<PARA> That your petitioners are gravely concerned that the Federal Government of Australia discriminates against Croatian migrants in Australia the target of combined Yugoslav and Australian security operations with the express purpose of discrediting the movement for Croatian independence and statehood, and that in so doing it is aiding and abetting the Yugoslav regime in the sentencing and imprisonment of Croatian intellectuals, students and priests and ordinary people in the thousands, the imprisonment of more than two thousand Albanians as a result of the uprising in Kosovo at the beginning of this year and the murder by Yugoslav Secret Police of more than 70 Croats in Western Europe in the past few years.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate urge the Government that diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia be called into question and discontinued as a sign of protest, and that Australia ask the United Nations General Assembly to supervise a referendum whereby the constituent nations of the so-called Federation of Yugoslavia might vote on the question of secession.</PARA>

<PARA> concern over Plant Variety Rights (PVR) legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> We agree that:</PARA>

<PARA> (5) The proprietary rights granted by PVR will encourage the introduction of seed distribution and marketing monopolies and lead to seed price increases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that Senator Chipp raises is a very important one indeed.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I repeat that the Commonwealth has responsibility. We will leave it to the nitpicking lawyers to find some joy in that. I thought this was a serious question which required a serious answer. I did not except to find the normal nitpicking on the sidelines. The fact is that the Commonwealth Government has been concerned for a very considerable time at what might be the extent of organised crime in Australia which might exceed State boundaries and which might have Commonwealth implications. The Commonwealth Government has taken steps therefore, such as the establishment of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the establishment of the various task forces with the State. Indeed, a number of royal commissions have been established throughout Australia at both Commonwealth and State levels. Some of those royal commissions , both Commonwealth and State, had drug implications such as the Moffat, the Woodward and the Williams royal commissions. The Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union is showing wide interstate and even international implications. The Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking has also had these implications and implications of Nugan Hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Only yesterday, in the painters and dockers inquiry, evidence was given that a person described as a crime figure in New South Wales, Mr Abe Saffron, had links through Ward, Knight and Dunn Pty Ltd in what were called Slutzkin-type activities. There is some evidence that there may be a link between Saffron and Nugan Hand. If that is so then one has some worries because, in the Allen affair , links were shown between the previous deputy-commissioner and Mr Saffron. So a pattern of circumstances emerge which could suggest that there is a network of activities of crime in Australia. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Government has invited the State Government to provide it initially with the transcript of evidence and the findings of the inquiry. The Allen inquiry by a police tribunal was a very narrow inquiry which, as Senator Chipp remarked, originated from information provided by the Commonwealth to the State. Other suggestions have been made arising out of that inquiry. For example, Sergeant Molloy had indicated subsequently that he had been offered a bribe of the order of $42,000. Quite clearly a number of implications need to be pursued.</PARA>

When it studies it, and looks at the overall scene, it will look to how the Commonwealth for the future should comport itself to tackle the obvious Commonwealth responsibilities that exceed State boundaries and may have international implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is extremely worrying that evidence is emerging of what is now called the ' laundering' of very large sums of money from criminal activities. That laundering can come from gambling, drugs, prostitution and all sorts of activities. It is now emerging that crime in Australia is of a magnitude which was perhaps not realised before. It is a sad reflection that we have needed something in the order of half a dozen royal commissions in Australia in recent times in their own episodic ways to start putting together a pattern which suggests that there have been very serious criminal activities and, indeed, evidence of some police corruption. I say that choosing my words because I do not want to reflect upon the police forces at all. Where some evidence of individual police corruption emerges, one worries about how effective a police force can be in its general functions in this regard. The Commonwealth is treating this matter with great seriousness. It will study the matter and will look towards any future steps that might be necessary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen Press reports that a motion was adopted by the meeting of the National Aboriginal Conference last week on that matter as well as on a number of other matters. But I have not yet been informed of the content of the motion. I think Senator Kilgariff is correct to ask what implications that would have and to ask for some comments on it. The fact is that on Aboriginal land-certainly Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory-it is not possible for mining to proceed or for exploration to proceed without the consent of Aboriginal owners. There is no intention that that situation should change. It is scarcely necessary that the NAC should call for a moratorium on what is already Aboriginal land. The capacity to introduce such a moratorium is in the hands of the traditional owners and through the traditional owners in the hands of the appropriate land council which represents them in negotiations. The administration of mining and exploration matters in respect of land other than Aboriginal land is the responsibility of the various State governments and the Territory Government. The Commonwealth has always urged the States to consider the need to take account of the legitimate interests of Aboriginal people and communities in any arrangements which are made and to take into account the rights of any Aboriginals who would be affected by exploration activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make the observation that recently some guidelines have been produced by two bodies-the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association Ltd and the Australian Mining Industry Council-as a first offer. These have been distributed for comment by Aboriginal groups. They have been considered recently by the Aboriginal affairs Ministers. I understand that they are under consideration by Ministers who are responsible for mining. I know that my colleague Mr Anthony will be discussing these guidelines with other Ministers. If these guidelines can be developed and can be agreed upon between Aboriginal and mining interests they should represent a very major step forward and should help us to achieve agreed and negotiated positions whenever mining or exploration is planned which will affect Aboriginal communities or Aboriginal land.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some sleight of hand is involved in examining this question of cuts in welfare expenditure. Various figures are used on various occasions to produce effects. I can only say, without wishing to increase the confusion in this area, that the total expenditure of the Commonwealth Government through the Department of Social Security increased this year by somewhere between 14 per cent and 15 per cent. I think the figure is much closer to 15 per cent. When one looks at the rate of inflation one can see that clearly that is an increase in real terms. It remains true, however, that there are significantly increased numbers of beneficiaries, that not all benefits are indexed and that therefore, with respect to some areas of benefit, there has been an effective real reduction. But the substantial portion of benefits paid through the Department of Social Security is indexed and is adjusted twice a year to take into account changes in the cost of living.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot confirm or deny whether the figure of 14.5 per cent cited, apparently, by Father Mogg, in a Press release which I have not seen as the decline relative to the proportion of average weekly earnings of specific beneficiaries is correct. But I can remind the Senate that, at the request of Senator Colston, some figures were incorporated in Hansard some weeks ago which showed the age pension as a proportion of average weekly earnings and which showed the figure as it had run from about the mid-1970's. The figures showed that there was a period in which the percentage of average weekly earnings increased. Over the last couple of years it has declined. The explanation of that is quite simple.</PARA>
<PARA> Pensions and benefits are in the main indexed against changes in the cost of living. In other words, they are adjusted as the cost of living changes. On the other hand, average weekly earnings are, of course, a function of the rate at which average wages are increasing. When average wages increase faster than the cost of living clearly pensions and benefits which are indexed to the cost of living will be a declining proportion of average weekly earnings. The reverse is true when average weekly earnings are rising slower than the cost of living. So it is true that over the last couple of years, as average weekly earnings have increased faster than the cost of living-in other words, wage and salary earners have been taking home real increases in their pay-the percentage of a number of benefits has declined as a percentage of average weekly earnings. I do not challenge the figure of 14.5 per cent. It is not a figure that I can simply confirm or deny.</PARA>
<PARA> Family allowances were instituted in 1976. They have not been adjusted, except in the last Budget when payments for children in families of three or more children were increased 50 per cent. That means that in real terms there has been a decline in the value of family allowances since 1976. What action will be taken in the Budget is, of course, a matter for Budget and Cabinet consideration . I would certainly put aside, however, any suggestion that cuts in taxes will be financed by cuts in welfare. I suggest to the Senate that history indicates that there is likely to be a continuing high and increasing requirement for welfare benefits in this country. Ten years ago we had one million people on income support. Today we have two million people on income support. Naturally that has changed very considerably the demands which are made upon the Australian Budget by the welfare sector. I do not see any change in that. At the same time, it is quite clear that the Government could not meet many of the requests made upon it for greatly increased assistance, if there is to be any hope of maintaining even a reasonable consistency of taxation, let alone reductions in taxation. I point to the single demand which many honourable senators have made in this chamber in the presentation of petitions that we increase pensions and benefits to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings. That has been costed by my Department at something like $2.7 billion a quarter, a real increase in the welfare expenditure of the Goverment. This is not the time to make a general statement. I am trying to respond to a question of considerable ambit put to me by the honourable senator. If he wants a more detailed reply he can let me know and I will get any further facts and figures he seeks.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware that Mr Hayden is reported to have told a civic reception in Port Augusta that countries wanting Australian uranium will buy only on condition that the waste is buried in Australia? Can the Minister say whether this is in fact a condition placed upon overseas countries by the Government? Did the Minister note that Mr Hayden commented that the Australian Labor Party is not opposed to uranium mining provided safeguards could be guaranteed? Does the Minister agree that this apparent change of view, along with the views of the Australian Workers Union, will assist in the development of the Olympic Dam project which will be of tremendous economic significance to South Australia and will contribute significantly to Australia's export income?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ordinarily my attention would not be drawn to such a newspaper, as Senator Chipp perhaps suggested. But the fact that it purported to report a statement by the Leader of the Federal Opposition and several statements that would be regarded as controversial resulted in the fact that I happen to have a copy of that article. So the first answer is that my attention has been drawn to the article. Assuming that the report is correct, the article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the conditions being laid down by countries which wanted our uranium was that the waste must be buried in Australia and it was this which was one of the main worries.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not; I make it perfectly clear that I have no way of knowing whether it is. That is why I refer to a purported statement. If it is such a statement, then it is incorrect. Secondly, I refer to a matter which is strictly under my portfolio, that is, the newspaper report that countries wishing to purchase our uranium were demanding that the waste products be buried in Australia. I say emphatically that that is nonsense. There is no truth in that report at all. If a country buys uranium from Australia, it is true that the Australian Safeguards Office and the International Atomic Energy Agency track the quantity of the radioactive material through all its stages, but the final disposal of the waste is up to the country concerned with, of course, the auditing being a responsibility for Australia. It would be utterly wrong to suggest that Australia is to be the burying ground for wastes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true also that the article stated that Mr Hayden emphasised that Labor is not opposed to uranium mining provided the safeguards could be guaranteed, and indicated that that may be so. If that is a correct report it is heartening because the development of Olympic Dam-indeed, the development of Roxby Downs-is a significant undertaking for all Australians. The development of uranium mining to provide essential electric power generation material to people overseas is of great importance. The people of South Australia would welcome a bipartisan approach to the development of an important mineral and employment creating opportunity in their State.</PARA>

I ask: In view of their strategic and economic importance to Australia, is the Minister satisfied that adequate measures have been and are being taken to protect these off-shore oil rigs against collision or other damage?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three types of incidents are of main interest in protecting the platforms in Bass Strait. They are the damage that occurs by the elements, that is, weather; the damage that could occur by accident or misadventure; and the damage that could occur by terrorism or, at the least, vandalism. Because of the risks to life and also to the supply of fuel to this country, very considerable steps have been taken. The first is that over the last year or so a great deal of strengthening of the platforms has taken place. Although the legs are pinned down through the centre 250 feet, I think, into the seabed-unlike the floating rigs on the North Sea-nevertheless, extra protection has been provided to make them stand up to what is called the 100-year wave- something of some dimensions. Secondly, a great deal of worry has occurred about the danger of collision by vessels-particularly larger vessels-in Bass Strait. Under international law a vessel is prohibited only from going within 500 metres of such an installation. Honourable senators will realise that a large vessel under way, or losing its steerage way, would find itself unable to dodge within 500 metres. So, steps have been taken through my Department and through the Government to get an international agreement that there be at least five miles clearance by sea-going vessels--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis is right. Even five miles allows only a reasonable safety margin for a very big ore carrier or container vessel. We hope that that requirement will be put fully in position soon. It is being largely observed now. I stress 'largely observed' because there were some breaches. There were two reported breaches recently. Neither case put at risk the platforms. It may well be that, had the visibility and the weather been different, there may have been some degree of risk. Both those incidents are being pursued. I have indicated to my own Department and, through it, to the Department of Transport-I know my colleague the Transport Minister holds the same view-that we should take the sternest view of any breaches by vessels. There is also now a prohibited area for smaller vessels under 200 tonnes so that there is an area around the platform that is to be free of all vessels. That, of course, has some difficulties because it is a fishing area. Radar and other surveillance equipment has been fitted. As to terrorism, the honourable senator will appreciate that I will not go into details in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

As Senator Georges may know, or ought to know, there has been regular Royal Australian Air Force surveillance over the rigs. Because we cannot, Senator Georges? Senator Georges must also know that, tragically, a young life was lost the other day because Special Air Service personnel were undergoing training to save those rigs from terrorism, not because we cannot but because we have taken steps to safeguard these rigs. I will not go into the details of the surveillance schemes, including naval vessels and other surveillance schemes. Suffice to say that the various defence services and intelligence services, as well as the civil police, have been consulted, and surveillance and defensive methods have been set up which the Government believes would be effective weapons in the case of aggression. One has to say that one would hope that that would not be so. It is the height of stupidity for someone to ask me to state what are the preventive methods. Anybody who knows these matters knows that it invites the unintelligent in this community to test them, and that is a provocation on its own.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been some comments by the coal producers that the levy has reduced the profitability of their enterprise. But there is no suggestion that it has reduced the output. The output of steaming coal has increased perceptibly. Its limitations at this moment are not so much the profitability as the ability to get the coal through the ports, particularly in New South Wales. As honourable senators know, there is, in fact, a quota system on ships, particularly in New South Wales at this moment, so that what is now known as 'Wran's navy' is standing off-shore. Ships are quotarised to come in- shore as the availability to load occurs. This, of course, is costing an enormous amount-something in the order of $1.5m and $2m a day in demurrage costs alone. It is costing an enormous amount in the loss of export income. But whilst there has been some slowing down in the world demand for steaming coal, there will be projected a steady increase in that demand in the years ahead. Australia has great opportunities provided that it has the capacity through its ports to export that coal. One hopes that these bottlenecks which are now, perhaps, one of our most serious export limitations will be removed in quick time.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it normal practice for an Australian electoral officer to give advice of such a partisan political nature to political organisations? Finally, is Mr Frank Coleman the same officer who was involved in what has been described as the 'Withers affair'?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</PARA>
<PARA> This paper deals with the United States research and development program in laser isotope separation technology for plutonium and suggestions that civil plutonium might be used for nuclear weapons. The paper demonstrates how the provisions of the Australia/United States Agreement on the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy signed on 5 July 1979 protect Australia's interest in ensuring that any nuclear material we supply to the United States under the Agreement is not diverted to military or explosive purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>A. BACKGROUND</PARA>
<PARA>Official references in the United States: 2. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for both peaceful uses of nuclear energy and production of nuclear material for defence purposes. On 4 March 1981, in testimony in closed session before the Procurement and Military Nuclear Systems Sub-Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Armed Services, Dr F. Charles Gilbert, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Materials, U.S. Department of Energy, revealed that the United States had a research and development program for laser isotope separation of plutonium to remove isotopes higher than plutonium-239 from reactor-grade plutonium so that weapon-grade plutonium could be produced. This testimony did not become available in the United States until about July 1981, when an edited transcript was released. The testimony was given in support of a general 1982 fiscal year Budget request for continuation of the existing U.S. special isotope separation research and development program at the level of the 1981 fiscal year. The matter became the subject of press attention in August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. A hearing by the Oversight and Investigations Sub-Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs was held on 1 October 1981, to consider public comments about the possible use of spent reactor fuel as a source of weapons-grade plutonium. Dr Thomas B. Cochran ( Natural Resources Defence Council, Inc) made a statement at the hearing. He testified that he was a member of the Energy Research Advisory Board of the U.S. Department of Energy and his statement included the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> 'On September 3, 1981, the Secretary of Energy endorsed the use of commercial spent fuel as a source of plutonium for the weapons program in a speech before the DOE Energy Research Advisory Board. Secretary Edwards stated that such a move would provide the plutonium needed for both the weapons program and the breeder reactor program. He also claimed that it would solve the nuclear industry's waste disposal problem.'</PARA>
<PARA> Congressman Edward J. Markey, the Chairman of the Sub-Committee, corroborated at this hearing Dr Cochran's remarks about the suggestion made by Dr Edwards:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Energy Secretary James Edwards suggested on September 3, 1981, to the Energy Research Advisory Board that we could solve our alleged plutonium shortfall for bombs, as well as our growing nuclear waste disposal problem, in one fell swoop. What Secretary Edwards meant was that we could take nuclear spent fuel from commercial power plants and chemically reprocess that nuclear waste to separate out the uranium and plutonium. Then, late in the 1980s, we can utilise a new laser isotope separation technology-now in R &amp; D study at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory-to upgrade reactor-grade plutonium to weapons-grade plutonium. By DOE alchemy, nuclear waste would supply plutonium for the weapons program'. Mr Markey also stated: 'If the DOE is permitted by Congress and the American people to take the crucial step of mining nuclear spent fuel for bombs, we will reforge overnight the links between civil and military nuclear activities that U.S. policy has laboured hard to sever for the past 20 years . . . I believe that so perilous a policy will be decisively repudiated by Congress. It will meet a bipartisan buzzsaw of opposition on Capitol Hill.'</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Since the press reports of August 1981, United States officials have stated publicly that no decision has been taken on this matter and that the idea floated by Secretary Edwards is only one of a number of possibilities under consideration as a solution to a potential shortfall later this decade of plutonium for the U.S. nuclear weapons program. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. At a press briefing on 8 October 1981, the following exchange took place with the U.S. Secretary of Energy, Dr Edwards, after he had made some remarks about reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to obtain plutonium for breeder reactors:</PARA>
<PARA> Q. Do you anticipate using any of that plutonium in the nuclear weapons program ?</PARA>
<PARA> SECRETARY EDWARDS: Not at this stage, no. </PARA>
<PARA> Q. When do you expect to make that decision?</PARA>
<PARA> SECRETARY EDWARDS: That would be a decision that would have to be debated extensively and would have to be decided at a higher level than even the Secretary of Energy. </PARA>
<PARA> Q. How are you inclined on that question?</PARA>
<PARA> SECRETARY EDWARDS: I have no inclination at this stage. I haven't studied it enough. </PARA>
<PARA> Q. You said it's a very good idea, Mr Secretary. You're all for it, it sounds like. </PARA>
<PARA> SECRETARY EDWARDS: I didn't say it was a very good idea, I think . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Q. You said it's the best way to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> SECRETARY EDWARDS: It is a way to proceed, I think it . . . I'm not sure of the verbage (sic), but it is a good way to proceed. There's no question about that. </PARA>
<PARA> You have to upgrade the plutonium, of course. The plutonium you get out of reprocessing spent fuel rods is a poor quality plutonium. You'd have to upgrade it and the technologies for that aren't very well developed yet, so it's a long way off.'</PARA>
<PARA> 6. At a hearing on 19 November 1981, before the Sub-Committee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and Government Processes of the U.S. Senate Government Affairs Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr James Malone (Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs) stated in relation to the possibility of use of commercial spent power reactor fuel in nuclear weapons that the United States ''Administration has made no decision on the feasibility or desirability of using plutonium from such fuel for military purposes; nor are any recommendations for decision pending before us.''</PARA>
<PARA> Dr F. Charles Gilbert (Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Materials, Defence Programs, U.S. Department of Energy) stated, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> 'At this time, plutonium isotope separation technology has not been demonstrated on a practical scale.'</PARA>
<PARA> 'In summary, I want to emphasise that we are evaluating many possible options for nuclear materials productions to assure that the needs of the United States, both in the governmental and industrial sectors, are considered in the most cost beneficial ways within an appropriate schedule. Any options, which might be recommended by the Department of Energy in the future would be considered at the highest governmental levels before being forwarded to Congress by the Administration. Such determinations would consider domestic institutional issues , foreign policy implications, including appropriate provisions of applicable international agreements and our non-proliferation objectives, as well as technical, cost and schedule factors.'</PARA>
<PARA> 'No decision has been proposed to utilise the plutonium from commercial reactor fuels in nuclear weapons.'</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The New York Times of 28 February 1982, quoted Dr Gilbert as saying that the U.S. Administration 'would not require' and 'has no intention of using' fuel from commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S. nuclear weapons program. It also reported that Dr Gilbert said that the Department of Energy 'was exploring the acceleration of a program designed to use lasers to separate plutonium from nuclear fuel. But he stressed that this controversial technique, if accelerated, would not be used to separate plutonium from commercial reactor fuel, only from military supplies.'</PARA>
<PARA> 8. There has been a number of legislative proposals in the United States Congress designed to prohibit the U.S. Department of Energy from obtaining plutonium for nuclear weapons purposes from spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power reactors. An example is Bill S.1812, introduced on 4 November 1981 , by Senator Percy, which was intended to prevent the transfer of irradiated fuel and special nuclear material from any reactor licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for use in a nuclear explosive device unless the President makes certain determinations and the Congress acts favourably to approve such action. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. In the Congressional testimony of 19 November 1981, referred to in paragraph 6 above, Dr Gilbert of the U.S. Department of Energy said in relation to S.1812:</PARA>
<PARA> 'We believe this bill would, in effect, unilaterally constrain future U.S. defence options. For this and other reasons . . . we consider its enactment inadvisable.'</PARA>
<PARA> 10. In summary, laser isotope separation technology for plutonium is understood to be still in the early stages of development in the United States. It is understood that the United States Government has made no decision to make nuclear weapons with plutonium obtained from civilian power plants nor is any recommendation to do so at present before it. </PARA>
<PARA>B. AUSTRALIAN ATTITUDE</PARA>
<PARA> 11. The Government has been closely following this matter since the edited transcript of the Congressional testimony of March 1981 referred to in paragraph 2 became publicly available. A copy of the Congressional transcript was secured and studied in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. On 28 October 1981, the Australian Embassy in Washington, on instructions, discussed the issues raised in the transcript with the United States authorities . The Embassy referred to the importance of maintaining a clear distinction between the peaceful and military uses of nuclear energy in the interests of upholding the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. It also drew the attention of US officials to the fact that all uranium supplied to the United States by Australia under the Agreement between Australia and the United States of America Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, signed on 5 July 1979, is subject to a peaceful, non-explosive use pledge. The Embassy also informed the United States authorities of the Australian Government's concern about any possibility of plutonium separated from spent nuclear fuel from civil nuclear power stations being used for nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. On 18 February 1982, the Minister for Foreign Affairs provided answers to House of Representatives Questions No. 3672 ('Use of Civil Plutonium for Nuclear Weapons') and No. 3674 ('Laser Isotope Separation of Plutonium')-see House of Representatives Hansard, 18 February 1982, page 411. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also answered two further questions of relevance: House of Representatives Question No. 4030 ('Australia/United States Nuclear Safeguards Agreement') and Senate Question No. 1853 ('Nuclear Safeguards Policy'). </PARA>
<PARA> 14. These replies indicated that:</PARA>
<PARA> the United States Government had made no decision to use for military purposes plutonium obtained from civilian power plants;</PARA>
<PARA> the Australian Government understands from official United States testimony that plutonium isotope separation technology has not been demonstrated on a practical scale in the United States;</PARA>
<PARA> the Australian Government considered that it is important to maintain a clear distinction between the peaceful and military use of nuclear energy;</PARA>
<PARA> in October 1981, the Australian Government had expressed to the United States Administration its concern about any possibility of civil plutonium being used for nuclear weapons; and</PARA>
<PARA> the Australian Government would not be prepared to approve such use of plutonium derived from Australian uranium, as all uranium supplied to the United States under the agreement of 5 July 1979, is subject to a peaceful, non- explosive use pledge. </PARA>
<PARA>C. 'NATIONAL TIMES' ARTICLE OF10-16 JANUARY 1982</PARA>
<PARA> 15. This section addresses the article with particular reference to points raised by Senators Chipp and Mason in the Senate on 18 February 1982, during the debate on tabling of a paper by the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia entitled 'Pre-Feasibility Study for the Establishment of a Uranium Enrichment Industry in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> 16. Senator Chipp referred to the article in the National Times of 10-16 January 1982. Senator Chipp said 'that the uranium that Australia is selling to the United States now has been reported as being used in the nuclear weapons program of the United States.'</PARA>
<PARA> 17. In his statement of 24 May 1977, on the Government's nuclear safeguards policy, the Prime Minister said that Australia wanted assurance from nuclear- weapon States that nuclear material Australia may supply to them for peaceful purposes is not diverted to military or explosive purposes and that IAEA safeguards will be applied to the nuclear material. The Australia/US nuclear safeguards agreement of 5 July 1979, incorporates the basic undertaking-common to all Australia's nuclear safeguards agreements-that Australian uranium supplied for peaceful purposes will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes. The agreement provides that Australian-origin nuclear material cannot be reprocessed without Australian prior consent or transferred from the United States without Australia's prior consent. Furthermore, it provides for the application of IAEA safeguards to all Australian-origin nuclear material in the United States, and for an effective mechanism for verifying these commitments through the accounting of all Australian-origin nuclear material in the United States. The text of the agreement was presented in the Parliament on 23 August 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. It is therefore not correct to say, as the article does:</PARA>
<PARA> 'But if the Reagan Administration goes ahead with its proposal, a key element of Australia's safeguards agreement with the US on nuclear energy would be nullified because the by-products of Australian uranium could be used to produce weapons-grade plutonium without Australia being informed.'</PARA>
<PARA> 19. The United States is bound by its bilateral agreement with Australia to the peaceful, non-explosive use of nuclear material subject to it. The United States would also need Australia's prior consent before spent nuclear fuel subject to the agreement could be reprocessed. Because of the substantial resources expended on its production, the only logical use of significant amounts of weapons-grade plutonium (that is, plutonium consisting of about 94% or greater of the isotope plutonium-239) made by laser isotope separation of plutonium separated from nuclear power reactor fuel is the military one of construction of nuclear explosive devices. By contrast, reactor-grade plutonium (in which plutonium-239 is contaminated by higher plutonium isotopes) can be used directly for peaceful purposes in energy production without the need for isotope separation, whether by lasers or otherwise. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated on 18 February 1982 in reply to a question on notice, that the Australian Government would not be prepared to approve the extraction of plutonium from Australian-origin nuclear material on behalf of the United States Government for use in United States nuclear weapons (House of Representatives Hansard, 18 February 1982, p. 411). </PARA>
<PARA> 20. Senator Chipp quoted the following sentence from the National Times article :</PARA>
<PARA> 'A move by the Reagan Administration to make nuclear weapons with plutonium from civilian power plants threatens to seriously embarrass the Fraser Government over its uranium export policy.'</PARA>
<PARA> The terms of the nuclear safeguards agreement between Australia and the United States as explained above demonstrate that this statement is without foundation.</PARA>
<PARA> 21. Senator Chipp said that the gist of what worried him in the article was the section saying:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The idea that plutonium from commercial nuclear reactors should be used in nuclear warheads comes from the US Energy Secretary, James Edwards. In a speech late last year to a research board of the Department of Energy in Washington he proposed that spent nuclear fuel from nuclear reactors be reprocessed and the plutonium extracted and used for both nuclear weapons and the proposed new fast- breeder reactors. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The Edwards proposal came soon after disclosures that research on the use of lasers to enrich uranium was also being directed towards extracting bomb-quality plutonium from waste in commercial reactors. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The revelations have sparked a furore in the US. One Democratic Senator, Gary Hart, who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, wrote to Edwards warning:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The very consideration of such a plan undermines the historic basic assumptions of the Atoms for Peace program: that a clear distinction exists between the military and commercial applications of nuclear technology.'</PARA>
<PARA> 22. The possibility of use for nuclear weapons of plutonium produced in civil nuclear reactors has given rise to spirited opposition in the United States. Some of the Congressional opposition has been referred to in paragraphs 3 and 8 above. The New York Times commented in part in an editorial on 30 September 1981 :</PARA>
<PARA> 'Most of all, there is no good reason to use civilian reactor waste as the raw material. Even if there is a shortage ahead of weapons-grade plutonium-and that' s not certain-it could be solved faster by taking military reactors out of mothballs, or building a new one. More expensive, perhaps: but that is an issue of dollars, not defence.'</PARA>
<PARA> 23. As is clear from the background given in paragraphs 2-10 above, no decision has been made by the United States Administration to use for military purposes plutonium produced in civil nuclear power stations, nor is any recommendation for decision pending before it. The Australian Government understands from official United States testimony that plutonium isotope separation technology has not been demonstrated on a practical scale. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Coates asked me a question about delays with respect to appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against decisions taken by the Director-General of the Department of Social Security or his delegates. I gave a partial answer yesterday and said that I would seek additional information. I am now in a position to provide some additional information. To the end of February there have been 813 appeals lodged with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in social security jurisdiction. Of these, 70 were decided in a period from 1 April 1980 to 26 February 1982; 55 were beyond the jurisdiction of the AAT; 54 were withdrawn by applicants; 78 were conceded by the Department of Social Security, which leaves 568 unresolved at the end of February. Of that 568, approximately 270 at 16 April 1982 are cases in which documents have yet to be provided by the Department of Social Security to the Tribunal. This means that approximately 300 cases are currently with the Tribunal, together with all social security documents. Some would be part-heard, others not yet heard or listed. We do not have a breakdown of those figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I indicated yesterday that there were delays and that there had been difficulties in obtaining staff of the required qualifications. However, it is apparent that while our delay in providing statements to the Tribunal may contribute to an overall delay in the Tribunal process, it is only a contributory cause. There are also some resource difficulties within the AAT itself. The sheer practicality of speedily determining difficult cases, which often involves the calling of many medical witnesses, is also very significant in causing delay. During the latter part of 1980, when AAT social security jurisdiction was potentially about 120 to 150 cases per annum the Department had eight staff assigned in that area. In September 1980 jurisdiction was expanded to present levels and new positions had to be created and filled. We now have approximately 23 officers engaged full time on Tribunal work. Further proposals are being developed for submission to the Public Service Board. This additional staff which is now available means that our time delays in providing material to the Tribunal have been reduced but we are still in excess of the statutory time scale in some cases. Part of that delay, again, has been caused because there have been some difficulties for the Tribunal in giving the Department the notice which it is required to give when an appeal is lodged. The Tribunal, for its part, is taking action to try to reduce those delays which have given rise to some bunching of notices being received by the Department as well as notices being received rather late and hence increasing the length of time between receipt by the Department and the ultimate response by the Department.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unless real gross domestic product-that is, the volume, the heap of goods and services in total-rises by around 4 per cent each year unemployment will rise. That statement is a truism. It is a truism because, firstly, the population of working age-that is, between 15 and 65-increases by around 2 per cent each year and will continue to do so into the mid-1980s; and secondly, because productivity-that is the amount produced for any given unit of working time-also increases by around 2 per cent each year. Therefore, unless growth rises by 4 per cent the number of unemployed must increase. In only one of the last six years of the Fraser Government has growth reached that 4 per cent minimum level-I am talking here of calendar years. I will be making comparisons later with other Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development countries. That level was reached in 1976 when the economy was still under the influence of the 1975 Hayden Budget which was a Budget of economic recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given those facts it is inevitable that recorded unemployment will increase as it has done from 4.8 per cent to 6.2 per cent in 1981. Real unemployment, that is, recorded and unrecorded, is now of course, much higher than 6.2 per cent. I will explain the reasons for the discrepancy at a later stage if I have time. The response of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to the empirical record of his failure in government-most recently expressed in his 14 March electorate broadcast-is an amalgam of bluster and falsification of history. I quote from that broadcast. The Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> That our policies were right, that the right policies and attitudes can enable us to succeed against world trends, is convincingly demonstrated by Australia's economic performance in recent years. For we have had economic growth at twice the average of other major industrialised countries in recent years . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That assertion is false. The more precise assertion contained in the OECD economic survey of Australia released in January 1982 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1978, real GDP has increased at more than twice the average rate for the OECD area as a whole . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That statement is also false, a fact grudingly conceded by the Secretary to the Treasury, John Stone, in his 1 April letter to me. Mr Stone's letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . my very quick examination of the facts suggests that there is substance in your opinion as to its inaccuracy . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In conceding the falsity of the OECD claim the Secretary to the Treasury implicitly repudiated the Prime Minister's less precise regurgitation of that claim in his 14 March electorate broadcast. It raises many questions, one of which I will now put. If the Australian Labor Party, with the limited resources of Opposition, can detect errors in the January publication about Australia which are subsequently acknowledged by the OECD, why does the Prime Minister, with all the resources and expertise of the Treasury and other departments of government, regurgitate a false assertion nearly two months after it is published?</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1976 Australia has not, as the Goebbels clones of this Government assert ad nauseam, had a good economic record relative to other comparable countries. Australia's record from 1974 to 1976 inclusive, relative to the rest of the OECD countries, was good. Since 1976 real growth-that is, real increase in gross domestic product-relative to the rest of the OECD countries has been poor. Compared with individual countries in the OECD, such as Japan, Austria, West Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and others, not only has it been poor but also it has been miserable, especially when considered in association with the relative unemployment rates of Australia and those other countries. At this stage, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which I have prepared from OECD publications showing the real increase in gross domestic product and the unemployment rate in Australia, the OECD as a whole and certain OECD countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That table shows that, relative to the OECD countries as a whole and, in particular, to a few individual OECD countries, Australia's record of real economic growth and of unemployment has been poor to miserable. Its record of real growth per capita-a slightly different concept which is to some degree normally related to the level of unemployment-is even worse but that is not shown in the table. From the Cabinet and from the Prime Minister in particular we have had newspeak ad nauseam. From that table we get the empirical facts. The stated intention of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) a fortnight ago to come clean with the Australian people about the state of the economy is certainly a worthy intention. As a first step towards that commendable objective, I suggest that the Prime Minister should desist from mouthing the type of newspeak he mouthed on 14 March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The corollary of our miserable level of economic growth is rising unemployment and/or a relative decline in real incomes. Both of these things have happened in Australia. The magnitude of our fall from affluence was shown in some detail in the National Times of 11 April to 17 April. That newspaper published a table showing relative changes in the per capita income of Australia and 13 other rich countries. By 1979-the last year shown in that table-Australia had fallen to fourth last in that group of 14 countries. Since then Japan's real per capita income has passed Australia's and we are now third last. Only the United Kingdom and Italy, of those 13 other relatively weathy industrialised countries, have lower real per capita incomes than does Australia. Compare that with the prime ministerial assertions of six weeks ago that our policies are right, our policies are working and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if we do not value the higher real incomes which come from higher real economic growth-I add as an aside that such sentiments are expressed normally by the already affluent and particularly by the already affluent in the non-market sector of the economy where their incomes are protected regardless of whether we can sustain economic growth, at least in the short term-surely nobody, surely not even this Government, actually wants higher unemployment. Unless we can achieve that 4 per cent growth rate unemployment will go up. It is technically feasible to argue to the contrary; that is, that a growth rate of less than 4 per cent or even no growth rate at all will not result in higher unemployment if the same amount of work is spread over more people, which inevitably entails lower real incomes for those who are employed. But that will not happen, so that can be disregarded. </PARA>
<PARA> What can be done? The common denominator in those countries which have had throughout the late 1960s and right up to the latest available statistics a satisfactory record of growth, unemployment and, I might add, low inflation- countries such as Japan, West Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Norway-is an effective prices and incomes policy regardless of whether it is called that. This Government, of course, is opposed to prices and incomes policies on purely doctrinal grounds. Some call its policy mon- grelised monetarism. It probably would be more accurate to describe it as Fraser's eccentricity and political cynicism along with assorted Country Party villanies superimposed on a foundation of stone age economics. The Prime Minister says in other context-even in this context he once said this-that the runs are on the board. In this instance the runs are clearly not on the board. We are steadily sliding down the batting average, to continue the Prime Minister's analogy. We are third last of a group of 14 wealthy industrialised countries and we are still slipping down. We have been passed by Japan. If present trends continue, we are about to be passed by a number of other South East Asian countries. Surely with that sort of record anyone must ask whether the batting techniques should be changed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the captain should be dropped, and he will be. Even if the Fraser Government was not doctrinally opposed to prices and incomes policies , it probably could not succeed in implementing a prices and incomes policy because, by the nature of our Constitution, Federal governments have little coercive power in this respect. A social concensus has to be achieved and for that a government must have moral authority. This Government does not have and cannot have moral authority, for a multiplicity of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, there are its own origins. There has been a string of broken promises. The Prime Minister promised growth at the rate of 5 per cent to 7 per cent a year. The highest he has achieved in any year is 4.6 per cent and the average since 1976 is 2.1 per cent. He promised to maintain Medibank. He promised to introduce tax indexation. He promised lower taxes. He promised ministerial propriety. Instead of that he has given us 20 resignations, sackings or induced removals, nearly all of them under a cloud of impropriety. He continues to give us such senior Ministers as Mr Lynch and Mr Sinclair and a Deputy Prime Minister who continues to squat on a 4 3/4 per cent housing loan secured from public funds, while everyone else in the community pays 15 per cent or thereabouts. The Prime Minister's wife and her relatives, apparently in defiance of the law of Victoria, secured a $50,000 loan at 4 1/2 per cent four years ago. Presumably, that loan has not been repaid. This Government has a record of treachery without parallel in Australian history or possibly in the history of any twentieth century democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has neither the will to do what must be done nor the moral authority to succeed even if it had the will. If acceptable rates of growth and acceptable rates of unemployment are to be reattained, this Government must go, and it will go. High economic growth, which I repeat is a pre-requisite for the restoration of full employment, can be sustained in authoritarian countries, as Professor Gruen pointed out a couple of weeks ago. It can also be sustained-and it has been sustained-in industrialised democracies, in countries such as the Netherlands, Japan, Austria and West Germany. In those countries, through the latter half of the 1970s and the early part of the 1980s, that has actually been achieved. Surely there are lessons for Australia to learn from that empirical fact. A not exhaustive list of those lessons includes the necessity to maintain aggregate demand at full employment levels and the necessity to achieve a social consensus. In present conditions, full employment demands entail a danger of fuelling higher and rising inflation. A prices and incomes policy will contain inflation. It has contained inflation in other countries which have maintained full employment levels of aggregate demand. </PARA>
<PARA> A social consensus is a prerequisite for a prices and incomes policy. It is also an aid to growth-an end in itself. A social consensus cannot be achieved unless a government has moral authority. I do not pretend that it will be easy to achieve a social consensus or the prices and incomes policy which could flow from it and which, in turn, could at least restore the rates of economic growth which Australia experienced in the 1960s and the rates of economic growth which are esential if real income is to continue to rise at the levels desired by most Australians and if unemployment is to be reduced to a level which is acceptable to most Australians. The pre-requisite to that happier state of affairs being achieved is the removal from office of a dogma-bound government which has no remaining credibility and can never gain any moral authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are indebted to Senator Walsh and the Opposition for proposing for discussion today this matter of public importance so that we can put on record and make perfectly clear what have been the outstanding successes of this Government since it came to office in 1975. Senator Lajovic will address himself to the problems relating to the industrial scene, and, on a later occasion, Senator Hamer will be discussing the huge potential for investment in this country and the opportunities that abound for us if we are prepared to grasp that potential. I wish to deal with some of the points made a few minutes ago by Senator Walsh and to demonstrate some of the great weaknesses not only in his arguments, but also in those of the Australian Labor Party, which seeks to represent the people in the national Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the first point which Senator Walsh made, that is, that the so- called 4 per cent rate of growth-which seems to have some magic attached to it- is the level which will deliver us from all kinds of evil in terms of unemployment. He claims that that is some mere truism. He has not told us in the terms of the matter of public importance that he proposed in his letter to the President whether he was speaking of growth in domestic product, job growth or of any other kind of growth. I listened very carefully to his speech to try to determine what in fact he was referring to. I take it from the general run of his argument that he was speaking of monetary growth and, consequently, of a 4 per cent growth in real terms in the money supply. That, of course, is substantially greater than the Government has seen fit to aim for in the past few years as it has been trying to contain the pressures in this economy which cause inflation. He well knows that that growth rate has been maintained by purposeful control by this Government at a level of approximately one per cent in real terms in order to bear down on inflation, which is the utter curse of this economy and the source of difficulty which led Senator Walsh's Government into economic disgrace when it was in power between 1972 and 1975. I will return to that question a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perfectly clear from all the information that is available that in the last three years of this Government the number of jobs that have been created in this economy has risen by more than 300,000. During that period we have seen the maintenance of a generally flat level of unemployment with an inclination for that level to decline. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last three years. Senator Walsh is interested in the figures. In the year ended 1978-79, the level of unemployment was of the order of 6.3 per cent whereas the given figure for the year ending 1980-81 was 5.8 per cent. That represents a decline of some one half of one per cent. One might not make too much out of that point, but it certainly flies in the face of the argument which Senator Walsh seeks to make, namely, that unemployment has not been addressed by the kinds of policies employed by this Government over the last five years. If we look a little further at the rates of growth in gross domestic product in this country compared with those in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development-certainly Senator Walsh made a great deal of this-we find that in the last three years Australia's rate of growth has ranged between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent, being 2.5 per cent in 1980. This compares with a growth rate in the United States over a period of 10 years of 3 per cent. In 1980 there was an actual negative growth rate of 0.2 per cent. In 1981, the latest year, for which we have figures, there was an indicative rate in that country of 1.75 per cent. That compares with the figure of 3 per cent applying in the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>

I acknowledge that that figure is again an estimate but when we compare it with the 3 per cent growth rate that has occurred in the Australian economy in the 1981 financial year, can we assume that the kind of argument which Senator Walsh seeks to put forward has any validity whatsoever? We could continue with that kind of analysis in detail. I cite the example of France which elected a socialist government half-way through 1981. In 1980 France had a moderate growth rate of 1.2 per cent, but in the last year in which, apparently, stimulative socialist policies were employed by the new Mitterrand Government in Paris, there was a growth rate of a mere 0.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> There are good reasons for remaining composed, quietly spoken, and steady of eye. </PARA>
<PARA>I claim that that particular viewpoint is the solid one, the one which we in this nation should be proposing at this time. We should not be listening to the kind of claptrap that emanates from the Labor Party which seeks mere political advancement of its policies to the detriment of the Australian people. It plays on the fears of people who are uninformed generally about the general trend of events not only in this country but also in the world scene. Consequently, it misleads people by its continued reiteration of these kinds of arguments. </PARA>
<PARA> The elements of the Australian economy about which we have been speaking are not the only ones with which we should concern ourselves. I have demonstrated in the last few minutes that the rate of growth in our gross domestic product has been very comparable with those of overseas nations-quite the opposite to the kind of argument which has been put forward by Senator Walsh. I come to the major thrust of what he has been saying. I take it that he was talking about-he has not contradicted me-a growth rate in the money supply in real terms of 4 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having received that correction, I take it that Senator Walsh was envisaging a money supply growth rate that was prepared to encompass that kind of growth in this economy. If that is so, it is a policy which has not been implemented by this Government in the last few years. I reiterate that the rate of money supply growth in this country has been controlled at a rate of approximately one per cent in real terms over the last few years. But let us assume that this Labor Opposition were to achieve government and seek to apply the kinds of policies that would lead to a money supply blow out along the lines that it has talked about. What would be the consequences? The evidence is before us. I hesitate to say it again, but it has to be said time and again. There are messages in that period of Labor Government between 1972 and 1975 which show the effects on the economy of the policies which the Opposition seeks to employ. We saw during that period money growth rates outstripping enormously the potential of the economy to meet the demands placed upon it. As a result inflation went through the roof. The difficulty that we have at this time--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wage rises had something to do with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will come to that in a moment because it is the main point that I seek to make. Due to wage rises and the unfortunate wage demands that are being imposed upon the economy by the trade union movement, the rate of inflation is higher at the moment that that which is applying in the economies of some of our major trading parteners. Current rates of inflation appear to be 7.7 per cent in the United States, 5.9 per cent in West Germany and 3.1 per cent in Japan. Our inflation rate currently appears to be around 11 per cent. That is not withstanding the very good result for the March quarter which was announced only the other day. I do not wish to lay too much emphaisis on a short term figure such as that; rather I will take the broader view. Our economy is inflating more greatly than the economies of our trading partners. That represents the major danger to our economy at this time. Inflation is growing whereas the inflation rates of our trading partners are declining. We see fewer opportunities for trade, less potential for our export development and, consequently, less opportunity to develop new jobs in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is fundamental to an understanding of the economic situation that we face at the moment. Without appreciating that and without, applying the right policies now, we see rocky roads ahead in terms of the rate of inflation and the dangers that has for job creation, which is what this Government's policy is all about. Job destruction will occur with the kinds of policies proposed by the Labor Party because it fails to understand the fundamental considerations relating to inflation, and the effect upon this economy of overseas transactions , and the need for us to take account of overseas cost pressures and the demands that that imposes upon us in so many ways. It leads to more imports flowing into this country and the displacement of workers as a result. It leads to lower exports. Other countries find it easier to sell into our markets because we have a higher cost structure than they have. Those things are fundamental. They are the issues that we have to address and which this Government, by its policies as demonstrated in recent times, continues to address. Those are the things which will lead to the creation of more jobs and the kind of growth rate that Senator Walsh envisages, whether it be some magical, pulled-out-of-the-air figure like 4 per cent or a more realistic figure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an airy fairy figure, as the honourable senator knows. It takes no account of such things as the growth in productivity, developments in the economy in other directions and the growth that might transpire by investment in the economy. Certainly my colleague Senator Hamer will be dealing with a few of those points at a later time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the point that the fundamental issue which we face is that of containing our cost pressures in this economy. They stem very largely from the manner in which we are able to keep our labour costs under control. In recent times we have seen developments in the wage settlement arena which do unnerve us substantially. There has been substantial growth of costs in the building trade, in the metal trades and in public service areas, relating not only to wages and direct remuneration of that kind but also to shorter working hours, as have been negotiated in the metal trades award and in the building trades. These things are important to recognise. Not only could they lead, of course, to greater leisure time for Australians-and in that sense they have their virtue-but also we have to recognise that they must be paid for out of the pockets of the consumers and wage earners who are not getting those benefits and who have to pay the prices in the supermarkets-if we like, the transport costs, the price of gas and power and everything else that they need to consume. This is what the Australian Labor Party fails to understand. Indeed, if we review the history of its three years in government between 1972 and 1975 we can see examples of that quite clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the period ahead, this Government remains confident in the basic future of Australia. We know of our huge resources in this country. We know of the need to develop those resources. We know how to do it. The ALP has never been able to demonstrate that it knows how to do it. In fact, that is the very point of this debate. Indeed, the Labor Party has come forward with some airy-fairy figure of 4 per cent which has no relation to anybody else or anything else and which appears to have been thought up as some kind of figment of the imagination of Senator Walsh who has not properly explained whether he speaks of money supply growth, of gross domestic product growth, of job growth or of any other growth. The fact is that it is a vague matter of abolutely no interest to the Senate; nor should it be seriously listened to by the public as meaning anything in particular. It typifies the kind of loose thinking that occurs on the other side of this Senate chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side stand for the development of Australia. We know that it is possible. We know how to do it. We need to ensure lower rates of inflation. We need to ensure that the population of this country is suitably motivated by adequate remuneration but not by disproportionate remuneration which leads to the kinds of inflationary pressures which will destroy our job markets by destroying the markets for our products overseas, particularly those natural resource products which are, of course, turned into consumer products in such countries as Korea and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> I make just one other point because it reinforces my argument. It is something which Senator Walsh mentioned at the close of his speech. He recalled that Japan and South East Asian countries are in fact passing Australia in terms of growth rate. He did not define the kind of growth rate. I assume he means gross domestic product. In that event, that only serves to demonstrate the very point I am making, that those countries, with lower costs and lower inflation, are in fact doing better than countries which have lesser concerns about those matters. It only serves to make the point that Australia, if it continues to grow-and it will grow-must have regard to those fundamental concerns in the economy. This Government is dedicated to that proposition. </PARA>

<PARA> The need to achieve and sustain annual growth rates of 4 per cent or above in order to reduce unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>I needed to do that because it would have been quite inconceivable for anyone listening to the debate to have understood that we were debating such an important topic. It was a mixture of listening to fairy tales from Grimm and observing a performance of Puck in Lindsay Kemp's Dream. It is not hard to understand why the Minister is the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and not a Minister charged with an economic portfolio. Time and again Senator Walsh mentioned in his speech what he was talking about in terms of growth. Time and again he related Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development statistics. Time and again the Minister refused to understand what Senator Walsh was talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister tells us that the situation is not all that bad, that there has been job creation in Australia over the last three years and that we are now much better off than we were three years ago. The facts show that now unemployment stands at 6.3 per cent. At the start of 1978 it stood at 6 per cent . That the Minister understands that this is in some way better than it was three years ago, I find hard to believe. He tells us that in terms of growth we are performing much better than OECD countries. But if one looks at the record of the last six years one finds that whereas OECD countries have experienced a growth rate of 3 per cent per annum, we in Australia have experienced a rate of 2.7 per cent. He tells us that this year the expected growth rate will be 3 per cent. Whose figure is that? Is it from the same source that some time ago told us that the estimated growth figure would be 5.75 per cent? Was it, in fact, the OECD? Was it the Treasury once again feeding into the OECD? It is these sorts of statistics about which this Minister has not told us. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that Australia now finds itself with a government which is stagnating both economically and morally. In six years we have had a government blindly pursuing economic theories and strategies which have been proven to have failed throughout the world. They have failed here, they have failed in the United Kingdom and they have failed in the United States of America. In the United Kingdom Thatcherism now stands in tatters. In the United States the third rate cowboy now stands economically exposed by his own strategists. Even they have admitted defeat. Yet in Australia we have a continuation of the performance we saw this afternoon. We have Government spokesmen time and again adhering to the blind philosophy of Fraserism, of the supply side economists. The Government not only does not recognise the deficiencies of its policies, but also is not competent enough to understand them. It has been advocating contractionary monetary policies for seven years. We, as Australians, have experienced the results of these policies. At the end of this period we have little to show for the pursuit of those policies except the following: World-wide we have 30 million people unemployed as a consequence of similar policies and inflation rates are still rampant. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Australian position. What have such policies produced here? As I said, unemployment has increased to over 437,000. As a direct consequence of the Government's open-door policy, interest rates now stand at the highest level in the world. We have the highest real interest rates in the world, and they are rising. Taxation, as it affects wage and salary earners, has more than doubled under this Government and prices are rising at a faster rate this year than they have in any of the last seven years. The anticipated inflation rate is higher than that anticipated in the last Labor Budget. We have a government incompetent enough to assert to us only eight months ago that it had the deficit under control and that there would be a surplus. Eight months later we have a deficit overblown by $1,000m. Not only can the Government not understand the problem, but also it is incompetent in handling it. </PARA>
<PARA> The real situation has been expressed not only by Opposition spokesmen but also by members of the Government. In terms of growth Sir William McMahon, a former Liberal Party Prime Minister, said in September 1981:</PARA>
<PARA> Non-farm growth slackened to a mere 1.6 per cent in the second half of the year of June 1981 and has shown no signs of recovery since then. </PARA>
<PARA>On 26 January 1982 Dr Peter Sheehan of the University of Melbourne said:</PARA>
<PARA> The economy is moving to recession with accelerating inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>W. D. Scott's journal Economic Advice to Business, once again in January 1982, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy is slowing down. </PARA>
<PARA>Maybe the Minister is an adherent of the policies of the Premier of South Australia who asserts that South Australia is not going too badly. He stated: South Australia is going backwards at a slower rate and, as a consequence, we are recovering. That is the type of philosophy and logic propounded by Government spokesmen. Under Fraserism, under the policy of cutting back essential Commonwealth Government expenditure, of reducing funds available to the States, of reducing funds available to public instrumentalities and of raising taxes, the economy is contracting. Fraser's monetarism masquerades public sector cutbacks as being economically responsible. Not only are they self -defeating, but also they are economically self-defeating. Tight credit policies increase the price of money and, as a consequence, increase prices generally. As a consequence of monetarism we have high interest rates and rising inflation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Thomas is welcome to inspect the notes if he likes. As I said, we have a Budget that was ill-conceived and a Budget that is not fulfilling what it promised to fulfil. Quite recently in the National Times there was an assessment of the Budget and how it has fared. We see that on the major indicators the Government has overblown its expectations. I mentioned the deficit earlier. The Budget expected a small rise in unemployment and so far this year we have had a rise of 50,000. The Budget anticipated an employment growth of two per cent. The signs are that we will have an employment growth of half that figure. The Budget anticipated consumer spending would increase by 2.3 per cent. Now we find that the real growth in consumer spending will be about two per cent. The record is clear. The Government produced a Budget which is ill -conceived and is not working, but yet again the Government is insistent upon pursuing the line espoused in that Budget. The Minister said today that things are not as bad as we in the Opposition say they are, but all the indicators, all the polls, all the expressions of public opinion are that the economy is going downhill and the Government is taking no action to redress the decline. Quite recently there was an article on the front page of the Australian-of all newspapers-referring to a report at the Melbourne University's Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research. It showed that consumer sentiment is now close to its lowest level in the past 10 years. The headline states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Survey reveals public confidence approaching lowest level in 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>The lowest March quarter expectation was recorded since the survey began 10 years ago. That is one sign of what is happening. We can turn to the report of the Confederation of Australian Industry-Bank of New South Wales survey, once again issued in March this year. The latest survey showed that excess capacity, because of lack of new orders, has increased and that business expects a downturn revision of capital spending on new buildings, plant and machinery over the next 12 months. The principle espoused by Senator Walsh is not hard to understand. What we need to have in this community and in this economy to meet the demands of a growing population is a real growth rate at least equal to or more than four per cent, which is not a figure that was settled upon but a figure that was put forward as the bare minimum. That is a concept that the Government refuses to acknowledge. Senator Messner, in reply to Senator Walsh, said he would handle one part of the argument and that Government senators would respond thereafter. He said that one senator would discuss the boom. Time and again Senator Messner returned to the boom as one answer to Australia's problems . But in doing so he obviously is totally out of step with the attitudes and expressions of his leaders, whether it be Mr Fraser or Mr Howard. Mr Howard, as late as November 1981, said that the so-called mining boom-a term which he tried to avoid using-was causing a problem in that the Government did not anticipate a mining boom at that stage. In saying that he discounted his own previous statements and the previous statements of government spokesmen such as Mr Anthony and Sir Phillip Lynch. Just before that, Federal Treasurer Mr Howard said that the expected resources boom would create tens of thousands of jobs. Mr Anthony is on record in 1980, 1981 and early 1982 as saying that the so-called resources boom is facing Australia. Senator Sir John Carrick, who may deny it now, is on record in April 1981 as discussing the prospective resources boom in Australia and so on. Spokesman after spokesman, especially before elections, were intent upon telling the Australian people that there would be a resources boom and economic recovery under the Liberal Government. Now we find that the boom has failed, is failing and is not proceeding at the rate at which the Government told the Australian people to expect. As a consequence we now find the Government not only without a wages policy but also without a total economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I must refer in closing in this respect to the situation in South Australia. We in South Australia have a Government which has invented its own so-called resources boom, a boom which overnight has become a whimper. The boom was placed around Roxby Downs, a project which is now seen to be more and more questionable economically and much more questionable environmentally. The South Australian Government fell over itself to oversee the project. The then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tonkin, said that Roxby Downs would create 20,000 jobs. After the election he told the South Australian public that it would create 50,000 jobs, directly or indirectly. The Minister of Industrial Affairs, Mr Brown, predicted that Roxby Downs would create 40,000 jobs. Mr Tonkin gave an estimate to the South Australian public that Roxby Downs would provide $100m per annum to the South Australian economy in the next decade. Yet we had the spectacle last week of the Deputy Premier of South Australia, Mr Goldsworthy, asserting that those figures were a misreporting by the Adelaide Advertiser and that the Government did not stick to them at all. We now have the spectacle of the job expectation assessment revised and devalued to 2,000 jobs instead of 20,000 and we now have an estimated income to the State economy of $10m instead of $100m per annum. The Deputy Premier contradicted not only his own Premier and Minister of Recreation and Sport, who is on record as saying that, but his own Goebbels, his own Press Secretary, who was doing the job for the Minister in overselling Roxby Downs at an earlier stage this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been told to expect, that Senator Lajovic will deal with the industrial situation and how it has affected growth within this economy. I have only two minutes left to deal with this aspect, of the problem. All I need to do is refer to a statement made by the Leader of the National Country Party, Mr Anthony, in Japan towards the end of last year. An article in the Age of 4 November 1981 states:</PARA>
<PARA> He told Japanese businessmen that 'the position in Australia is not as serious as the position in the US, Britain or a number of other large industrialised countries. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Australia's, problems are relatively minor when compared with the problems that exist in so many other resource-exporting countries around the world,' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made overseas by a senior Government Minister. Now the lackeys who will follow me in this debate will claim that industrial relations are the essential problem facing this community. Let us see who is competent to handle industrial relations matters. In closing, let me refer to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 14 August 1981 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Federal intervention has not led to the resolution of one dispute in the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the record of this Government. It shows that the Government is inadequate to handle the problems. </PARA>

I am surprised that he used that word. Anyone who has read George Orwell's books would know what he implied in using the word 'newspeak'. He implied the system run by the socialists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the matter of public importance with which we are dealing. It is about the need to achieve and sustain annual growth rates of 4 per cent or above in order to reduce unemployment. We have already asked the Opposition what annual growth rates it is referring to, but we have not yet had an answer to that question. Let us look at the definition of gross domestic product. Gross domestic product is the total market value of goods and services produced in a country within a given period after deduction of the total cost of goods and services. The problem with which we are faced is the cost of goods and services. Unless we can control the cost of our goods and services we will never be able to achieve a 4 per cent annual growth rate-a magic figure that exists only in the mind of Senator Walsh. Why not 3.8 per cent, 4.2 per cent or some other figure? Why has he suggested a growth rate of exactly 4 per cent? That just shows the fallacy of his argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh mentioned that Austria was one of the countries which had a far better growth in GDP than Australia. Every time the socialists get up they always take Austria as an example of a socialist country with a beautiful system . I have before me a table which shows that the real growth of GDP in Austria was 1 3/4 per cent while the rate for Australia was 3 1/4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the cost of goods and why we are having problems achieving a higher growth in real terms in gross domestic product. The headlines in today's Australian Financial Review state 'More big mining ventures are chopped back'. Anybody reading that article would find that the port of Newcastle in New South Wales has introduced quotas on the export of coal. That means that two major coal mining projects will be scaled down for up to two years. A whole list of projects in that area have been delayed and will be delayed because of the inability of the socialist Government in New South Wales to deal with the problems at the port of Newcastle. Development costing up to $1 billion for the whole of that area is now in danger. The key point is that the New South Wales Government, which always puts the blame for everything that it cannot do or everything that it bungles on to the Federal Government, has at no time asked for the inclusion of the third Newcastle coal loader in the Commonwealth's infrastructure borrowing program. The Federal Government has not contributed in any way to the delay in this project. But I am convinced that, in a few days, the Federal Government will be blamed for the inability to export the tremendous quantity of coal which is now stockpiling at Newcastle. Twenty or 30 ships are waiting in Newcastle at tremendous cost to the shippers-$1.5m to $2m a day in demurrage. </PARA>
<PARA> Another article in today's Australian Financial Review is headed 'Ships still disrupted by rolling tug stoppages'. At this stage the cost to shipping companies is estimated to be $1.2m. This strike commenced only on Tuesday of last week. No one would dispute the fact that our nation is unable to export sufficient quantities of minerals or wheat because of these disputes on the seaboard. Page 18 of today's Australian Financial Review, under the section ' Industrial briefs', reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Iron mines still idle. </PARA>
<PARA> A strike by 500 men is continuing to prevent work at two iron mines in Western Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>The next item in that column reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Rally against nuclear ship. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> All unions in the Brisbane metropolitan area are expected to participate in the strike. </PARA>
<PARA> The final news item in that column states:</PARA>
<PARA>North West Shelf impasse. </PARA>
<PARA> Unions on the North West Shelf gas project are still waiting for an Arbitration Commission decision . . . </PARA>
<PARA> About 900 workers walked off the project on April 1 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is the news. This is why the cost of our exports is prohibitive and why we are losing our export markets. Another article in today's Australian Financial Review states:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia 'losing European, Japanese coal markets'. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian coal exports have been virtually priced out of the European market and are losing their large competitive advantage in the Japanese market. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the facts. Let us look at the figures. Not one of the socialist senators opposite has referred to these figures. The number of working days lost , recorded in per thousand man days, for the United States of America in 1978 was 38,927 and in 1981 it was 24,668. In 1978, France recorded 2,187 man days lost and in 1981 1,495. In 1978, in the United Kingdom 9,404 working days lost and 4,195 were lost in 1981. Let us look at the Australian figures. The number of working days lost are recorded in per thousand man days. In 1978, 2,130 man days were lost and 4,165 were lost in 1981. That is almost double the 1978 figure. Australia is the only major exporting country in which the number of strike days lost has increased. What is the cost of that to the economy and to goods and services?</PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that we are having problems increasing our gross national product with claims for a 35-hour working week and a reduction in working times? Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd has reported that the fall in raw steel production was largely the consequence of industrial disputes. Port Kembla lost 117,000 tonnes of production and the Newcastle works lost 6,000 tonnes of production as a result of industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the cost of the power shortages in New South Wales? What was the amount of earnings lost by the workers? What was the reduction in profits? What was the resultant increase in prices? What was the cost to retail sales? Wran's navy is waiting and waiting outside Newcastle. Employment and unemployment were discussed. I wonder what would be an acceptable percentage of members of the work force out of work in today's world, particularly in Australia? The situation is certainly different from what it was 10 to 15 years ago. Even the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations in the other place mentioned somewhere that we will never again achieve the kind of level of employment that we have been used to. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the socialist idea of full employment? Is full employment when people are sent to concentration camps or slave labour camps, where they have to perform work which they do not want to perform? Is that the kind of full employment that they want? I wonder how many young people today in Australia who reckon that they are unemployed would prefer to be fully employed in a slave labour camp? The only way that Australia can continue to grow and to have a high standard of living is to continue to present policies of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The average annual rate of growth in Australian gross domestic product declined from 4.9 per cent, during the decade 1963-1964 to 1973-74 to only 2.3 per cent during the period 1973-74 to 1978-79. The rate of growth for the 1981 financial year was 2.9 per cent. So, in recent years we have seen a decline to virtually half of the growth rate of the boom days. It is true that this decline in the rate of growth of the Australian economy has been accompanied by an increase in the level of unemployment, reduced investment and profitability and higher levels of inflation. This has been a world trend. These facts can provide a convenient backdrop to this discussion but what might seem obvious conclusions ought not necessarily be drawn from them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats feel that the Australian Labor Party is attempting to present a rather mechanistic view, one which I think was criticised with some justice by Senator Messner in his comments. We cannot take a simple proposition such as this and present it as a palliative or panacea to even part of the problem of unemployment. However, most matters of public importance that we debate from time to time in this place on the subject of unemployment boil down to a series of pious platitudes about how bad employment is and how something ought to be done about it. I get heartily sick of these flows of words about unemployment and the lack of effective action about it. I suspect so do other honourable senators and I am absolutely convinced that members of the public certainly do. We appear to have a problem here which we are now being told in so many words that it is something we cannot do anything about but wring our hands. Of course that is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The topic of this matter of public importance today at least does take the matter to a slightly more definite stage. It is:</PARA>
<PARA> The need to achieve and sustain annual growth rates of 4 per cent or above in order to reduce unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>It surprises me, and it surprises the Australian Democrats, that such a naive proposition should be advanced on behalf of the Australian Labor Party by a man as knowledgable and intelligent as Senator Walsh. I wonder whether he seriously believes what he is putting forward. I think he should know that there is no way , on a global basis, that we can go on year after year increasing growth rates for the simple reason that the resources of the planet are finite and rapidly diminishing. Sooner or later this is a problem that will have to be faced and the sooner it is faced the more effective the attitude will be. If it is allowed simply to go on decade after decade we will reach a situation in which there is a planetary crisis of massive proportions. I think this is a matter which cannot be disputed although it is one which is frequently ignored. There is no way the rest of the world can share, even now, anything approaching the standard of living that we have in Australia, without a disastrously rapid running down of resources combined with an increase in pollution and environmental disturbance of ruinous proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought also that Senator Walsh had observed that an increase in the growth rate, however he measures that, by no means guarantees increased employment. Indeed there is abundant evidence that by automating and robotising industrial processes, which is happening all over the world and increasingly in this country now, we can certainly achieve productivity growth within those industries which we treat that way. However at the same time we will also cause major drops of employment or at the best marginal increases. I will give some examples of what I mean. A few years ago, the Philips organisation, then employing about 425,000 people world-wide, estimated that, even with a 3 per cent real increase in turnover, it would still become 56 per cent over manned. In 1972, 9,051 people-nearly 10,000-were on the manufacturing staff at Hitachi's colour television plants. In 1976, this figure had been reduced to 4,299, less than half the earlier figure. The ironical thing, of course, is that during that time productivity was raised by 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Volkswagen designs its own robots for spot welding and panel handling. It also sells the robots to other manufacturing industries. The robots can be reprogrammed. Three robots can replace 10 men, I am advised, on a two shift system. VW produces twice British Leyland's declared target with 80 per cent of British Leyland's labour force. Australia's largest insurance company, the AMP Society, introduced its first computer in 1959 and has since introduced new technology rapidly. The company's administrative staff increased by only 2.17 per cent. During the same period the number of policies handled increased by 50 per cent and the company's annual premium income grew by 300 per cent. So I think we have some lessons in explicit terms which illustrate that merely to take the simplistic view that by increasing productivity we will solve or even help unemployment is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no need for us to be neo-Luddites, to take the view of the Luddite movement that the only way to answer these things is to smash all the machines. Of course, that was ridiculous at the time and it would be ridiculous now. The problem has to be coped with in other ways because it is good that boring and repetitive work should be done by machines rather than by human beings. It is something we have to accept as an advance in the conditions of life of human beings rather than the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed and the Australian Democrats are disappointed at what would appear to be the view of the Australian Labor Party if this topic is at all representative of its thinking. At best, to promote the proposition to the Australian people that an annual growth rate in productivity of 4 per cent or more will automatically solve or help to solve the unemployment problem, is, I think, nor worthy of a great political party that is offering itself to the electorate as a government. Here again I agree with Senator Messner who touched on this point. He said that there could be tremendous trouble in the economy, perhaps masive inflation, if we attempt to adopt this as a serious policy. If the Labor Party became the government and seriously said that it would insist and somehow devise, if it could, every year, a growth in productivity of 4 per cent or better, I suggest it would create problems worse than we have now. I think it ought to be axiomatic that under present conditions of the world economy and, indeed, the Australian economy, growth in productivity is a difficult enough proposition even it it were possible. Any sort of attempt to say merely that we can get this sort of growth in productivity through some magical means is whistling in the dark. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be difficult enough to promote expansion in existing industries and areas of effort. That, of course, is the key to the whole point. If there is a situation in which there are large numbers of unemployed schoolteachers or doctors or technicians, it is rather silly to try to promote employment in those areas. We have to look for new areas. This should mean that the Government ought to be looking at something new-not only one new thing but also a number of new departures, not to be introduced quickly over a year or two, but to be introduced over time as a result of proper examination and planning. Yet, at the same time, as I said earlier, any political movement which will not recognise that we should, even now, be planning for an economy that this planet can sustain is less than responsible. This is a constraint that we all must accept. The Australian Democrats do accept it. We do not pretend, by any means, to have the answers to the total problem. I do not think anybody has. All we are saying is that we should, certainly as a nation, be addressing our minds to it as a matter of urgency with an eye to future planning direction so that we know what we are going to do as this revolution in automation and robotism overwhelms us, as indeed it will do unless we do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> One basic point is, I think, again that if there is overcrowding in most occupations then the only way to increase employment is to look at other things and to try to develop useful areas that are not fully exploited at present. We can gain some lessons in this, wisely, from overseas countries where the trend has been to look at labour-intensive areas of employment, particularly in the energy field. I mentioned in the Senate some years ago, but it is perhaps worth mentioning again now, the Californian experience with what is called Solarcal which is a commission or instrumentality which is designed to do two things: To encourage, in every possible way, the development of solar energy in the State of California in the United States; and, recognising the fact that the manufacture and installation of solar devices is labour-intensive, to increase employment. In the number of years that that program has been going it has been enormously successful. In some places in California now it is illegal to build a new house without putting proper solar installations into it. Also, of course, there is an enormously large program of tax concessions, which I think is the key point because this is the way it is being done. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment the cost of a solar heater is so great that the average young family in Australia will say that it cannot justify the interest on that money in the savings that it will get in electric power. While that situation continues, of course, we will not have these installations in sufficient numbers in Australia. Of course, they have a very important bearing on our energy requirements into the future. They are conservational. That is, or should be, a national intention. In California and in a number of other American States, the subsidy on State and Federal income tax is 55 per cent of the cost of that installation. If that subsidy is not obtained in one year it is obtained in a successive year. It is a direct rebate from one's income tax. This is found to be economical for a number of reasons. One is that it is cheaper to have people provide these installations than to build enormously expensive new thermal or hydro-electric power plants-conservation is the answer. Another is that by employing people-there has been an enormous increase in employment in California because of this-the tax concessions that are given are repaid by the new employment, by the fact that the people who are newly employed are paying tax and that they are not being paid the dole. Documents would be available to this Government from the Californian Energy Commission which would prove this beyond doubt. I have copies of them if the Government wants them. That Commission has done its homework and it knows this works. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask and the Australian Democrats ask: Why are we not doing something like that here? There are other areas of the same type. As I mentioned before, we should be looking at fuel cropping. Fuel cropping can be justified as being uneconomic now in terms of the cost of petrol. But it has a certain strategic importance and a certain development importance. It is a new agricultural crop. It would encourage our regional centres. It would provide something which would bolster us against the unmitigated disaster that could be brought to this country if a few shots were fired today or tomorrow in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh. That would be all that would be needed. Within weeks this country would be in sore need of liquid fuel. Our present difficulties would be gravely compounded. And, of course, as our supplies of Bass Strait crude run down over the next 10 years, as we know they will, that risk becomes greater and greater. We could be then engaging people in employment in that respect. We should be doing that sort of thing instead of spending money on useless, expensive military hardware like the billion dollar aircraft carrier Invincible which we are now told will be useless if it does not have further extremely expensive aircraft on it. I tend to agree with that. It would be of limited use even with those aircraft. But without them, of course, it has no practical uses whatsoever other than to fly a flag and to have parties on the quarterdeck. I suspect that is its fundamental purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be spending money on major and forward-looking development projects. I respect Sir Mark Oliphant for his grand concept of a pipeline that might bring North West Shelf gas across to the eastern States. Plants to make fuel ethanol from natural gas could be established. There is a five-year lead time. If we had done it five years ago we would have had it on stream this year. These things are possible with established technology. I spoke to a gifted friend of mine today. He mentioned a canal from Port Augusta to Lake Eyre. When one looks at the topography of that area it is a smaller project than many that have been successfully completed elsewhere in the world. I do not say these things should be done; I say they should be explored. A government with vision and forward- looking initiative would be looking boldly and with courage towards development projects that would make this a better country. We should give our priority to spending in that area. By adopting these new areas of work we will provide employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering a matter of public importance raised by Senator Walsh, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need to achieve and sustain annual growth rates of 4 per cent or above in order to reduce unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased that Senator Walsh has raised this issue. The importance of economic growth has been a central part of the policy of the Liberal Party for many years. In fact, for 20 years before 1972 we managed to achieve a balance of low unemployment, low inflation and reasonable growth probably better than any other country. As we all know, and to our intense regret, all that was thrown away in the three years of the Whitlam Government. Economic growth is essential to the achievement of any government's social and other objectives. There is a great deal of evidence that in a democracy the so-called zero sum economy-the no -growth society-is unworkable. In such a society if one wishes to give something to a particular group one has to take it away from another. That group normally resists and resists successfully. The result of that is endemic inflation. If we want to achieve social objectives in a democracy, in my view it is essential that there should be a growing economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted to see the Australian Labor Party converts-admittedly very late converts-to the necessity for economic growth. In the past they would have been anything but that. They would have been influenced by trendy pressure groups of various types and would have appeared to be aiming for a no growth economy. I hope Senator Walsh represents the true opinion of the Labor Party. I must say that I doubt it. The question we must face is not whether growth is desirable; nearly all of us here believe that it is. What we have to look at is how to achieve that. The first thing we must do is control inflation. Senator Messner dealt with that at some length. I will not repeat what he said. Without control of inflation we will not have sustained growth in the economy. Secondly, we must aim for long term growth. This has been one of the successes of this Government. We have laid the foundation for long term growth. It is not good enough to have short term spurts in economic growth. It must be sustained if we are to achieve our objectives in all areas of political activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Our approach has been successful. In general, growth-that is non-farm gross domestic product-has accelerated. The growth was 0.8 per cent in 1977-78. It rose to over 2 1/2 per cent in the two following years and to 4 per cent last year. Regrettably-this is the cause of great concern-it has fallen back to 2 1/2 per cent this year, but it is still better than most other countries with similar economies to ours. Because of that growth in GDP in our economy, the rate of unemployment fell throughout 1980 and 1981. The reason that decline has not continued this year is that the growth in the economy resulted in increased wage demands and acceleration in the growth of average weekly earnings. Average weekly earnings rose by 7.2 per cent in 1978-79; 9.4 per cent the next year; 12. 5 per cent in 1980-81 and this year they are expected to rise by 13 1/2 per cent . This means that we are experiencing a sharp acceleration in labour costs at a time when these costs are decelerating in overseas countries-our main competitors. We are thereby losing competitiveness in a world where growth is generally very subdued and where competition is, therefore, very intense. We must tackle this problem of excess wage demands. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh advanced the idea-this does not originate from him-of a social contract on wages. Two points must be made about that. Firstly, no such contract is possible unless there is a broad social consensus throughout the community to make that policy work. Secondly, it is peculiarly difficult in this country because the Federal Government has no power over wages, no power to set a wage structure. Therefore, this type of consensus is particularly important if we wish to have an effective and agreed system of wage fixation. The trouble has been that nearly all the activities of the Labor Party have attempted to destroy this consensus, encouraging people to be selfish, to go it alone and grab what they can while they can. The whole approach has been the very opposite of consensus and it is the most nauseating hypocrisy for members of the Labor Party in the Senate to advocate a social consensus in this direction. We welcome their assistance here and now to achieve such a consensus. If they really believe what they say, that is what they should do. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give an example of the sort of activity which has gone on and which has been encouraged by the Opposition. In the United States of America and Great Britain the motor car industry is under considerable threat and pressure. In both those countries-Britain might surprise some people-the management and unions have managed to get together to show restraint in claims for improved wages and conditions. What happened here in the motor car industry when it was under similar pressure? The unions immediately negotiated a shorter working week -down to 38 hours-for the same pay and then looked to the Government to protect their members' jobs. We have to develop this social consensus, but the Labor Party must stop destroying the atmosphere in which such a social consensus is possible. The remark of a former Labor Treasurer, Mr Crean, has been quoted many times in this place. It is worth quoting again because it is a fundamental truth . He said that one man's pay rise costs another man his job. Over recent years the unions have spent the benefits of the resources boom before we have even got it. Even if the resources boom had taken off in the way one hoped it would, it is still five or 10 years down the track before we start getting the benefits. The unions are spending the benefits now in the form of increased and unjustifiable wage demands. Because they are doing this they are creating unemployment. The great social problem in this country is that union managements on the whole do not give a damn about the unemployed. If they can get more for their members, the fact that they are going to be unemployed as a consequence of their action's does not seem to concern them at all. This is not the case with all union leaders, but too many of them take that attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us come back to the problem of what we must do to achieve growth. If we are going to have economic growth, we must have more investment, because it is from investment that economic growth comes. Where does investment come from? The great proportion of it comes from profits. If the Labor Party is serious about encouraging economic growth it should be encouraging profits and not discouraging, criticising and ridiculing profits. From profits comes investment and from investment comes increased economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area where investment for economic growth comes from is from savings and overseas investment. In the area of overseas investment, members of the Labor Party take the most negative attitude-criticising, denigrating and opposing it. If they really believe the thrust of the matter of public importance brought forward today by Senator Walsh, they should be encouraging it . I do not believe they do believe it. Even if we do have investment-just investment is enough-it must be directed in the areas which will be most productive for the Australian economy. There is no doubt at all that the market- place-what people want-is the right place to decide investment. Government intervention is nearly always harmful. Can one imagine a more interventionist government than the previous Labor government or what would happen if Labor were ever trusted with power again? We must look to ways to reduce government intervention in investment. The key area in this is a reduction in protection. Protection is a means by which governments direct investment into particular areas. I think we can see from the record that this has not been a very successful intervention. The Government's White Paper on the Manufacturing Industry of 1977 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There is now a growing recognition in Australia of the adverse effects on economic growth that can result from pressing import-substitution beyond levels justified in changing economic circumstances. An important adverse consequence of pursuing import-substitution is that it can result in the foregoing of opportunities for specialisation in areas in which Australia has the greatest advantages. Tariff reductions to induce changes in industry structure and encourage greater specialisation in industry therefore have a role to play in the process of encouraging a more efficient manufacturing industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>All those remarks are true. When we attempt, as we are doing, to reduce protection on a predictable basis years ahead-to reduce protection slowly and predictably-the Labor Party is most strident in its opposition. The most outspoken troglodyte in the protection area is undoubtedly the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the other place, Mr Lionel Bowen. If members of the Labor Party are serious about their attempts to improve productivity, which is the thrust of this motion, they should be in favour of rationalising our protection system. They are not. They oppose every change in it, arguing, for instance, that any change at all, as far as I can gather, would create unemployment. This is complete nonsense. If we reduce protection we might reduce, and probably would reduce, employment in the particular industry concerned. But the increased spending of the community would create other demands and other employment. If anything, the evidence shows that a reduction in protection would increase employment. It most certainly would not reduce it. Yet, that is the sort of simple-minded argument that is always trotted out by the Labor Party every time there is any suggestion that there should be an organised, sustained, predictable reduction in the protection of industries in which we are not internationally very competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also-this is where I take issue with Senator Mason-look to the tertiary sector as the place where new employment is being created. When we make a more efficient manufacturing industry, whether it is to produce steam engines as in the early years of the nineteenth century or robots now, we do not destroy employment overall. We just take away inefficiently done manual activities, make them more efficient and create a great deal of new employment in new areas. There, too, the Labor Party, if it were serious in its desire for increased growth, could help. The problem in the tertiary industry is that it is marred with a web of restrictive practices, restrictive wage scales, triple pay for work on public holidays and so on. One cannot easily increase on any economic basis employment in the tertiary sector because the people in it are protecting their own interests and are not interested in creating new jobs for others. That is an area, too, where the Labor Party could help us if it were serious in trying to increase growth. I hope, therefore, that in all this the Labor Party will help and reinforce what we are doing. I hope that members of the Labor Party will help us to hold down inflation; that they will help us to increase business profits and, therefore, investment; that they will help us to try to hold down excessive wage demands; and that they will help us towards a simplified and less interventionist system of protection. If they are sincere about their objective of increased growth they will help us in all these things. But I doubt that they will. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the time for the presentation of the report from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations on the Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1982 be extended by providing that the Committee report to the Senate on or before Wednesday, 19 May 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving that motion I read a statement made on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations in explanation of the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> On 25 March 1982 the Senate referred the following Bill to the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for report, namely, the Honey ( Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1982. On 15 April 1982 the Committee held a public hearing in relation to the Bill. At that hearing the Committee received evidence from the Department of Primary Industry, the Australian Honey Board and members of the industry. The issue involved in the reference of this Bill to the Finance and Government Operations Committee concerned the rate of charge for the inspection of honey prior to export by the holders of export licences issued by the Australian Honey Board. The decision to apply the charge arose from a decision by the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee in April 1981 that 50 per cent of inspection costs be recovered. Submissions received by the Committee did not question the principle of cost recovery, but rather the level at which it was set. It was pointed out that the rate of $6.75 per tonne which was proposed in the second reading speech was very much higher in relation to honey inspection than that for butter at $2.50 per tonne or margarine at $1 per tonne.</PARA>
<PARA> The submissions also mentioned the effect a charge levied at the rate of $6.75 per tonne would have on the industry. The Federal Council of Australian Apiarists Associations made the point in its submission that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the proposed charge comes at a time when industry viability is under severe assault in the market place, and would represent a further erosion of viability. Producer returns from the export market place, although there is a firming trend, are still at or below costs of production. </PARA>
<PARA>The amount to be recovered in a full year may be only $50,000. However, the submissions received by the Committee indicate that this is considered an extra burden which this small and troubled industry cannot afford. Further, the industry, in its submissions to the Committee, questioned the efficiency of the inspection service provided by the Department of Primary Industry. Specifically the submissions referred to the relatively short time involved in collecting samples compared with the high costs involved due to the charge being on a per tonne basis. As I stated earlier, the industry was not absolutely opposed to the charge, just to the level of the charge. Indeed, several of the submissions suggested alternative methods of recovering costs of inspecting honey for export . </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee wishes to seek an extension of time to report in relation to this Bill. Although the Bill was referred to the Committee on 25 March 1982, it was not possible to obtain a submission from the Department of Primary Industry in relation to the issues raised by the honey industry until the afternoon prior to the public hearing on 15 April 1982. This alone made it extremely difficult for the Committee to obtain at the hearing the necessary information upon which to form an opinion. Further, the Committee was unable to obtain a Hansard transcript of the hearing which took place on 15 April 1982 until yesterday afternoon, principally due to the Estimates committees extending the resources available to Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further reason for the Committee proposing an extension of time to report on the Bill. Several submissions to the Committee actually questioned the need for the inspection service as at present provided. The point made was that certificates issued as a result of inspection were not utilised by honey exporters, nor were they required by the largest percentage of their customers. Alternatives have been discussed and some expressed the view that in any event the competitive world market was a more effective regulator. The Committee is currently seeking more information in regard to this issue. As Commonwealth taxpayers will be paying 50 per cent of the inspection charges levied under the Bill-the Bill provides for the levy to raise the other 50 per cent-the question of the necessity for the inspections becomes critical. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was also informed that the Australian Honey Board proposes the implementation of a stabilisation scheme. The Committee wishes to follow up on this proposal the potential cost to the industry and the taxpayer of maintaining the scheme. This is particularly important considering the problems the industry foresees in meeting the proposed charges under this Bill. As part of the Committee's inquiries into the level of the charge contained in the Bill and the industry's ability to meet that charge the Committee intends to take into account the cost to the industry of the Australian Honey Board. The Committee proposes to seek the information I have mentioned and to report back to the Senate on or before 19 May 1982. Accordingly, I seek the Senate's approval to extend the Committee's reporting time to that date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1966. We do not oppose the Bill but we will be moving a second reading amendment to express our concern and our hostility at the Government's insistence on making wheelchairs dutiable as part of the package of proposals in this Bill. That is a matter to which I will return. There are four main groups of amendments in the Bill. The first is the enactment of a variety of tariff changes which were introduced into the House of Representatives on 14 May last year by Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 6 to 15 (1981) and Proposals Nos 1 to 5 ( 1982). There are 16 broad categories of goods with respect to each of which a report of the Industries Assistance Commission in fact preceded the tariff change. As is the norm with legislation of this kind, this Bill, which runs to 107 pages and incorporates 13 hefty Schedules, is all but incomprehensible to anyone except the most ferocious enthusiast in this area. I will not pretend to endeavour to summarise its impact in all the various areas that are affected by it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second thing the Bill does is make certain amendments to the tariff preference rates for certain goods from developing countries. Thirdly, it makes additions to the list of goods accorded special preference under the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement. Finally, it makes provision for the addition of electric soil heating apparatus to the list of goods agreed to under the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The general approach of the Opposition is, as I have indicated, not to oppose this Bill because the Opposition believes its provisions are all aimed at quite desirable objectives; in particular, the maintenance of employment in a wide variety of manufacturing industries in Australia and also the encouragement of freer trade with our close neighbours-the countries of the South Pacific Forum, including New Zealand. The Bill provides an opportunity for an explanation of this Government's and this Opposition's approach to industry protection policy and to industry policy in general. These matters, however, have been canvassed at some length and with customary lucidity by my colleague, Mr Hurford, in the other place. I refer anyone interested in yet another exposition of what we are about in this area to look at his speech in the House of Representatives on 17 March, the terms of which in this respect I shall not repeat. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I think two specific matters do justify some reference on my part, the latter of which will be the subject of the foreshadowed second reading amendment . The first specific matter I refer to, following the point I made at the outset about the complexity of this Bill, is the IAC report on customs tariff simplification which was dated 30 November 1981 but which made its appearance in this Parliament-being tabled-only yesterday. The report arose out of a reference to the IAC by the late Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Moore-I hasten to add that he is late in his capacity as a Minister. The main purpose of the reference was for the IAC to inquire into and report upon, firstly, what changes can be made in the Customs tariff to enable the numbers of subdivisions in each item and the number of different rates of duty to be reduced without substantially affecting the assistance afforded to Australian industry and, secondly, what changes could be made to improve the precision and clarity of this schedule of tariffs; in particular, so far as the description and specification of subdivisions of the items in the Customs tariff were concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> The report of the IAC on this reference runs to two volumes the second of which , in the finest Customs tariff tradition, is a quite mammoth volume of God knows how many pages. The pages are not numbered, but the volume runs to 99 chapters which will undoubtedly serve as a useful doorstop for those who are not especially concerned with its detailed content. Rather than obviously taking up the time of the Senate by reading even the recommendations of the Commission in this respect, I think it would be appropriate to seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the page and a half summary of those recommendations as a useful basis for further discussion. </PARA>
<PARA>Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>1. Summary</PARA>
<PARA> This inquiry differed from most other Commission inquiries in that it covered the whole Tariff, and therefore all importable goods, but did not involve a review of assistance levels. In fact, the reference specifically excluded proposals that would substantially affect assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff Act is an extremely fragmented and complex document comprising 5 schedules, divided into 16 operative and 3 inoperative parts, together with covering provisions. In the main schedule alone, there are some 2, 500 classifications and, over all schedules, about 700 different duty rates. In addition, various sections of the Act vary, or allow the Minister to vary, scheduled duty rates. Even as interpreted and partly consolidated in what is known as the ''working'' or Annotated Tariff, its application to imports is difficult and costly for both government and industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's objective in this inquiry was to formulate proposals that would simplify the tasks of classifying imported goods and determining the duty correctly payable on those goods. To this end, the Commission proposes major revision of the Tariff and, except for the inclusion of unenacted amendments ( Tariff Proposals, etc.) in any working Tariff, the elimination of all differences between the working and the Legal Tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> The report recommends that the Tariff comprise, in addition to the covering sections of the Act:</PARA>
<PARA> the existing Interpretative Rules;</PARA>
<PARA> a Principal Schedule; and</PARA>
<PARA> a Concessional Schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The Principal Schedule is intended to be the main schedule covering classifications and normal duty rates (including all preferential rates) applicable to imported goods. The Concessional Schedule would incorporate all provisions for the entry of goods at concessional (as distinct from preferential ) rates of duty. It would thus incorporate the existing Schedule 2, tariff quota provisions and concessional treatment provided by a number of Ministerial measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission proposes also that, to the maximum extent practicable, the exercise of executive discretions involving changes in applicable duties be by measures that result in the new rates being shown in the Tariff schedules rather than only in separate instruments. This would reduce confusion about the operation of Ministerial measures and the existing high level of misapplication.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed Principal Schedule is contained in Volume 2 of this report. It contains about 2,000 classifications and about 250 different duty rates. For reasons stated in section 4.3, the Principal Schedule retains explanatory matter although the Commission recommends against continuation of this system.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the sections of the Customs Tariff Act were not directly under reference, acceptance of the Commission's recommendations would require changes to the Act. However, the Commission believes that the Act as a whole is very much in need of a complete overhaul and that the Government's stated objective of Tariff simplification requires its complete redrafting. </PARA>
<PARA> One significant cause of the existing Tariff complexity is trade commitments accepted by Australia in international negotiations. Significant simplification will not be possible without modification of some commitments and the Commission recommends that the Government undertake any necessary negotiations. However, the Commission recognises that it is for the Government to decide whether the potential benefits warrant re-negotiation of any particular commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The report draws attention to some areas where the Commission's proposals would not achieve significant simplification and where satisfactory simplification proposals could only be developed in conjunction with a review of assistant issues. In one of these areas, a separate inquiry is formally recommended. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the report recommends that the simplification objective be given its due weight whenever changes or possible changes in the Tariff are under consideration and suggests other steps that might be taken with a view to keeping the Tariff reasonably simple. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply indicate that the Opposition endorses generally the recommendations of the Commission in this report as a means of dealing with the present chaos-the multiplicity of individual rates, the uncertainty that exists, the number of classifications and as the IAC says in the report 'the existing high level of misapplication' of the existing tariff rates. In particular I welcome the IAC's recommendation that the Act as a whole is very much in need of a complete overhaul and that the Government's stated objective of tariff simplification requires its complete redrafting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only further specific point I make in respect of this simplification exercise is this: In order to reduce the numbers of different rates there was a direction by the Government to the IAC to change existing rates by no more than plus or minus 5 per cent. This has been done, and the massive Volume 2 is the result. We point out that a change of plus or minus five per cent is small if the existing rate is of the order of 50 per cent or 60 per cent, but obviously it is very significant if the existing rate is of the order of 15 per cent or 20 per cent. Therefore, the Government should, I believe, check very carefully that this simplification has produced no glaring anomalies. Certainly we of the Opposition will be doing so and I take this occasion to say-will welcome any apparent anomalies in the IAC's proposal being drawn now to our attention. The Government's statements in response to this report made by Mr Moore and Sir Phillip Lynch on 13 April indicated that it was expected that a Bill to implement the proposed new simplified tariff would be introduced during the Budget session of Parliament. I simply say that we look forward to the advent of that Bill and the opportunity for further detailed debate that it will provide. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining specific matter to which I wish to draw attention is the matter of wheelchairs, which was the subject of considerable previous debate in the Parliament when the matter was first mooted, and which still represents so far as the Opposition is concerned an unconscionable action on the part of the Government. Our attitude in this respect has not changed. We take particular objection to the decision of the Government, now given legislative form in this Bill, to impose a tariff duty on the importation of wheelchairs. It is not that the Australian Labor Party is opposed to the retention of a wheelchair manufacturing industry in Australia. On the contrary, we believe that it is highly desirable that the capacity to make such items locally be maintained. However, the effect of the tariff is to raise the price of imported wheelchairs, as well as to enable higher prices to be charged for locally produced wheelchairs. Where wheelchairs are provided free of charge by the Government, such an impost does not disadvantage those who must use them unless they are taxpayers like the rest of us, who are then left to pay the tax on those wheelchairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Not all wheelchairs needed by Australians are provided-this is the real rub- free of charge. Just to give added weight to that, the scheme which provides free chairs is manifestly so inadequately funded by the Government that hundreds of people are missing out on provisions to which they really ought to be entitled. Those who, for one reason or another, have to pay for their wheelchairs as a result of import tariff duties can now expect to contribute as much as $300 a chair to the Government coffers. We simply have taken the view-I repeat it here today-that the imposition of a charge amounting to this order of magnitude is an absolute abomination. As I have indicated, the particular tariff change was, ironically enough, introduced into the Parliament during 1981-the International Year of Disabled Persons. The matter was raised by the Opposition in June last year when the wheelchair tariff was first put before the House as part of a Customs tariff validation Bill. At that time we pointed out that the tariff proposed by the Government was significantly higher than that which had prevailed before 1 January 1980 and, for that reason at least, was simply intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point, as Mr Hurford has done before me in the other place, that there is an alternative way of assisting industry which ensures that the prices of goods do not rise-a particularly important consideration when we are talking about necessities as crucially obvious as this. This is the technique that was recommended by a minority of the IAC commissioners who provided advice to the Government on this matter. It is, of course, to provide a bounty or subsidy for local production instead of placing a tax on imports. The effect of a bounty is to lower the price of the good in the hands of the consumer whereas a tariff raises it. I believe that in this area, as in so many other areas, there is a strong case to be made out for a bounty to be payable to lower the price of wheelchairs, rather than having this extra tariff over and above what was previously payable applied to wheelchairs so that those unfortunate souls who are obliged to use wheelchairs and to pay for them themselves have to contribute so much more to the coffers of the Government. To summarise those points, I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading:</PARA>
<PARA>At end of motion, add ', but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) expresses its concern that the customs duties imposed by this Bill in relation to wheelchairs will maintain the high cost of these necessary aids for the disabled; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls upon the Government immediately to review its decision in relation to wheelchairs with a view to replacing the tariff arrangements provided in the Bill with a bounty scheme for local producers.'. </PARA>
<PARA>The cost of the bounty scheme to which I have referred, and to which I refer again in the terms of the amendment, would, in our estimate, be only of the order of $250,000, since the bulk of wheelchairs purchased in the Australian community are imported. Furthermore, much of this $250,000 would in our estimate be offset by the reduced public cost of wheelchairs which are already provided through hospitals and the aids for disabled persons scheme. In other words, the Government could avoid the inequitable situation that is created by the imposition of an additional tariff on imported wheelchairs at very little cost. I repeat: We deplore this burden on the disabled and I commend the Opposition's amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Australian Democrats support the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1982 and we intend to support the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party. This Bill has been used as an excuse by all the political parties to comment on the basic issue of protection for manufacturing industry in this country. The Democrats believe that the whole protection debate in Australia has been prostituted because of the simplistic approach that is taken on the one hand by the free traders who say that there should be no protection for manufacturing industry in this country and the sooner that happens the better, and on the other hand by the manufacturers-</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. The noises I hear coming from the 'dries' are simply that the quicker we have free trade in Australia the happier they will be . I could show Senator Thomas many references to that sort of comment. On the other hand, the manufacturers very often adopt the attitude that anything that is made in Australia should be protected. The Democrats do not adopt either of those extreme attitudes. We say that there is a third approach which is within the realm of practical politics. We believe that there should be long term indicative planning, co-operative planning, among governments, industry and the trade union movement, and that the Government has a very real responsibility to discuss with those in industry what sorts of industries they wish to encourage in this country in the long term. It is completely unsatisfactory for industry to be operating on the basis that on any day of any year protection may be substantially withdrawn or reduced depending on whether the 'dries' or the 'wets ' happen to reach ascendency in a particular political party. Industry is far too fragile to be a political football. It is basic to the employment and wealth of this country. If we are to solve the very real problems that lie ahead and have our work force fully employed in the very near future, we have to encourage manufacturing industry. We have to encourage it on a firm foundation which is a genuine partnership between the interests of labour and capital. There has to be co-operation and partnership between labour and capital and also a partnership and co-operation between industry and the Government. The Government has to take industry into its confidence as opposed to what goes on at the moment, with industry appearing before the Industries Assistance Commission in a confrontation position justifying its right to exist. Surely there can be discussion and co-operation rather than confrontation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The wheelchair issue that has been raised in relation to this Bill is a typical case in point. As I said, we support the Labor Party's amendment, essentially on compassionate grounds. Wheelchairs should reach their users in this country in the cheapest, possible way. On those grounds there is a very good case to be made out for a bounty. Bounties, however, tend to be short term approaches. Industries can have bounties one year and they can be withdrawn the next. In actual fact, as is set out in the Bill, the Government has clearly stated that it wants to reduce gradually the tariff from 30 per cent in 1982 to 20 per cent in 1983. That sort of approach is in line with what we would advocate. On the face of it, it provides for a gradually reducing tariff over a period. It gives industry a clear picture, at least for three years ahead, of what the Government is expecting of it. Three years is not far enough. We believe that there could be a much better approach. The Government should take industry into its confidence on the basis of its projections for the market over a period. It should be much more forthright with industry generally. Nevertheless in the case of wheelchairs there is a reducing tariff. To that degree we commend the Government for what it has done. However, on compassionate grounds we feel that because of the need for wheelchairs to be in the hands of the consumer at the cheapest possible price, they are a special case. We will support the Labor Party's proposal that a bounty would be more appropriate in this instance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to express my concern and that of the Opposition that in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1982, which is now before us, the Government has decided to maintain what is really an unconscionable tariff on the importing of wheelchairs into this country. It is with dismay and, quite frankly, amazement-this has now moved to revulsion with the Government-that I stand in the Senate today to talk on this issue. I cannot conceive of a more cold-hearted action by any Australian government than this, which puts an impost of up to $300 on the cost of importing what is an essential aid for the disabled. It is even more amazing when one considers that the basis for this action was laid in 1981 in the International Year of Disabled Persons. One wonders about the commitment of the Australian Fraser Government to the disabled within our community when such a situation can arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are not talking about the importing of luxury items such as colour television sets.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They utterly support my contention. What is more, my contention is borne out by every editorialist in this country. If Senator Martin wants to defend a Minister's connivance in this matter she should do so in another debate on that topic. It is not surprising that nobody on the other side of the chamber rises to defend this proposition except by way of interjection from the luxury of the other side. As I was saying, this callous imposition of a tariff on the importing of wheelchairs is hypocritical and fills one with amazement. It has galvanised community groups into taking the sort of action which spreads well beyond the lobby groups for the disabled themselves. I will speak of those groups at the moment. The Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled, known as ACROD, has argued, as Senator Siddons so well recognised, that a bounty would be a more equitable way to continue the employment opportunities of the 55 Australians who are employed in the manufacture, repair and provision of wheelchairs within Australia. Only 55 people are employed in this way. I do not say 'only' in the sense that their employment prospects are not important, but in order to emphasise that their interests could be well protected by a bounty scheme rather than a tariff. I think that is acknowledged around this chamber and as I said, by the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled. The Government has taken an attitude which is concerned with revenues and expenditures, not with the real needs of the disabled and the handicapped. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in opening ACROD House in Canberra on Wednesday, 20 May 1981, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . one of the benefits of the policy of financial restraint and responsibility we have consistently followed is that we have been able to do more in areas which we regard as of high priority. Programs for the handicapped and the disabled have this high priority. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that statement was made in May of the International Year of Disabled Persons. In this chamber, a mere 12 months later, we are confronted with the Government's actions belying its words. The then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Moore, in replying to our pleas on behalf of the disabled, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Australian Labor Party has a bleeding heart from time to time, but the relevance is to industry. </PARA>
<PARA>What a narrow conception of the responsibilities of government. The Government looks at the imposition of tariffs on the importing of wheelchairs as merely an industrial matter, merely a question of revenues and does nothing to meet the real heart of the matter which is that we are providing as a community a means for the disabled to achieve some measure of mobility. The matter has gone much further than the lobby groups for the disabled. Mr Don Wing, an alderman of the Launceston City Council, is reported in the Mercury of 27 April 1982 as strongly attacking the Federal Government for its actions in this regard. Mr Don Wing, as many in this chamber will know, is a very distinguished member of the Liberal Party in Tasmania and for many years he was its State President. The Mercury reports him as saying of this particular proposal that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government's action was 'verging on the hypocritical' and they were virtually making money from the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wing characterised the Government's action as totally 'unconscionable', to use his term. The service groups, who played such an important role during the International Year of Disabled Persons and who do so year after year in providing motor vehicles and doing various works on behalf of institutions for disabled people, are also extremely concerned. Letters to the editor of the Examiner newspaper include a letter from Mr G. D. Paton, District Governor of the Lions Club in Tasmania. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At the Lions District Convention held late last year at St Helens the following motion was passed to go forward to the Multiple District National Convention in Brisbane next month. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA> 'That this Convention, through the Lions Multiple District Council requests the Commonwealth Government to remove all forms of duty and tax on wheelchairs and other specialised equipment and aids used by disabled persons.'</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that it is the service groups in the community, the Lions clubs, the Apex clubs, the Rotary clubs and those clubs which devote many hours to the service of disabled people, which have a real appreciation of the needs of disabled people and a real concern that the Government should change its mind even at this late date about this unconscionable impost. In fact, when I raised the matter in the Senate last week by way of a question directed to the Minister for Health, supposing in my ignorance that the Minister for Health, Senator Peter Baume, would be interested, given his portfolio, in the needs of the disabled, I was amazed to get from him the answer that really it was not his concern but was a matter for the business and consumer affairs portfolio. In other words, once again the matter is seen as one of Customs revenue or Customs regulation rather than as this society making a compassionate and realistic response to the needs of those who have been disabled either at birth or by some traumatic illness or accident in their later years. I simply put on the record the Labor Party's concern, along with that of many community groups, about the imposition of this particular import duty. We hope that the Government will see the folly and the callousness of its ways. Even at this late date I hope that Senator Messner finds himself able to say that the Government will retreat from its cold-hearted position. I fear that I may wait in vain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before touching on the main element of the debate here today, I thank the honourable senators for their general support of the legislation insofar as they discussed matters other than wheelchairs. Having said that, I would like to turn to the matters that have been raised in the first place by Senator Evans, followed by Senator Siddons and ending with Senator Tate with regard to wheelchairs and the duty which is imposed upon their import. I should point out that this matter has been the subject of a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission. Indeed, we all know that draft reports came down offering two alternative, schemes, one involving both a tariff and a bounty and the other a bounty alone. I understand that IAC members were divided on this question, amongst other things, for reasons of uncertainty as to Government policies of assistance to wheelchair users generally. I would like to come back to that matter a little later because it is of vital importance, I think, in understanding the Government's attitude to this question</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In its final report the Industries Assistance Commission referred to the announcement in the 1980 Budget of increased assistance to, wheelchair users and concluded that there was no longer a social welfare justification for a bounty on local production of wheelchairs. This, I remind honourable senators, is the IAC speaking with an industry consideration in mind. That view was the unanimous one of all five signatories to the report, all of whom, at the draft stage, had favoured some kind of bounty for wheelchair users. Nevertheless, the then Minister, for Business and Consumer Affairs indicated that he still wished the Government to be able to look at a bounty as an alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC, as a result, offered four types of bounty schemes. The Government then undertook an examination all of those four schemes. All the bounty schemes would have been complex and costly to run and may not have been effective in assisting many of the small firms involved in the manufacture of wheelchairs. I think Senator Evans alluded to some of the difficulties that would be involved in the administration of the bounties in this area by drawing our attention to the fact that there are a large number of small firms and that consequently one can imagine the difficulties in offering assistance of this kind to them. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to make one other point; that is, if the simplest bounty-a flat rate of so many dollars a wheelchair-were adopted, it would be necessary to define and administer what might be called 'local content rules' as a condition of receiving the bounty. Without such rules a firm might get the bounty for adding only a few finishing touches to an essentially complete wheelchair. The Government thus chose a reduced tariff-I stress the word ' reduced', and I will return to that in a moment-to ensure the existence of a local wheelchair industry. I think Senator Tate would be the first to acknowledge that with the problems of the disabled comes the problem of provision of aids. It is vitally important, as I have experienced in my area of veterans' affairs, to ensure that facilities are locally available for the provision of all kinds of aids to the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention my own Department because, as honourable senators would know, the Department of Veterans' Affairs administers the repatriation and artifical limb appliance centres and consequently there is a very real concern that we need to keep up our local level of skills and abilities to provide aids to the disabled in many ways. It follows that it is necessary to ensure that a local industry to provide wheelchairs is maintained in Australia and that, in fact, we have access to the provision of this kind of facility. I believe that, while this may not meet the direct remarks of honourable senators, certainly some assistance has been offered to the user, as distinct from the manufacturer, by way of the Government's decision that the tariff rate will be reduced, that the general rate applicable to mechanically-propelled chairs will drop from 34 per cent and that the rate applicable to hand-propelled units will drop from 36 per cent to 20 per cent over two years. I think all honourable senators would acknowledge that that is a substantial reduction and of substantial assistance to people who are in such need as to require wheelchairs. </PARA>
<PARA> So, I reject the assumption that the Government is being hard-hearted in this area. There has been substantial assistance through that measure. Furthermore, I think we need to look at the total situation and have regard to the fact that during the International Year of Disabled Persons in 1981, and extended into this year, the Governement assisted disabled people with a range of various aids and, by virtue of provision of finance to the States, provided assistance for them generally. I draw the attention of honourable senators to a statement by the then Minister for Health on 13 December 1981 which announced that there would be an allocation by the Commonwealth Government of $2.4m to the States and Territories for the program of aids for disabled people. Incorporated in those aids, of course, are both manual and motorised wheelchairs. They are amongst other aids which would generally be available under those programs. In respect of the finance that was made available to the States on earlier occasions, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard, in order to make clear the Government's intentions in this regard, a Press release from the then Minister for Health dated 8 June 1981 which sets out the allocations of finance to the States for those particular purposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think perhaps we have a situation where, it is very difficult , as we have demonstrated, to design a bounty system in regard to wheelchairs which would assist all disabled people. There is absolutely no guarantee that manufacturers would pass on the benefit of any bounty given to the local industry to those who need it most, that is, the disabled people, the actual users of wheelchairs. For that reason the Government has a multi-faceted approach to this question and is, of course, addressing itself not only to a reduced tariff over a two-year implementation period but also to the provision of direct assistance through finance to the States. For these reasons the Government rejects the amendments put forward by the Opposition, which I notice has the support of the Australian Democrats, and will oppose them. I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to clarify that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) in his second reading remarks stated that in fact the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1982 represented a decrease in the tariff applied to wheelchairs. Whilst that may be technically true in relation to the immediate past, is it not a fact that the Senate could have been provided with a fuller picture which would have shown that, with the abolition of the preferential duty on 1 January 1980, there was a dramatic increase in the duty applicable to wheelchairs? Whilst there may be a small decrease provided in this Bill, if a comparison is made with the pre-1980 position, there is in fact a very real increase in the burden applied to those who wish to purchase an imported wheelchair. Over a period of two years this Government has in fact imposed an unconscionable, callous, cold hearted increase in the tariff applicable to the import of these wheelchairs. In other words, the picture that the Minister painted for us was indeed of a very brief period of history and did not by any means give the full picture of the Government's narrow minded attitude, as would be revealed by a two-year survey of its actions in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will take an even broader one and draw his attention again to the provision of finance to the various States for the provision of aids to the disabled, through the program established by the Minister for Health .

In other words, how much of the $5m that is required to be expended by disabled persons over any one year in Australia on the provision of this essential item to enable them to enjoy some degree of mobility, given their illness caused by some traumatic accident or whatever, has been allocated by the Federal Government and spent in alleviating the cost of the purchase of wheelchairs?</PARA></TALK.START>

I am unable to identify the specific amount offhand but I will endeavour to obtain further information in that regard. I imagine that it would be a matter for the States to decide. Senator Tate would acknowledge that the program evisaged by the Commonwealth was an overall program for the provision of assistance to the States. Consequently it would be for the States to distribute that amount as they saw fit. I hope that the honourable senator will acknowledge that there might be some difficulty in obtaining detailed information along the lines that he seeks.

Is the Government locked into that progressive minimal reduction of tariffs up to May 1983 or will the Government be open to the pleas of those organisations which have been formed to represent disabled people? Will it be open to pleas from service organisations such as the Lions, Apex and Rotary clubs whose members give countless hours of service on behalf of disabled people and the institutions which help them? Will the Government listen in an open-minded way to the pleas of the Senate and take note of the amendment which has just been passed, which expresses the concern of the Senate at the high cost of these necessary aids for the disabled and calls upon the Government to review immediately its decision? Will the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) give an undertaking on behalf of the Government that the pleas of honourable senators which were carried by a majority a moment ago, the pleas of the organisations of the disabled and the pleas of those service organisations which help them year by year will not be falling on deaf ears but will find some response?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had no hesitation whatsoever in supporting the amendment which was just carried. I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs ( Senator Messner) to have regard to the fact that, as Senator Tate has said, the Senate has expressed its opinion on this very important matter. I should have liked further clarification, although I admit that it is not possible in some circumstances to have all Ministers present during a debate, from the Minister for Health (Senator Peter Baume) in regard to the provision of funds for the purchase of aid equipment for the handicapped. While the Minister is considering the various propositions that have been put forward, I draw to his attention also the fact that early in 1976 I put a proposition to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), who passed it on to the then Minister for Social Security, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, that there be some sort of travel assistance, including some sort of mobility allowance, for the handicapped. I include that in the requests that are now being made to the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate concentrated on the point that the preferential tariff applicable to wheelchairs was only 15 per cent. I point out that that applies only to imports from Britain. Imports from other countries attract a rate of either 36 per cent or 34 per cent; in other words, the equivalent rate that applied before the adjustment effected by this piece of legislation, wherein there is a two-year reduction period down to a level of 20 per cent. I hope that Senator Tate will make it clear to other people to whom he is speaking on this matter that the Government is providing assistance via the States for the very purposes for which they are seeking to be helped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point raised by Senator Harradine concerning the mobility allowance needs to be drawn to the attention of the responsible Minister. I certainly will do that and I will see whether I can get a reply for the honourable senator by way of direct correspondence. The honourable senator asked also for details of the provision of assistance to the States. He may not have heard the points that I made earlier in the debate on this matter. I sought to have incorporated in Hansard a ministerial Press release which sets out the details of that arrangement and which goes back to June of last year.

<PARA>TOBACCO CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1982</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Tobacco Charge Act (No. 1) 1955 for the following purposes:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to increase the rate of charge payable on sales of Australian tobacco leaf on and after 1 March 1982 from 1.1 cents to 2.5 cents per kilogram</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to enable the rate of charge to be increased or decreased by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is closely linked with the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill (No. 3) which will apply the rate of charge set under this Bill to Australian tobacco leaf purchased by manufacturers or grown and used by manufacturers. It is proposed that the three Bills be treated as cognate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the rate of charge paid by manufacturers is 2.2 cents per kilogram. </PARA>
<PARA> The three principal Acts have, since 1955, established rates of charge to be paid by industry funds for research financed from the Tobacco Industry Trust Account established by the Tobacco Industry Act 1955. In 1965 the latter Act was amended so part of the charges paid by growers and manufacturers could be appropriated to meet the cost of operation of the Australian Tobacco Board which was then being established. The balance of the amount collected continues to be appropriated to the Tobacco Industry Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA> The rates of charge were increased at the time from one half penny to three- fifths of a penny per pound. Since then there has been only a minor reduction effected in 1973 to 1.1 cents per kilogram. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of money thus provided for research has been declining as the costs of operating the Australian Tobacco Board have risen in spite of substantial economies being effected. In more recent years there has been a further decline because it has been necessary for marketing quotas under the Tobacco Stabilisation Plan to be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> An effect of this has been that research and extension programs in the three producing States have been pruned and rationalised over a period of several years. Even so the cost of basic programs has exceeded annual income and it has been necessary to draw on reserves accumulated in previous years and the proceeds of sales of real estate and assets which were no longer essential to the scaled down programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The stage has been reached where remaining reserves would quickly be depleted and the current programs could not be maintained unless there is an injection of additional funds. </PARA>
<PARA> With the new proposals and at present marketing quota levels the industry will contribute about $250,000 more than it has been doing. The Commonwealth is prepared to continue matching expenditure of industry funds and so will contribute a like amount. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus it will be possible to continue the current level of research for some years to come, drawing on reserves to some extent. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of whether the Commonwealth should contribute to tobacco research has been asked before and will no doubt arise again. One of the decisions announced on 19 December 1980 following the Government's consideration of Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare was that there would be discussions with the industry on redirection of funding for research into alternative varieties of tobacco leaf having a less detrimental effect on health . There has been increasing emphasis on plant breeding and on cultural practices which affect alkaloid levels in leaf. There is also some important work on resistance to insects and plant diseases to lessen dependence on the use of chemicals for control purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be expected that there will be further emphasis on these essential aspects of research. With this in mind the Government has sought the agreement of the Australian Agricultural Council to add a representative of the Department of Health to membership of the Central Tobacco Advisory Committee. That is the Committee which has the responsibility of examining research programs and recommending to me the expenditure of moneys from the Tobacco Industry Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure approved for this year, 1981-82, is $1,233,155 of which the Commonwealth is committed to contribute $348,000. The whole amount is made available to State Departments responsible for agriculture in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Additional State expenditure on tobacco research in 1981-82 is estimated at $580,000. </PARA>
<PARA> All of the expenditure is concerned with production and curing of leaf on the farm, not with manufacturing. The increases in the charge rates from the start of the selling season have been sought by both the growing and manufacturing sectors. Both are in favour of the starting date of 1 March. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as any future changes in rates are concerned regulations will be introduced only if changes are sought by both sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>TOBACCO CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1982</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Tobacco Charge Act (No. 2) 1955 to increase the amount of tobacco charge payable by manufacturers on their purchases of Australian tobacco leaf. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is part of the cognate legislation referred to in my second reading speech on the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that as from 1 March 1982 the rate of charge paid by manufacturers on their purchases of Australian leaf, presently 2.2 per cent per kilogram, is to be the same as that applicable under the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1982. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. The Opposition will not be opposing the Tobacco Charge (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1982 and cognate Bills . They are relatively minor Bills which authorise an increase in the levy currently paid by tobacco growers and tobacco manufacturers. The purpose of the levy is to fund the Australian Tobacco Board and to finance research in the industry, which I understand has had its emphasis changed in the direction of attempting to devise ways of processing tobacco and of developing new tobacco leaf varieties less harmful to health when used. Also attempts have been made at an agricultural level to reduce the dependency of the industry on chemical, insect and disease control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that Senator Peter Rae at the Committee stage will move an amendment to clause 4 of the Tobacco Charge (No. 1) Amendment Bill which imposes the levy on tobacco growers. Apparently the purpose of Senator Peter Rae's amendment is to ensure that the levy may not be increased, by administrative action, above 6c a kilogram. The Bill, as it stands in its original draft, appears to be open-ended in that respect. The Opposition will not oppose Senator Peter Rae's amendment. We may not have bothered to move it because some people may think that it is so minor a point that it is not worth doing it as the Government would not attempt to impose massive charges on the industry. However, if anyone thinks the matter is of sufficient importance to warrant moving an amendment imposing some ceiling on what levies may be imposed by regulation only , we certainly will not oppose it. However, I understand that the Government cannot make up its mind about something as trivial as this because the Godfather is in Queensland, or some such place, and the Government would not dare to muscle in on National Country Party territory on even the most trivial of matters without the approval, in advance, of the relevant National Country Party Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Tobacco Charge (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1982 and related measures and to take the time of the Senate for just a few minutes to raise a matter which is ancillary to the Bill, which is constantly being raised publicly and which, I think, ought to have some reply. I note the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), in his second reading speech, states that the purpose of the Tobacco Charge (No. 1) Amendment Bill is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . to increase the rate of charge payable on sales of Australian tobacco leaf . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is closely linked with the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill (No. 3) which will apply the rate of charge set under this Bill to Australian tobacco leaf purchased by manufacturers or grown and used by manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister also states:</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure approved for this year, 1981-82, is $1,233,155 of which the Commonwealth is committed to contribute $348,000. The whole amount is made available to State Departments responsible for agriculture in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Additional State expenditure on tobacco research in 1981-82 is estimated at $580,000. </PARA>
<PARA> All of the expenditure is concerned with production and curing of leaf on the farm, not with manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA>That states the purposes of the Bills that we are debating together this evening . I also note that the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The question of whether the Commonwealth should contribute to tobacco research has been asked before and will no doubt arise again. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bills were introduced into the Senate on 18 March. The Minister's hopes that the Government's role in tobacco research and purpose of tobacco research in Australia are again under attack. Only one week later, in a hearing conducted by the Industries Assistance Commission, the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria made submissions which were relative to the tobacco industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a very specific interest in these Bills, not because I happen to be a tobacco addict, but because about half of the tobacco farmers in Australia are in Queensland. I have visited the areas where tobacco is growing and have discussed with growers the matter of additives in the industry. They have expressed to me great concern about the attitude of certain anti-smoking groups in the community and some worries about the Government's attitude, not necessarily that they think that there should not be anti-smoking campaigns. I think the dangers that appear to be associated with tobacco smoking should be made clear. Anti-cancer councils are right in campaigning publicly about the effect that smoking could have on one's health. However, I cannot support a view that the industry should be deprived of access to research funds which has been an attitude put in this Parliament, put in a number of venues and, as I have said, put to the Industries Assistance Commission on 25 March 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement made by the Council to the IAC included this remark:</PARA>
<PARA> Tobacco is a toxic product and should not receive assistance from the Government for its growing, manufacturing or marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is at direct variance with the Government's declared intention of reducing tobacco consumption . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that it is not at variance. The tobacco industry is an industry which exists in Australia. If the Government were to decide, because of its concern about the effect of tobacco on individuals' health, that the tobacco industry should be eliminated in Australia-it could do that by a number of measures-it would not of itself eliminate smoking tobacco. We all know that. We do import a large quantity of tobacco and manufacturers use imported tobacco, along with Australian tobacco in their industry. Therefore, tobacco and tobacco products would still be available for import unless the Government made the decision that it would ban tobacco and tobacco products which I think is entirely unlikely. So , if the Government were to take that decision, it would phase out an industry in the country and allow the products of the industry to come from other countries. It is entirely competent for the Government if it wishes to make that decision. What it must not do is send Australian tobacco farmers broke through depriving the industry of access to research money into disease. It is no cure for the tobacco smoking habit to prevent our farmers having access to research funds which will discover cures for diseases of crops. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh pointed out that the Government has stated that it is encouraging means of research which will lead to the development of a leaf which has lower levels of certain allegedly toxic qualities and also resistance to disease so that chemicals do not have to be used so much. So long as we have the industry, that research is important and it must be carried out. I contend that the view, as reported by the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria and other groups which have taken this line from time to time, is quite unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Sarfaty, head of the New South Wales Cancer Council, said to the IAC:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that duty concessions to cigarette makers for buying Australian leaf, and their promotional tax deductions should also be ended. </PARA>
<PARA>If duty concessions were eliminated for buying Australian leaf the only effect would be to send Australian tobacco farmers broke and that will not achieve the end that any anti-cancer council might want to achieve. It will only affect the Australian industry's income, not the smoking habit. The effect of the tactics of these people would be only to beggar the farmer-and to what purpose? As I have said, if the Government decided that it did not want to support the tobacco industry, because of other forms of assistance, and it made a conscious decision that the tobacco industry in Australia was to be eliminated, given that it can only exist in a protected situation, that is a decision that the Government is competent to make and could make. However, if it makes that decision it must face the fact that tobacco growing is a highly specialised industry; that the types of soil used for growing tobacco are unlikely except in a couple of fairly rare instances to be suitable for growing other crops, except with the addition of large amounts of fertiliser; that the equipment used for tobacco farming is highly specialised, specific to the crop and not suitable for other crops; and that the farmers would have to be bailed out in a reasonable way and set up in other industries, or given the opportunity to set up in other industries, if that was what they want to do. If that is the Government's decision-good. But I urge the Government not to take any notice of people whose frustration at, frankly, their lack of success by and large with their anti-smoking campaigns leads them to advocate that the solution to the problem of tobacco addiction could be achieved in any way by hurting Australian farmers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank both Senator Walsh and Senator Martin for their support of the legislation. As was foreshadowed in Senator Walsh's speech a matter has been raised which it was proposed would be raised in the Committee stage. This is the matter which the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills drew to our attention with respect to clause 4 of the Tobacco Charge (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1982. That clause establishes a right to fix a charge by regulation without stating a maximum permissible amount. It has, in fact, been customary in legislation implementing levies for rural industry research to establish an operative and a maximum rate and to provide for the operative rate to be increased up to the level of the maximum by regulation. That has meant that, on a number of occasions, legislation has had to be brought into the Parliament solely for the purpose of increasing the maximum rate of levy. For example, the Wheat Tax Act 1957 was amended in 1973 and in 1978. The Dairying Industry Research and Promotion Levy Act 1972 was amended in 1980. The purpose of the provision, as the Government has put it into this legislation, is simply to reduce the future legislative work load by obviating the need to amend the legislation for the sole purpose of increasing a rate of charge as requested by the industry concerned and as agreed to by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point made by the Committee is not, of course, that this is an inappropriate delegation of power, but that it might be. The matter having been drawn to my attention by Senator Rae in the context that it is a question which arises not only with respect to this legislation but also potentially with respect to other Bills which might be drafted in the same form, it seems to me to be desirable for the Government to consider the point which has been made prior to our movement to the Committee stage. I note the rather critical comment of Senator Walsh in referring to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). I simply remind the Senate that, in fact, with respect to a number of Bills from the Department of Primary Industry which have gone through this chamber recently and which have been subject to comment by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, amendments have been made in this place to meet difficulties which have been drawn to our attention by that Committee. Those changes have been made after consultation with the Minister responsible for the Bill as anyone would expect in the operation of the system of government in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising that I should want to refer the matter to the action Minister. In turn, it may be a matter which he will want to have considered by the Government because of its broader application. I point out that in any event what the Government is putting forward is not leaving the tobacco growers without recourse to parliamentary control, nor is it leaving this Parliament without control because, of course, any regulations made increasing the amount of the levy are subject to disallowance in this or the other place. I give notice prior to the conclusion of the second reading debate that I will, on the Bills being given a second reading, move that the consideration in the Committee stage be made an order of the day for next day of sitting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the continuation of the debate on the documents tabled in connection with the importation of a colour television set by the honourable member for Warringah, Mr MacKellar. Honourable senators will recall that the Government decided to table all relevant documents. Arising out of that, a volume of documents were tabled. The Government indicated that it would continue the search to find out whether there were further documents. Subsequently, a document was found. In the first place it appeared to have no relevance because there was no mention of the television set in the text. A subsequent inquiry of officers revealed that it did have relevance and so it was tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There had been suggestions that there might be more documents.

<PARA>STATEMENT BY THE HON. N. A. BROWN MINISTER FOR BUSINESS AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS</PARA>
<PARA>Review of Customs Administration</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister informed the House on 20 April 1982 that there were matters which seemed to require examination within the administration of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in New South Wales. He indicated that consideration was being given to the appropriate form of the inquiry into those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The circumstances associated with the importation last year of a television set by the former Minister for Health have attracted publicity and comment in this House and outside. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been publicity and comment about wider difficulties in customs administration in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> In tendering their resignations last week the Minister for Health and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs accepted responsibility for what happened in relation to the importation of the television set. They have paid a heavy price. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition the Government has tabled the relevant documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not believe that there is any good purpose to be served by further examination of those particular events with a view to reporting on the responsibility and conduct of those involved. </PARA>
<PARA> What is important, however, is to look to the future and to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that any difficulties in Customs administration in New South Wales are put right. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect I inform the House that a great deal of work has already been completed by the Department and the Public Service Board on a major restructuring of the Customs organisation throughout the Commonwealth. The proposed restructuring includes the introduction of a single work category of customs officer which should lead to the elimination of work demarcation tensions now present. The Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs recommended the early introduction of a single work category. </PARA>
<PARA> The implementation plans which will be made public very shortly include processes for consultations with the interested staff associations. The Government believes that the reorganisation will do much to avoid a repetition of the difficulties that have been in evidence recently. It is the Government's wish that the reorganisation proceed expeditiously.</PARA>
<PARA> While it believes that this reorganisation will achieve a great deal, the Government has decided to establish a further review of Administration and procedures of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in regard to the control and clearance of imported goods under the customs Act in relation to New South Wales. The review will have particular regard to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) clearance of incoming passengers and of the unaccompanied baggage of incoming passengers and of incoming cargo at the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the relations between management, staff and staff associations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the need to ensure the efficient and impartial application of Customs procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The review will report on any changes that may be necessary or desirable for more efficient and effective administration, including industrial relations, and to ensure observance of the instruction by the Prime Minister in 1976 that all Australians should receive equal treatment in respect of the enforcement of Customs regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The review will be carried out by Mr F. J. Mahony, C.B., O.B.E. Mr Mahony is the President of the Repatriation Review Tribunal. He was formerly a deputy secretary in the Attorney-General's Department and acted for a period as Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Mahony will be invited to take account of such reports, developments, events and other circumstances as he may consider necessary in order to report on necessary or desirable changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not propose to confer on Mr Mahony powers under the Royal Commissions Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not believe this is necessary for a review which is essentially forward looking and directed to setting the administration right for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> While Mr Mahony's attention will be directed to the Customs administration in New South Wales he will not, of course, be excluded from examining the relationship between the Department in Canberra and the administration in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The manner in which Mr Mahony conducts his review will be a matter for him including the extent to which he may decide to hold public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be asking Mr Mahony to present his report in a form that may be made public subject, of course, to any particular part that should be treated confidentially. </PARA>
<PARA> I table the terms of reference of the review and ask leave to incorporate them in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA>TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR REVIEW OF CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION</PARA>
<PARA> 1. To review the administration and procedures of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in regard to the control and clearance of imported goods under the Customs Act in relation to New South Wales, with particular regard to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) clearance of incoming passengers and of the unaccompanied baggage of incoming passengers and of incoming cargo at the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I revert for a moment to the previous matter of the documents. Last week Senator Grimes asked a question of Senator Messner regarding a second document that I understand he felt was in existence, originating from Mr Kennedy who, I think, is the Director of the Internal Affairs Unit. I am advised that all inquiries have failed to identify the existence ever of such a document. I understand that the questioning of Mr Kennedy has indicated that he knows of no such documents. Perhaps there is some misunderstanding about the nature of the document on this matter. The reference may be to a document that was tabled previously. The Government, from the outset , recognised that there were obviously serious difficulties within the Customs section of the Department. There were quite serious allegations by certain Customs officers of practices that, if true, could not be tolerated-allegations of standover tactics, overriding of valid actions and of patronage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Arising out of these matters some people have felt that some of the officers have suffered victimisation. I refer, for example, to the comment made by Senator Macklin earlier today in the Senate. There was a serious allegation of victimisation of a public servant who is engaged in carrying out his duties to the best of his intentions. The Government shares entirely the views of all honourable senators who would want to pursue to the ultimate this question of justice, fair play and sound working conditions for the officers engaged in the Customs area. Accordingly, the terms of reference have been so designed that they cover explicitly all such matters. I give an assurance to the Senate that the terms of reference-I have legal advice on this matter-are such that they enable the fullest investigation of all the practices and alleged malpractices within the Customs section, whether they be alleged industrial practices, allegations of overriding of orders, allegations of patronage or, indeed-and more seriously-allegations of corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made no reflection at all on any officer and certainly not on any officer carrying out his duty in this matter. In 1976 the Government set out, through the then Mr Carmody, who was the Secretary of the Department of Customs and Excise, clear instructions that there should be absolute equality of treatment for everybody who comes on to the Customs floor and that nobody-be it members of parliament or overseas dignataries-should receive any different treatment. It is the Government's emphatic desire that this should be so. The terms of reference have been designed taking into consideration the intensions behind the suggestions of the union representative indeed, the Customs officers themselves, that an investigation was necessary. The terms of reference have been so designed because the Government believes that there should be the fullest understanding on this matter. They have been designed-as honourable senators from both sides have said-not to undertake a witch hunt of the unfortunate incident for which two former Ministers have paid a very high penalty. Honourable senators from both sides of the chamber have stressed that it is not the desire of this inquiry to proceed with any further witch hunt in regard to two people concerned. They have paid an extremely high price. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator's colleagues have indicated that it is not their intention in this inquiry to pursue a witch hunt against those Ministers. The request of the Australian Labor Party and of all honourable senators has been that there should be an inquiry. The terms of reference should be sufficiently wide to uncover all the details of procedures within the Bureau of Customs which have been exposed in this instance. I put it to the Senate that these terms of reference are adequate. All the lawyers insist that that is so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A chairman has been selected for the inquiry. He is Mr Frank Mahony. He is a man of unquestioned integrity and ability, a man whose knowledge both of the law and of the procedures of the Public Service would be second to none. Honourable senators will be aware that Mr Mahony has had a distinguished service in the Attorney-General's Department. He was recognised for his great skills, integrity and dedication. He was, in fact, in charge of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. He is a man whose ability and objectivity has been recognised on both sides of the Parliament. My understanding is that he had the full support of the Whitlam Government during its term. I think he was appointed by it to ASIO. His background in the Attorney-General's Department, in ASIO, and now in the Repatriation Review Tribunal makes him eminently suitable. No one would question his ability to undertake this inquiry. Under the terms of reference he has the ability to inquire into the whole field of the activities of the Customs area of the Department, relations between management, staff and staff associations-if there is any victimisation it can come out quite clearly- and the need to ensure the efficient and impartial application of Customs procedures. If there is any attempt to obstruct an officer in his duties, that can come out. If there is any kind of suggestion of patronage or corruption it can all be brought out. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Senate that the matters that have been sought by the officers concerned, by the Government itself and by requests made from both sides of the Parliament are well met in these terms of reference and by the nature of the person conducting the inquiry. I believe that it is unrestricted in its ability to prove all these matters. Against that background I commend the terms of reference. The Government, therefore, will not be supporting the proposed amendment to the motion that the Senate take note of the paper. In other words, we will not be supporting the request by the Opposition for a judicial inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter arises from what I suppose was a sad and sordid little episode in the history of this country which occurred a couple of weeks ago. Last week when the matter was discussed in the Senate I moved an amendment to the motion that the Senate take note of the paper. The purpose of that amendment was to call for a judicial inquiry with certain terms of reference which the Opposition believed would satisfy the public concern about this important question. A week has now elapsed and some of the interest in the matter has probably subsided a little. The Government has now proposed an inquiry of an internal Public Service kind into this matter. I will seek leave to withdraw the motion which I moved on a previous occasion and to move a fresh amendment to the motion that the Senate take note of the paper. I explain to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) that I am doing that in the context of what has happened since we last discussed this matter. The Government has now tabled further documents relating to this matter. It has indicated also that it proposes to appoint Mr Mahony to conduct an inquiry. I seek leave to withdraw the previous amendment proposing a judicial inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Leave out all words after 'That', insert:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The terms of reference for the review of Customs administration should be amended to include the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. (a) The effectiveness of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in the performance of its functions under the Customs Act 1901;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The handling of complaints within the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and in particular the Bureau of Customs;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Any questions affecting the industrial relations or relations between the management, staff and staff associations within the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, and</PARA>

<PARA> 4. That the review should produce its report by 1 November 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>I move that motion because it is the Opposition's view that this is a serious matter in which an allegation was made in the newspapers and by officers of the Australian Public Service employed in the Bureau of Customs that there had been a serious breach of privilege. It was not a breach of privilege in the sense that we talk about in the Senate. It was alleged that privilege had the appearance of being abused by Ministers in a particular situation. We are all aware of the circumstances in which that came about. In saying that there has been an appearance of an abuse of privilege, I am really trying to point out that the whole matter received an extraordinary amount of interest and the political flavour attracted to it was very colourful because of the fact that two Ministers had been involved in this incident and there appeared to have been an attempt to discipline a public servant who had done his duty and who had, in fact, carried out the instructions which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) laid down in 1976 in relation to this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I was dealing with the MacKellar-Moore black and white television set issue. We were trying to get some resolution of the proper nature of an inquiry which should be conducted into this whole affair. As Senator Sir John Carrick properly pointed out, we have made it quite clear right from the beginning that we are not interested in pursuing a witch hunt against particular Ministers. But if the circumstances are such that an inquiry is felt to be necessary, the Opposition has maintained from the beginning of this matter that the inquiry should be public, that it should be conducted by somebody outside the Public Service, that it should have much more explicit terms of reference than this proposed inquiry of the Government has and that it should report by a particular date. If the questions involved justify an inquiry, they justify a proper inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to indicate some of the dissatisfaction which the Opposition has with these proposed terms of reference. The first thing I should say is that the inquiry is directed to New South Wales only. It is not anything but a matter of common knowledge that for some time there has been dissatisfaction with the staffing levels of the Bureau of Customs, that there has been some dissatisfaction with procedures, that there has been some dissatisfaction with industrial relations within the Bureau of Customs and that that is not confined to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. We find it extraordinary that the inquiry should be so limited as to be directed to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport only.</PARA>
<PARA> We have no qualifications about the calibre of the man appointed to conduct the inquiry, Mr Mahony. We are not in any sense attacking his capacity. What we are saying is that this inquiry has all the flavour of a little sweeping under the rug operation conducted by one public servant into the activities of other public servants. It certainly does not have the quality of being an independent, outside inquiry. It is not seen by the public as having that character and it is certainly not seen by people in the Bureau of Customs as having that character. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Government that only a year ago or so there was an inquiry into the Bureau of Customs conducted by a Mr Willett, a senior public servant, and a Mr McGonical. That inquiry, which was instigated by the Government as a result of the publication of a document known as the McShane report dealing with the unsatisfactory situation of the bond stores administered by the Bureau of Customs and conducted by Mr Willett and Mr McGonical, investigated the Bureau and recommended very considerable changes, particularly to the industrial relations system of the Bureau. The consequence of that inquiry and its report was that really very little happened apart from the removal of a few people in the bureaucracy of the Customs Bureau from Sydney to Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> That inquiry had very similar terms of reference to those for the inquiry which is now proposed by the Government. If nothing was done as a result of that inquiry, what confidence have we that anything will be done as a result of this inquiry? If that inquiry was thorough and effective in terms of the administration of the Bureau of Customs, why have there been all the complaints since that inquiry reported? Indeed, why were Mr MacKellar and Mr Moore caught up in this incident which has led to the suggestion of a new inquiry by the Government? If that inquiry had been successful in the report and recommendations which it made, if it had been successful in the sense that those recommendations were carried out and the efficiency, effectiveness and morale of the Bureau of Customs were improved as a result, why did this whole shabby incident occur and why is there a need for yet another inquiry at this point? As I would put it, we have very grave reasons for concern about the proposal which has now been brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Two things have been associated with this debate since the issue was debated in the Senate a week ago. A week ago the Opposition was asking for the publication of all documents relating to this matter. We were given a green book of documents a week ago or so and we were told that they were the documents relevant to this matter. Since that time, as a result of information that has come to hand, further documents have been prised like limpets off the rocks from this most reluctant Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Martyr's preference is for oysters. They were prised like oysters off a rock from this most reluctant Government. It is reluctant to publish the documents. The situation was, of course, well illustrated by the cartoonists who saw this Government's attitude to full disclosure as a long saga of documents being produced one after the other, day by day, as they were pressed for and the result of that pressing was the presentation of various documents from time to time. Some more documents have now been made available to the Senate. In a minute I want to comment briefly about those documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, I will digress for one minute to deal with an issue which came up before the suspension of the sitting for dinner in relation to the payment of duty on the television set which Mr MacKellar brought into this country in October last year. There was an exchange in the Senate between me and Senator Sir John Carrick relating to this matter. By way of interjection the question was asked whether Mr MacKellar, having paid the penalty over this matter, had also paid the duty. We were informed that he had paid the duty. I do not know whether that is correct. I understand from a consideration of the Customs Act and regulations that duty is payable on goods only at the point of entry and that a penalty is payable in respect of non-payment of duty only at the point of entry. If an offence is detected subsequent to the point of entry, I understand that ordinary procedures apply under the Act and the regulations and the offending person is proceeded against by way of summons. I raise that question only in the context of asking whether the procedures have been applied properly in this case. That is an important matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Siddons shares my interpretation of what the correct position is. It is important in the context of this issue as it has been raised in the Parliament to consider whether the proper procedures have now been applied or whether there has been again an attempt to sweep that issue under the carpet and evade the proper procedures. I want to make some brief comment about the tabling of the documents. As I said earlier, we were assured on two occasions last week that all the material relating to this matter had been tabled. An unusual incident took place earlier. It involved the Parliamentary Liaison Officer rushing busily into the office of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, Mr Hayden, and taking back a file which he had given to Mr Hayden's private secretary. It was returned to the Leader of the Opposition some time later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been asserted by Opposition spokesmen that there are more documents-and there are. It is interesting to note that, even at this stage, there are no copies of the important memorandum from Mr Besley, the former director, to Mr Cunningham, but only a transcript of the shorthand notes taken by Mr Besley's secretary. This transcript in itself raises further issues because it simply records what was said by the former Minister to Mr Besley. Many questions arise in relation to that matter. They are questions which, I might add, could lead to the conclusion that Mr Moore, the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, was perhaps wrongly pressed into a resignation which would not have occurred if those questions had been properly revealed. Those matters ought to be known because, if the former Minister was wrongly pressed into resignation, it is the task of this sort of inquiry to exonerate him, if 'exonerate' is the appropriate word to use. That is why, as I said earlier, the Opposition has always called for a full judicial public inquiry in which all the facts will be revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> The questions arising from the television incident which remain unanswered are as follows: What is the meaning of the memorandum in relation to the former Minister, Mr Moore? Was there a conspiracy in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to cover up the whole matter? If so, did that conspiracy involve senior officers of the Department or was it encouraged by other Ministers? Further, what other documents are yet to be brought to light? The Opposition argues that only a judicial inquiry or a royal commision can bring out the truth in relation to these matters to the satisfaction of the public. A departmental inquiry or an inquiry involving public servants is no guarantee of satisfaction. The failure of the Department is evidenced by the fact that this is the third set of documents to be tabled. On each of the occasions when documents have been tabled in relation to this matter, they have been accompanied by an assurance that there are no more relevant documents and on each of those three ocasions there have turned out to be more relevant documents . </PARA>
<PARA> That serious situation, involving as it has the resignations of two Ministers over what in itself was a trivial issue, more importantly involves a question which goes to the entire integrity of the Public Service and of the Bureau of Customs. I refer to the allegation that a relatively junior officer in the Bureau was stood over by a senior officer for doing his duty and carrying out the instructions which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said would be applicable to every citizen, including himself I presume. An officer who was responsible for carrying out those instructions was told, effectively-if I may lapse into a colloquialism-to pull his head in, because what he was doing was not the way to get on in the Australian Public Service. That is the most serious allegation of all, because it goes to the question of the integrity of the Public Service, the integrity of government and the confidence which a member of the Public Service can have in the notion-sadly, it is perhaps becoming old- fashioned-that people should do a good job according to the standards which are appropriate and which should apply to the concept of Public Service. It is in that context that the issue is immensely serious. How does the Government respond to all of this a week later, after the MacKellar-Moore affair has perhaps retreated somewhat from the highly political psyches of the senior Ministers in this Government and has become less colourful and perhaps more black and white? It sets up this Mickey Mouse inquiry into the Bureau of Customs . </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer briefly to the terms of reference. These are the matters to which, according to the Fraser Government, the inquiry is to have particular regard, arising from this most serious incident which involves the fate of two Ministers and the morale of an important section of the Public Service and which may or ought to involve the fate of some very senior officers in the bureaucracy. The Government's response is that the particular matters to be considered are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) clearance of incoming passengers and of the unaccompanied baggage of incoming passengers and of incoming cargo at the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the relations between management, staff and staff associations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the need to ensure the efficient and impartial application of Customs procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry is confined to New South Wales. It is directed specifically to the area of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The inquiry is not bound to report to this Parliament or anywhere else by any particular date. It is to be conducted by a public servant inquiring into the activities of other public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not an inquiry which, like Caesar's wife, is above suspicion or ought to be above suspicion. The very strong suspicion is that all this inquiry involves- having regard to the sad history of the Customs Bureau and the numerous inquiries which have apparently not been successful-is a Mickey Mouse exercise to sweep this issue under the carpet until the next election. I suppose that no date has been set by which the inquiry must report because it has not yet been decided when the next election will be held. That is the obvious reason for not setting a date by which the inquiry has to report so that this Parliament can debate this issue again with the advantage of the recommendations of the inquiry . </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, it is in that context that the Opposition has insisted from the beginning and insisted again that this inquiry have a judicial quality about it, a quite independent quality from that which it will have under the chairmanship of Mr Mahony, a public servant, however worthy a gentleman he may be. It is for that reason that before the suspension of the sitting I moved an amendment insisting that the terms of reference of any such inquiry embrace the effectiveness of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, which escapes unscathed from this proposed inquiry. I moved that the inquiry should examine:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The effectiveness of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in the performance of its functions under the Customs Act 1901;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the handling of complaints within the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and in particular the Bureau of Customs;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) industrial relations between the management, staff and staff associations, and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) any changes necessary in arrangements or procedures within the Department and the Customs Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA>We seek to give that review-that inquiry-the status, powers and privileges of a royal commission and to require it to report by November 1982. In a Parliament where we are still talking about freedom of information-nothing much is happening, I might say-what is wrong with that? What is wrong with having an inquiry of that kind? Why should those issues not be examined? I tell the Senate now that officers of the Bureau of Customs and some members of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs will have no confidence in this internal inquiry which the Government proposes. They will have no confidence in it because the certain promise for them is that if and when this inquiry reports-they have given evidence to it and have been involved in its deliberations-the experience of Mr Mayhew, called 'Mr Mayhem' by the cartoonists because of his allegations, might well be repeated. What confidence can they have that officers who allegedly disciplined Mr Mayhew for doing his duty will not in turn discipline them for giving evidence to this inquiry or for being involved in it and making recommendations regarding the procedures and work of the Bureau of Customs? What confidence can they have in view of the record of the Bureau of Customs, having regard to the numerous inquiries to which it has been subject? They can have no confidence at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The result is, as I said, a Mickey Mouse thing which is designed to sweep this important issue under the table, get rid of it all for the next election, make sure any inquiry does not report until after the next election, not put any deadline on it so that the whole issue will be dead and buried and the Ministers in question will be able to be returned happily to the Government in due course, if that be the case. The whole thing will be forgotten as other incidents in the shoddy record of this Government have been allowed to be forgotten, and about which we will consistently be reminding the Australian people in order that right from the top of the administration in this country, through bodies such as the Bureau of Customs and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, people can have confidence in the procedures which are being adopted and in the standards which are applicable and certainty that in the future the recommendations of any inquiry will be adopted and will be for the benefit of all those involved in this important area of public service. I commend the amendment to the Senate. I think it is most important that the Senate, as a House of review, adopt a proper and responsible approach on this issue and not be subject to the whims of an Executive concerned only to sweep this matter under the carpet and escape the justice of the people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome politicians being true to their colours but Senator Button started off by trying to present himself in a statesmanlike role and then spent most of his speech in presenting his true form. Senator Button was at great pains to inform the Senate and all those listening to this debate tonight that he did not want to conduct any witch hunt whatever into the role of the Ministers who have resigned. He had to do that because he realises that there is a very wide sense of fair play in the Australian electorate and the Australian character. It is recognised widely in this community that the two Ministers, Messrs MacKellar and Moore, have paid a heavy price, have accepted their responsibilities and have resigned. Senator Button knows perfectly well that there is no political mileage whatever in pursuing the matter in a direct way but he has sought in this debate to pursue it in an indirect way. That is why I say that he has engaged in a truly cynical political exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last week Senator Button introduced terms of reference for an inquiry, most of which would have been, if adopted, clearly an inquisition into the role of the Ministers and the circumstances surrounding the importance of a colour television set by Mr MacKellar. This afternoon he withdrew that motion and introduced an amendment setting out the terms of reference for an inquiry which would be, if adopted-as is the inquiry under the Government's proposed terms of reference- an inquiry into the administration of the affairs of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. In the course of Senator Button's speech this evening he has not addressed himself to the details of his own proposal. Much less has he endeavoured to compare his proposal with that of the Government. He has processed with a speech about cover-ups, conspiracies, intimidation of public servants and sweeping matters under the carpet. None of the trigger and motor phrases that he has been using has relevance to the issues that are before the Senate in the debate this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am. I do not mind admitting that I might be making a political speech in this chamber. I do not object to Senator Button's making one . It is when he tries to dress it up in another colour that I object. I will come back to what this debate ought to be about. The Government has not decided to set up an inquiry into the actual facts and circumstances of the importation of the now famous colour television set by Mr MacKellar. It has decided, as has the Opposition, although one would not believe it from Senator Button's speech, that no useful purpose whatever would be served by pursuing the facts and circumstances of the MacKellar importation. The Ministers concerned have accepted their responsibilities and have paid the heavy price of resignation. The Government has decided to set up an inquiry into certain administrative aspects of the Customs Bureau and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs with a view to investigating the administration and procedures of industrial relations in that Department and recommending whether any changes should be effected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment that the Opposition has moved proposes an inquiry into the effectiveness of the Department in its performance under the Customs Act, the handling of complaints within the Department, in particular the Bureau of Customs, and any questions affecting relations between management and staff. In the broad approach to the inquiry which is to be undertaken there is no difference in principle whatever between the terms of reference which the Government has announced and the approach that is recommended in the amendment by the Opposition. There is some difference in detail which I will deal with in a minute but there is no difference in principle between the approaches despite the speech by Senator Button to which honourable senators have just listened. I think it would be as well if honourable senators, in considering this amendment this evening, discounted almost the whole of what Senator Button has been saying because it has been directed to a different sort of inquiry altogether which the opposition proposed a week ago, which proposal it withdrew earlier today substituting the amendment which is at present before us in this debate. So much for the bona fides of the Opposition in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> There are really only two significant differences between the proposal of the Opposition and that of the Government. Firstly, the Opposition has suggested this evening in its amendment that the inquiry should be concerned with the effectiveness of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, operating under the Customs Act, in a general way, that is, throughout the whole of the Customs administration in Australia; whereas the Government's terms of reference for the inquiry which it set up are in regard to the control and clearance of goods under the Customs Act in New South Wales with particular regard to the clearance of passengers, goods and cargo at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. It is not limited by any means simply to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, as one might understand had one been listening carefully to Senator Button. It is not confined to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport at all, as he said. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly confined to the role of the Customs Bureau in New South Wales. The reason for that is that the Government is anxious that this problem, which has existed in the administration in New South Wales for a very long time, should be the focus of this inquiry. The problems that have been of concern for some time have been centred in New South Wales and, in particular, at Sydney ( Kingsford-Smith) Airport. They have not been in other parts of Australia. They have been centred there, and that is why this inquiry is focused on that subject . Senator Button says that he does not want an inquiry that will be swept under the carpet-I think that was his phrase-until after the next election. He wants an inquiry which will be able to report in a reasonable time. So does the Government. That is why the Government is trying to give the inquiry a reasonable area of investigation, an area where there are and have been problems for a long time, so that it will be a manageable inquiry which will be able to report in a reasonable time. That is one difference between the proposal of the Opposition and that of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Other aspects that the Opposition suggests should be dealt with, such as the handling of complaints and industrial relations, are all matters that are clearly comprehended within the terms of reference of the Government's inquiry. The question of reporting, the proposing of changes and so on are clearly dealt with in the Government's proposals. In fact, the Opposition's amendment adopts exactly the same phraseology as that of the Government, which asks the inquiry to take account of such reports, developments, events and other circumstances as may be considered necessary and relevant to the inquiry and to make its report. Senator Button's speech was about conspiracies and about a specific investigation of alleged interference with a public servant. Those matters are not specifically dealt with in the Opposition's proposed terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> The other difference between the Government's form of inquiry and that of the Opposition is that the Opposition wants the inquiry to have the powers, status and privileges of a royal commission. The Opposition does not criticise-indeed, it would not in any way reflect upon-the integrity, the status and the ability of Mr Frank Mahony, who has been selected by the Government to undertake the inquiry. The inquiry is into administration, into procedures and into general matters of that kind. It is designed to have a different approach altogether from that of a normal judicial inquiry, which would be normal in the case of a royal commission set up with the full powers and privileges referred to by the Opposition. It would be conducted in a remote judicial manner assisted by counsel. People who appeared before it would want to be represented by counsel. It would be conducted with the full and formal forms of a judicial inquiry. That is not what the Government sees as necessary here at all. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government sees as necessary here is a review by a man of independence and integrity, which everybody agrees Mr Mahony is; a man of experience with the Public Service but independent of the Public Service, which Mr Mahony is; and a man who has the ability to act as a trouble shooter, to get down to the work place at the shop floor level, to talk to people and to find out what the problems are. That is the sort of inquiry that the Government wants. It does not want a remote judicial exercise with lawyers having a field day, which is what the Opposition wants. It wants an inquiry that will be conducted efficiently, informally and with expedition. That is a role that we believe Mr Mahony can perform perfectly well. We have every confidence that he can perform without being given, as the Opposition says, status, powers and privileges. Privileges- that is what the Opposition wants; it wants the inquiry to have the privileges of some sort of royal commission. There will be no lack of people who want to come before Mr Mahony and tell him what the problems are as they see them. Mr Mahony is a man perfectly capable of lending a very sympathetic and understanding ear to people with complaints; and that is what is required. It is not necessary to haul people up before him and have them cross-examined. It is an inquiry into administration, procedures and industrial relations. A great, formal judicial inquiry is not the way in which an investigation of that kind is desirably conducted. Those are the only differences between the Opposition and the Government in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate can discount, as I have said, almost every point of criticism that Senator Button made on the Government's inquiry because they were made in relation to a proposal that the Opposition made a week ago and has now withdrawn . Senator Button did not address himself in any way at all to his own amendment and to the terms for the alternative inquiry proposed by the Opposition in this amendment. For all those reasons I believe that the Government's inquiry will be effective and efficient. It will have the opportunity of reporting at a reasonably early date. In fact, we do not want Mr Mahony to prolong the inquiry unduly but hope that he will be able to report within a reasonable time. The amendment proposes alternative terms of reference which, as I have said, are not really different in any substance from the terms of reference of the Government' s inquiry. Nevertheless, there would be differences which I do not think are justified, which the Government does not believe are necessary and which, I trust, the Senate will reject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) used a tactic frequently used by people in this place when trying to justify an unjustifiable case; that of setting up straw men and then knocking them down. He made a particular play during his speech of the fact that Mr Frank Mahony is an honourable man and that therefore no one here should criticise him. We in the Opposition agree that Mr Mahony is an honourable and skilful man. We do not criticise him; we criticise the Government for setting up this sort of inquiry. Senator Durack made the point towards the end of his speech that the Government sees as necessary a manageable inquiry which reports in a reasonable time. He objects to the motion put forward by Senator Button tonight because, amongst other reasons, the motion would provide for an inquiry to have the status, power and-he emphasised it-privileges of a royal commission. I will deal with those matters first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, it is quite clear that the Government wants a manageable inquiry. Senator Durack, in criticising the Opposition's motion, made a great point of the fact that Senator Button and the Opposition changed the terms of reference for the inquiry that we asked to be established a week ago. We did change the terms of reference, and we did so for the simple reason that the whole ball game changed in the last week. A week ago, when we sought an inquiry, the main difficulty seen in this Parliament was the attempt to cover up what happened to two Ministers. As Senator Sir John Carrick quite rightly points out, those two Ministers resigned, but arising out of those two Ministers' resignations we have the papers which were produced in this green folder, papers which were produced a day later and the papers which were produced after that, despite, as Senator Button said, each time there being protestations that there were no more papers to be brought out. These documents that have been tabled have demonstrated an attempt at cover-up in the Bureau of Customs in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. There was an attempt to stand over and suppress an officer of that Department, Mr Mayhew, who insisted on performing his duty as he saw that duty should be performed. Obviously, things were not well in the Department, and they were not well in the Department as far as Customs were concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> An inquiry into what happens at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in regard to incoming passengers and incoming cargo is certainly a manageable inquiry. It is a manageable inquiry as far as the Government is concerned; it is not a manageable inquiry as far as this country is concerned and as far as the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs is concerned in relation to its administration of the Customs Act because what happens at Sydney may well happen at Melbourne, Hobart, Perth, Darwin and every other port through which international traffic flows. To try to focus this inquiry on what happens at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, because the original embarrassing incident happened at Kingsford-Smith Airport, is not satisfactory to the people of this country, to the officers who have to deal with the Customs Act in this country, or, I believe, to this Parliament. Senator Durack said that the inquiry should be not only a manageable inquiry but also should report in a reasonable time. Yet nothing in his terms of reference suggests when that report should come forward or what is a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA> We asked for a judicial inquiry with the powers of a royal commission and, as Senator Button's amendment states, with the privileges of a royal commission, not to give the royal commissioner privileges but to give those people who may give evidence to this inquiry the protection they need. Who can deny that they need that protection when one reads the documents tabled in this place on 20 April, which give a clear documentation of what happened to Mr Tony Mayhew, who tried to pursue his duties, who tried to carry through the duties given to him as a Customs officer and who was obstructed at every stage by senior officers of the Department and, I suggest, at one stage by the Minister? We then had the allegation in this place that there were in fact further documents, and we asked that those documents be produced. The only document of significance which was produced was a report by a senior officer of the Bureau of Customs. Almost the whole of the page and a half of that report denigrates Mr Bennett and Mr Spanswick, who were Customs employees and officers of their staff association and who were attempting to represent Mr Mayhew and their association's members in that Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole of that document, without any supporting evidence, was an attempt to denigrate those two officers. If Mr Mayhew, who tried to carry out his duty, and if the officers of the Customs Officers Association of Australia, who tried to put his case, were subject to that sort of obstruction and that sort of denigration, what else can happen in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs as far as it affects its administration of the Customs Act? What else, we may ask, can be happening throughout the rest of Australia, not only at Kingsford-Smith Airport? If we establish an inquiry by a senior public servant- no matter what Senator Durack may call him-and an honourable man, which inquiry does not have the status, the powers and the privileges of a royal commission, what confidence can people such as Mr Mayhew, Mr Spanswick and Mr Bennett have if they come to give evidence to it? What protection do they have now or will they have in the future if they come along and tell what is going on in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs?</PARA>
<PARA> Why should we set up this second rate inquiry which provides no protection for witnesses and which has very limited terms of reference? Why should we as a Parliament be satisfied with that sort of inquiry when obviously what has gone on has been a serious attempt to cover up what initially may have been considered by some people to be a fairly trivial incident? I suggest that what is wrong with the inquiry which the Government is attempting to set up is in fact that it is not seen to be sufficiently independent. Despite what Senator Durack says, that is not a reflection on Mr Mahony. It is not seen to be sufficiently independent, first of all, because of Mr Mahony's history in the Public Service and, secondly, because of the obvious limitations on the nature of the inquiry he can conduct because he and witnesses do not have the protection that they would have in a judicial inquiry. We believe the inquiry is too narrow in its application because it deals specifically with the clearance of incoming passengers, the unaccompanied baggage of incoming passengers and incoming cargo at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. If Senator Durack means that the inquiry should be Australia-wide, why the particular reference to Sydney ( Kingsford-Smith) Airport?</PARA>
<PARA> It deals specifically with the relations between management, staff and staff associations. We know the management is not good at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Why should that not be extended to other areas? It refers to the need to ensure the efficient and impartial application of Customs procedures. We know quite clearly from the evidence contained in the green document tabled on 20 April that there was not an efficient and impartial application of Customs procedures at Sydney. Why should not we look at the situation in the whole of the country? Why should not we do so with the protection that is normally afforded to a judicial inquiry?</PARA>
<PARA> We suggest that the inquiry cannot and will not get at the deep sense of dissatisfaction which is apparent in the Department as far as the Bureau of Customs is concerned and which is apparent in the documents which were tabled on 20 April and in the document which was produced by Mr Kennedy and tabled. The inquiry cannot get at that deep dissatisfaction which obviously exists, for the people who give evidence to that inquiry cannot consider that they are protected when they give that evidence. There is no quarantee that they will be given that protection in the sort of inquiry that the Government suggests. </PARA>
<PARA> We suggest that the inquiry is not fair and cannot be seen to to be fair to Customs officers such as Mr Mayhew who quite clearly are under threat, as Mr Mayhew was under threat, if they insist on carrying out their duties and if part of those duties involves the giving of evidence to this inquiry and, again, they do not have the normal protection that people have in giving evidence to inquiries of this type. It is very hard to see how union representatives such as Mr Bennett and Mr Spanswick should have confidence in such an inquiry if they are not protected from being publicly maligned-as they were in a document before this Senate; a document which became privileged-if they give evidence to this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button has moved an amendment tonight to the terms of reference of the inquiry into Customs administration. He has moved it specifically because there needs to be an inquiry which is independent and is seen to be independent. There are serious questions as to what is happening in the whole of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, particularly as it affects the administration of the Customs Act. If the inquiry that the Government proposes goes forward it needs to look particularly at the changes which are necessary and which, of necessity, will affect a senior officer of the Department who can have a severe effect on the careers of junior officers in the Department. We suggest that the only way to do this is to set up a judicial inquiry with, as Senator Button suggested, the status, powers and privileges of a royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA> This affair has gone far beyond the problems which were faced by two Ministers who have lost their portfolios. This affair goes to the very real conditions of work of members of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs who are administering Customs matters in this country. It goes to the very real conduct of industrial relations in this Department. It goes also to the relationships between senior and junior officers in this Department. I submit that one cannot do this in a fair way without setting up the sort of independent inquiry that Senator Button has suggested. It is no good saying that the inquiry that he has suggested tonight is different from the one that he suggested a week ago. Of course it is different from the one that he suggested a week ago. It is different because in that week we have had tabled in this place papers which have demonstrated that there is deep malaise in that Department. It is a terribly important Department. It is a Department which protects the frontiers of this country. It is a Department which is involved not only in the importation of colour television sets and black and white television sets but also in the importation of drugs and all sorts of other materials which could be of great detriment to the well-being of citizens of this country. For that reason we, as a Parliament, must make sure that that Department is working efficiently and that officers can carry out their duties without fear of the sorts of problems which faced Mr Mayhew, without fear of being stood over if they insist that what they saw and what they did was right. We can do this only through a judicial inquiry. Therefore, I firmly support the amendment moved by Senator Button and urge every other honourable senator to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening the Senate is debating some statements relating to the so-called colour television set affair and papers about it tabled in the Senate by the Leader of the Government, Senator Sir John Carrick. I do not intend to debate the amendment moved by the Opposition for a very particular type of inquiry. My concern in entering this debate is that I believe, in view of papers tabled yesterday in the House of Representatives and today in the Senate, it appears in retrospect that a manifest injustice may have been done to Mr Moore, the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. My concern in this matter is heightened by a debate which took place yesterday in the House of Representatives and which was widely reported in the Press-a debate on a motion by the honourable member for Port Adelaide, Mr Mick Young. I quote just briefly from that debate. Mr Young said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But what happened to Mr Garland?</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to Mr Vic Garland, as he then was-</PARA>
<PARA> We are all aware of his appearance in the court and of the findings against him . </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that Mr Garland had some charges laid against him, appeared in court and was found innocent. It appears that, in matters relating to allegations against Ministers or members of parliament, it is not a case of innocent until proven guilty; it is a case of guilty even after being found innocent in the courts. There is no doubt at all that the request to resign that was made to Mr MacKellar and Mr Moore will have an abiding effect on their reputations and careers. I emphasise at this stage that because I will basically confine my comments to Mr Moore and the position that he appears to be in does not mean that I think Mr MacKellar deserves condemnation. But the papers tabled today in the Senate and yesterday in the House of Representatives cast a very particularly light on the position of Mr Moore as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs and actions that he took or did not take and why he took them or did not take them. </PARA>
<PARA> The first lot of documents is contained in a little green covered booklet. If one wades through them one will see many things have been repeated. I want to pass through these documents just to show the sort of confusion that apparently existed in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs about the matter of Mr MacKellar's television set. I think there is nothing in the documents to suggest that there was a cover-up within the Department. I think a journalist from the Brisbane Courier-Mail, Mr Wallace Brown, phrased it better in an article that he wrote on the documents last Saturday when he referred to 'a bureaucratic gap'. There is a gap in the documents. That does not mean that documents are missing. I think the gap is that certain statements were made and assumptions followed from them, people acted in good faith in the belief that they were acting on good advice and the situation was compounded over and again, particularly as it related to Mr Mayhew and his allegations that the Minister had brought in a colour television set and had not paid duty on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The first document to which I wish to refer is a minute paper dated 5 October 1981-the day that Mr MacKellar arrived back in this country, from overseas. The minute was written by Mr Pattison, the officer who shepherded Mr MacKellar through Customs. I refer to the last paragraph of his report where he says:</PARA>
<PARA> After making an endorsement on the Customs and Quarantine Passenger statement, I ascertained that the Marshal involved was Senior Preventive Officer T. Mayhew who told me that the Minister was in possession of an undeclared colour T.V. set . </PARA>
<PARA>Mayhew was the officer who made a notation to the effect that some examination ought to be made of Mr MacKellar's baggage and who subsequently became upset because Mr MacKellar had passed through Customs with a colour television set. It appears that the report made on the first day of the offence is the first information that came to Mr Pattison that the Minister was carrying a colour television set. In a minute of 13 October 1981, Mr Kelly, who I assume is a Collector of Customs, makes a report headed 'Clearance of Mr M. J. R. MacKellar, Minister for Health' to the Assistant Collector. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> 2. It is noted that Senior Preventive Officer A. Mayhew is of the view that Mr. MacKellar was in possesion of an undeclared colour television set. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Preventive Officer Woodley, a South Australian officer who was on attachment to Sydney Airport at the time, has been contacted about his recall of the matter . He advised that he commenced to process Mr. MacKellar's baggage prior to the Supervising Preventive Officer's intervention-</PARA>
<PARA>That is Pattison-</PARA>
<PARA>and noticed that Mr. MacKellar was in possession of an unboxed combination unit which included a television screen. On the basis of similar units that he had encountered in the past, he-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Mr Woodley-</PARA>
<PARA>presumed the television to be a black and white one. The examination did not proceed to finality on account of the Supervising Preventive Officer's instructions. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Checks have also been made with Mr. MacKellar, and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has confirmed that Mr. MacKellar was in possession of a radio/cassette/black and white television combination unit when he arrived on 5 October. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the first statement in writing in which Mr Moore suggested that the television set was black and white. I will return to where that suggestion appears to have originated but I mention it now because I am attempting to trace through the attempts Mr Mayhew and later, I think, Mr Bennett made to bring to the attention of officers the fact that Mr MacKellar had carried a colour television set and the basis on which those officers looked at those claims and apparently disputed or rejected them. They believed, as stated in Mr Kelly's letter of 13 October, that Mr Moore had confirmed that the television set was black and white. Subsequently it appears that Mr Moore did nothing of the sort; that there was a misunderstanding. </PARA>
<PARA> The next document-closest in date to this, on the same date-is one which was tabled in this chamber yesterday. I think it is a document that makes a critical difference to the case that can be made or was made against Mr Moore. It was a minute from Mr Besley, the then Secretary of the Department, to Deputy Secretary Mr Montgomery-two gentlemen who seem to have had all the conversations with one another on the subject-Headed 'Mr MacKellar's Recent Arrival in Sydney'. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>That is Mr Moore-</PARA>
<PARA>phoned me-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Besley-</PARA>
<PARA>last night. I told him that we had checked it out and that the equipment brought in by his Ministerial colleague was not dutiable. </PARA>
<PARA>On 12 October, according to Mr Besley, Mr Moore was told 'per telephone' that the matter had been checked out and the equipment brought in by Mr MacKellar was not dutiable. That is specific advice that was given to the Minister and that is advice that he apparently acted on from there on. I will return to that matter later. </PARA>
<PARA> The next document that mentions any of these matters is a minute of 19 October to the Collector of Customs from Mr Drury, Senior Assistant Collector, in which he refers to an approach from a Mr Bennett, who I understand is an executive officer with the Customs Officers Association. Mr Bennett attempted to pursue Mayhew's allegations regarding the television set and is mentioned frequently in the minutes. Converservations with him are mentioned frequently by various officers. The minute states that Mr Bennett was attempting to establish what progress had been made in respect of the importation of what Bennett described as 'an undeclared colour TV set'. Mr Bennett was then asked for an explanation of what he thought the offence was and part of that explanation, according to this summary, apparently was that Mr M. J. MacKellar, Minister for Health had imported a colour TV set which he had not declared. </PARA>
<PARA> Further on it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 3. I told Mr Bennett that both you and I were aware of certain matters involving the clearance of Mr MacKellar through Customs on 5 October 1981. On that basis I could neither agree with his assertion that Internal Affairs should have been asked to enquire, nor did I accept his claim that the Minister had in fact imported an undeclared colour T.V. set. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Bennett argued that in his opinion the latter point was not in dispute. I asked him to elaborate and he said that the Minister had told an officer that he had in his possession a colour T.V. set and that the Minister had informed the same officer that he had paid in excess of $350 for it. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no further evidence to suggest that Mr MacKellar made the statement about the value of the set being $350 and the matter is not pursued in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> The minute continues:</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Bennett then said that he wished to lay a formal complaint in his capacity as a Senior Preventive Officer, Grade I, in the following terms:-in clearing the effects of Mr M. J. MacKellar through Sydney ''an officer had not conducted himself correctly''. Bennett added that he expected feedback in respect of his complaint. </PARA>
<PARA>I hasten to add that that was not a complaint against Mr MacKellar but against the Customs officer who intervened and passed Mr MacKellar through Customs. The minute continues:</PARA>
<PARA> I informed Bennet that without acknowledging in any way the accuracy of his assertions I would report the complaint to you but whether an internal inquiry followed was not an immediate consequence. I asked Bennett if he agreed that the essential point in his complaint was whether the TV set in question was either colour or black and white. He said that he did and explained that he was anxious only that officers were left in no doubt as to whether V.I.P.'s were to receive special treatment or were to be dealt with equally under the law. </PARA>
<PARA>Following this information, Mr Drury interviewed Mr Mayhew. The minute goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Mayhew told Drury this morning the following:</PARA>
<PARA> when he intercepted the Minister on 5 October he asked what he had under his arm to which the Minister is alleged to have replied ''a colour TV set'';</PARA>
<PARA> he then asked the Minister had he read the declaration and claims the Minister said, ''No'';</PARA>
<PARA> at this point he directed the Minister to P. O. Woodley for examination which was soon after aborted by the intervention of Pattison;</PARA>
<PARA> he advised Woodley to make an entry in his official notebook;</PARA>
<PARA>That is Mayhew-</PARA>
<PARA> at no point did Mayhew discuss values with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> on account of the Mayhew/Woodley conversation, I phoned Woodley again-</PARA>
<PARA>Drury is continuing-</PARA>
<PARA> You will recall that I spoke to him last Monday, 12 October, at his home. Woodley agreed that Mayhew had suggested he make a notebook entry of the MacKellar incident. I asked Woodley to read it to me and the following is a fairly good paraphrase of what is recorded:</PARA>
<PARA> 'At 0730 hours I was handed a declaration from Mr Mackellar, Minister for Health. All boxes ticked ''No.'' Minister in possession of one combination colour T.V. set. Examination not proceeded with following instruction from Sup. P.O. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Woodley-perhaps recalling his earlier conversation with me-made the comment immediately he had read the notebook entry that the reference to ''colour'' was incorrect. He agreed that a week ago he had told me that he thought it had been a black and white unit. I then asked why he had written ''colour''. He claimed that he had been somewhat carried away with the events as they happened and probably had been swayed by Mayhew's claim that the unit had included a colour T .V. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. I then read to Woodley the third paragraph of your minute of 13 October and asked him to comment. Woodley described the account of events as you have outlined them as ''exactly correct''. He then repeated to me that his notebook entry was wrong and that he wished to change it. I told him that he should not alter his notebook and should not construe any conversation which I had held with him as suggesting such action. I added that I would report what he had told me. </PARA>
<PARA>There starts another area of confusion within the bureaucracy as to whether Woodley actually had a recollection at the time that the television set was colour or whether he had assumed it to be black and white. </PARA>
<PARA> The next document which is of some interest, is dated 23 October 1981. I am afraid that I will have to skip through some of these documents but I do want to show how I think there was a misunderstanding and how Mr Moore's views were incorrectly portrayed within the Bureau of Customs, which led to certain Customs officers believing that there might have been a cover up. I have here a minute to the Senior Assistant Collector (Services) from Mr Kelly regarding clearance of Mr M. J. R. MacKellar, Minister for Health. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> When the question of Mr MacKellar's clearance first came to attention, steps were taken to ascertain what he had imported. Mr MacKellar subsequently confirmed to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs that he was in possession of a radio/cassette/black and white television unit upon his arrival on 5 October. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, there is no evidence and the indications are that Mr MacKellar did not confirm that it was black and white, nor did he state it was colour. At that point, whether the television set was black and white or colour does not seem to have been the subject of much discussion between anyone. But an assumption was made that Mr Moore had inquired of Mr MacKellar; Mr MacKellar had confirmed. It was that assumption, that belief, that gets repeated over and over again in the minute papers, I believe, in totally good faith by the officers concerned that appears to condemn Mr Moore. The minute continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Against the background of Mr Bennett's complaint it could still be argued that there is a conflict between S. P. O. Mayhew's recollection of what Mr MacKellar apparently said to him and what Mr MacKellar subsequently advised to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The doubt is whether he did advise any such thing to the Minister. The minute continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Resolution of this situation could be achieved by seeking to have an officer view the unit which Mr MacKellar imported and any accompanying documentation to establish whether a black and white or colour television was involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not satisfied that action along these lines is required. Mr MacKellar as a Minister of the Crown, in response to a specific question put to him, has advised the Minister that the unit he imported included a black and white television set. There the matter should rest. </PARA>
<PARA>There was no specific question. There is no indication that there was a specific question. But senior Customs officers believed it and the belief grew. That is the bureaucratic gap that was referred to earlier. Other documents repeat and repeat these items: The matter of Mayhew and Bennett repeating the allegation, pressing for an inquiry as to whether the television set was black and white or colour; senior Customs officers repeating the statement that Mr MacKellar had assured Mr Moore that it was a black and white set and not a colour one; and so it goes on. There is a minute paper of 8 January to the Collector of Customs from Mr Williams, Acting Senior Assistant Collector, which contains that view. There is a minute from Mr Tuite of 25 January 1982, which states that an inquiry had been conducted at Ministerial level and that it had been conclusively established that the imported article was free of duty. There is a minute to the Senior Assistant Collector (Services) from Mr Kelly, again indicating that Bennett was pursuing his complaint. There is a minute paper from Mr Woodley in which he explains why he changed his notebook entry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> At the completion of my shift I finished the entry in the notebook and found that I had included the word colour, as this was not correct and I do not know if the set was colour or black and white I lined out the word colour. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, from all these papers, Mr Woodley became confused about whether it was a black and white or a colour television set and decided that he could not state one way or the other on the subject. There is another statement from Mr Woodley which is a minute paper to the Senior Assistant Collector (Services) giving a full outline of his version of the event. The next minute paper is one coming close to the time when the matter became a large public issue and the two Ministers in question had to resign. On 16 April 1982 a minute went to Mr Moore from the then and present Secretary to his Department, Mr Hayes, in which, in summarising the documents, he drew attention to paragraph 4 of the minute of 13 October 1981 from the Collector of Customs, New South Wales. Mr Hayes says:</PARA>
<PARA> Checks have also been made with Mr MacKellar, and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has confirmed that Mr MacKellar was in possession of a radio/ cassette black and white television combination unit when he arrived on 5 October. Such units are admissable under Bylaw free of duty as general concessions to arriving passengers. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> I have inquired of the Collector of Customs New South Wales as to the source of this advice. He has informed me today that the material quoted above was based on advice provided to him verbally by a previous Deputy Secretary of this Department (Mr Montgomery). Mr Montgomery has advised me that his information came from the then Secretary (Mr Besley). Mr Besley, in turn, has advised me that his advice had come from you. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, Mr Moore. Mr Hayes continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The remaining folios concern themselves mainly with expressions of dissatisfaction by the Customs Officers' Association about what had happened. Central to the Department's insistence that the case was closed was the advice that you had confirmed with Mr MacKellar that the television unit was a black and white unit and as such was admissable free of duty. </PARA>
<PARA>So it appears that the line of communication was from Mr Montgomery to Mr Besley to Mr Moore and then back down again and that all that communication was verbal. It was on the basis of those verbal communications on which we have now had a little more light shed that it was believed, in the lower ranks, that Mr Moore had investigated the matter. The next document of interest is one from Mr Besley , who is no longer Secretary to the Department, but who was at the time the incident happened. It is a letter to Mr Hayes, the current Secretary, in which he outlines the facts as he recalls them, of the incident involving Mr MacKellar 's arrival on 5 October 1981. I quote from parts of the letter. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> I was informed that Mr MacKellar had arrived that morning, that he had been delayed because of arrangements connected with the arrival that day of HRH the Duke of Edinburgh, that his Customs declaration had been filled in on his behalf and was not accurate in that it did not disclose that he was carrying a combination radio/cassette/television set. I was also informed that Mr MacKellar had been selected for baggage examination and that while this was in course a more senior Customs Officer had recognised Mr MacKellar and had directed that the examination cease and that he be passed through Customs. All of this information was conveyed to me by Deputy Secretary Montgomery. </PARA>
<PARA> I rang the Minister for BACA and said that I was concerned at the inadequate or possibly false declaration on a passenger statement by Mr MacKellar. I urged the Minister to ring Mr MacKellar and point out the problems which could be caused by such action. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the false declaration by Mr MacKellar. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> I suggested to the Minister that he might ask his colleague what kind of TV it was. At that stage I was not aware of a conversation which apparently took place between Mr MacKellar and a Customs Officer in which Mr MacKellar was said to have stated that the television part of the combination set was a colour television. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, the Minister called me back. He said he had stressed to Mr MacKellar the seriousness of making an inaccurate Passenger Statement and that Mr MacKellar had assured him that it would not occur again. The Minister then said he wished to regard that as the end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I then told Deputy Secretary Montgomery that I had spoken to the Minister who had in turn spoken to Mr MacKellar and then spoken again to me. I referred briefly to the Minister's counselling of Mr MacKellar on the need to accurately complete Passenger Entry forms and said the Minister regarded the matter as closed. Accordingly the Minister must regard the television as black and white and no duty is chargeable. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no indication that the subject of whether it was a black and white or a colour television set was ever discussed by Mr Moore and Mr MacKellar. Certainly the indication is that it was not raised again with Mr Besley when Mr Moore called him back. But he did not query it. He made an assumption that Mr Moore had discussed it with Mr MacKellar. It appears to be a false assumption. Mr Moore's Press statement of 17 April makes some reference to the fact that in his conversation with MacKellar he had emphasised his concern about the false declaration. Again, there is no indication of any pursuit of the fact of whether the television set was black and white or colour by Mr Moore. Apparently he did not, and Mr MacKellar did not raise the subject with him either. I quote briefly from that statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Moore said that subsequently he had decided that that should be the end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>That was after admonishing Mr MacKellar on the false declaration. The statement continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In coming to this decision Mr Moore said he had regard for the fact that Mr MacKellar had been cleared by the Supervising Preventive Officer exercising his judgement in the normal course of duty. </PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Moore made a judgment about whether the matter should be pursued on the basis of what apparently was the practice of a senior Customs officer. The next matter that happened after the conversation between Mr Moore and Mr MacKellar was, of course, Mr MacKellar's letter dated 13 October 1981. I do not know whether it is known when that letter was actually received by Mr Moore. It may have been on the same day. Again it just refers to a portable radio TV cassette appliance. Apparently neither Minister was aware that it was a matter of any significance, that there was a difference between a black and white set and a colour set. That really was the central issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Some criticism was made in the last few days of the fact that Mr Moore did not act on that letter. In fact we now have the information in papers tabled yesterday in the House of Representatives and in papers tabled today in the Senate that on the day before Mr MacKellar had written his letter, the Minister had been advised by Mr Besley that the matter had been checked out. The Department said, in effect: 'We have checked it out'. His Department had checked it out and the equipment brought in by his ministerial colleague was not dutiable. I suggest to the Senate that Mr Moore's behaviour was entirely reasonable. I was distressed today to hear Senator Tate, a Labor senator from Tasmania, in debate on some Customs legislation, refer to a hypocritical connivance by Mr Moore and Mr MacKellar. That just is not so. The facts do not bear out any such allegation. I interjected in Senator Tate's speech and asked on what he based his allegation of a connivance. He replied: 'The documents that have been tabled in the Senate'. I challenge any honourable senator to indicate that any such thing at all occurred. The documents do not prove anything of the sort. Unfortunately, it is possible for Senator Tate to say that sort of thing and almost make it stick because that was a general belief when the documents were incomplete. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with that, Senator Georges. The new documents which were tabled in the House yesterday and here today indicate something very different. There are headlines and stories on the matter in the newspapers today. A story in the Australian carried the headline: 'Document suggests MacKellar did not have to pay duty.' There is a story in the Courier-Mail, under the headline: ' Office note may clear Moore'. The suggestion is that that statement by Besley turns it all around. I believe it does. I take the Government's word utterly that it has done an investigation and there are no indications of other documents. The Opposition makes an allegation that there are. If it can produce them, well and good but if it does not we have to assume there are no other documents that give any indication to the contrary. It is my firm belief that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) should reappoint Mr John Moore to the Ministry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been much speculation on ministerial re-shuffles. I certainly do not have any inside information on that. I urge the Prime Minister, as strongly as I can, to make it clear that, on the basis of the evidence available, John Moore did nothing wrong. He was in fact a capable, intelligent Minister who has served the Government and this country well. As I said at the beginning of my speech, it would be a grave injustice if a slur was left against his name such as could be the case in this matter when the evidence does not suggest that it is justified. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one final appeal. At the beginning of last week some newspaper editorials, on the basis of information they had available, demanded that Mr Moore and Mr MacKellar should resign. I had my own feelings about whether they had enough information, but not all newspaper editorials-I hasten to add-went so far. The Courier-Mail noted that Mr Fraser faced a difficult decision in the matter and did not specifically urge that the Ministers should either be sacked or that they should resign. I now urge the same newspaper editors, who had judged Mr Moore and Mr MacKellar guilty at the beginning of last week, to look at fresh evidence and decide whether their editorials should not indicate something to that effect in the next few days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Martin is in fact supporting the amendment that the Opposition has moved. She has outlined a case which is based on the further documents which have been tabled in the Senate which strongly support the proposition that there should be a full judicial inquiry. The person who has been appointed the head the inquiry should have full powers to investigate, to call witnesses and to have those witnesses protected in order to seek the fullest information possible. The matter now is far more serious than some breakdown of efficiency in the procedures within the Bureau of Customs. It appears clear from the documents tabled today that at least one of the Ministers may have been unjustly dealt with. He may have been unjustly dealt with because he was misinformed, deliberately or otherwise, by his Department to the point that he made no disclosures to the Parliament. In my view, he was misinformed. Whether this was deliberate or not needs to be determined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since I have been a member of this Parliament I have witnessed another instance where a Minister was misinformed, in that case by the head of his Department. He was lied to by the head of his Department.I knew that the head of the Department had lied because he had also lied to me. In spite of that, the Minister lost his position. It was a most unjust action on the part of the Prime Minister at the time. In that case the Minister had to bear the full brunt of the error of his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us put ministerial responsibility to one side for the moment. Ministerial responsibility surely does not mean that the Minister, no matter how well respected or how well he performs, should have to bear the brunt of misinformatiom from his Department. These documents which have suddenly appeared today seem to indicate that. I ask the Leader of the Government (Senator Sir John Carrick) who was party to that action which accepted the resignation of these Ministers whether he could explain to me how he came to the decision to accept those resignations when all the information was not before him. The information today negates much of the information given previously. It certainly puts Mr Moore in a better light, but it certainly does not put the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or the Cabinet in a very good light at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or the Cabinet; it has now reached the stage where the Prime Minister may again be in error. He has made a decision against one of his Ministers to the extreme disadvantage of that Minister. This has happened before ; it happened with Eric Robinson. The environment created by the Prime Minister may have even accelerated Eric Robinson's death. Senator Reg Withers, who now sits abandoned on the Government back benches, is there because of a decision of the Prime Minister-a most unfair one if I might say so. I have no brief for the Ministers of the Government. On that occasion, we were at war with Reg Withers every day in this place, but the decision of the Prime Minister on that occasion was a most unjust one. I do not doubt that the reasons we have the Australian Democrats here is because of the same attitude of the same Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am prepared to say that if the ballot of the parliamentary Liberal Party members were to have taken place after the resignations of these two Ministers were forced the result could have been quite different. It seems to me that the person who should resign, or should have resigned if ministerial responsibility is to be thrust home, is the Prime Minister himself. He ought to look very closely at these documents and at the position in which Mr Moore is now placed and should reconsider his decision. It seems to me that a grave injustice has been done here. If the Prime Minister had not been so precipitate Mr Moore might still be a Minister today. I outline another scenario: The whole thing is a hoax . The two resignations are a deliberate scheme. What will happen is that there will be a judicial inquiry and the Ministers will be exonerated because of some breakdown in communications within the Bureau of Customs. The Ministers possibly will be chastised as being bad boys and reappointed to the Minister and that is the reason why new Ministers have not been appointed. I do not think that is the case; possibly one could paint that scenario. It seems to me that somewhere the responsibility for the misleading of this Parliament should be sheeted home and it can only be sheeted home to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister should do the right thing; that is, he should reappoint Mr Moore as a Minister and resign himself. For too long we have had the intolerant and arrogant actions of this man imposed upon the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me get back to discussing the need for the judicial inquiry. The inquiry should be, as the Opposition intends it to be, a full judicial inquiry if for no other reason than to clear the name of Mr Moore. As far as Mr MacKellar is concerned I think he was trapped by the circumstances. I think that when Mr MacKellar was directed to an assessment point, if the supervisor had not interfered at that time and given that Customs clearance Mr MacKellar would have paid whatever penalty might have been imposed or he might even have surrendered the television set at that point. My belief is that that would have happened. But the supervisor on his own responsibility intervened and cleared Mr MacKellar through Customs. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, there was that document too. But even if the document were false there is time for recovery when a person gets to the point of the Customs check. The officer says: 'You go there for an assessment'. The person goes. Up to that point a person is still in a position of recovery-if I can put it that way. I think Mr MacKellar was at the point of recovery when the supervisor intervened and cleared him. He should have stood his ground at that stage. This is like someone giving one a right of way when it is not one's right of way. One has to jump up and down to force the person giving the right of way to take the right of way. What Mr MacKellar should have done at that stage was insist on not being cleared through Customs. But the supervisor cleared him. From that point a whole series of events and conversations occurred and a whole series of messages were exchanged which misled one Minister. That is why this inquiry is very important. It should be a judicial inquiry that gives Mr Mahony the powers that are necessary to bring before him whoever he wants brought before him. Those people should be able to speak clearly and fearlessly about what happened. The whole mess would then sort itself out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This should have been sorted out in the first place by the Prime Minister. He is too busy establishing his own credibility to the disadvantage of others. What occurred in this case does not happen in the National Party. Of course, the other extreme occurs in the National Party. We have a Prime Minister who will discard Minister after Minister in order to establish some false credibility. In this case, because of the documents that were tabled today, he again is at a loss. The Senate should insist that the Prime Minister and the Cabinet who imposed these penalties upon these two Ministers should reflect. I do not doubt that Mr MacKellar's position is as a result of an error. He was entrapped in a position which perhaps could justifiably lead to a resignation with that resignation being accepted. The same thing does not hold for Mr Moore. That should have been apparent some time ago. This situation should not have been suddenly made apparent as a result of these two extraordinary documents that we have before us today. One struggles through them wondering what sort of an organisation this is, what sort of place this Parliament is, what sort of a Ministry we have and what sort of a government we have, that dribble forth information in this way. Suddenly we find that the Parliament may have been at fault. The only way to recover from this fault is to support the amendment calling for a full judicial inquiry and to give to Mr Mahony the power that he needs to unravel this sorry mess. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) to the motion that the Senate take note of the papers and the statement. The point that I made on 21 April was that the most serious aspect of what has been going on in the so-called colour television set affair was the possible victimisation of a public servant who was engaged in carrying out his duties. The point of that allegation, of course, is that the law as set down by the Parliament must be observed by all citizens. The document put down yesterday by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) in the House of Representatives did not seem, upon reading it, to deal specifically with this issue. However, the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) tonight in his speech made specific reference to that problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking to the amendment. Senator Button also made reference in support of his amendment to that particular element, that is, the possible victimisation of a public servant and stated that it was the central and gravest issue of concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The choice is between supporting either the position taken by the Government in terms of the review of administration and procedures of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs or the proposal by Senator Button for a royal commission into the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. In order for us to be able to choose between those proposals I think we really rely very heavily on a speech that was made tonight by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Senator Sir John Carrick made specific reference to that particular item and gave unequivocal assurances that the terms of reference as set down in the Government's inquiry would be able to take that into account. Since the Senate does not have the power to establish a royal commission and since the only inquiry will be that which the Government has proposed, it would seem acceptable that the Government's proposition be supported, particularly in view of the very strong assurances given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other items that Senator Button raised in support of his amendment, I think , have bearing and are of concern; that is, the lack of a closing date in the terms of reference provided by the Government for the review of Customs administration and also-although this is referred to in the speech by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs which was incorporated-the lack of a reporting mechanism to this Parliament. I quote from the statement which was incorporated. The report of the inquiry will be:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in a form that may be made public subject, of course, to any particular part that should be treated confidently. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a drawback to the Government's proposition. Nevertheless, four Australian Democrats will be supporting the Government's position. This is based on the assurances given in the Senate tonight by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Senator Siddons will be taking a different view and will be speaking later in the debate in relation to that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved so ably by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button). From the debate that has ensued on this matter one can see how correct the Opposition is in suggesting that there needs to be a full and public judicial inquiry into the Bureau of Customs and all of the circumstances that surrounded the crisis which hit the Government just 10 days ago. I remind the Senate that the reluctance of the Government to extend the terms of reference and to accept that there is a need for a thorough review of the activities of the Bureau of Customs is in line with the Government's attitude with respect to previous inquiries and royal commissions. The Fraser Government's attitude now is synonymous with the attitude it has had since it came to office in 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of royal commissions and public inquiries have been conducted. With only one or two exceptions, they have shown that there has been a reluctance on the part of the Government to have a full and proper inquiry into the matters that required the establishment of either a royal commission or a public inquiry . There is no exception in respect of this matter, as this debate this evening has shown. I am not as generous with respect to Mr Moore as the honourable senators from Queensland-Senators Martin and Georges -were in their contributions. The terms of reference state:</PARA>
<PARA> To review the administration and procedures of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in regard to the control and clearance of imported goods under the Customs Act in relation to New South Wales . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think the very fact that the Government has seen fit to make that part of the terms of reference is in itself an indictment of the way in which the operations of that Department were being conducted. Having regard to all that has been said about the Customs Bureau in the Parliament in recent years and to all the public statements that have been made by Customs officers and officials of their association, one would have thought that the Government would have been alerted to the sort of problem that obviously exists in the day to day administration. While there may have been some merit in the contributions of those two Queensland senators specifically about Mr Moore, the fact is that I see a dereliction of duty in respect of Mr Moore's inability to get his Department functioning properly, having regard to the published statements and comments that have been made in the Parliament since 1977 about the problems in the Customs area. </PARA>
<PARA> To endorse what I have to say I would have only to remind honourable senators about the establishment of the McGregor royal commission and the reluctance of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to extend properly the terms of reference in respect of that matter. I remind the Senate that the Prime Minister criticised the McGregor royal commission and refused to provide it with adequate terms of reference to inquire into the matter which is now known as the Withers affair. Because of the determination of the Opposition, two members of the Government in the other House and Mr Justice McGregor's own contribution in his letter of 12 May 1978 in which he said that if the Government wanted a more extensive inquiry it would have to extend the terms of reference, the Prime Minister was forced to extend those terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> Originally it appeared that Mr Eric Robinson was to be the casualty in that inquiry whereas, of course, when the terms of reference were extended and the inquiry carried out its task it was found that there had been an improper influence by Senator Withers in that matter which caused his removal from the office of Leader of the Government in the Senate. There were also, of course, the nefarious activities of Mr Coleman, the electoral officer in Queensland. Following the establishment of that commission there was the establishment of Mr Justice Williams's Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Arising from that was the establishment of the inquiry by Sir Robert Mark into the activities of the Australian Federal Police. Again there was the necessity for two inquiries to carry out the job that could have been done effectively by one inquiry if, in fact, there had been adequate and extensive terms of reference in relation to that issue, which brought about the amalgamation of the Australian Capital Territory Police and the Federal Police and a transfer of the activites of the Narcotics Bureau from the Customs Bureau to the jurisdiction of the Australian Federal Police. We have seen in more recent times, as a result again of public pressure both in the Parliament and outside it, the establishment of Mr Justice Stewart's royal commission into specific questions about the operations of Mr Asia and the drug scene in Australia. As a result of the determination of the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Hayden, and to a minor extent of myself, in the matter of the inability of Mr Justice Stewart's royal commission to carry out its proper function, the Government last week was forced to agree to extend the terms of reference to look into all the factors relating to Nugan Hand Ltd and the other matters related to drug running in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have had the spectacle of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator John Carrick, making an admission that, in fact, there has been extensive currency manipulation, laundering of money and criminality at the highest level in this country that require a further extension, I submit to the Senate, of the terms of reference so that a proper inquiry can be carried out. Again the Opposition finds itself unable to accept the Government's limitations in respect of the operations of the Customs Bureau and all the facts that relate to the resignations of Ministers Moore and MacKellar. We had the spectacle of an all-day meeting of the Cabinet last Monday week and the persuasiveness of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in convincing the Cabinet of the need for some propriety to be established in respect of the activities of those two Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of that, documents were tabled and debated in the Senate a week ago. Since then we have had two subsequent tablings of documents. That shows how incompetent this Government is and how incompetent its adviers are in respect of this whole sorry eopisode. One can only say that anything short of a judicial inquiry will fail to overcome the malaise that exists in the Customs Bureau. In the document that has been made available to us today we have a suggestion by the new Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr N. A. Brown , that Mr Mahony, the person proposed to conduct the inquiry, be given the responsibility to conduct public hearings in his own right. The document states that Mr Mahony may decide to hold public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> The work of the Government has been disrupted for a quite considerable period. We have had the resignations of two Ministers of the Crown. We have had public criticism by Customs officers. We have had an attempt to intimidate officers whose public responsibility it was to provide properly for the accountability of dutiable goods in this country. In the wake of all that the Government has placed restrictions upon the ablity of the inquiry to carry out its work. What comes clearly out of all of this is that we have one law for the privileged-for the rich-and one law for the poor. </PARA>
<PARA> A sort of cover up and conspiracy clearly exists in this area. An attempt was made to keep from either the Minister or top officials in the Department certain basic information which affected the effective functioning of the Bureau of Customs. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it inconceivable that two Ministers of the Crown would not know what their responsibilities were on this question of duty with respect to imported goods. I find it impossible to accept that the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs would not have asked the obvious question as to whether the television set was black and white or colour. I cannot accept, therefore, the view that has been expressed that in some way or other he has been done an injustice. I believe that, in the context of ministerial responsibility, the former Minister failed to carry out his accepted role of leadership of his Department. Of course, if there was a conspiracy of the top brass in the Bureau of Customs I am not so sure, having regard to the obvious attempts that were made, to imtimidate Mr Mayhew and to denigrate Mr Spanswick and Mr Bennett-they are clearly evidenced in the documents-that we can get any sort of justice from the sort of limited inquiry that suggests itself in the documents that are now available to us. </PARA>
<PARA> The view held by Senators Martin and Georges about Mr Moore may well be justified, but are we to establish those sorts of facts? Are we going to establish whether the Bureau of Customs operates in accordance with its obligations to the Parliament and to the Australian people? I wonder why it is that, when the Government is forced to establish royal commissions or inquiries, they are always given very restrictive terms of reference which means that they do not get to the heart of the problem and do not have the sort of investigative role to produce findings that establish the truth beyond all reasonable doubt. Why is it that we are forced constantly into the position of elucidating from the Government the reasons for its reluctance to extend these terms of reference ?</PARA>
<PARA> No explanation is given by the Ministers as to why, for the third time within a week, we have been given extra documents. It is all right for Senator Sir John Carrick to say that the Government is convinced that no further documents will be forthcoming. That is what we expected after the original tabling of documents . They were tabled in the belief that they comprised all the available documentation. We were then given another set of documents. Now we have a third, and we cannot be sure that it is the final set. A great deal of empirical evidence is available and much criticism has been raised publicly in this place over the last three or four years since 1977. We have asked questions about the malfunction of the Bureau of Customs in New South Wales. We have asked why this inquiry is to be restricted to New South Wales. Is it suggested that in every other State the effective functioning of the Bureau is an accepted fact? That was the Government's view until this blow-up occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not opposing the Government's propositions just for the sake of opposing them; we are opposing them because we do not think they go far enough. We do not believe that the restrictions that are placed upon the terms of reference can in any way establish once and for all the effectiveness of this inquiry. One is therefore entitled to say that the Opposition is acting responsibly in this matter by moving an amendment. I remind the Senate that there is no doubt that had it not been for the persistence of the Press and the media over the weekend before Parliament resumed, the persistence of the Opposition and the knowledge that Parliament would be sitting and making judgments about these matters, no doubt it was in the minds of the Ministers that they could ride out the storm. That was their view. They were forced into a position based on the determination of public opinion that they had a price to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it incomprehensible that it has been suggested in the statement of the current Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) that the two former Ministers involved have paid a heavy price. I think those words were used today by Senator Durack. When I asked a question yesterday about the procedures that operate at an international terminal he gave me a very unsatisfactory answer. I wanted to know whether, for example, it was not a fact that at a person's point of entry into this country, when he hands over his passport, he is asked by a Customs official whether the signature appearing on the form is his and whether he has any goods to declare. There is no evidence in the written reports of those questions having been asked. That is the procedeur that is applied to Mr and Mrs John Citizen in our country. Those questions are posed to each one of us when we come into this country. Yet there is no suggestion that they were asked or answered in this case. Does it mean that only certain classes of people are asked those sorts of questions, that in the case of the privileged few, the questions are not asked and therefore no answers are given; or is it a fact that Mr MacKellar orally answered those questions in the negative? That would mean that the position that he took on this matter was of even greater culpability than that which has been suggested. There is nothing in the documents to say that those procedures were carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that an absurd position exists in that there is absolutely no obligation on citizens coming into this country personally to sign the form. That is certainly not the general view. I have never filled out my wife's form when we have returned from overseas. I think all citizens of our country believe that they have an obligation to do that for themselves; yet we are told that the regulations do not require it to be done by the individual. That is a most alarming state of affairs. Does that suggest that the procedures ought to be tighteded up? Does it mean that in future I can just fill out the form on behalf of my wife and let her carry in dutiable goods for which she is in no way likely to be penalised and about which she is not likely to be asked a question because somebody else filled in her form?</PARA>
<PARA> These matters ought to be included in the terms of reference. There ought to be some explanation about these sorts of matters. The terms of reference are so restrictive as to be totally unsatisfactory. As Senator Grimes suggested, there is a breakdown in industrial relations in this Department. That is what the Customs Officers Association of Australia has been saying in public statements. That is what I have been saying on the odd occasions when such matters have been raised in this place. That is what has been said repeatedly and consistently. But what was the action of Ministers for Business and Consumer Affairs both prior to Mr Moore's appointment and in the period in which he was the Minister? What steps did he take to have these matters remedied? Responsible officers at senior levels within the Department do not make these statements just for the sake of them; yet on the record are at least a dozen statements made over the last three or four years suggesting that there was something rotten in the state of the Bureau of Customs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was forced to take steps to remove the Narcotics Bureau from the Customs areas and transfer it to the Australian Federal Police. An adequate explanation was never given. The Parliament is treated with disrespect by the Executive and the Prime Minister. As I indicated earlier, the Government has been forced ultimately to extend the terms of reference of all its Public Service inquiries and royal commissions to get to the truth of the matter. We are determined as far as is possible in this case to press on until we get to the crux of the problem that exists in the Customs Bureau to see that body properly carry out its function, to see that ministerial propriety and responsibility are accepted by this Government and to see that the revenue provided for in the Budget Papers is properly and adequately collected by Customs officers. I am not talking only of what happens at Sydney Airport. The biggest proportion of funds that come from excise and dutiable goods does not come purely from the international airport at Sydney. Obviously major problems exist in the Department. Sooner or later it will be shown to the satisfaction of the Parliament and the Australian people that this Government is shirking its responsibility by not accepting the amendment which has been moved by Senator Button and which is supported by members of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by Senator Button on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. In doing so I will be voting differently from my four colleagues on this occasion. I wish briefly to explain my reasons. Firstly, it is a basic tenet of the Australian Democrats' policy that our parliamentarians are able to express an independent point of view. I exercise that right on this occasion for two very basic reasons which I consider are important. The Government has initiated an inquiry into this matter on the basis that there will be no fixed date for the inquiry to terminate. As Senator Button pointed out, this means that the inquiry can be delayed until after an election has been held. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I fail to see how a Public Service inquiry can inquire into the Public Service and be a fair, reasonable and independent inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think this whole matter started in the manner of comic opera. I could not believe my eyes when I saw in the Press that the resignations of two Ministers were likely over what seemed to me a comparatively trivial matter. 'Let the punishment fit the crime' started ringing in my ears. But information has come to light that there was victimisation in a very important department. That is serious. What is also very serious is the fact that two very important Ministers of this Government have seen fit to tender their resignations over the incident. We can no longer treat the incident as trivial. There are some very unusual aspects to it. I believe the only way the good names and reputations of the two Ministers can be cleared is by a genuine independent judicial inquiry. Then there could be no doubt about its findings. As the inquiry is currently constituted there can be all the doubts in the world. For these reasons, essentially in the interests of justice on this occasion, I find it necessary to vote other than with my colleagues. I support the motion moved by Senator Button . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is dealing with the report of the Senate Standing Orders Committee. I begin by recording my view that the Committee of the Whole should not debate the Standing Orders of the Senate when its proceedings are being broadcast. I do not regard them as matters of such significance and importance for listeners outside the chamber that we should be debating them on air. I think there are far more important topics of general concern to people in this country than the Standing Orders of the Senate which are really only the rules which govern debate in this place. However, there is involved in the Standing Orders an important issue-not sufficiently important to be dealt with when the proceedings of this chamber are being broadcast-which relates to the petitions which are presented by various constituents to members of parliament for presentation in the Senate. The present practice is that petitions are collected by various people in what I regard as a most worthwhile activity as part of the democratic process. The presentation of petitions to Parliament is a very ancient custom. Those petitions are collected, as Senator Mason pointed out with great gusto in a contribution yesterday, and are sent to this Parliament. The present situation is that they are read by members of parliament and then they disappear from view .</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Rae interjects that they are inwardly digested. Certainly whatever happens to them is inward because nothing outward happens to them after they have been read in this chamber. They are put away, as it were. I do not think there is any real indication for those people who have sent petitions to the Parliament of what has happened to them except that they have been read here by honourable senators. I want again to put to the Committee that it is in a sense a waste of time for honourable senators to read petitions in the Senate when its proceedings are being broadcast. Of course, petitions are presented on both Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Some petitions are read on air and others are read when the Senate proceedings are not on air on Tuesdays. There is no reason, in my view, why this practice should continue. The important thing about petitions is the involvement of citizens and electors in expressing their concern about and interest in topics being discussed by the national Parliament and in involving their fellow citizens in that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The procedure recommended for the future by the Standing Orders Committee, of which I am a member, is that petitions should not be read by senators because that adds nothing to the democratic process. All it means is that time is spent in that exercise. The important thing is that it is suggested by the Standing Orders Committee that in future petitions in summary form should be read by the Clerk of the Senate, taking much less time and allowing the Senate to proceed with Question Time, another traditional and important aspect of parliamentary democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that I have the support of Senator Georges on this issue. If only he were on the Standing Orders Committee he would be able to make some very intelligent suggestions, I am sure, about what ought to be done with Question Time. The important point which I wish to make is that the proposal is not only that petitions which have been collected by citizens and electors and sent to this Parliament should be read by the Clerk in summary form but also that from now on petitions should be referred to standing committees of the Senate for consideration. I think that is a very important recommendation. It means that petitions, when read in this place, have not reached, in a sense, the end of their lives but are to be referred to standing committees which will consider them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mason asks what the standing committee will do with them . That is not for me to say. I assume that he is a member of a standing committee and that he will make it his business to see that something very worthwhile is done with them. But of course standing committees can make recommendations to the Senate about the contents of petitions. I think that at least the democratic process which is started in the electorates when petitions are collected by citizens is kept alive and before the Senate, which is not the situation at present. I hope that the procedure which is designed to improve the proceedings of the Senate would have appeal to the Committee as a whole because I think it is an important initiative which represents a break with the past and it is a better system for dealing with the matter than is available to us now. I have frequently expressed the view that the reading of petitions in this Parliament on broadcast day can do nothing for the ratings of this place-I talk in broadcast terms.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am getting a lot of support from my colleagues here, but I want to make it quite clear as to where the Standing Orders Committee stands on this matter and why it arrived at this conclusion about the future of petitions. I think we have to do everything we can to make this Parliament more relevant in all its activities, and the reading of petitions is not a relevant activity. It is not one which will encourage people to listen to Parliament. People want to listen to Parliament to hear debates, and that is the important issue. Finally, let me make the point that governments have to make decisions and parliaments have to approve or disapprove all decisions made by governments. One of the unfortunate things about petitions, of course, is that petitions present all points of view-for example, the plant variety rights legislation. It is important that people are involved in that issue, but ultimately the Government has to make a decision about the issues involved. If we were to decide issues on the basis of petitions we would not decide anything because all points of view are expressed. I commend the views of the Standing Orders Committee to honourable senators and I hope it will have the support of all honourable senators in streamlining and improving the procedures of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Petitions do not go to a Senate standing committee now. At least the text of a petition is read out in this Parliament. It will not be read out in future. The Senate Standing Orders Committee is trying to ape the practice which is adopted on the other side of King's Hall. Many honourable senators will argue that we should not copy the House of Representatives. That is the very thing this chamber will be doing if it adopts this recommendation. It will have no mind of its own. No definite recommendation is to be found in this report which says that the Senate standing committee to which a petition is referred shall do anything at all with the petition. The recommendation states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . should those Committees wish to inquire . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They may not wish to inquire as they may have a lot of other work to do. The recommendation continues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . they may seek a reference from the Senate to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>Ever since we dealt in the Committee of the Whole with the privileged Ministers who have very cheap home loans, I have been presenting petitions here dealing with that subject. The committee to which those petitions would have to go would be the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations of which Senator Peter Rae is the Chairman. Let us look at how many references that Committee has before it in its current inquiries. The Committee has 16 references before it at present. How long would it be before that Committee got round to looking at whether that is fair to all the young couples who are paying exorbitant interest on home loans? How long would it be before Senator Peter Rae got around to looking at that matter and came back to the Senate with a recommendation?</PARA>
<PARA> I doubt whether his Committee would be game to come back and say that it agrees that Mr Anthony should not have such a loan. He is the only one who is now getting a home loan so cheaply. In view of the political climate, I doubt whether the Committee would come back with a recommendation that he should not continue to receive that loan. The National Country Party is breathing down the neck of the Government, so that Committee would not be game to come into this place and recommend that Mr Anthony should pay the same rate of interest as every other young married couple in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not nonsense at all. If people go to the trouble of drawing up and signing petitions and of giving them to members of parliament to present in this place they should at least be able to hear them being read. Let us look at the first part of the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee on page 3 of its report. Under the heading 'Petitions'. it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In considering the more effective use of the time available to the Senate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Nine petitions were presented today in the Senate. Nine petitions had to be read . How long did that take? It took exactly 15 minutes to read those nine petitions. That is not taking away any of the time of the Senate. I doubt whether more than nine petitions would ever be required to be read on a Wednesday. We are going to deprive the people who sign petitions of the right to have those petitions read because we want to save 15 minutes. What will we do with that time? If honourable senators go back through Hansard they will see that hour after hour has been wasted on useless debate in this place, yet honourable senators want to take away the rights of citizens to have their petitions read in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> What else is contained in the recommendation? It states that the Clerk shall read a summary of the contents of petitions. Who will determine this summary? I just want to remind the Senate of the summary of the petitions that I have presented in this place. I am not blaming whoever is responsible for it. I have the right as a senator to alter the wording of a petition. But if we are to be bound, as we will be if this recommendation is adopted, by the summary determined by the Clerk the summaries will read something like the summary of the Clerk of the petitions I have been presenting from people who object to Mr Anthony getting a very cheap loan. The wording I am given every day, which, of course, I change, is:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I present a petition from citizens praying that the Government extend the generous terms of Commonwealth home loans granted to two Ministers to the thousands of young couples suffering undue hardship because of high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>The petitions presented had in them the names of Mr Nixon and Mr Anthony but because such petitions have been presented by me so religiously in the Senate, Mr Nixon has bailed out. It embarrassed him, so he paid off his cheap home loan. But Mr Anthony has not yet paid off his home loan. If we prevent the people of Australia from petitioning this Parliament and complaining about the fact that a Liberal-National Country Party government treats its Ministers so generously, we will not embarrass Mr Anthony; he will be happy. I am wondering what sort of input he has had with regard to this recommendation. </PARA>

In view of the fact that the allegation made is that Mr Anthony had a loan during the period of the Labor Government, I object to the suggestion that it is only on the basis of something done by a Liberal-National Country Party government that the situation referred to by Senator McLaren exists. I believe that Senator McLaren should be brought back to the subject matter of the debate, which is the report of the Standing Orders Committee, rather than range far and wide in an effort to regurgitate some of the matters that people have heard ad nauseam, to the degree where I cannot imagine that anyone in Australia would ever wish to hear any reference to those matters by him again.

I seek some clarification from the responsible Minister as to the type of summary that the Clerks will come up with. Who will determine it? Can we be given some example of what the summary will be when petitions are lodged? Will this matter be left to the sole prerogative of the Clerk without any direction as to which standing committee each petition will be sent to? We have quite a few standing committees . We have the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Afaairs, the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources , the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare and the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce. Who will be judge and jury to determine which standing committee should look at a particular petition? Of course when a petition reaches a standing committee, it is up to that committee to decide whether it wishes to look at the petition or refer it back to the Senate and seek a reference so that it can examine it. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) A Senator wishing to present a petition shall lodge it with the Clerk. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Clerk shall make an announcement in respect of petitions lodged with him, . . . </PARA>

<PARA>The explanatory notes point out that the Committee recommends that the reading of the full text of petitions be abandoned, that all petitions be lodged with the Clerk and that the Clerk shall read a summary. I presume that, if the honourable senator presenting the petition objects to that summary he can do so and have that summary changed. What is more important is this: If the new sessional order is adopted, Mr President, not the Clerk, will as a matter of practice, have a list of all petitions circulated to honourable senators and the text of petitions will be referred to the relevant standing committees so that those committees which wish to inquire into a particular petition may do so.

The fact that a petition has been presented to this chamber should be announced to this chamber. What has happened is that petitions have become less significant because of the procedure we use and because of the nature of debate in this place. Recently a petition was presented in this chamber which had, I think, 25, 000 signatures on it. I believe it was said at the time that the number of signatures on the petition presented in this place was a record.

The names of the people on the petitions are not read. I can tell honourable senators that if they read some of the names of the people who signed the petition they would not want to read them. I suggest that some of those signatures are false and some of them are extraordinary. I am saying that those people who genuinely sign petitions for presentation to this place have a right to know that they will be printed in the Journals of this place, that they will be considered and referred to places where they can be considered. At the moment they are confined to the dungeons or the archives or God knows where, and we do not know what happens to them. Nothing happens after that. This is all because some people believe that those who are listening to Parliament are interested in listening to the endless repetition of petitions which goes on here every Wednesday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that petitions should be read in the detail in which they are read on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. I say to Senator Georges that I believe that if the text of those petitions is to be read it should be read by the senators who present them.

I believe this is a sensible reform. I believe that as it is a sessional order we can see what happens at the end of the session. If Senator Georges, Senator McLaren and Senator Bonner find that there are thousands of people out there who are protesting that the petitions are not being read, they can come here and convince us and change the sessional order. Let us have this sensible reform and realise that we are in the 1980s and not in a time when that sort of procedure was first developed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the views which have been expressed by Senator Button and Senator Grimes on the issue which is before the Senate. I think it is a fact that there is a limited amount of time in this chamber to do an unlimited amount of work. One of the problems which we have is making a sensible allocation of time. Some senators have the view, for example, that we should do more in committees. Other senators say that we should spend more time debating committee business that is the Senate's own business and so on. The fact is that the system of petitions can be endlessly used and it can be endlessly abused. In fact, a petition was put down by, I think, Senator Harradine which contained 25,000 signatures. He could, if he had wished, have presented each page of that petition day after day or he could have had different senators present separate pages of that petition and had us sitting here for endless hours while we processed the very many pages of that single petition. We all know that some senators use that technique to ensure that a petition of which they are particularly fond takes up a great deal of time and creates the impression that there is some great mass of feeling out there. I congratulate Senator Harradine for his self-control on the occasion of presenting a petition which I know was dear to his heart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there are a lot of mechanisms which are available to senators in this place to air the grievances of their electors. There is the Adjournment Debate; there is the giving of notices of motion which is, again, a popular technique which can be used or abused according to which end one is on, the giving or the receiving end; and so on. With great respect to this Committee I put the view that, in the hours which we spend here, the sometimes quite long periods where we sit listening to the present procedure of dealing with petitions are not the most productive hours spent in this chamber. I believe there is a situation whereby a small number of senators are able to monopolise a quite large part of the time of this place. I believe if senators careful consider the use of time in this place they will adopt the recommendation of the Senate Standing Orders Committee a committee of which I hasten to add I am not a member. I also tend to agree with Senator Button in that I very much doubt that this debate has particularly advanced the status of the Senate among the listening public, if there is any listening public. I do not believe that it is of particular interest to very many people outside how we order out domestic affairs. However, it is important that as much of the time which we have available to us as possible is seen by the public to involve senators directing their attention to matters of national concern. I believe that the safeguards which are contained in Appendix D ensure that the citizen is able to approach this place and is able to put on the permanent record of this place the view that he or she wishes to put before us. I believe it would amount to a more effective use of our time if we adopted Appendix D as a practice of this place. </PARA>

<PARA> The only Questions entertained by the Senate on the presentation of a Petition shall be:- I. ''That the Petition be received;'' II. ''That the Petition be read ;'' III.

''That the Petition be referred to the Select Committee on-.''</PARA>
<PARA>That is, to the committee dealing with the subject matter the petition refers to . The proposal that is currently before us is to change the current sessional order. The current sessional order presumably has a preamble which states: ' Notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders of the Senate the following shall be the order in which the petition shall be dealt with'. Nevertheless, I would like to ask the proponents of the recommendation whether or not it is sought to supersede Standing Order No. 96. </PARA>

The fact that the petition is then before the Senate is enshrined in this new sessional order. The fact that the subject matter of the petition is referred to and read out briefly-summarised-and that the full text of the petition is circulated to all senators does not then presumably preclude the right of any senator, including the senator who has been given by his constituents the responsibility of ensuring that the petition comes before the Parliament, to act in accordance with Standing Order No. 96 or to move any of those motions that are stated in that Standing Order. Under those circumstances and with that assurance I am happy to support the proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Archer was there too. I am aware of what happened. What happened was reported in the Press. I make a particular note that the only Press report which was brought into this place was brought in by Senator Watson. That was the report from the Hobart Mercury. I happen to know, as Senator Watson knows, the Launceston Examiner was available in this place yesterday, yet he chose not to take the report from the Launceston Examiner. I believe I can demonstrate quite clearly why, in fact, he chose just the report from the Hobart Mercury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I say, I was present at the graduation ceremony. Mr Hawke gave the occasional address. Before he did so, he made inquiries about what sort of speech was expected, whether the contribution should be a substantial one and whether, in fact, anyone would worry if it was controversial. He made those inquiries of the Chairman of the Council of the College of Advanced Education. He was informed that both conditions-that the address be substantial and controversial-were acceptable to the Chairman and therefore he thought to the Council. The Chairman of the Council, I might add is, Mr Edmund Rouse. I do not believe either Senator Watson or Senator Rae could suggest that he is a Labor Party supporter in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke observed before he started his address that he would be both political and controversial. He explained that he thought people would consider him to be less honest if he were otherwise. Quite clearly, what is appropriate or otherwise in such an address is a matter for judgment. I agree that many people present thought that Mr Hawke was too political-an extraordinary complaint for a political figure of his type. Neither Mr Hawke nor I would deny that he is a very political figure. Senator Watson and, I assume from his remarks, Senator Rae made that judgment. Quite clearly, I want to point out that not everyone present that night agreed. I was present later when members of the staff and students of the College apologised to Mr Hawke for what they considered to be the unfortunate manners, perhaps some of them considered ill manners, of students in the audience. Quite clearly on that occasion there were people who did not agree with the judgment that was made by Senator Rae, Senator Watson and many others present. In fact, I have a letter to Mr Hawke from the staff of the College expressing a view opposite to that expressed by Senator Watson. I point out that when Mr Hawke was interrupted by the graduate he said that he was sorry if his approach was not what she and her colleagues had expected or appreciated and from then on cut his speech short. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to that. The report given by Senator Watson last night suggested that he misjudged the appropriateness of the occasion and the response from the audience as to the form and the content of his address. Senator Watson then stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . where Robert John Hawke-</PARA>
<PARA>He could not even get the name right--</PARA>
<PARA>abused the privilege which was granted to him in presenting a sound, reasoned, researched and academic address on a matter of substance. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>

<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The approach was discourteous, not only to the chairman--</PARA>
<PARA>I will come to the Chairman later--</PARA>
<PARA>but also to the principal, the graduates, their families and the many guests. </PARA>
<PARA>He then made a remark which I think was incredible. He described Mr Hawke's speeches as 'a monotonous monologue on matters relating to unemployment, inflation and industrial relations'. I am not in a position to judge Mr Hawke's speeches. I am not going to judge Mr Hawke's speeches in comparison with Senator Watson's speeches. I merely make the remark that if Mr Hawke's speeches are considered monotonous monologues, honourable senators who have heard Senator Watson's speeches can make their own judgment as to how they describe them. Senator Watson had incorporated in Hansard the report from the Hobart Mercury. I would liked to quote from the report from the Launceston Examiner. The Launceston Examiner had the advantage of having a reporter there on the occasion . The Hobart Mercury, as I have found out, merely had a hearsay report from someone who was present. The Launceston Examiner quoted some people who had different views from those of Senator Watson and Senator Rae. I am not denying that they had their views and I am not denying that they have the right to express their views. The Examiner first of all reported the words of the Chairman of the Council of the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education, Mr Edmund Rouse, who:</PARA>
<PARA> Told the audience that he had requested Mr Hawke to treat the address with the utmost seriousness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a letter from a member of the staff of the TCAE. I am not saying that it is anything other than that but it was sent only a few days after the event. I suggest that Mr Hawke may have not been aware of what many people expected. He would not have expected fellow politicans like Senator Watson to expect him to behave like an apolitical eunuch. We have all made and will make speeches which are not very good. I, and other senators, have done that. We all can and we all will, I suggest, misjudge an audience. I have heard speeches containing tasteless remarks by politicans-that certainly cannot be said of Mr Hawke's speech the other night. I have heard speeches which could have been classed as inappropriate. But this is the first time that I have ever heard anyone come into this place and make a speech like Senator Watson's. I am sure he made that speech, in fact, to chase a headline. I suggest that he deliberately chose the report from the Hobart Mercury because it was more favourable to his case than the report in the Launceston Examiner. I do not believe that someone like Mr Hawke needs defending from attacks like this but I believe we should have a sort of balance in the reports that are made. I have tried to do that by reporting from another newspaper in Tasmania, a newspaper which did have a reporter at the ceremony and a newspaper which did give a report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is worth while just pointing out that Mr Hawke was a distinguished Rhodes Scholar. He was the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. He is known by sight by almost every citizen in this land. I do not think we can say the same for either of the honourable senators who spoke last night on this matter. I do not think the name of Senator Watson would cause even a flicker of recognition in the minds of most people in this land any more than mine would. The thing is that Senator Watson and I will never be in Mr Hawke's position, probably, of being asked to give the sort of address that he was asked to give. Yet Senator Watson comes in here and denigrates a man of that stature for what may in Senator Watson's judgment have been a misjudged speech. I believe the crux of Senator Watson's complaint can be seen in his description of Mr Hawke's speech-a monotonous monologue on matters relating to unemployment, inflation and industrial relations. It is those three subjects of unemployment, inflation and industrial relations which, I suspect, upset people like Senator Watson. I can understand Senator Watson's sensitivity on this matter in view of his previous experiences in this area before becoming a senator. I can understand his difficulty in view of the things that he had to do in his occupation before he became a senator. I do not believe that the denigration of Mr Hawke which was indulged in last night advances the cause of politics or advances the career of Senator Watson or, for that matter, Senator Rae. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that Senator Watson did not give the unanimous view of everyone present. The Launceston Examiner at least was willing to report both sides of the story. It at least was willing to report the views of those people present who disagreed with the judgment of Senator Rae and Senator Watson. I do not deny their right to make that judgment. I just question the fact that they came in here last night and brought up the subject in such a manner. I hope that in future they will be a little more tolerant. I hope that in the future they are not on the wrong end of such discussion as was Mr Hawke on Saturday night. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke made a speech on a very serious subject. It was certainly relevant to the people who were graduating. He made it in a manner which some people may have considered to be too political. He made it at a length which some people may have considered to be excessive. But he made that speech, as the Chairman of the College of Advanced Education said, in all seriousness and in a sincere manner, having in mind his record in this area and his conscientious belief that that was the sort of controversial matter which was appropriate to be raised at such a graduation ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA> I think if we look over the years at graduation ceremonies at the great universities of this country and at the great universities overseas we will find that through the decades, in fact through the centuries, such graduation ceremonies have been at times controversial. Controversial speeches have been made and controversial views have been put. I hope that that will continue in the future because our universities and our colleges of advanced education are places where, in fact, such subjects should be discussed and such subjects should be raised. I do not in any way-nor would Mr Hawke-denigrate the courage of the young lady who chose to interrupt Mr Hawke. He made that perfectly clear at the time he spoke and after he spoke. She did what she thought was right. That is what I think people at colleges of advanced education and universities should do. But that this matter should be dragged up in this Parliament in the selective way and in the manner in which it was dragged up last night, I think was most unfortunate. I merely wish to balance the picture this evening. </PARA>

I believe that Senator Watson expressed his concern in relation to what he saw was an affront to an institution in which he had a very strong and legitimate interest, having had a close involvement with it for a considerable period and having been involved there in the teaching side as well as taking a very close interest in its development. I am not suggesting that that places him in an extraordinary or unique sitution. I believe and I think Senator Grimes would believe that it is an excellent institution which should be supported.

I tried to point out that had that address come from somebody who did not have the availability of a tertiary education such as that which Mr Hawke had-in other words, one who had come from the school of hard knocks-one could probably have well understood the content and form of such an address. But we have to recognise that Mr Hawke, in his own right, is an academic, having had a distinguished career with the University of Western Australia and in the United Kingdom. So he knew the unwritten rules which generally apply on such occasions. He knew and he was well aware of them, having been through that sort of thing. I tried to draw attention to the inappropriateness of those remarks, given that occasion and given the fact that an election campaign was forthcoming in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was really nothing more than politicking at the expense of an institution which is trying to find its identity. The tragedy of this situation is that it will scare off not only the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education but also a whole host of universities and similar colleges of advanced education from inviting politicians in the future. I think it is important that such colleges have an input. Some time prior to the event I was told that Mr Hawke was going to speak. I was asked whether I could see any objections arising. I said: 'No, he is an academic'. I believed that there would be the opportunity to provide what was required on such an occasion. Certainly I was let down and many others were let down as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter on behalf of Mr Kerry Davis, a constituent of mine presently residing in Devonport. This young man, through occupational stress brought about while he was a member of the Australian Federal Police, has been required to relinquish his position, which had been well-earned and in which he was well regarded by that force. Although he was a Tasmanian, he moved to Queensland in July of 1980 to carry forward his duties within the force. In doing so, of course, he had to undertake such a move of household as required him to purchase a new residence for his family in Brisbane. This he did, but within five months of taking occupation of that family residence he was required by ill-health-his health having deteriorated rapidly due to occupational stress-to resign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This young man has given very distinguished service to Australia not only in the Federal Police but also within the armed forces. In fact, during his period of service in the armed forces, which commenced at the age of 17 years upon voluntary enlistment in the Australian Regular Army, he served for some time in the infantry in South Vietnam and was engaged in combat on several occasions. As I have said, after only five months residence in the family home in Brisbane, this young man was required to resign from the force and he returned to Tasmania . Presently he is living with his wife's family in Devonport. The expenses involved for a young family man in such a situation can well be imagined. </PARA>
<PARA> What he has asked of the Federal Government is some aid in meeting the reimbursement of legal and other costs associated with the sale of that home in Brisbane. He hoped that section 23 of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act might provide some avenue for him to make such a claim. But he has been informed by the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Kevin Newman, and indeed by his own Commonwealth Police Officers Association that his claim does not fall within the purview of that statute. It seems to me that that view is the correct one. What this man is seeking-given his long period of service with the Commonwealth in capacities, as I have said, within the armed forces and within the Federal Police during which time he performed his duties diligently and well and rose to the rank of detective-sergeant-in the absence of a statutory entitlement is an ex gratia payment to help alleviate the financial stress in which his family has found itself because of the forced sale of the family residence in Brisbane prior to his return to Tasmania. I commend the case to the attention of the Government.</PARA>

I will read the first part of the telex and seek leave to have the other part of it incorporated in Hansard. I do this in the hope that the Minister for Health (Senator Peter Baume), who is now in the Senate, will look at it tomorrow and see whether some urgent action can be taken to protect local rice growers. The telex which I have just opened is addressed to Senator G. T. McLaren, South Australian, Parliament House, Canberra. It is from the Ricegrowers Co-operative Mills Ltd, Leeton. The telex reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most concerned at sudden increase in importations of rice into Australia which do not meet high Australian standards and are threat under quarantine system to Australian ricegrowing industry. Western Australian industry supports our view. As member of committee of inquiry into quarantine safeguards, your support sought urgently for investigation into way that quarantine barrier around NSW ricegrowing area was broken and rice from China was put on sale. Further seek your support for declaration from quarantine service that in view of contaminated samples which have been identified by this co-operative and reported to quarantine service stringent controls should be placed on imported rice so that it meets the high standards of our export quality products. Understand ship due to leave Bangkok which may carry rice for Australia. Ship due to call at several southern ports and Fremantle. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The sudden increase in the number of importers of foreign rice for Australia poses a grave threat to the disease-free Australian rice industry, an industry leader said today. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr L. C. Davidge, the Chairman of the Ricegrowers' Co-operative Mills Limited said that he was deeply concerned that tests carried out in Sydney had revealed that samples of imported rice had contained wheat seed, dead insects and unmilled rice grains. </PARA>
<PARA> He said that advanced milling and hygiene techniques in the huge N.S.W. rice industry ensured that unmilled paddy was virtually eliminated from rice produced locally. </PARA>
<PARA> However, he said samples of foreign rice had up to 6 grains of unmilled rice per kilogram. Mr Davidge said that this unmilled grain could carry diseases, such as blast, and viruses which could destroy the $150 million N.S.W. rice industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This foreign rice had already been detected by the State Department of Agriculture within the quarantine area. The varieties developed by the N.S.W. rice industry have no resistance to diseases and relied entirely on quarantine protection. </PARA>
<PARA> He said, quick buck entrepreneurs bringing in cheap parcels of sub-standard rice must be made to conform with the strict controls which protect Australia's high standard of food quality and hygiene. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 March 1982 (Hansard, page 1090) Senator Teague asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Education, a question without notice concerning the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a normal requirement of TEAS that students should lodge their applications by 31 March each year if they are to receive benefits with retrospective effect to 1 January of that year. Where an application is received after 31 March, benefits will apply only from the date of application.</PARA>
<PARA> Final enrolment data in relation to universities, colleges and technical and further education institutions does not become available until mid-year. On past experience the figure quoted by the honourable senator of 38 per cent of tertiary students being eligible for TEAS at that stage would appear to be reasonably correct.</PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of full time students enrolled in approved courses at universities, CAE's and TAFE institutions who were in receipt of TEAS at 30 June each year from 1976 to 1981 was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1976-38.4 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> 1977-40.3 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> 1978-41.8 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> 1979-39.5 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> 1980-38.6 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> 1981-37.5 (preliminary figure)</PARA>
<PARA> The level of benefits and conditions to apply for 1983 under all the student assistance schemes including TEAS are currently under review in the context of the 1982-83 Budget. It is therefore not possible to indicate at this stage the priorities which might be adopted in the allocation of funds which will be available to support the overall student assistance program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 March 1982 (Hansard, page 645) Senator Mulvihill asked me the following question without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, is based on an answer I received on 8 December. It was a two-tiered response. In the first instance the Minister promised that there would be legislation early this year to provide for an end to discrimination in relation to migrant women and the limitation involved in having their children listed on the citizenship certificate. The second part of the answer concerned a consolidation of voting rights and equality of voting eligibility between Commonwealth nationals and other migrants coming into this country. I received the answer on 8 December and we were promised legislation early in 1982. Does the Minister contemplate introducing legislation to amend the Australian Citizenship Act in the former case and the Commonwealth Electoral Act in the latter case?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in my previous response a review of the Australian Citizenship Act has been undertaken. The proposals are being finalised and it is likely that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will foreshadow the proposed legislative amendments in another place before the end of the current sittings.</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to eliminate provisions which now discriminate on the grounds of sex are included in the proposals under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 was amended by the Statute Law ( Miscellaneous Amendment) Act 1981 which was assented to by the Governor-General on 2 December 1981. The new provisions will come into operation on a date to be fixed by Proclamation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Proclamation has not been made because it is hoped to have a uniform Australia-wide commencement date. Consultations are continuing with State Governments with a view to complementary legislation being introduced by them as soon as possible to enable an early uniform Australia-wide commencement date of the electoral change.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (3) I wrote to Senator Walsh on 16 December, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Walsh,</PARA>
<PARA> You wrote to me about Mr Besley's resignation as Secretary, Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the announcement of his prospective appointment as Managing Director of Monier Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a great pity that the facts of the situation were not sought before you made, under the protection of Senate debate, the serious and totally unfounded imputations contained in your speech on 26 November. It is perfectly proper that a senior officer taking up a position in private industry should indicate his intention to do so immediately, and to disengage from his official duties promptly. Whether some period should elapse between resignation from the Service and engagement in private industry is a matter to be judged on the facts, and procedures have been laid down for this judgment to be made.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Besley first approached the Chairman of the Public Service Board, Sir William Cole, on 6 October 1981. He indicated that he had been offered a position as Managing Director of a large public company and that he was proposing to resign in about March 1982 to take it up. He wished to follow the Bowen procedures properly.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the 6 October meeting the Chairman of the Public Service Board sought further information from Mr Besley concerning the proposed arrangement. Sir William was in Port Moresby in the week beginning 12 October and in that week Mr Besley spoke to Sir Geoffrey Yeend about the matter. In the following week Sir William appointed a Permanent Heads' Committee comprising Sir Geoffrey Yeend, Mr N. S. Currie and himself to report to me and this report was provided on 20 October.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee did not consider that it needed to call Mr Besley before it, and did not do so; as indicated there were prior discussions between Mr Besley and two members of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not appropriate to publish all the information obtained by the Committee, and contained in its recommendations to me. I am sure you will appreciate that there are privacy considerations in respect of individuals which should be taken into account in this respect. I can say, however, that the Government's decision was consistent with what was put to it by the Permanent Heads' Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> You ask if there will be ''monitoring'' to ensure that any ''conditions'' laid down are followed. The Bowen recommendations constitute a code of conduct. They are not enforceable in law and it is neither desirable nor practicable to contemplate some kind of monitoring of the activities of private citizens. Mr Besley has in fact assured the Government that, in his new position, he would act consistently with the Bowen report.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Besley is currently on recreation leave/furlough and his resignation will be effective on 14 March 1982. Mr Besley, quite properly, immediately went on leave following the announcement of his intention to accept a position with Monier, pending his resignation from the Service.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision was consistent in all respects with what was put to it by the Committee. There were no recommendations by the Committee which were not accepted by the Government.</PARA>
