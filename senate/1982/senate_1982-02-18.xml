<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware of today's Press reports of continuing repression of people in Poland by the martial law authorities? Is the Minister aware of yesterday's Press reports that last week some 117 civilians were arrested and 40 persons were sentenced to prison for breaking martial law regulations? Is it a fact that our noblest peak, Mount Kosciusko, was named after the great Polish patriot who fought so valiantly against Russian occupation of his country in the 1790s? Mindful of this strong symbolic link between our countries, will the Government convey to the Polish martial law regime its strong condemnation of the continuing repression and deprivation of liberties being suffered by the Polish people, particularly the industrial workers and farmers formerly organised by Solidarity ?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Government has been very active in response to the martial law proposals and activities in Poland. To instance some of the things that the Government has done I mention that Australia has joined the Western allies in calling for an end to martial law, the release of the detainees and the resumption of genuine dialogue. We have conveyed our condemnation of martial law to the Polish and Soviet governments, told the Polish authorities that in the present circumstances we are not prepared to conduct normal bilateral relations with them and continued to defer a recent Polish request for further economic assistance. We have also indicated to Warsaw that the roll-over provisions of a current government guaranteed credit facility are dependent upon the prompt payment of accounts as they fall due and that the option to cancel or suspend those provisions remains open to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have supported Western moves to condemn martial law in international forums such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. We have told the Soviet Union that its role in the Polish crisis reinforces the need for Australia to keep in place the post-Afghanistan measures limiting bilateral relations. We have also consulted carefully with allies in order to support Western objectives arising from the Polish crisis and we have declined to accept an increased number of refugees and migrants from Poland, as recently announced by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I think we have joined with the Australian people in sending private humanitarian aid to the people of Poland. In general I think what was outlined in the question is very broadly in line with the Government's response. We will continue to react in the same way until there is some reaction with regard to martial law in the country of Poland.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Considerable attention has recently been given to statements by Prime Minister Mugabe in favour of a one party state in Zimbabwe. For some time now Mr Mugabe has been on record as considering that a one party system would be more appropriate to conditions and traditions in Zimbabwe than the Westminster parliamentary system which emerged from the Lancaster House agreement. However, in a recent interview reported in the London Times, and reprinted in the Canberra Times of 1 February, Mr Mugabe was quoted as saying that there were obvious constitutional restraints and that he did not want to move illegally or hastily. He has reaffirmed many times that he will abide by the Constitution. Mr Mugabe has acknowledged that there are provisions in the Zimbabwe Constitution which would make it difficult to move hastily towards a one party state. Any changes within 10 years of independence to key provisions of the Constitution, including the right to form or belong to political parties, would require an affirmative vote from two-thirds of the membership of the Senate and from all the members of the House of Assembly. Such a vote seems most unlikely in the present circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As is well known, Australia played an active and positive role in the proceedings leading to Zimbabwe's independence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Finance whether she said on a television program this morning that the Department of Administrative Services had ' mishandled' instructions from the Government to reduce spending. Did she accuse the Department of sending out instructions for cutbacks in overtime for the Australian Federal Police and travel allowances for the staffs of members and senators without consulting the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman? Will the Minister outline to the Senate the terms of the Cabinet instruction about reduced expenditure sent to departments? Does she believe that Ministers, such as Mr Newman, should accept responsibility for the actions of their departments if matters are mishandled?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; On a television program this morning I explained that some of the Press reports which were abroad yesterday and are abroad today were the result of a misunderstanding or mishandling of the procedures which have been set in motion for the preparation of the Additional Estimates this year. The Government has decided that until the Additional Estimates are finalised discretionary expenditure and expenditure which might be flexible with regard to timing are to be deferred. Contractual commitments in respect of major equipment acquisitions or other project expenditures will not be entered into and increased wage and salary expenditures are to be absorbed to the maximum extent possible by eliminating overtime and perhaps other forms of departmental expenditure. Ministers may seek exemption from the above in areas of any special sensitivity or difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I explained on the program this morning that as far as the Department of Administrative Services was concerned-this has been reported also by its Minister-the procedures of consultation as outlined in the original telex and in the Government's arrangements for the establishment of the Additional Estimates were not followed. Had that consultation by the Department of Administrative Services with its own Minister, and in turn with me, been followed there would not have been the very temporary difficulty that was made public by telexes that had been sent, withdrawing authority for what would be regarded as the essential activities of Government. It is not the Government's requirement that essential activity be curtailed or that disruption to what is the usual departmental practice occur, but in the next four or five weeks until such time as we settle the Additional Estimates all departments have been asked to absorb as far as possible the recent salary increases in their original Budget figures and at the same time to minimise any further expenditure which they may seek under the Additional Estimates.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think I need to explain to the Senate that there has been a shortfall in the revenue that was expected in the present Budget. The sales tax Bills, which have not yet been passed in the Senate, have been one of the reasons for that fall in revenue. The lower revenue received from the oil levy as a result of strikes and other things has also reduced income. In view of the reduction of income and the additional requirements for salaries and other expenditure, while we are settling the Additional Estimates there is a procedure for departments to minimise any outlays that may be discretionary or may be able to be curtailed in the interests of adhering as closely as possible to our original Budget.</PARA>

If the report spoken of by Senator Mason is the one in the London Times, the response at this stage from the Minister for Foreign Affairs is that we have not yet received a copy of the London Times report but the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been in touch with the United States Government to seek clarification of it.

The Senate will be advised as soon as any further advice is received from the United States authorities on the matters raised in the London Times report or any other public comment that may have been made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, refers to the article in the Australian this morning which quotes back bench Liberal members of parliament as stating that nobody can bring children into the world and expect the bloke next door to pay. It went on to refer to the means testing of family allowances. Was the revamped family allowance scheme of 1976 largely paid for by the abolition of tax rebates for children, which tax rebates were a recognition of the fact that it is a costly business to raise children? Is not this recognition a basis for the current Government's family allowance scheme? Are the Government members who made that irresponsible statement talking about means testing on a family basis or on the basis of what is in the hands of the recipient? Finally, will the Minister point out to his faceless back bench colleagues that the children of today, raised at considerable cost by their parents, will tomorrow be the ones who will have to pay the parliamentary salaries of those who make that sort of irresponsible statement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I pick up the last point of the honourable senator's question first. It is a matter of some regret to me that there seems to be a reduction in the reproduction rate in this country. Unfortunately whilst there is certainly a problem for the future with respect to the young of today having to pay taxes to pay the parliamentary salaries of tomorrow, it is also true that the young of today will be required to pay the pensions of today's wage earners. Therefore, the point raised by the honourable senator in his question has significance right across the field of social welfare. The fact is that we have an aging population and that there is a shift in the weight which is going to have to be carried by wage and salary earners in the future because of the reduced birth rate in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main point in the question asked by the honourable senator related to the means testing of family allowances and the rationale behind family allowances. Until the family allowance reform of 1976 Australia, in common with most comparable countries, had a system of assistance for families with children which was basically regressive. The system provided assistance through relatively small amounts of child endowment and also provided assistance, as Senator Harradine mentioned, through the tax system. That seems to be a pattern which is repeated through a great deal of the Western world. The assistance through the tax system, of course, provided assistance to those Australians who were taxpayers. That, of course, is the great bulk of wage and salary earners. It provided a greater level of assistance for those taxpayers with higher incomes who were, therefore, paying higher rates of tax. It provided a lower rate of assistance for those who were earning lower salaries and it returned no assistance at all through the tax system to those who were not paying tax. So, we had a system in which the amount of assistance that went to families with children was highest for those on the highest taxable incomes.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in its change in 1976, ensured that all families with children received the same assistance, be they families with high incomes or families with low incomes, although I should mention that there are additional allowances for children with respect to pensioner and beneficiary families. But for the great bulk of Australians we went from a basically regressive situation in which the better-off received more assistance to a situation in which all families received the same assistance. I think most honourable senators would welcome that balance which was achieved in 1976. Indeed, in debates in this place suggestions have been made by honourable senators from right round the chamber that that level of general assistance should be increased to bring it back into line with the values which were originally established in 1976. In the last Budget the 50 per cent increase for families with three or more children went a fair way to returning the value of it to those children, but the assistance, as has been pointed out, is less in real terms now than it was in 1976.</PARA>
<PARA> The issue of means testing which has been raised from time to time from a variety of sources is a matter which flows from a real concern on the part of many people in the community that the substantial welfare bill which is paid by the Australian taxpayer-this year payments through my Department alone will reach about $10 billion-does not have the effect of easing the poverty which exists in some corners of the Australian society and at the same time it pays money to some people who could adequately provide for themselves. There is a quite vigorous debate in the community as to whether the system should be more directive. It is not suprising, nor do I think it is in any sense undesirable, that the debate should spill over into the area of family allowances so that that question can be canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA> In the question which has been asked of me today Senator Harradine has properly raised the offsetting argument that families with children should receive some assistance which places them apart from those Australians who do not have the care and custody of children. I concede that he has raised a point of considerable significance. I think it has a very significant place in the rationale behind the decision which was taken by the Government in 1976 to implement the present system. Clearly, it is a consideration which will remain very strongly in the mind of the Government. This is a difficult area and I would like to think that in this chamber we will get constructive contributions to the debate on the problems which face us in the Department of Social Security . I think they are real. I think there are at times difficult choices to be made . But I hope that there will be common cause in the fact that we want to advance the position of Australian families just as we want to protect the poor and needy in Australia.</PARA>

I raised the matter with the Minister in this chamber and she requested that I put the question on notice. That was done on 26 November last. I have had no reply.

In view of the very large cost to the community, is the Minister satisfied that adequate resources are being made available to detect the guilty and, more importantly, to deter others from committing offences? Is the Australian Medical Association co-operating fully? Would not the greatest contribution it could make be to reduce confusion over charges by stopping recommending that its members should charge different and higher fees than those that have been assessed as fair and reasonable by the arbitrator? Finally, is it not mainly bulk billing and the consequent lack of patient audit that makes frauds possible?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Concern about the activities of doctors and people in other professions who are acting illegally is not a recent event. It has only recently come to public notice. It has been of greater public concern with the greater public reimbursement of medical costs. One of the problems that has occurred has not been so much identifying the doctors or even getting some kind of prosecution, although that is difficult; it has been the imposition of appropriate and matching penalties. If a doctor has, for example, earned an extra $100,000 in increments of $20, it is almost impossible for the police to mount the evidence to take him to court on each of those $20 transactions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has looked at the possibility of altering the penalties to make them more effective. The Minister for Health announced in a Press statement a couple of weeks ago that the Government will be introducing legislation to increase the penalties to make them real and significant. The new legislation will provide that any doctor found guilty of a couple of offences, even if those offences are minor, will then be open to a major administrative penalty which the Government can then apply. That penalty will be that the doctor will no longer be considered eligible to be a participating doctor for the purpose of the medical benefits scheme. Obviously, the best interests of patients must be looked at to ensure that if this happens, adequate public disclosure is made and patients are informed that a doctor is no longer able to participate in the medical benefits scheme. That is an extremely severe penalty and would make any doctor who is playing the scheme think twice before he ran the risk of being caught. He would have to be caught for only a couple of small offences to face the administrative penalty of not being a participating doctor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp asked: 'Why not criminal proceedings? One of the problems has been that the doctors go before the courts for a couple of events and the judge, in determining penalties-whether they are criminal or anything else-is judging them on the evidence of the particular offences. We are trying to identify a means of intervening effectively to make the small number of doctors involved think twice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Hamer asked a number of other questions. He asked what was the number of doctors involved. I understand that the document from which the figures he gave came may have been used to brief a number of people including members of the Labor Party and the AMA. It referred to 900 high profile doctors and another 1,600 to 1,700 doctors whose profiles required attention but who did not come in the first priority. I do not think that the recommended fee is the problem Senator Hamer suggests. His final point concerned bulk billing. The only statement I make about bulk billing-I am trying to contribute to the national debate-is that it has two features. On one side it contributes to the production of a better national data base and, therefore, easier detection of doctors who may be playing up. On the other hand, and simultaneously, it makes it easier for people to cheat the system. Anyone who looks at bulk billing must balance these two factors-whether he wants the benefits of a greater data base or whether he is concerned about the increased opportunities for cheating. It is that kind of concern that is before the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government certainly recognises the importance of encouraging the development of high technology industries in Australia. It has offered to participate in the National Semi-conductor Corporation facility in Canberra. This, together with its revised purchasing policy, which gives preference to supplies from high technology areas of Australian industry, and its support for industrial research and development, provides evidence of its policy. These initiatives are consistent with the Government's overall policy objective of encouraging the development of internationally competitive export oriented and specialised innovative industries based on advanced technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concept of Technology Park in Adelaide is to provide an environment in which high technology based industry can develop in close association with a technology oriented tertiary institution. This concept has been developed successfully in the United States of America and therefore the South Australian initiative is commendable.

<PARA> Do the Iwasaki beef production interests in the central Queensland region have an agreement with a local export meat processing firm for the killing of cattle produced on the Iwasaki properties-</PARA>
<PARA>That meat is subsequently exported to Japan. I then asked whether it was sold by the same interests in Japan or disposed of through normal channels. In reference to the first question, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Such arrangements, if they exist, would be commercially confidential between the interested parties. The preparation of meat for export is subject to controls under the Exports (Meat) Regulations and must be prepared in a registered export establishment.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> All beef exported by Australia to Japan enters that country under a global import quota.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1980-81 we exported all types of meat amounting to some 218,000 tonnes. I want a further explanation of the Minister's reply. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from a small percentage (around 10 per cent) all beef and veal imports into Japan and their distribution are controlled by the Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation, a semi-government authority.</PARA>
<PARA>Will the Minister obtain further information on this because it appears that almost 22,000 tonnes was exported from Australia. A percentage of this amount, undoubtedly, would have come from my State. Apparently the Government has no control over that amount of beef. Where does it go? Who is responsible for it? Who buys it? Is this one way that illegal exports of all sorts of game meat are going from this country?

It has not been possible to extend that to the provision of pharmaceuticals. As the honourable senator would know, it is those who hold a pensioner health benefit card and sickness beneficiaries who can get free pharmaceuticals. It is possible in some States, under arrangements which exist there, for people to attend hospitals to get their drugs. It is also possible for doctors wishing to give drugs that are needed for long term care to make special application to the Commonwealth Director of Health in the particular State for a larger supply than is set out in the schedule. In other words, if the schedule provides for a ten- day supply and the patient needs one month's supply, it is possible for the doctor to seek an increased supply. The extension of free pharmaceuticals to all people covered by disadvantaged health cards is a matter which the Government would have to take up in light of its capacity to manage that matter financially .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, it is quite understandable why Australian Labor Party senators would not want the people of Australia to hear the reply to such a question, hence the volume of interjections. The fact is that the Commonwealth Government has attempted in its Budget strategy to reduce its deficit to the minimum to have an anti-inflationary effect and, in particular, to do two things regarding interest rates: Not to compete in the public field and therefore not to bring pressure upwards on interest rates for home buyers and others, and to provide more room for others to borrow money. Anything that in fact increases the deficit must of course cause the Government to go into the public field more, borrow more, bring more pressure and of course penalise the very people we do not want to hurt; that is, all those 70 per cent of Australians who are seeking to pay off their homes and who are being forced by such devices to pay more interest. Of course, this is an attempt to weaken the very strategy of the Budget. The Budget strategy, in fact, has been commended in the recent report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which said that it is the right managerial course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was asked two questions by the honourable senator. One question was: How much would the action cause to be lost in the present Budget? I understand it would be in the order of $130m. The second question was: How much would it cause to be lost in a full year? I understand it would be in the order of $330m. The loss of $330m in a full year does two things: It very substantially restricts the capacity of the Government to make tax concessions and therefore to pass money back to the people of Australia to help them in their purchasing power and, of course, it then threatens the size of the deficit and bears upon interest rates. Nothing could be more conducive to the destruction of the purchasing power of the ordinary Australian than that attempt to frustrate the Budget process.</PARA>
<PARA> I was asked whether I recall Senator Mason's statements. Which ones? There are so many. They are so conflicting. I remember one, of course, about keeping certain people honest. I remember the undertaking that the Australian Democrats would be, in fact, the physicians who would cure others and keep others honest. I well recall an unequivocal promise by them that they would pass these Bills. If it is now said that their reverse is an error of judgment, are we to take every decision of theirs as likely to be judged in the future by them as another error of judgment? When, in fact, can anybody believe the credibility of the Democrats in this matter? There is no group of people more in tatters than the Australian Democrats at this moment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the epidemiological study about which Senator Macklin seeks information, I point out that the decision on this matter was not taken on any ground of cost but rather on the problems that arose during the early part of the study. These were confirmed after conducting a pilot study into the circumstances of 600 Vietnam veterans in Sydney. It indicated that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to establish to what degree Vietnam veterans were individually exposed to herbicides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of where we are to go in relation to future developments and studies has been thought through very carefully by the Commonwealth Institute of Health and the scientific advisory committee which has been advising me along those lines. We have come to the conclusion that we should develop alternative studies into three separate areas: The illness of veterans, the causes of death amongst veterans and birth defects of veterans' children-of course, an area about which there is a great deal of concern. Those studies are proceeding. They are matters about which I believe veterans themselves are very anxious to find answers. There is only one way to find the answers and that is by scientific investigation. That is the Government's policy.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the question of a judicial inquiry on this matter I have pointed out many times that an inquiry is already being conducted by a committee of this Senate into the whole question of pesticides. Their particular use in Vietnam happens to be one division of that inquiry. I understand that the study is proceeding and a considerable amount of evidence has been given. Indeed, we had a question, I think yesterday, from Senator Mason in that respect. It seems to me that with the powers of inquiry which a committee of the Senate has in this area it is quite likely that the questions which are in the minds of veterans, and certainly in the minds of honourable senators, will best be answered by the conduct of that inquiry. I believe that the powers that are available to the committee certainly are as great as, if not greater than in some areas, those of a judicial inquiry which may be set up. For that reason the Government does not accept that it should proceed to the establishment of any judicial inquiry in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the question of benefits for Vietnam veterans, I point out that of 45,000 Vietnam veterans approximately 7,000 are currently in receipt of benefits of one form or another from my Department. Of course, if any Vietnam veteran feels that he is in need of treatment or care or feels that he should be entitled to some pension or other, he is fully entitled to test his eligibility for those benefits by putting in a claim with my Department. I encourage him to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the question of the Government's attitude towards this whole matter it has been, of course, a very difficult area. In this regard one needs to understand the problems with repatriation law. The Government has sought, through various means, to demonstrate its concern for the problems of veterans. It believes that the policies that have now been adopted are headed in the right direction and will bring the answers in due course.</PARA>

The action of the Australian Labor Party, in conjunction with the Australian Democrats, will have the result I have stated: It will bear down upon interest rates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday, 16 February, the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Button, asked me what directions, if any, had been issued to staff of the Parliamentary Library concerning purchases of books and payment of overtime and salary increases. I can now respond fully to the honourable senator as follows: Regarding the purchase of books, in the discussion in Estimates Committee A on 15 September 1981 concerning the estimates of the Department of the Parliamentary Library, Senator Evans raised the question of the reduction in the book vote and it was pointed out by the Acting Parliamentary Librarian that the reduction was a serious one. A number of measures designed to cope with the problem were signalled in that discussion and it was made clear that, in order to maintain an acceptable level of purchases, additional funding would be required. If any honourable senator wishes to follow this up I refer him to the Senate Hansard of Estimates Committees A, B and C of Tuesday, 15 September 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Early in December Mr Speaker and I sought such funds but to date there has been no response. The request is being repeated in the formal Additional Estimates procedures. The difficulties foreseen at the time of the Estimates discussion have got to the stage where, at this point in the financial year, the Library must spread the available funds thinly in order to support the purchase of urgently required material until such time as additional funding is approved, or through to the end of the financial year if such funding is not approved. In order to deal with the situation, on 11 February 1982 the Acting Parliamentary Librarian issued the following instructions to staff with regard to book purchases. The instructions were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> You will be aware that a request has been made for extra funds for book purchases but so far there has been no response on this. In the meantime, therefore, only absolutely essential titles can be acquired and this will pertain through to the end of the financial year if funds sought are not provided. Normal selection procedures are to continue and a hold file will be created. Until further notice approval to go ahead and purchase any particular item lies with the Acting Head Librarian . . . In general, paper back copies will be sought rather than hard-back and no multiple copies will be acquired.</PARA>
<PARA>In response to the other question asked by the Leader of the Opposition with regard to the payment of overtime or salary increases, I can say that no instructions have been issued and that where overtime is worked it will be paid. I can assure the honourable senator that discussions on additional funding are continuing. Similarly, no instructions have been issued concerning the salary increase awarded by the Public Service Arbitrator which will be paid on the pay- day of 25 February 1982.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Communications has had an extremely busy year in terms of its work load. It is short staffed and it has been considerably mucked about by the Minister for Communications, Mr Sinclair, as a result of a variety of ad hoc policy decision changes made at Cabinet level and not on any advice from the Department itself. The Department's personnel have worked in that sense under extreme difficulty during the relevant year. The Secretary to the Department, Mr Lansdown, in his letter of transmittal, notes that it was an extremely busy year and the report shows an enormous range of matters covered by the Department.The stringent staff ceilings, uncertainty and the ministerial capriciousness about policy matters make it difficult for such a department to work and it is to be commended for what it has managed to achieve. There are very serious problems in the administration and development of communications policy in Australia. My view may seem blunt rather than circumspect, but I believe the fault lies with the Government and the absence of a communications policy; and it lies particularly with the present Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department has to deal with a great complexity and convergence of issues. A few years ago broadcasting seemed a very simple matter compared with what it is today. It is no longer so simple because there is a vast convergence of issues as a result of new technologies. In the communications area there is currently an inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal into the possible development of cable television in Australia. As a result of ad hoc government policy, there is an inquiry into the telecommunications system and the desirability of making parts of Telecom Australia's work available to private enterprise. There are the problems of satellite development. We also have within the province of this Department the inquiry into Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> All these inquiries are taking place at the same time. All of them arise from either ad hoc or ideological decisions taken by the present Government which are in no way related to a coherent communications policy. For example, it is ridiculous to have a cable television inquiry being conducted by the Broadcasting Tribunal at the same time as inquiries are being conducted into the future of Telecom because the two matters are intimately related in the sense of both developing technology and capital investment, as well as, of course, in relation to any structural arrangements which would have to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a tragic confusion which the Department of Communications has to try to embrace. Ultimately the Government should get advice on all these things from its Department. It is commendable that the Department has set up a task force on broadcasting development which is referred to at pages 7 and 35 of the report. But it should be noted that this task force was set up by the Department, not by the Minister, and that it was to operate for only six months from February 1981. The question arises as to whether this task force still exists. If so, might it discover some inconvenient facts to bother the Government's so-called policy maker at the ministerial level? One wonders whether the policy issues are simple enough for a group such as a broadcasting task force to be able to second guess the work of two major inquiries as well as to canvass the satellite and general broadcasting issues in a period of six months. </PARA>
<PARA> The notion of trying to lay down policy guidelines and to develop a scenario, if I can use that awful word, for the development of a broadcasting system should be strongly backed by government. Even if the Department, on its own initiative, did develop a scenario and desirable future policy for the development of broadcasting in Australia, can we be sure that the Minister would take any notice of it? He is more likely instead to listen to some unidentified cabal of interests and develop things according to some unexplained and doubtless irresponsible prejudice or ideology of the present Government, the classic example of that being the decision, contrary to the best interests of the Australian business community involved in telecommunications, to give videotext to private enterprise when Telecom had already invested a considerable amount of money-something of the order of $1m-in that system. </PARA>
<PARA> That puts Australia in the position of being the only country in the world, apart from Belgium, where special circumstances apply under which that sort of system, that new technology, will not be developed by the major common carrier, the major provider-the state-owned provider of telecommunications services. We are placed in that one-off category because of the ideological prejudices of this Government. This is quite contrary to developments in Europe. France is moving ahead very much with the development of these services in the hands of government, for very good reasons. As the French Government puts it this is, firstly, because new technologies should be shared equally between the people and should not be the province of only those who can afford them and, secondly, because new technologies involve very severe threats to privacy and it is much better for those technologies to be developed by a government instrumentality than by private corporations which carry with them the threat to individual privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another deep-seated and disturbing phenomenon which is illustrated by the Department of Communications; that is, the increasing tendency for Ministers in this Government to separate themselves from departments. They even thrust departmental officers forward to present issues and proposals not backed by the government; that is, to fly kites. If the reaction is adverse, the Minister can wash his hands of the proposal which has been floated. I raised a similar matter in a question to Senator Guilfoyle this morning. It appears that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) had no knowledge of what his Department was doing about a directive from the Department of Finance. Senator Guilfoyle appeared on television this morning and criticised that Department. I believe that under our system of government a department cannot be criticised without the Minister being implicated. </PARA>

<PARA> Early last year the Department of Communications released a discussion paper on a commercial direct broadcasting service-a very sensitive matter. The document said it was giving attention to the matter without requiring the government to commit itself in advance of experience. The document was put out by the Department, not the Minister. I am not against those sorts of discussion papers but they should go out with the authority of the Minister, not the Department, because the Minister is the person responsible. This should not be a method of making the Department a whipping boy.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia Post, as a government instrumentality, and Telecom Australia, as another government instrumentality, have in a sense been under siege since the Fraser Government came to power. Inquiries have now been set up into their operations on a very ad hoc basis. Very few reasons have been given for those inquiries. For example, the inquiry into Australia Post is clearly designed to expand the role of private enterprise in the area of postal services. I do not think there has been a very vigorous response from private enterprise in seeking to expand postal services. The ideology embraced in the so-called razor gang is being pursued to enable a public utility to be plucked for the benefit of the private sector. Professor Mathews, in his January paper about the activities of the razor gang, made the comment that if this Government devoted as much energy to revenue raising by catching up with tax avoiders as it does to allegedly trying to cut costs, there would be much better government in Australia. That is an important observation. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post is under siege because of the ideological ad hockery that lies behind the activities of that stunt called the razor gang. Since Australia Post was established by the Labor Government in 1975 it has shown increased efficiency. This is borne out by an examination of the accounts, the operating surplus, the amount of mail moved, the staff employed and the cost of mail services compared with the increase in the rate of inflation. Australia Post has had to carry out these operations while being starved of funds by the Government . It needs new equipment and funds in order to better serve its customers. This is not to say that there have not been disastrous attempts at modernisation. This is well known because of the proposals in relation to the Redfern Mail Exchange. There is no doubt that if Australia Post is allowed to compete effectively with private enterprise it can. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reactions of this Government, of course, has been to try to strip Australia Post of its most profitable enterprises. Principally they, like the services offered by Telecom, are services which will result in no cross- subsidisation by Australia Post. People such as Senator Bjelke-Petersen will know that Australia Post subsidises country mail by some $20m a year. So people are able to send a letter from Birdsville or Weipa to Melbourne for the same price as they can send a letter from one Melbourne suburb to another. In my view it is a very good thing that that service exists. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Australia Post is only able to provide that equal service to the Australian community as a whole because it makes profits in some other areas of its operations. Areas where Australia Post is making profits in its operations, areas which pay for this equal service, are being attacked by this Government. For example, the attempt to abolish the Australia Post courier service will result in a decline in profits for Australia Post because that was a profitable operation. It is that area which is being attacked by the Government with the result that in the long term people will have to pay. The first people who will have to pay will be those who live in the outback areas of Australia and who obtain the benefits of cross subsidy and the cross subsidy policy which has been adopted by Australia Post over many years. We think there are many things in the report of Australia Post which require intelligent examination by honourable senators and some thoughtful concern as to how these issues are best resolved in the interests of the Australian people rather than in the interests of a few entrepreneurs who push the Government to try to obtain the profitable work of an organisation such as Australia Post. The report indicates something of that story and expresses some of those concerns. I commend its reading to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to say a few words about the report. When the 1979-80 report was tabled in the Parliament on 24 February last year I complained about the booking system used by Australian National Railways for the transcontinental railway, mainly the Indian Pacific service. I made a complaint also about the way the ANR was crippling small businesses in country areas with an enormous increase in parcel rates. The report tabled in the Senate is the first report brought down by Mr Marks, the new Chairman of ANR. I continue to call the organisation ANR because it is a railway report that we are dealing with. The heading of the report is ' Australian National Railways Commission, 1980-81 Annual Report'. I remind the Senate again of the complaints that I have made made times, of this instrumentality wasting $409,000 of its money in dropping the word 'Railways'. It is now known as Australian National. But whenever a report is tabled in Parliament or we see advertisements in newspapers for loan funds for this organisation, the organisation is always called the Australian National Railways Commission. It is my view that the name should not have been changed. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Marks states in the report that nine months of the operations detailed in the report were under the jurisdiction of the previous Chairman, Mr Smith. I congratulated Mr Smith 12 months ago on the fine work he did over the years that he was Chairman of the Australian National Railways. I will not do that again now. His service is mentioned in the report. I notice-I hope it was because of my complaints voiced on behalf of many people-that the Commission is now altering its method of bookings for railway services. It now has a computerised passenger booking system with the object of obtaining effective utilisation of long haul passenger services. The report states that this can be accomplished only if booking information is centralised and continually updated. That has been my complaint on many occasions in the Parliament. We found that dead cars were running on ANR's interstate train because people who rang for seats on that train were told by railway officers that all tickets had been sold. There was no cohesion between the railway and the tourist agencies which had allocations of seats to sell. The agencies did not always report to the railways the seats that they had not sold. I am pleased that ANR has now taken some action to see that a stop will be put to that and the train will run at full capacity every time it operates. </PARA>
<PARA> I have travelled on trains in many parts of the world. Last year I travelled on the Canadian Pacific from Vancouver to Regina in Saskatchewan. A couple of years previously I travelled on the Canadian Pacific from Vancouver to Calgary. Such trains are of world note. They cannot be compared with our trans-Australia trains; they are second to none. I hope that the Australian service is further improved by fuller utilisation of the seating capacity on trains. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that because of the Standing Orders we are restricted to 10 minutes for debate on these reports. Many of them we could not deal with in the 30 minutes that we were allowed previously, so we have to gloss over them. Under the heading of 'Country Passenger Services' the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Patronage of country passenger services in South Australia continued to decline with a 10 per cent reduction on the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>That is understandable in view of the fact that whilst people who want to travel on passenger trains within South Australia make bookings there is not enough staff on trains to supervise those bookings. I have had many complaints from people who have had bookings on trains run by the ANR. However, when they get on at the station they find other people sitting in their seats. They have to stand even though they have made bookings many days, sometimes weeks, before. In school holidays, some children going on holidays, would have to stand, for 100 kilometres or more despite having made a booking. Yet we find in this report that passenger services are continuing to decline. That is one of the reasons people will not travel on passenger trains in South Australia. I hope the Commission takes some note of what I am saying in making this complaint on behalf of the many people who would like to use the trains but who cannot do so because they find that they still have to stand even after booking a seat. The only way they could get their seat would be to have a fight with the person who is occupying the seat. There is only a guard on the train, and he is fully occupied with his duties. There are now no conductors to whom one can go to lodge a complaint. If there were they could officially remove the person from the seat booked by the other passenger. </PARA>
<PARA> We see some mention in the report also of the increase in revenue from freight rates. I am talking mainly about parcel rates. The small parcel freight service has been killed in the railways. To send a parcel from Adelaide to Murray Bridge , which is a distance of about 70 miles by rail, costs a minimum of $7.50 no matter how small the parcel is. Yet one can have a parcel sent on the bus for $1 . Of course the people are not patronising the railways. In the same instance, people who want to send a small parcel can go to the post office and send it by post. It is put in a canvas bag which is then put on the rail because there is a contract. </PARA>
<PARA> Some mention is made in this report of the increase in revenue from the carriage of mail. That is how that situation is coming about. The railways have lost the direct carriage of parcels. They are going into Australian Postal Commission bags and still being carted by rail but at a much lower price to the people sending them. The railways are losing a lot of freight revenue. Apart from that, this is having a very detrimental effect on many small business people because they cannot afford to pay these enormous small parcel freight rates. </PARA>
<PARA> In the couple of minutes left to me I want to relate to the Senate the complaints from the farming community in South Australia about these increased freight rates for grain and the detrimental effect that is having on the country areas. I do not have time to read the whole of a report of a meeting held at Karoonda Institute on 25 January between representatives of the United Farmers and Stockowners of South Australia, representatives from the Co-operative Bulk Handling Ltd and Australian National Railways representatives but part of the report of the meeting highlights the feeling of the people. The report was written by members of the Australian Railways Union, not by the Australian National Railways. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The feeling of the meeting was that if A.N. continued to charge uncompetitive rates, there would be two losers, firstly A.N. because more grain would go by road transport and secondly when A.N. closed the lines because of lack of traffic, the farmers would be at the mercy of road transport operators re charges. </PARA>
<PARA>I have made that statement in the Parliament over the years. The minutes go on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>After many questions and discussion, sometimes heated, the following motion was presented, seconded and carried. </PARA>
<PARA> 'That this meeting of grain growers express its strong disapproval at the ever increasing rate of freight being sought by A.N. for the haulage of grain. It is respectfully pointed out that the end result will not be more profit for A.N. on the contrary it will be the direct cause of:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Less tonnage and profit for A.N. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Increases in road haulage to terminals</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Congestion at terminals</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Unused space at country silos</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Country rail centres not being fully used</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Further decline in country employment and further imposition on country living including the added costs of road maintenance</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore the meeting recognizing the value of A.N. to the community as a whole , makes a genuine and honest request of A.N. not to pursue a policy which will result in the problems forecasted becoming realities to the detriment of all concerned'. </PARA>
<PARA>I fully support that resolution carried at a meeting of farmers and farmers representatives and attended also by members of the Tailem Bend regional branch of the Australian Railways Union. I hope that at some time in the future, perhaps on the first reading of a money Bill, I will have an opportunity to say more about the need for Australian National Railways to be competitive and to give a better service to people, particularly those living in country areas. I hope that when the report comes down next year we will see that this computerised passenger booking service is operating in a most efficient manner. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving this motion I should like to make a number of points in respect of the Industries Assistance Commission, its report on the industry and, further, the effect of the report and the policies embodied therein on the South Australian economy. I think the hard effects of the report and the consequent Government decision making can be numbered about five. Firstly-this is not disputed-about one-third of the motor vehicle industry in Australia will be killed off by implementation of decisions consequent upon this report. That means a loss of about 30,000 jobs nationally. Secondly, and most importantly in my opinion as a respresentative of the State of South Australia, the decisions consequent upon this report will have a disproportionate effect on the South Australian economy because of our regional peculiarities, the nature of our economy and our already shrinking manufacturing base. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the report will mean an end to the Australian car. Basically, the Australian car will be a thing of the past; indeed, this is already virtually the case. Decisions in the future will more than definitely be made in places such as Detroit and Tokyo. The Australian consumer will have to buy what decision makers overseas tell him or her is available. Fourthly, and extremely importantly in an age of advanced technology, we will see consequent upon decision making a massive de-skilling of the Australian work force. The car industry has indeed been responsible for introducing a vast number of skills into Australian industry, and with the degeneration of this industry we will find a consequent degeneration of the development of skills in the work force. Finally, the one sector that will be affected more than others by the effects of this report will be the migrant sector. People who have historically been working in unskilled areas and who have historically been over-represented, in the motor vehicle industry, according to their proportion in the work force, will find that jobs will no longer be available to them. In this respect I will refer later to the situation at the General Motors-Holden's Ltd plant at Woodville in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis of the IAC report is an econometric model called Orani, which, in the IAC's own words, is a system of equations which impose conditions on a larger set of variables. There are some basic problems with the use of this type of econometric approach by the IAC. </PARA>
<PARA> The first problem is that the Orani approach pre-supposes some kind of perfect economy where all things are equal and rational. It is discussed at length in the IAC report, and indeed it is a crucial factor in the final recommendations put forward in that report. As I said, it is deficient in many ways. When one tries to apply this type of approach to the South Australian economy one is met with extraordinary pressures from within and from outside South Australia both in terms of international and national pressures. For a start, the Orani model takes employment projections only at a national level; it seems to ignore regional pressures and conditions. For this reason it can be rejected as an appropriate approach not only to the South Australian car industry but also to the Australian car industry in general. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing the IAC does not consider consequent upon this fault in the Orani approach is the likely investment response of companies which may be located in more than one region. In this instance once again I mention GMH. If as a result of what the Government announced last year GMH seeks to rationalise it will have to weigh up what pressure it has to reduce the overall scale of its operations. Will it reduce them in one State? Will it reduce them in another? Will it do so in Adelaide or Melbourne? It seems from all the evidence available to us that what will happen in this case is that the GMH plant in Woodville is more than likely to close down. It is ominous in this context to look at the land adjoining that plant in South Australia, and that is the Cheltenham racecourse which the South Australian Government is allowing to close down and be taken over for some type of development. It is my information that that racecourse, together with the degenerating Woodville GMH plant which it is expected will close down in three to four years, will form the basis of a development which the South Australian people and the trade union movement in South Australia have not been informed about but which government in South Australia, in secret cahoots with the South Australian Jockey Club, and GMH, is organising at this moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us return to the Orani model and look at other aspects of it. One other deficiency of the Orani model, when one assesses its relevance in respect of this debate, is its misunderstanding of the labour market. The IAC expresses a desire to have the price of labour float around rather like the price of other commodities, whether they be jumpers, apples or whatever. That is an approach which does not take into sufficient recognition the state of the labour market at the moment. It does not take into account the fact that unemployment levels are already high and, in fact, in South Australia are the highest in the country . The report to my mind has been formulated in a vacuum when it comes to employment, and especially regional employment. The IAC makes a basic assumption about the ability of the Australian industry to mop up any displaced workers. It makes some assumptions about the mobility of the Australian work force. It makes some assumptions also about the mobility of capital within Australia, that by freeing up capital through the lowering of protection further regional based industries will be created where they are economic. What the IAC does not take into consideration is that we have had year after year of structural downturn in our economy, in our industries, and that this freeing up, this mobility, has had more than enough time to operate if, in fact, it is going to operate. The economic environment is not there for it to operate. That has been shown by recent experience. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of the report which I find objectionable is the fact that the Australian workers-male or female-are seen by the IAC as cannon fodder to be used, to be moved around the country. They are expected to pack up their bags and go around the country according to the dictates of internationally based industry. I do not have much longer to speak. Dealing with South Australia, I mentioned earlier the regional aspects of the implementation of a report such as this and Government decisions consequent upon it. There will, in fact, be very few winners under this decision-making process and very many losers-the major losers, of course, will be in South Australia. There will be two winners, as has been assessed by, amongst others, the Sydney Morning Herald. There will be General Motors-Holden's Ltd, a company which has already structured its operation to accommodate the international car, and the Department of Industry and Commerce. The local components manufacturers will be well and truly in a deficit situation after the implementation of the increased export facilitation scheme. As I said, we will see quite a number of people within Australia losing jobs with the implementation of this report. I will not say anything further in respect of this report. I know that my colleague from South Australia, Senator Foreman, wishes to follow me in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that I have to begin where Senator Bolkus left off. The one important thing that he did not say was that the Government has already made an important decision to ignore the Industries Assistance Commission report. Therefore, many of the concerns which he has properly taken into consideration are somewhat irrelevant. The rather esoteric discussion about economic models which Senator Bolkus mentioned I think can be very simply summed up as long term protection at any cost for the motor car industry versus a more competitive resources conscious development of the industry. I will not repeat the basic arguments of the IAC report. I commend the IAC for a very thoughtful contribution to what is quite fundamentally a debate about tariffs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of many of my constituents in Western Australia, and people in many other parts of the country, I express great regret that the Government has by- passed this wonderful opportunity to introduce initiative and enterprise into the motor vehicle industry. I could have said, I suppose, reintroduce initiative and enterprise into the motor vehicle industry. I think we have to say-the evidence is pretty clear in the IAC report-that it is many years since there has been any sort of initiative and, almost from the very beginning, there has been no enterprise at all in the motor vehicle industry. This, of course, is always the consequence of having industries that are heavily protected. The present system of heavy and inordinate protection of the motor vehicle industry is to continue. I think that is sad because it will mean that the present misdirection of scarce resources will continue for years to come to the overall detriment of all Australians-not just us in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest I be misunderstood and considered hard-hearted, I state quite unequivocally-I think I speak on behalf of colleagues in this place and in the other place-that none of us wants the overnight scrapping of all protection arrangements. All we are trying to do is to achieve their gradual reduction and eventual disappearance. The IAC report would have been a very good and reasonable beginning to that process. The day of judgment has been put off. Australia will continue to pay a larger price for scarce resources in the years to come. People in Western Australia and, I think, in Queensland understand, and sometimes it causes them enormous worry, that their export industries-the industries which these two States base their prosperity on-cannot be protected. Somehow, in the fairy tale world that seems to surround commercial arrangements we wish the same criteria would be applied to domestic industries on parts of the eastern seaboard as apply in Western Australia, Queensland or any other State which has to live on its export of resources. Lest I be considered disloyal to the Government for having stated exactly how I feel about this I say that I hope that the Government realises that it is a very hard thing for those of us who have these strong views to bow our heads and accept how the Government has decided to react to this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few points concerning the Industries Assistance Commission report on passenger motor vehicles and components and the Government's plan that has been formulated since that report. I cannot altogether agree with some of the comments that were made by Senator Martyr who has just preceded me. He said that there should not be the amount of protection for the industry that there is. The plan that has been announced by the Government for the next decade will have a disastrous effect upon the car component manufacturers and will, of course, threaten the jobs of thousands of industry workers throughout Australia. The new arrangements announced on 21 December last year will almost certainly accelerate the downward trend in employment in the car industry which we have experienced over the last few years . As a direct result of the decision to extend the export facilitation scheme whereby vehicle manufacturers can import duty free additional components equivalent in value to any increase in exports achieved, employment in the component sector is likely to fall by at least 20 per cent and possibly by as much as 70 per cent. In other words, up to 18,000 jobs in the component sector alone could be lost with total employment falling from the present level of 25, 000 to as low as 7,000. Under the new arrangements General Motors-Holden's Ltd, for example, will be able to import as much as 30 per cent of its components compared with the present level of 15 per cent. As a result many Australian component manufacturers will be forced to close down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The component sector will be the worst hit area. But both the Ford Motor Company of Australia and Mitsubishi Australia Ltd, who are not locked into the world car concept-at least not to the same extent as General Motors, Toyota or Nissan-will also be disadvantaged by the changes. They will not be receiving the massive government subsidy-that is, on the duty free components-that other manufacturers will be getting under the new arrangements. Indeed, some economists have predicted that at least one car manufacturer will be forced to close down, but who and when remain to be seen. Cabinet's decision to extend the export facilitation scheme is a dangerous step in that it makes Australia much more dependent on overseas manufacturers. As a result we will increasingly become just a cog in their wheel. </PARA>
<PARA> It will mean that if a multinational company, such as General Motors, decides, for example, that producing engines in Australia is no longer viable it may decide to close down the Australian operation. This would be disastrous for the car industry workers and the Australian economy in general. After all, we are talking about an industry that is the hub of our manufacturing sector. Many other industries such as steel, rubber and glass are highly dependent on a viable local car manufacturing industry. We are talking about an industry which directly employs tens of thousands of workers and which accounts for 9 per cent of Adelaide's work force and 8.5 per cent of Geelong's work force. Nobody would question the need for some kind of restructuring for the industry. But the Fraser-Lynch plan is nothing more than an attempt to subsidise General Motors and secure funds for the Liberal Party for the next federal election campaign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not know. Perhaps the honourable senator knows. No attempt has been made by this Government to introduce any sensible, long term planning into the car industry, the sort of planning which is urgently needed to maintain job security for car industry workers. As soon as the new arrangements were announced I called for an urgent meeting of car and component manufacturers , relevant unions, the Victorian, New South Wales and South Australian governments and the Federal Government to thrash out the proposals. However, all that Mr Lynch has done on behalf of the Government is to stage a token meeting with the South Australia Premier which achieved absolutely nothing. Despite the fact that thousands of jobs will be threatened the Government did not even offer any plan to assist those who will be made redundant as a direct result of the arrangements. Instead, it simply claimed that the workers would be employed by other industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issues and problems confronting the car industry are highly complex and certainly not unique in Australia. New technology, such as the introduction of robots and other sophisticated production techniques, will threaten thousands of jobs in the next decade. Some sort of long term planning is urgently required and this is why the Australian Labor Party has called for the establishment of a motor vehicle industry authority. The authority would be comprised of industry, union and government representatives as well as independent economists and would be much more effective and practically oriented than the Industries Assistance Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industries Assistance Commission report on passenger motor vehicles and components has led to enormous interest in the Australian community and in this Parliament. It is appropriate that several honourable senators briefly indicate their response to the report and to the Government's decision on the basis of it, not least in South Australia where a very important foundation industry in Adelaide is the passenger motor vehicle industry. Mitsubishi Aus. Ltd and General Motors-Holden's Ltd are of very high importance to South Australians. I am glad to see that the Government's decisions in this matter have not been to endorse the full package of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendations because, I believe, it was judged that there would have been disadvantages in the employment structure and in the continuity of industrial investment that has been placed by Mitsubishi and General Motors in the State of South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I welcome the moderate stand that has been well set out by the Government's decisions. I do not share any of the pessimism and undue criticism indicated just now in the remarks of my fellow South Australian senators of the Opposition . Their estimates have no substantial support. I do not believe that the pessimism which they have had all along in recent months is well founded. As for my colleague from Western Australia Senator Martyr, he comes from a low tariff State where there is not such investment in this basic industry. All I can say to Senator Martyr is that he can easily luxuriate in trying to see some benefit to consumers and to purchasers of passenger vehicles in Western Australia because he does not have the same industrial base to protect. I think we need to try to encourage one another in the chamber to have a sense of national interest . While South Australia and Victoria are the high tariff States, where there is such an investment in this industry that is important for us we need to see a balance between protection of that basic industry and the employment structure that is involved. At the same time, we must ensure that we are still serving well the consumers of Australia, those who are buying passenger motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I especially want to make is that in response to the Government's decision on the IAC report, in South Australia GMH has made a very firm commitment that it is there to stay. Similarly, Mitsubishi, which, in Australia, is to be found only in South Australia, has said: 'We are here to stay'. It will not be the motor vehicle company that some commentators seem to think might be pushed out of the competitive situation that will develop throughout the 1980s. I welcome those statements by Mitsubishi and GMH. I believe that the economic structure for South Australians involved in those two important industries will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus said that there will not be a future for an Australian car and that we will have to accept a derivative of the world car. I think it is a matter of emphasis. The old FJ Holden was regarded as a typically Australian car . I remember that in the Redex trials of the 1950s it certainly performed very well. But who is going to say that that car is superior to the modern world car derivative such as the Commodore or even the Sigma? These cars have drawn very directly upon modern technology, and if there were a Redex trial now I would much prefer to be driving a Commodore than the old FJ Holden which is, on Senator Bolkus's argument, perhaps more distinctly an Australian car, a car produced only for Australia. I feel that the Mitsubishi success with the Sigma and the GMH success with the Commodore is appropriate to Australia's needs. We should commend those companies and face up to the realities; there are economies of scale and advantages in the developed technology appropriate to the world car which we can draw upon here in Australia through the strategies that are now being encouraged by the Government's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one small point about export facilitation. I know that GMH made a commercial decision to be in a position to take advantage of that process and perhaps it is better placed as a result of the Government's decisions in this matter. But Mitsubishi, for example, was, in earlier days as the Chrysler company, the first company in Australia to bring to my attention the call for export facilitation. In 1978 Mitsubishi needed it as a means of overcoming a problem whereby it was not going to meet the 85 per cent criterion and hence perhaps face direct penalties. But through export facilitation then it was very well served and I believe that, by making commercial judgments, it can still be well served on the basis of this plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the commitment of the South Australian Government. I believe $2m was committed last year by the Minister of Industrial Affairs, Mr Dean Brown, towards the cost of restructuring components and motor vehicle industry employment as a result of continuing development such as that involved in the Government's decisions. I believe that the Commonwealth government must continue to give consideration to the transition that is involved in the new arrangements. It must give direct support to South Australia, in particular, as a relatively small State and as a State which continues to be very strongly committed to the motor vehicle industry and thus ensure that there is the least employment dislocation as a result of the transition to new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not share the pessimism of the Labor senators who have spoken on this report. I do not share the sense of criticism that has been put up by the free traders, even from my own party. I believe that what is needed in this situation is a balanced, rational consideration of all the factors involved. That is what we have in the Fraser-Lynch decisions that have been endorsed by Cabinet and which will operate in Australia in the 1980s. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the persistent criticisms that have been mounted by the Labor Party of the present so called co-operative companies and securities scheme is that it involves a system of divided or joint responsibility or accountability which is all too likely in practice to produce a situation whereby the machinery in question and those who operate it and the Ministerial Council who supervise it are in fact responsible, to no one. It is against that background that this report comes to us. It represents one of the very few opportunities that arise in this Parliament for us to scrutinise the operation of the companies and securities law as it has recently developed. It is a matter of profound regret that there should be only 10 minutes available to me and to any other speaker who wants to come in on this to take advantage of this all-too-rare opportunity to look at some of the crucial issues. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is, by any standard, an excellent one. The test of any good annual report by a statutory authority must be its ability to convey an accurate impression-preferably in short compass-of the scope and direction of the activities of the body and, just as importantly, of the manner in which it approaches the discharge of its functions and the exercise of its powers. This report certainly satisfies those tests and is in fact an excellent handbook on the National Companies and Securities Commission. I commend it to anyone concerned about the future of companies and securities regulations in Australia. One particular aspect deserving of a mention is the setting out in the appendix to the report of the first seven policy statements issued by the Commission. Together with the practice notes giving interpretations of aspects of the present substantive law, the policy statements are a model, in a sense, of public communication by a statutory authority and they do represent a significant advance towards those goals of administrative uniformity and commercial certainty which are essential ingredients of a regulatory system in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The occasion must be taken, however, to point to some of the very serious difficulties which have accompanied the operation of the NCSC so far. I have spoken in the past-I will not do so again on this occasion-of one of those difficulties and that is the problem of co-operation between the State corporate affairs commissions and the National Commission. The second problem which is starkly revealed in the terms of the report goes to the resources of the Commission. There is still, and has been since the Commission's inception, a chronic shortage of staff, in spite of repeated calls by the Commission itself, by business commentators and by industry organisations. The approval last week by the Ministerial Council of a so-called 50 per cent increase in the operational staff of the Commission still leaves the Commission something like 16 bodies short of its own minimum assessment of what it takes to run the show at a national level. The so-called operational staff that were approved by last Friday's ministerial council-the eight additional staff in question-were in fact support staff rather than professionals in this area. There is still an acute shortage of senior professionals in the Commission. Given the availability of places to fill, one of the particular problems that the Commission has experienced has been that of attracting operational staff of sufficient professional and commercial expertise. It has been very difficult for the NCSC to do this when it has been forced to pay in effect the gamekeepers so much less than the poachers out in the field are getting. </PARA>
<PARA> The main problem I want to address in my limited time today is not the co- operation problem or the resources problem of the Commission but the limitations and constraints which have emerged already in the legislative scheme supporting the Commission's operations. Unfortunately corporate raiders of the likes of Ron Brierley will always be concerned with the letter and not the spirit of regulatory legislation such as this, despite the laudable aim of really everyone , I suppose, associated with the new scheme-in the language of the NCSC and its report-'to encourage and secure compliance with the spirit and intent of the law and promote high standards of professional competence and integrity'. Regrettably all too many of those people out in the commercial jungle do not share that aspiration or those standards. That was, I think, vividly expressed and communicated by some remarks of Mr Brierley reported in Australian Business this week when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't need a group of commercial failures, bureaucrats and academic dropouts with two or three months' experience in a new area to teach me how to look after small investors. </PARA>
<PARA>With that arrogant and contemptuous attitude being expressed by Mr Ron Brierley it is very difficult obviously for the NCSC to apply the law that it is supposed to be applying in a way that will be effective, and it needs all the co- operation that is possible from the court system. Regrettably, however, that co- operation has not so far been forthcoming and that sensitivity to the aims of this legislation has not been demonstrated in the two main trials of strength that we have seen in the last couple of months in the operation of the new system. The first trial of strength-which involved Mr Brierley-in the Industrial Equity Ltd case decided by Justice Needham in the New South Wales Supreme Court at the end of December was decided, it must be said, on a highly legalistic and unadventurous interpretation of the securities industry and takeover codes, and it had the result of narrowing rather than expanding the NCSC's powers. But it was with even greater astonishment that we read yesterday of the decision of the Queensland Supreme Court in the Pine Vale case involving really a quite extraordinarily narrow interpretation of the Commission's power to hold public hearings conferred by section 36 of the Commonwealth NCSC Act and in similar terms by section 7 of the corresponding Queensland Act. I pause here to note that there is a difference in the terminology of the relevant sections. The power in question, as described in section 36, is 'for the purpose of the performance of any of its functions or the exercise of any of its powers', whereas the corresponding section in the Queensland Act, section 7, is subtly differently worded, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . for the purpose of the performance of a function or the exercise of a power conferred or expressed to be conferred on it by or under an Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The point I am making here-I do not want to get too far into technical detail-is that we have a classic example of the kind of textual disuniformity which bedevilled the so-called uniform companies and securities legislation which preceded the current legislation. For no immediately apparent reason the Queensland Government, in common with other State governments, has chosen to re- enact the actual text of relevant parts of the NCSC Act rather than simply incorporate them by reference. For an even crazier reason, if there was any reason at all, it has chosen to vary the language in which those provisions have in fact been incorporated into the Queensland law. That creates a situation where there is scope for argument by lawyers, as there was in the Queensland case, that the Queensland legislation is slightly more restrictive than its Commonwealth parent. If there was one benefit which was supposed to be claimed by all its sponsors for the new co-operative scheme, it was at least that the text of the legislation in question would be absolutely uniform and that we would not go down this road of textual differences in it from State to State. This is an extraordinary problem that has become apparent just in the last couple of days with this case, and it is an alarming one to have to note at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of matters require immediate reform so far as the legislative framework of this scheme is concerned. One of them obviously is an amendment to the relevant powers to conduct hearings to cope with the Queensland decision yesterday, if indeed that is not overturned on appeal. Other amendments are obviously needed-I have not time to explain why-including amendments to section 14 of the Securities Industry Act, to the operation of section 42 of that Act and to section 60 of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act, all of which have been shown up in stark relief as having problems in the way in which they have been interpreted so far by the courts. Some more general amendments which are clearly needed to the legislative framework of this scheme are, in the first place, the enactment of a section 15AA-type provision in the overarching interpretation code which will in fact require courts applying this legislation to look to the purpose, the policy, the objectives of the scheme in the legislation and not to apply a narrowly literalistic approach. It is necessary for technical reasons to have an explicit provision of this kind in this legislation and not simply to rely on the existing Commonwealth provision in the Acts Interpretation Act. The insertion of such a provision should have very high priority. </PARA>
<PARA> Another overarching amendment that is needed to this legislation is, I believe, one to give the NCSC power to make consistently, to the extent that this can be done under Commonwealth constitutional constraints, binding orders without having to go to court. At present its powers to make binding orders are very limited and there is a whole series of matters, particularly its section 45 powers under the takeover code concerning the restraining of the disposition of shares and so on, in which the NCSC simply cannot move quickly and directly to deal with problems as they emerge. Innumerable problems are emerging in this whole legislative framework. It is regrettable that the attitude of the present Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Moore, has not been one of more alert attention to the problems. The same goes, I regret, for his ministerial counterparts in the States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the expression of concern we have just heard from Senator Evans, but first I would like to support the remarks he made about the standard of the report of the National Companies and Securities Commission. I think it could be used as a model for others as to how reports should be presented by such a body. The Senate has expressed for some years concern as to the standard of reports made to the Parliament by statutory authorities and departments. I commend the National Companies and Securities Commission for giving a lead to others in how to present a report in which the type of information and the manner of presentation of that information are excellent. I would like also to refer very briefly to the fact that it is my belief, and I am sure the belief of all members who made up the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, that in making the recommendation that there be a national commission in relation to companies and securities one of the most fundamental, essential and important powers for investor protection, for speed and efficiency of inquiry and for action and information to be available to investors was the hearings power given to the Commission. Of all the powers that it had to have to be effective, that was the most essential and the most important. otherwise the fear was that it would be slow moving and that there would be repetition of the defects which were identified in so many of the case studies undertaken by that Committee in presenting its report to the Senate .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It goes beyond disappointment for me to find, as I did yesterday when I heard of the judgment in the Pine Vale case and started to inquire as to how it could come about, that there has been what Senator Evans has referred to-a reduction in the powers of the Commission by the States in re-enacting legislation which went through this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator. I can only say that I was neglectful in not having checked every piece of State legislation in this regard . I had assumed that we could trust the States to enact legislation in the same form as and in the spirit of what was intended to be the agreement; that is I assumed that there would be uniformity. We find that we are back to square one. We are back to the same situation of the non-uniform uniform Companies Act. We have all of the problems which that created. The decision made in Queensland by Mr Justice Sheahan is an excellent example of this. He certainly had my sympathy when he said that it is a very complex lot of legislation. Certainly I have never said more in support of the co-operative federalism approach than that what the States have done was not recommended by the Committee. But rather than have nothing, if that was what the government of the day wanted, I would support the proposal in order to get something going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Never did I expect to find that people would curtail the clear and most important single power of the Commission, thus creating a situation in which real doubts exist, as identified by Mr Justice Sheahan, as to what is the nature and extent of the hearings power which the Commission has. I support the need for urgent consideration of what steps are necessary to ensure that this matter is cleared up immediately so that the Commission can fulfil the function for which it was created and for which so many people in this country have been waiting so long. Just when the commission was appearing to become effective, to be able to start to use its hearing power and to be able to provide information to the market, to investors and to anyone else who is concerned to ensure that the takeover code operates effectively, the States curtailed its hearing power. It did so without reference to this Parliament, without anybody being made aware of the fact that they were curtailing it. This has brought about a situation which I believe requires urgent remedy. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no further comment than that at this stage, although I believe that we are entitled to expect some response from the Minister as early as possible next week as to what sort of action is proposed. I recognise that the question of what is now to be done is a complex one. I recognise that there are sensitivities in the relationships with the Ministerial Council, but surely we are not going to have a situation in which the scheme is destroyed virtually without consultation, without our knowledge, by the complete changing of the nature and extent of the powers which this Parliament understood it was giving to the national Commission. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I will deal separately with the reports dealing with the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. I think it would be true to say in relation to both the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island that the average Australian would not be aware of the fact that the Australian Government has some jurisdiction over as well as some responsibilities for these two small outposts on the north- west perimeter of the coastline of our country. They are areas which in fact have no basic links with Australia but which for historical reasons and because of the activities of the United Nations on the question of former colonies have come under Australia's jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot criticise the report in terms of the information that is provided. One can accept as being factual all the historical and current evidence that is set out in the report. A number of answers to the problems which are raised in the report have not been provided by the Australian Government in preparing the report. For example, the Senate will remember that a few years ago the Australian Government was persuaded to expend in excess of $6m to acquire the Cocos (Keeling) Islands from Mr Clunies-Ross in the belief that this would provide an environment in which the indigenous people-I suppose one could argue that they are not indigenous, but in any case they have had an association with the islands for the last three centuries-would be able to proceed to make decisions about managing their own affairs. But of course, as the United Nations mission that went there last year found, the influence of Mr Clunies-Ross, who saw himself as the uncrowned king of the islands-we left him in possession of several acres of land-still exists, inhibiting and in many ways restricting the aims of the United Nations and the Australian Government. I am sure that there is a degree of unanimity in the national Parliament about the rights of the people to self-determination in every sense. Nevertheless, as the report indicates, Mr Clunies-Ross's mere presence in the islands is a factor that is inhibiting the proper progression towards self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to point to a number of other weaknesses that still have to be faced by the Australian Government. One can say that the Australian Government's mandate in this area still leaves much to be desired. The report indicates that there is a need for a great deal of diversification of economic activity on the island, that they should not rely on copra as the principal source of economic influence and development and that there is a need to extend the economic aid that is presently provided so that the people who have remained virtually untouched by mankind in a cultural sense will be able to progress towards development in the way in which the rest of the modern world has developed. The report indicates that steps ought to be taken to overcome the isolation of the people. They are living in such a state of literal isolation that they are not able to appreciate the evolution of man that has taken place in most other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations report deals also with what the United Nations believes to be deficiencies still present in terms of the participation of the residents in the management of the islands. It points to the need for a lot more education input. There is a need for encouragement of the people's cultural, personal, social and educational development if they are to be able finally to survive in the environment in which they live. In other words, there is a lack of overall development. The United Nations has found that whilst the islands are moving towards the objectives to which I refer it is nevertheless a slow development. The United Nations report also makes reference to the fact that the Cocos ( Keeling) Islands are a tax-free haven and that a number of foreign companies have taken advantage of this fact. In the annual report of the islands the Administrator, Mr Buffett, on behalf of the Australian Government, quarrels with that statement. I think the report is deficient insofar as there are two conflicting views on this matter. The United Nations report talks about foreign companies using the Cocos (Keeling) Islands as a tax haven. We know what the professed aim of this Government is in relation to tax havens. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1980 report of the Australian National University illustrates two points. From page 9 onwards the university has taken some trouble-I think it has succeeded-in presenting to the wider community the results of research undertaken within the previous year at the university. It has presented these reports in a manner which is intelligible to the layman. This is an essential element which has been missing from many university reports to date. I hope that in future university reports details of research carried out will be presented in the manner in which they are contained in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> From page 71 onwards the interrelation between the work of universities, particularly the Australian National University whose report we are considering, and the wider community becomes very clear. I point in particular to the major contribution that academics at the Australian National University have made to government. Page 71 and following pages of the report show that much of the expertise that the Government is able to call upon is provided by universities in Australia. There are people acting as chairmen of a whole variety of boards who are available to serve on various commissions and inquiries. It seems to me that all too often in a discussion on universities in Australia the phrase ' ivory tower' is used. The report of the Australian National University has made it much more clear that ivory towerism is not operating there. The university has a very great involvement with and makes a great contribution to the general public and to the Government. The funding of universities, in part, is recouped by a government being able to draw upon this enormous range of expertise. I suggest that part of the case for adequate funding of the universities may be based upon keeping available and enhancing that expertise which is freely available to the community and to the Government. I think that the Australian National University's annual report is to be commended for drawing the general public's attention to those two aspects-the wide research that the university is undertaking and the contributions it makes to the general community and the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also would like to refer to the report of the Australian National University and to take this opportunity to congratulate the University it on appointing Professor Peter Karmel as Vice- Chancellor. I do so not only because of the personal merits and abilities that he will bring to the Australian National University but also because he has been for more than the last 10 years a senior servant of the Commonwealth Government. He has given direct advice to the Government and this Parliament on tertiary education matters and he has brought his very considerable experience to that task. I think it is well known that he was once Professor of Economics at the University of Adelaide and went on to be the first Vice-Chancellor in the founding years of Flinders University, in South Australia. He was also Vice- Chancellor of the University of Papua New Guinea. Then he was appointed the fourth Chairman of the Universities Commission, as it was then called. In 1977 he became the foundation Chairman of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission when the three tertiary advisory councils were amalgamated into that body. He also was interim Chairman of the Schools Commission in its first two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This record demonstrates a very comprehensive and full commitment to the cause of education in Australia. There are few people in this country who will exceed his range of experience in various aspects of Australian education. At this stage of professor Karmel's career it is quite exciting to think that he can apply himself to our pre-eminent university, at least in the sense that it is the one for which this Parliament has approved statutory provisions and the one which has the focus of international attention because it is here in the national capital. I hope that the experience that Professor Karmel has gained in his various appointments can be brought to the council of that University and its departments so that, in dialogue with his colleagues there, we may see developments in the quality of university education at the ANU and, by implication, an example to perhaps other Australian universities and colleges. For my part, I want my very full regard and respect for Professor Karmel to be noted. I wish him well in this appointment and the ANU well in the years ahead during which he will be Vice-Chancellor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I wish to make a brief comment in relation to the Academic Salaries Tribunal and that is to draw the Government's attention to a serious problem that has arisen. I hope that in future it may be avoided. The establishment in Victoria of the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission which is chaired by Mr E. Taylor has, as late as this morning, refused to consider the flow-on effect to colleges and universities in Victoria, of Mr Justice Ludeke's judgment in the Academic Salaries Tribunal review of 1981 . His judgment has been that he will not consider the matter until 15 sitting days after it has passed through both houses of this Parliament. I point out to the Government that it would cause serious embarrassment and dislocation for Victoria if it is treated differently from the rest of Australia. I hope that the Government will seek in future to make sure that the review of the Academic Salaries Tribunal goes through both Houses of Parliament as rapidly as possible to avoid the disruption which will occur unless we are able to take that particular action.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a sad occasion to the extent that it represents Al Grassby's reporting swansong so far as this Parliament is concerned. That may be a matter of profound indifference or a matter for applause so far as some of the more insensitive Government senators in this Parliament are concerned. But Al Grassby has been an indefatigable advocate of racial tolerance in this country of ours. He has fought a long and distinguished fight against prejudice and discrimination in the community at large and in the breasts of certain State governments and their Ministers in this country. In doing so he has had to fight , for most of the last six years, the overt hostility and lack of co-operation of this present Commonwealth Government. Certainly the manner of his departure from the independent status which he has hitherto enjoyed, and the manner of his no doubt inevitable departure altogether from this field when his seven-year term runs out later this year, does the present Government no credit. </PARA>
<PARA> The reports which Mr Grassby and his staff have prepared, compiled and distributed over the last six years are superb social documents on any view. His present one is no exception. As I say, it is sad that it seems inevitable that the voice of Mr Grassby and his staff will no longer be directly heard in the future. Of course the reason is that Mr Grassby has disappeared now within the flabby bowels of the Durack Human Rights Commission which was finally established on 10 December last year. He is not a commissioner of that body. He retains his title as Community Relations Commissioner under the statutory provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act but he is subject to the direction, discipline and everything else of the largely part time Commission which is being superimposed above him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a question of whether he will be ever given that degree of independence and responsibility by that body. I know there are some more sensitive souls on the Commission, certainly including the Deputy President, Peter Bailey, who I know is concerned to make the Commission work well. Significant progress has been made in the last few months in devising work programs and so on. But it is clear, so far as the Goverment is concerned, that it regards the Commission, finally thus established, as being an essentially cosmetic exercise designed more than anything else to satisfy potential critics overseas about Australia's inactivity in the domestic human rights arena. I do not want to go into a repetive diatribe on this matter because I have done it before but we know that the powers vested in the new Commission are limited in the extreme. Its jurisdiction is limited in the extreme, confined as it is for a start only to the Commonwealth level of governmental activities and not extending, as would be constitutionally possible under a more advantageous government, into the civil liberty depredations of the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had occasion to describe the Commission recently as a paper mouse in that not only is it weak, but it also looks weak. I also had occasion to describe my reaction to most of the present commissioners on the Human Rights Commission, who have not, between them, chalked up-despite the credit in which they are held in one way or another in their various professions-or established any kind of reputation as vigorous and effective human rights campaigners. Indeed, as I have said elsewhere, they have barely rocked so much as a dinghy between them in their previous professional lives. That is the kind of body that has been created; that is the kind of personnel. One would have to have more optimism than I have that they are going to perform the job in the future that Mr Grassby and his staff have so effectively performed in the past just in the racial discrimination area. But so much for that. </PARA>
<PARA> If, as seems certain, the official voice of Mr Grassby is stilled in the future , nonetheless it must be said that his influence will linger on in the reports which have been put down in this Parliament over the last six years. They amount -this one, in particular, does- to a detailed record of just how endemic prejudice and discrimination continue to be in this community. They amount to a record and a description of just how much effort is needed, both at the educative level and at the conciliation and enforcement level to counteract the effects of that all too pervasive prejudice in both word and deed, that applies in the community. Mr Grassby's report is a record, as all too many of his previous reports have been, of just how little co-operation in the process of creating a more civilised and tolerant society he has received from a number of governments at an official level in this country, conspicuously, of course, the Queensland Government which is presently embarked on the enterprise of trying to rub out completely the Racial Discrimination Act by subjecting it to constitutional challenge in the High Court of Australia. It will be a black day, indeed, if the High Court, in the next couple of months when it hears and determines this case, does come to the conclusion that technically the powers are not there to establish this kind of national legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is also, in particular, a record of how much racial intolerance there is, not just by deed or by the actions of publicans and public servants and so on, but how endemic still is racial intolerance and predjudice manifested by word in crude, offensive, racist literature. I want to say something more about this in a moment. One whole chapter of the report demonstrates, as previous reports have too, just the extent to which overtly racist organisations continue to operate in this country, many of them, only with a tiny number of people directly associated with them, others like the League of Rights, which under cover of one or another of a number of front organisations has many thousands of people subscribing directly or indirectly to the really rather crude racist tenets which are propagated by that organisation. That does, I think, raise a number of questions which I will come back to in just a moment about what our response as legislators, as policy makers for the whole community , ought to be to that phenomenon. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of points that I specifically now want to make using the report as a base rather than specifically referring further to anything in it. The first point I make is one about the emergence of a more sophisticated kind of racism in the last year or two, particularly in recent months, which can be charted. We are, and have been for a long time, familiar, regrettably, with the kind of thuggish racist organisations which I have mentioned. We have been familiar, I suppose, in recent months, with some crude manifestations of racism showing their ugly heads again. I am referring, I suppose at one level, to the actions of the Queensland Government in challenging the Act, but more specifically and more obviously I am referring to the lunatic genocidal nonsense that was mouthed by Lang Hancock last year and the more recent calls for the return to the white Australia policy that were so vociferously promoted by the Victorian Returned Services League President, Bruce Ruxton, again in the latter months of last year. But it is not that to which I am referring. I think we are sophisticated enough as a society to be able to cope with that and to shrug it off as the crude excess that it obviously is. </PARA>
<PARA> What I find a little more alarming and what I want to draw to the attention of the Senate is the more sophisticated racism which I see as being evident in the attacks on multiculturalism which are being mounted, in particular, by people such as philosophy Professor Lauchlan Chipman at the University of Wollongong, a leading member of the Quadrant group of intellectuals whose views are particularly reported in a long article in the Melbourne Age on 2 October last year but have had a good deal of circulation elsewhere. Chipman describes the kind of multicultural society which people such as Al Grassby, of course, have been long promoting and which is very much crucial to my party's view of the world, as being 'divisive' and as the product of 'political opportunism'. He expresses himself as being opposed to the preservation of the separate integrity and identity of ethnic traditions on the grounds that, while some traditions are valuable, others are not and ought not to be encouraged. He implies the propriety of selectivity in the maintenance of different ethnic traditions. He says that the old policy of assimilation of different ethnic traditions within the larger Australian community was, by contrast, effective and a proper course of action to adopt. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a point of view, of course, assumes, and it does so in a very subtle way, that the Anglo-Saxon culture of which most of us are part, the Anglo-Saxon tradition, is superior and that other migrants and in particular black Australians, Aborigines, must improve themselves by becoming like us. Migrants treated as second-class citizens under the old assimilation policy that some of us can remember all too well will be only too well aware, in turn, of the kind of society that Professor Chipman and others like him in the Quadrant group have in mind for them. I think the sentiments of the white Anglo-Saxon superiority and all the nastiness that is associated with that underpins the thought of Chipman and his intellectual peer group-his very influential intellectual peer group-every bit as much as the kind of jingoistic bigotry of people like Lang Hancock and Ruxton. I believe it is our responsibility as parliamentarians and as public figures in one way or another to resist what I perceive to be an alarming tendency of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I make-I will finish on this-relates to how we should react to these cruder forms of racist vilification as promulgated by organisations such as the League of Rights and many others much less well known and often much more overtly crude in the stuff that they produce. How should we, in fact, deal with it? Do we just note its existence, condemn it when we are confronted with documentation of the kind contained in chapter 4 of the present report and then pass on or do we do something about it? The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination which Australia signed back in 1966 and which we ratified in the last months of the Whitlam Government on 30 September 1975 contains a clause which commits signing and ratifying parties to do something about this phenomenon. It is article 4 (a) and is in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> State Parties . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof;</PARA>
<PARA>When Australia ratified that Convention it did, in fact, express a reservation about the implementation of article 4 (a). That reservation, which was expressed by the Whitlam Government, was in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> ''The Government of Australia . . . declares that Australia is not at present in a position specifically to treat as offences all the matters covered by article 4 (a) of the Convention. Acts of the kind there mentioned are punishable only to the extent provided by the existing criminal law dealing with such matters as the maintenance of public order, public mischief, assault, riot, criminal libel, conspiracy and attempts. It is the intention of the Australian Government, at the first suitable moment, to seek from Parliament legislation specifically implementing the terms of article 4 (a).''</PARA>
<PARA>Since then nothing has happened. It was not possible for the Whitlam Government to do anything more about implementing that intended state of mind because, of course, the Whitlam Government was not with us a short two months after this ratification. It is inevitable that lively controversy will be generated by any attempt to legislate for the supression in any way at all of incitements to race hatred, the dissemination of racially offensive ideas. Obviously a tension has to be resolved between the demands of free speech, free debate and free comment, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the very obvious disabilities involved for racial minorities in particular in our community who have to tolerate the kind of sentiment generated by that kind of propaganda. I am all too well aware of the difficulties of finding a satisfactory formula to legislate in this area because I was involved in another capacity in trying to draft the language of the original Racial Discrimination Act and to negotiate with the then Government Ministers on behalf of the then Attorney-General, Senator Murphy, some agreed and acceptable formula at a time when, as now, there was a hostile Senate. I am aware that it is a problem but it is a problem that I think is--</PARA>

One of the bits to go during that transitional period was in fact the section designed to implement article 4 (a) of the international convention. I do not suggest that a dismissive attitude was taken by the then hostile majority in the Senate to that matter. It was just a matter of obvious difficulty in reaching an agreed formula . I do not underestimate the difficulty now of reaching cross-party consensus on that problem, but at the same time I do not think we ought to go on putting that issue into the too-hard basket.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that some initiatives are presently being planned within my own party, as I hope they will be in the Government parties and by the Australian Democrats, to come to grips with this issue and see whether we cannot, acting together in this larger matter of community interest, find some way of legislating effectively both to discharge our obligations under the international convention and, more importantly, to try to remove what is all too obviously and all too clearly a continuing running sore in our society. I am talking about the continued prevalence of manifestly offensive racist literature of no redeeming social benefit whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I repeat that this report, which raises that question amongst others, is an admirable document, recording as it does the boundless efforts and the boundless energy and goodwill of an admirable Australian, Al Grassby, and his admirable staff. It is a matter for regret, I think, that the calumny that all too often has been heaped on his head by members of the governing parties over the last five or six years has not been matched by an equally overt appreciation of the fine work he has done and the fine series of reports that have been produced under his name. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am inspired by the eulogy of Senator Evans, but unfortunately it was tinged with a fair amount of diatribe as well. I wish to make some remarks about this report and Mr Grassby. I would not like to follow Senator Evans into the line on which he first proceeded in discussing this report, namely, the attack on the Human Rights Commission Bill. He regards it as a mouse and he is valiantly battling with it. He wants to give it a bad name as a mouse before it has even got under way. It is perhaps not quite worthy of him to do that, having regard to the fact that he and the Senate know my views on the work of the Commissioner for Community Relations and the Human Rights Commission. Of course I have reason to think that in the remaining period that Al Grassby is Commissioner good work will be done and the two bodies will work together very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Insofar as reports are concerned, it is true that there will not be a separate report in future by the Commissioner on racial discrimination. On the other hand , one may anticipate that in the reports of the Human Rights Commission there will be a very substantial description and full-blooded reportage on the work done in relation to racial discrimination by whoever may be the next Commissioner and on the way in which it is being carried out by the other officers of that Commission. I do not see this as the end of an era in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that this is the last report Al Grassby will put before this Parliament. I believe that Al Grassby has done a very good job in this community in filling the position as Commissioner for Community Relations. He has worked with very few staff and with a great number of restrictions on the way in which he could follow through many of the complaints, but the records which he has given in his reports in the last six years have demonstrated some very worrying matters in this country and have pointed out for us the need for a better method of clearing the problem. We certainly do not have the problem under control in any way. We owe a great debt to Al Grassby for what he has done in bringing forward these examples and giving to the Parliament such a frank record of his administration over those years. In the time he has been in that office I have had a number of occasions to have dealings with him. He was a member of another political party and his views are probably very different from mine in some ways , but I believe that he has followed his course as a commissioner conscientiously. I believe that in the course of those years, though criticised by many, including some of my colleagues, he has stuck well at the job. Sometimes he has been perhaps too flamboyant; sometimes he has certainly made mistakes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to add some remarks to the comments already made by Senator Evans and Senator Missen on the appearance of the sixth annual report of the Commissioner for Community Relations. Like my colleague Senator Evans I greatly regret that this will be the last independent report coming from Mr Grassby as Commissioner for Community Relations. Because it is the last report, of course, it is of particular importance. As honourable senators will be aware, the reports coming from Mr Grassby in the past as Commissioner for Community Relations under the Racial Discrimination Act were the only independent source of information to this Parliament and to the Australian public generally on the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. It is because of the extremely thorough investigations that Mr Grassby was able to carry out and because of the very brave documentation of those investigations of racial discrimination that Australia today is much more aware of the existance of racism in this country than it was before Mr Grassby started this work. I am one of those people who believe that once the Australian people become properly aware of the existance of racism in this country they will be determined to eliminate racism. I am not one of those people who regard Australian society as particularly or inevitably racist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans made reference to some of the racist organisations in this country, and their existance is a real blot on our national life. But, as Senator Evans pointed out, there are not many of them and they certainly do not have many adherents. We would like to have a society in which there are none. As I said, I believe that Australians are not inevitably or naturally racist and that many of the racist practices, particularly against Aborigines, have been carried out and have been able to be carried out because most Australians have not been aware that Australian Aborigines have been suffering this kind of discrimination. This, I believe, has been the real value of Mr Grassby's work; that through investigation and documentation and independent reporting to this Parliament he has been able to place on record the kinds of discrimination that Australian Aborigines have to endure. Thus he has been able to raise the consciousness of the Australian community and gain support for Government measures and community measures to bring about a truly racially tolerant society . </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, under the legislation passed by the Fraser Government in 1981 Mr Grassby, as Commissioner for Community Relations, will have to act upon and be subject to the directions of the Human Rights Commission. Both Senator Evans and Senator Missen have made some predictions about how this new relationship will work but, of course, I am inclined to agree with the predictions of Senator Evans. It seems to me that Mr Grassby's independence will be eroded under the new arrangements. It seems to me also that the Human Rights Commission, as currently structured, will not investigate and report to Parliament in the same vigorous and fearless manner on race relations in this country as Mr Grassby was able to do. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Thomas suggests that that is an unfair prejudging of the situation. My response to that is to ask: If the Government wanted the kinds of reports on race matters that Mr Grassby has been making to continue to be made to this Parliament why did not the Government appoint Mr Grassby as one of the commissioners for the Human Rights Commission? If the Liberal Party totally supports this kind of brave investigative reporting to the Parliament then it ought to have allowed Mr Grassby to continue in that position by appointing him as a commissioner. I think that is a great set back to the new Commission. We all want it to succeed but obviously we have doubts. It is a grave setback to the Commission that Mr Grassby was not appointed as a full commissioner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to how the changes of status will affect the work of the Commissioner for Community Relations and what the relationship between the Commissioner and the Human Rights Commission will be. The Commissioner states on page 6 of the sixth and final report:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner has neither been consulted nor informed on the Government's policies, legislation or intentions and, until the new Commissioners have been appointed, the basis of operation within the amended legislative framework cannot be known. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is a great shame that the Government did not consult Mr Grassby on this matter. Whilst the Human Rights Commission is now in operation and some excellent commissioners have been appointed to it, grave reservations about the Government's motives in amending the Racial Discrimination Act and altering the status of the Commissioner for Community Relations remain. I should make clear what I think the basis of the Government's watering down of the Racial Discrimination Act and putting aside of Mr Grassby is based on. I believe that it is based on the Federal Government's unwillingness to come into confrontation with the State governments of Western Australia and Queensland on race matters. I have said that in this place before and, unhappily, it will probably be necessary for me to say it again. It seems to me that the very forthright reports that Mr Grassby made on racist practices backed up by State governments in Western Australia and Queensland are the reason the Federal Government found itself unable to appoint Mr Grassby as a full commissioner. I would like to make it clear that I do not have objections to the establishment of the Human Rights Commission but I do object to the downgrading of the Commissioner for Community Relations in the process. Under the amended legislation the Commissioner no longer has the powers of a permanent head within the Australian Public Service, no longer has staff in his own right and, of course, as I have said, can no longer report directly to Parliament. The Commissioner for Community Relations has not been appointed as a member of the Human Rights Commission but has been made subordinate to it. It is my fear that this loss of independent statutory powers will limit the effectiveness of the Commissioner-a concern which has been echoed by many members of the community concerned with human rights. </PARA>
<PARA> For six years Mr Grassby's thorough and perceptive reports have provided the only ongoing monitoring of racial discrimination in this country. The education and research functions carried out by his office are unique in Australia and are invaluable if racial discrimination is to be eliminated. Through Mr Grassby's work we have learnt that racial discrimination in Australia is widespread and that the most severe and persistent racial discrimination is suffered by Aboriginal people. Mr Grassby's work in conciliating in cases of racial discrimination and bringing them to a peaceful resolution has had a high degree of success and has attracted international praise for Australia. So the Government's apparent intention not to re-appoint Mr Grassby in a commissioner role reflects on its political prejudices and not in any way on the calibre of Mr Grassby's work. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of effective measures-by that I mean measures that can actually change the situation-to guarantee human rights in Australia cannot be underestimated. The Australian Constitution has no guarantee of human rights. Mr Grassby himself has pointed out in this report that the common law in Australia has not proved an effective champion of the rights of the oppressed and the disadvantaged. Mr Grassby has, however, proved a powerful figure in defending such rights. In this respect I express the hope that the Human Rights Commission will emulate him. In his current report Mr Grassby outlines also the pressures which his job has entailed and the reasons why autonomy is vital. On page 2 of his report he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It must be noted that in almost all the cases against Departments and statutory bodies, a ready response has been made to the Commissioner's inquiries under the Act, and indeed in most cases exemplary co-operation has been the order of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases, however, there has been a complete lack of co-operation, announced public hostility, attempts to interfere with the Commissioner in the performance of his duty, and great pressure either to drop investigations, abandon them, or bring them to a 'no conclusion'. Only an Office operating with complete independence can be expected to resist such pressures . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I endorse Mr Grassby's remarks. Unfortunately, no such independent office will now exist. It is obvious from previous reports of the Commissioner that the pressure and hostility that he describes have come mainly from this Government's Liberal and National Country Party colleagues in the Western Australian Government and the Queensland Government. The Queensland Government, as honourable senators will be aware, is currently challenging the validity of the Racial Discrimination Act in the High Court of Australia. This is a case of great importance as it will determine the future of anti-discrimination legislation in this country. Of course, I am happy to congratulate the Federal Government on its defence of the Racial Discrimination Act. I trust that the defence will be successful and, if not, that the Government will take urgent action, if necessary through constitutional amendment by referendum, to ensure the protection of human rights in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I congratulate Mr Grassby on six years of very hard and very effective work against racial discrimination in this country. I am sure, speaking as the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, that a majority of Aboriginal people in this country would join me in congratulating Mr Grassby. I simply express the hope that the newly formed Human Rights Commission will do as creditable a job as Mr Grassby has done in the last six years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition senators have rightly referred to the substance of the six years of reports and work of the Commisioner for Community Relations. In doing so they have been halting in their commendation of the support that this Government has given the Commissioner for Community Relations and the attitudes expressed by this Government in such matters as setting up the Human Rights Commission and in other ways seeking to diminish those areas of racism and discrimination that exist in Australia. Senator Evans, in fact, referred to the overt hostility of the Government towards the Commissioner for Community Relations. I think the honourable senator does himself no service to imply that there is a monopoly of virtue or insight in the Opposition or, indeed, even in the Commissioner for Community Relations. It is on that note that I want to make just a few remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has already been well put by Senator Missen that during Mr Grassby's term of office he has brought to attention-as is his responsibility-those transgressions against understanding and good community relations that ought to exist in Australia. He has particularly brought to light incidents of racial discrimination. But in so doing he has not only been brave or energetic as some honourable senators have said today but also, I think, sometimes self-indulgent, exaggerated and, as a result, divisive. I have in mind the flamboyant style of Mr Grassby, particularly noting his political commitments of the past. His reiteration of strongly-held political commitments and even his seeking of political office in Australia-that cannot be denied to him, he has every right to his own views-have meant that his exaggerated and, I think at times, self- indulgent style has exacerbated some divisions and has made it more difficult to bring full unison to these questions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that there has been overt hostility to the substance of the work of the Commissioner for Community Relations but there has been a lack of popular support for the exaggerated statements made from time to time by Mr Grassby as if there were a monopoly of virtue or insight residing in him or in his office. I believe that is shortsighted. It is the kind of fault which has led to less than full support amongst the people of Australia for Mr Grassby to continue to hold that kind of important position. I do not believe that any honourable senator in this place or any parliamentarian would condone the overt racism of anti-immigration bodies in various parts of Australia or the individual statements such as that which was made by Lang Hancock late last year about Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some deplorable events, statements and incidents in Australia that need rightly to be analysed, condemned and acted against. But if any white knight arrogantly believes that he has a monopoly of virtue-I am not applying those phrases directly to Mr Grassby-I believe there will be a disservice in bringing division to the views of ordinary Australians of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the case of various industrial leaders and parents who have criticised the education system in Australia because it is seen by them to have inadequacies in orienting or equipping school leavers for employment with the skills necessary to take them through their lives. Some statements are made by industrial leaders that the schools are totally lacking in fulfilling their traditional duties. Some of these exaggerated statements do not assist anybody because they are divisive. They alienate teachers who are doing their best at allowing young people to gain an education while they are in their classrooms. </PARA>
<PARA> If there are exaggerated statements by industrial leaders, for example, against teachers or against the education system, we are not taking any positive or constructive steps to remedy the problems that are there. It is that kind of indulgent and exaggerated statement which, in the education area, can be divisive and counter-productive. Similarly, I believe that there has been a view in the minds of many Australians that that kind of divisiveness has sometimes come from statements made-perhaps even with the best motives-by Mr Grassby in his role as Commissioner for Community Relations. There is no monopoly of virtue , insight or understanding in these matters on the Opposition side or on the Government side. Any attack upon the present Government as being overtly hostile to Mr Grassby or to the whole purpose of the work of the Commissioner for Community Relations is misplaced criticism. I wish only to give some substantial reason as to why there was a lack of full confidence in the work that Mr Grassby has achieved. I come back to my opening remarks when I said that the work of that office has been substantial and has been directed towards the achievement of a better society in Australia over these past years. We look to the Human Rights Commission, indeed to this Parliament, to all manner of social activists and commentators throughout Australia to remedy the series of problems in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I note, not with any sense of being blind to the inadequacies that remain in this area, that during the 1970s there has been a very welcome change, an increased understanding of Aboriginal community problems in Australia and a willingness to come to terms, to understand and to share in the problems of Aboriginal communities. Similarly, I believe that the acceptance of various immigrant communities through better settlement arrangements, better migrant education programs, and a better understanding of ordinary Australian neighbourliness that has been experienced by ethnic communities, is a far cry in the improved decade of the 1970s from earlier times in Australia. There were times when overt racism and a lack of understanding were endemic in many parts of the Australian community. But I believe that there have been welcome increases in understanding during the 1970s both with regard to the orginal inhabitants of Australia and to other minority, immigrant groups. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the levers towards understanding has been the presence of overseas students in Australia; an intelligent, well-disposed group of persons who have come here with different cultures, languages and customs and who have become very familiar, particularly in our capital cities where they have studied. The enormous good will that Australians shows towards overseas students has been part of the process of percolating this increased understanding of ethnic and Aboriginal communities amongst the broad mass of Australians. That process has come about not only because we have had a Commissioner for Community Relations but also because any explanation would lead to a reference to many centres of increasing understanding by Australians. I appeal to Opposition senators not to feel that they are the only ones bearing the burden of enlightenment, virtue and insight in this Parliament or in this country but to have some generosity towards others in the community having a like commitment to increasing understanding and good community relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I will be brief. I am at least grateful for Senator Teague's remarks. I had gathered, after listening to Senator Evans, that he had the monopoly in this Senate of virtue in community relations. I believe that Senator Evans grossly impugned the reputation of Professor Lauchlan Chipman. Honourable senators can make their own judgments about what Professor Lauchlan Chipman actually said by obtaining a copy of his paper through the Parliamentary Library. I think they will find if they read that paper that Professor Chipman was not indulging in any kind of racism, let alone the sophisticated racism of which Senator Evans accused him. I say to the Senate that Senator Evans's charges are totally baseless. Professor Chipman's general fairness and logic, his perception and, I think, his articulation are greatly appreciated by a great many people in this country. I do not think they will be put off by the false labels that Senator Evans attaches to him. Because Senator Evans has a basic ideological difference with Professor Chipman on a number of matters there is no need to bring his name into this debate and start a witch hunt, a scare campaign against him on things that he never said and never implied. If honourable senators want to judge this matter properly for themselves they ought to read carefully the Hansard report of exactly what Senator Evans said. They will see that it is Senator Evans's implications that are dangerous to the reputation of Professor Chipman.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is why I wish to correct what I think was a wrong accusation by Senator Evans. There are just a couple of other things I would like to say. Again I insist on defending the rights of the sovereign States in matters of community relations. It has been well said by people on both sides of the chamber that there is no monopoly of wisdom in community relations. There are difficulties and there probably always will be difficulties. But I draw the attention of the Senate to the rights that the States have. If the Commonwealth uses force it will produce only bitterness. These matters have to be worked at in the long term. They have to be very gradual. With regard to the application of immediate force, I think that if the Opposition thinks about it again it will realise that there is no profit in that, and there never was. The only other thing I would like to say is that I have always liked Mr Grassby. I wish him well in the future. I have not always totally supported his efforts but I think that by and large what he has done has not been to the detriment of this country .</PARA></TALK.START>

I can assure him that a State such as his under its present control and a State such as mine under its present control would be delighted to take over the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations with the express purpose of abolishing it. Both have racist attitudes in relation to our indigenous people as well as other people who come into the country as migrants. If these people are less than white they are last in the queue for jobs.

In relation to my other opponent, a prominent preacher, I am quite amazed at some of his utterances and his contribution to this debate. Because of the restrictions placed on Mr Grassby's office, which this Government has now watered down, of course, by putting it into another channel, it has been extremely difficult for the racial discrimination which so often rears its ugly head to be eliminated. I refer in particular to Queensland where the name of Grassby and anybody associated with him is held in extreme hate by the Premier of the State and by most of his Ministers, including that famous police Minister , the tiny little Mr Hinze. Currently in my office cases are being handled in relation to racial discrimination which has reared its head in the Townsville area and in other areas to the north and south. It has reared its head so many times in the last two or three years that the statements made by Senator Teague and Senator Martyr, that it is being eliminated, are not correct. Because there is greater tolerance in some sections of the community racial discrimination is not as open now as it used to be. But it still goes on behind the scenes and every so often it is exposed publicly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect, Mr Deputy President, I would like to convey my best wishes to Mr Grassby. I extend my compliments to him on a job that he has done while his office has been operating under extreme pressures from many sections of the Liberal Party not to do some of the things that he has done and, particularly, under absolute opposition from all members of the National Country Party. I hope that no further restrictions will be placed on the Office and that the two previous speakers will change their attitudes to a whole number of things. I hope that they will adopt a greater degree of tolerance. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that both honourable senators let their skirts show when they expressed a rather thinly veiled hate for the politics of Mr Grassby. Mr Grassby is entitled to belong to any political party. He is entitled to participate in any public activities that he wants to. The fact that he happens to hold a public office should not preclude his doing so. I have heard people on the Government side of the chamber so often say that they belong to independent local government teams. When one looks at the independent local government team it is entirely made up of people who belong to conservative parties. They deny it publicly when they are in that particular role and exercise it quite openly after they obtain office. I suggest, with the greatest encouragement in the last surviving weeks or months of this Government, that all members of it do everything they can to assist the new organisation and to give Mr Grassby every assistance. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>My brief remarks on this subject do not, I think, have the same potential to arouse the backwoodsmen of this Parliament as other remarks of mine have, but one is never quite sure. I congratulate the Ombudsman, Professor Richardson, and his staff for producing what we have come really to expect from him-a thorough, detailed and informative Ombudsman's report. I note that it is substantially abbreviated by comparison with the report for the previous year, 1979-80, for reasons which are spelt out on page 1, namely, the increased work load which has been placing a great demand on the resources of the Ombudsman's office. Nonetheless, the only respect in which the report is really reduced is in the detailed reporting of individual cases. The main features and the quality of the report are certainly maintained and a sufficient selection of individual case notes is given to give at least a flavour of the Ombudsman's operations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly welcome that an officer to whom so many members of the public are having recourse should provide, through his annual reports, a clear account of his method and approaches to the resolution of problems that come before him. For example, last year there was in his report a very helpful discussion on his approach to the power to recommend a remedy where he concludes that an official action is, in the language of the Act, 'unreasonable or unjust' . This year there is, again by way of example, a very frank and useful account on pages 12 and 13 of the Ombudsman's interpretation of that provision in the Act which prohibits the Ombudsman from investigating a matter where there is in the individual a right to pursue some remedy in a Federal court or tribunal unless, the Act goes on to say, the failure to exercise that right is not unreasonable. It is a very vexed question for people trying to advise other people of their options as to just what all that means, and I am pleased to see that the Ombudsman has given us a full account of what that means in his view. I am also pleased to see that he exercises a very flexible approach in determining when a failure to pursue a formal remedy is in fact not unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> Some particular points need to be noted about the operation of the Ombudsman's office and the Government's facilitation of reasonable requests that have been forthcoming from it. The first point I make goes to the very obvious and visible expansion of the work load of the Ombudsman, which demonstrates the growing public awareness of the existence of the office and a perception of its effectiveness. Oral complaints, we are told, rose from 8,535 in 1979-80 to 11, 345 in the last financial year. Written complaints similarly expanded from 2,646 to 2,824. Last year's report expressed its support for a recommendation of the Administrative Review Council that the Act be amended to formalise and, in the process, to streamline the procedure for dealing with oral complaints, but this appears still not to have been acted upon by this Government. I take this opportunity, as I will briefly with respect to several other matters, to draw attention to that failure to act. It is on these occasions when dealing with these reports that these points should be brought home to the Government about its failure to move. </PARA>
<PARA> Then again, and very importantly, there is a whole series of jurisdictional problems which have continued to plague the operation of the Ombudsman's office. The last two reports have referred to the need for extensive statutory amendments to resolve these jurisdictional problems. They were listed, for example, in the 1979-80 report as including, among others, the following difficulties: The definition of prescribed authority; the scope of Commonwealth employment matters from dealing with which the Ombudsman is precluded; the definition of statutory office holders; how to deal with bodies not established by statute; the question of private bodies in receipt of Commonwealth funds; the question of State bodies in receipt of Commonwealth funds; and questions relating to complaints about government policies. Each one of those areas raises very difficult jurisdictional questions. On all of them the Administrative Review Council has made recommendations of one kind or another, but there is still no sign of remedial legislation forthcoming. Nor is there evident on the part of the Government any attempt to implement another recommendation made by the Ombudsman in his report which would help in a partial way to solve these problems; that is, the suggestion made on page 11 of the report that the Act be amended to enable the Ombudsman to apply to the Federal Court himself for the determination of jurisdictional disputes between the Ombudsman and a department. One asks, no doubt to the empty air in the absence of the relevant Minister from this chamber, what will be done about this request for a procedural machinery to be created for everyone's convenience?</PARA>
<PARA> A number of other problems in the operation of the Ombudsman's office and the exercise of his jurisdiction are evident from the report. They are lingering sores from year to year about which no action seems to be taken. Let me mention finally just two of them. There is the problem of de facto relationships, dealt with at page 34 of the report, and the differing treatment and administration of claims arising from de facto relationships by the Taxation Office, on the one hand, and the much more insensitive, as has been the case in so many respects, Department of Social Security on the other. If the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), who happens to be sitting at the table at the moment, has anything to offer by way of comment on that differential treatment of de facto relationships by the Taxation Office, on the one hand, and the less liberal Social Security Department on the other, we would be delighted to hear from him. That is a long-running problem to which the Ombudsman refers which clearly it has not been possible to resolve satisfactorily, notwithstanding successive mentions of the problem in his report. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the other continuing saga of Telecom Australia. One successful resolution of a problem in relation to Telecom is described on page 21 of the report. At the same time the Ombudsman points to the fact that, as he has indicated previously, there is still a fundamental problem in that section 101 of the Telecommunications Act 1975 renders Telecom immune from actions for loss suffered by persons by reason of any default, delay, error or omission, whether negligent or otherwise, by Telecom. There is a continuing saga of injustices which seem to have been denied remedy by virtue of that statutory prohibition. That is not something the Ombudsman himself can solve. It just means that he has to try to negotiate solutions in the absence of those legal remedies. It is clearly a problem in the fair administration of the present law which is adverted to. It demands a Government response and we wait in vain for one. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman's report is not by any means just an account of problems that have been experienced by the office. It is also a record of very considerable achievement now over the four years or so that the office has been in active existence. Many more individual matters are the subject of report in some detail in this document and there are very many illustrations of the extraordinarily valuable role that this office continues to play in making Australian government more sensitive and more accessible than otherwise it undoubtedly would be. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have plenty of other things to say about the report. The first instance to which I refer is an inquiry conducted by the Ombudsman's office several years ago at the request of an Aboriginal enterprise in South Australia known and registered with the Companies Office in South Australia as Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd. This company, at the request of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, asked the Ombudsman's office to inquire into certain things. The Obudsman's office did so. Because of factors which I have pointed out in the Senate on many occasions, there was an undue delay in completing the Ombudsman's report, to the extent that the company wrote to the Ombudsman asking his office to discontinue the inquiry. The greatest problem now is that there are people in South Australia who are prepared to peddle a document-a letter which came from the Ombudsman's office-for personal purposes and to endeavour to discredit the Aboriginal people. They are prepared to peddle that letter around to local newspapers, the daily newspaper, radio stations and television stations-to wherever they could get it. They say that this document is the Ombudsman's final report. It is not, far from it. I have correspondence from the Ombudsman to say that it is not. He is most annoyed that this sort of action is being carried on, that the document is purported to be the final report from the Ombudsman on this inquiry. This is a cause of great concern to many people in South Australia and in particular to those very fine people who live at Narrung and who are shareholders in the Ralkon Agricultural Co.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had discussions with the Ombudsman. There is no way under the Ombudsman Act in which the Ombudsman can release that final report unless the company asks him to do so. I will not say much more about the matter because court cases are pending. I think that when we get the result of those court cases many of the things that I have said in the Senate will be vindicated and some of people who have tried to ridicule me will have red faces. That is one of the matters about which I wanted to speak, because people are saying that in fact the final report of that inquiry has been published and they are using that letter as a final report, which it is not. As I have said, I have letters to that effect from the Ombudsman himself. There may come a time when I will have to use them in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter in the Ombudsman's report to which I wish to refer is dealt with on page 2. Under the heading 'Extensions of function', the Ombudsman states :</PARA>
<PARA> A third likely extension of function is to be found in the Freedom of Informantion Bill which passed in the Senate shortly after the close of the year . The Bill provides that a person unable to obtain access to information may make a complaint to the Ombudsman under the Ombudsman Act 1976. In this fashion a person will have an alternative avenue of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>I have not received any legal advice on this matter but in view of that statement by the Ombudsman I expect that members of parliament and particularly honourable senators may have to take the avenue which he has suggested to get answers to questions which some of us have been asking for many years, which answers have not been provided by the Government. The first one that I have in mind relates to the office occupied in London by the previous Governor-General, Mr Kerr. For many years I could not get an answer to my question as to whether the Government even provided him with an office. But due to a blow-up in the Senate last year when we were dealing with the Estimates the Government got cold feet. Senator Chipp had said: 'Next time round if the information is not available we will see that it is; we will hold up the Bills in the Senate'. To my surprise, last year some of the requested information became available in the Budget Estimates. Likewise we were able to get information on the cost of running the Lodge and Kirribilli House and one other function. The information was very sketchy but at least there has been a breakdown in the previous attitude. I come to the matter that I am concerned about. I have also been told by the Department of Administrative Services that in fact that Department pays rent for an office in London for the ex-Governor-General-the former Governor- General who now lives in exile. For many years I have been asking this question: What is the cost of the telephone service provided to one Mr Kerr? We cannot get that information. I have made a few statements about this matter in the Senate. On 11 November last year my colleague Senator Keeffe asked a question on this matter. The answer that he received from Senator Carrick reads:</PARA>
<PARA> On 11 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2007), Senator Keeffe asked me as Leader of the Government in the Senate, a Question without notice, concerning the cost of facilities for Sir John Kerr. The Prime Minister has supplied the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been the practice of successive governments to provide former Governors- General with office facilities, a secretary and access to car transport. The expenditure is covered by parliamentary appropriation. In London, Sir John Kerr-</PARA>
<PARA>I am only reading this answer, I do not concur with titles but I have to read the answer as it is in order to put it in its proper context. I think titles are favours bestowed on people for services rendered which they are paid to give anyway. I do not think those people should get these titles. The answer continues:</PARA>
<PARA>has facilities available in line with this practice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but not Imperial honours. The Order of Australia is a different matter altogether. In view of that answer I am now of the opinion that in view of what the Ombudsman says on page 2 of his report there may be an avenue open to members of parliament to pursue such matters, particularly where an expenditure of taxpayers' money is involved and the government of the day refuses to disclose how much money is being expended. As I have said, I have been pursuing this matter for quite a time. On 26 November 1980 I moved in the Senate as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate views with grave concern the continued refusal of the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, to answer repeated calls from Senator McLaren for information as to whether he has provided the previous Governor-General with a free telephone service between Great Britain and Australia, and if so, what has been the total cost to the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, as all honourable senators know, I will be pursuing that matter again very shortly. When the Supply Bills are introduced into the Senate I will seek that information. In view of what we are now being told-that money is being tightened up, that the Parliamentary Library cannot get money to buy new books and has to buy paperbacks, and that sort of thing-I want to know how much it is costing the Australian taxpayer to provide this man in exile with a free telephone in London. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am serving the taxpayer. I was elected by the taxpayers; he never was. I am still working for the taxpayers; he is not. Senator Missen would know that. I will be pursuing that matter. I think it now comes within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, so we might have to make a reference to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter about which I am concerned and which would also come within the ambit of the matters mentioned by the Ombudsman is the matter of taxpayers' money being used by the Government to have certain inquiries undertaken. When one asks for a copy of the report of an inquiry one is told it is a confidential document. I refer to the Marks report-the report produced following the inquiry commissioned by the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman. I had reason to write to Mr Newman on 4 December last year about some of the recommendations which have been implemented following the Marks report and how they are affecting the Commonwealth car fleet not only in Canberra but also in all of the capital cities. I will not go into that matter now because I will deal with it at the appropriate time. The thing I am concerned about is that Mr Newman, in the final paragraph of his letter to me dated 2 February of this year , stated:</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to your request for a copy of the Marks report I regret to inform you that I am unable to comply as the report is a confidential document. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst Mr Newman might say that the report is a confidential document, the inquiry was conducted at the taxpayers' expense. The report should be a public document. That is another matter which may have to be referred to the Ombudsman for inquiry-as he said, it can be done under the Freedom of Information Bill-to see whether we cannot be provided with that information. Of course we all know of the great trauma that we had in the Senate last year in relation to the Auditor-General's report to the Minister for Primary Industry relating to Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Pty Ltd. Whilst the Government says that that report is confidential, that the inquiry was an interdepartmental one, that inquiry also was carried out at great expense to the Australian taxpayer. I could go through and list a whole series of areas in which this Government is engaged in expending taxpayers' money. Yet the Government surrounds all these inquiries with a cloak of secrecy. We are unable to ascertain what it is costing the taxpayer for these inquiries to be carried out first of all and then what is contained in the reports. We in the Senate and the Australian Parliament and the people who elect us to come here are entitled to know these things when we ask such questions. We should not be fobbed off repeatedly by a government that is penny pinching in many areas, yet expending many hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars in other areas. It will not tell us what is in the reports when they are handed over to the respective Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I have put the message across that if we do not get those answers we will look very seriously, in view of what the Ombudsman said, at what avenues are open to us on this side of the chamber. I mentioned in particular the Freedom of Information Bill which was referred to earlier today when Senator Missen thought he was being accused of not supporting the legislation when he did support it. I would say that he, being a fair-minded senator as he claims he is, would support Opposition senators using that piece of legislation to get the information which we require. I see that the honourable senator is nodding his head in agreement. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement was made by the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) in relation to the report on grants to voluntary conservation organisations which was presented to the House of Representatives in May 1980. As the statement shows, the report, although it was a report to the other House, has been of great interest to those who are interested in environmental matters and in the question of the funding of environmental organisations. The report arose originally from a request by Senator Webster in 1979 for a report on the program. It was therefore looked on with eager anticipation. </PARA>
<PARA> The report which the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation put down analysed the change over a period of years in the financing by the Commonwealth Government of voluntary organisations. I regret to say that that funding has, in real terms, declined quite considerably. Paragraph 35 of the Committee's report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes the comments on the amount of money allocated to this program. Grants totalling $323,000 were made in 1973-74 to 17 organisations, on the basis of recommendations of the Hope Committee. In 1979-80, $350,000 was allocated to 26 Organisations. In real terms the amount of support provided by the Government has dropped considerably, although support from other sources has increased. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a matter of concern to me, as chairman of the Government members home affairs and environment committee, that there has been a quite considerable whittling away in real terms of the amount provided. Of course, the grants now are to cover 26 organisations rather than 17. Therefore, when the House of Representatives Committee made proposals I had a great deal of support for them. Grants to conservation bodies were made on the basis that for every $2 of Commonwealth money provided up to a specified amount the conservation group must provide $1. In 1979-80 this was changed to a dollar for dollar basis. It was suggested that it was not desirable to impose further demands upon organisations which, by and large, are busy in the conservation area but which may not be terribly brilliant at the raising of money. They do not have great sources of supply. </PARA>
<PARA> In the ministerial statement which was tabled, one finds that the Government strongly supports the grants to voluntary conservation bodies but, regrettably, as one reads it, it is clear that although this is declared to be a healthy sign of democracy, the result of the ministerial decision is that the recommendations for additional funding or a relaxation of funding requirements are not to be acceded to this year. One brighter aspect is that for 1982-83 it is said that the case for additional funding as presented by the Committee will be considered . But I regret to say that in the last few years, as the value of that funding has declined, there has been no change. One must hope that it will at last be recognised that every year means a further loss in the support which these organisations get. Likewise, the Government has not acceded to the request that the dollar for dollar matching requirement be relaxed. It says that there should be a decrease in the dependence of conservation groups on government. The situation has come to a stage where the amounts of money they are getting from government are relatively small parts of their income. I think that a lack of funds greatly inhibits organisations which very often have to present massive submissions requiring a great deal of competence. The organisations come up against mining groups, companies and all kinds of organisations with a great deal of expertise at their disposal. The work of conservation organisations is becoming more and more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommended that additional funding be given to conservation groups to enable them to undertake special projects. Regrettably, again the Government has found that this is not possible and has decided that no special fund is to be established. On the other hand, the Government has agreed to the Committee's recommendation in respect of the eligibility criteria for funding under the program. It has acceded to widening those criteria so organisations will have a better opportunity of qualifying. A major recommendation made by the House of Representatives Committee was that the basis for advice in allocating funds should be the Australian Heritage Commission, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the principal conservation organisations in each State as well as the organisations under the Minister's control. Unfortunately, that recommendation has not been acceded to. I regret it because I believe that those organisations have a very considerable knowledge of who is doing the effective work in this area. It should not be left merely to ministerial advice from the Ministers' departments. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that organisations such as the Australian Conservation Foundation have found that their grants have been eaten into over the years. The effectiveness of these organisations is weakened by the failure to increase considerably the total amount available to volunatary organisations. In moving that the Senate take note of the paper, I regret the paucity of hope and encouragement which the paper gives. I hope that in the determinations for 1982-83 there will at last be a recognition of the fact that if we believe in conservation and voluntary work being done by organisations we also have to be prepared at least to maintain the value of those grants in response to the inflation rate. In fact, they are falling behind year by year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Missen's comments regarding this matter. The extent of support to the conservation movements has given rise to an increasing degree of concern within the Australian Democrats. We feel there is a philosophy abroad that somehow conservation movements are a group of econuts who are doing something on their own personal behalf. The truth of the matter is that, by and large, with few exceptions, they consist of thoroughly dedicated people who have an enlightened and proper view of the future. They attempt to see that everything is not looted in this generation by Senator Martyr and his friends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently I was in the Mt Windsor Tableland area. Senator Martyr's colleague and friend Mr Bjelke-Petersen proposes to cut down national monuments in the form of 1,000 year old trees. This will destroy the last remaining piece of distinctive Queensland rain forest in the world. the order has been given that between now and 1985 that area is to be milled and every large tree taken out of it. This will not be for any useful purpose. It will not add one square metre to the amount of building carried out in Australia. It will all be done for veneer. Instead of having these magnificent trees where they should be, in the forest where people can appreciate them, the wood from them will be on the front of somebody's furniture, which, of course, is the worst of bad taste as a result. What will happen when these big trees are chopped down? There will be no regeneration of the forest. I have been there and I have seen the sort of regeneration that is taking place in the Mt Windsor Tableland. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bonner will know what I mean when I talk about gympie bush, a form of stinging nettle. The entire cleared areas of the Mt Windsor Tableland are being taken over by dense thickets of gympie bush. That will make it a lovely place for people to go in the future, will it not? Why should that happen? Why should not the people who want to prevent that happening be given reasonable support by the Government? I think they should. In any case it should be recognised that they have got the poor end of the stick in their task of fighting large corporations. They do not have money resources and the Government is taking good care to see that their financial resources are continually eroded so that its friends, the big companies, can defeat them easily in court actions. That is the situation. A large company can afford sufficient legal rodomontade, complication and delay to ensure that costs are run up very heavily for conservation organisations. I know a case in New South Wales-I do not want to mention the name-which concerns the--</PARA>

Is the honourable senator aware that a certain company there has used legal costs, used the threat of bankruptcy, against people in that movement to shut them up? I do not think that is good enough. In other words, one could say the battle is to the strong. If we are going to interpret the strong as being people who have influence and money and say that because of that they will have a licence to destroy everything, I believe we will have a world which will be in the end, I imagine, like China was in the 1940s when a person could travel for scores of miles and not see a tree growing. I feel quite sure there are plenty of people who would exploit the situation to that extent. The evidence is there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Missen made the point that conservation organisations are doing a reasonable and worthy job, and I respect him for putting that point of view. I think the time has come in the community when the genuine requirements of conservation are recognised more and more by more people, especially young people. The Government and the people it represents are afraid of that. They feel that it is essential somehow to cripple these organisations, to handicap them in some way so that their influence is minimised. This is a very dangerous thing for Australia. It is wrong. It is not in the interests of the future. I urge people such as Senator Martyr who have a categorical view that there is nothing good about conservationists to think again, to think what sort of world all of our great grandchildren will see if somebody does not take into account what will happen at assets such as the Mount Windsor Tableland which are genuinely irreplaceable within any span of time that we can think of. It takes 1 ,000 years to grow a 1,000 year old tree, but it can be cut down in a day. </PARA>

The judges in that litigation were absolutely outraged to think that their time had been wasted by such a nonsensical litigation. I am not certain that any Commonwealth Government money was vested in the particular organisation which undertook that litigation, but if such were the case it would not surprise me. In my opinion the Government has funded some very strange causes-causes which seem to be more dedicated to the downfall of this Government than they are to the preservation of the environment . Fundamentally there is not really a good argument for funding extra- parliamentary conservation groups, or any group for that matter. I cannot see why they should be favoured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are various kinds of right to life organisations in this country. They are about wanting to protect human beings. I am not aware that any of those organisations get any subsidies from the Government. They have to raise their own funds and conduct their own battles. I do not see why it is that so-called conservation groups which think they are protecting the environment-the environment which is to be used by human beings, and human beings are far more fundamental in the environment-should be subsidised either. I think it is another one of these funny situations where the Government has mistakenly ordered its priorities. I am following a very consistent line. From the first day that I became a member of Parliament in the other place I made a decision, as a result of some experience over the years with groups which call themselves conservation groups, that they were not conservation groups. On the evidence I believe that my stand is right. They were not conservation groups at all; they were political groups with political objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude as I began. I like clean air and clean water and a decent environment and that is what I think conservation groups ought to be about. They ought to fund themselves. I do not see any reason why this or any other government should fund such groups. If they have the ideological guts and persistence, as have other organisations in the community, let them fund themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to be associated with the remarks made on this matter by Senator Missen and Senator Mason and to be critical of the unenlightened contribution of Senator Martyr. He fails to understand the important post-war development that has taken place in the thinking of people on a world wide scale. In the Western countries, where a movement for conservation and protection of the environment began and took on the very important task of creating an awareness and consciousness within the community, there was a need to have an impact upon governments. I think the best example of that was the movement to save Fraser Island. Unfortunately, those of us who were involved also with saving Lake Pedder did not succeed in doing that. But we certainly did, with assistance and by creating public interest and public awareness, finally see a position taken by the Federal Labor Government on that matter. The stance was taken by the then Prime Minister Mr Whitlam and followed through, to his credit, by Prime Minister Fraser. The value, therefore, of the small amount of money that is allocated annually to the conservation and environment movements of this country is an investment worthy of being undertaken by the national Government and by State governments throughout our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is wrong to get into an area of controversy as Senator Martyr attempted to do. He suggested that we should see one thing against another. In fact, government encouragement and support for community action groups is, I think, a very worthwhile obligation that governments ought to have. If we look at the work that is being carried on by many conservation groups we see that they are, as Senator Mason indicated, not concerned with self-advancement but with protecting the community's interests and assets. To that extent they are protecting the public assets of our country. </PARA>
<PARA> There ought to be a public input to public awareness campaigns. For example, when I first worked in local government I thought the right and proper thing to do was to reclaim the waterfront swamplands. Unfortunately I worked in that direction for a short time. Everybody applauded that belief; that was the community attitude at the time until it was drawn to our attention by community groups and by people involved in the conservation movement that that was the very worst thing that could possibly be done. Finally, a decision was made by the national Parliament, by Mr Whitlam, to take over the whole of the Towra Point wetlands area on the southern foreshores of Botany Bay-some 500 acres of unique wetlands which are incomparable with any other part of Australia. This area was saved because of the work done by a few pioneer groups. To suggest therefore that it is morally wrong and unethical for public funds to be expended creating enlightenment and understanding, awareness and action, to preserve such important heritages I think is failing to understand part of our responsibilities as a Parliament and as citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> Will we always take the view that the silent majority is right in all things and that the vocal minority is wrong and therefore should not be assisted in the preparation of its case? Of course, that is an argument that ought to be demolished once and for all. It is the responsibility of a responsible government and of a responsible Parliament to give impetus to organisations that are seeking to protect the public interest. What has happened? This Parliament has passed legislation which requires the preparation of information- environmental impact statements. Of course, in many cases, as you are well aware , Mr President, this means that tremendous resources are applied to this area by those who have the financial resources. Surely it is inequitable to suggest that we ought not give some public funds to those organisations that want to put forward a contrary viewpoint on these matters. I do not regard these matters as political campaigns. They are political in the sense that there is a struggle for ideas. To that extent they are political. They are not party political. They are political to the extent that they seek to change community attitudes, local government attitudes, State attitudes and finally national attitudes. I think public funds ought to be available to do just that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with Senator Gietzelt in refuting the false prophecies that Senator Martyr produced. I do this in a very temperate manner. I will stagger Senator Martyr with chapter and verse to disprove the fantasies that he advanced today. In doing that I will deal with the famous battle that took place in the 1960s over the Colong caves in New South Wales. That episode contained all the ingredients and fears that Senator Martyr spoke of in his speech. The Premier of the day, Sir Robert Askin, was told that if he did not allow the mining companies into the Colong caves New South Wales would lose its cement industry. There is no secret that the Australian Workers Union is affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. I have had a lifetime friendship with Charlie Oliver. The union at that time had some of the fears mentioned by Senator Martyr. I said: 'If the cement companies search other parts of New South Wales they will find limestone deposits'. The Colong caves were protected and the AWU did not lose a member. For good measure, in support of this matter, the member for Sydney, a number of other people and I took six weeks to get ourselves into condition and we ran two miles in protest. Senator Martyr can chew on that. I gave practical support for the conservation of those caves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are the alternatives if society remains passive? There are two classic illustrations. A Bill was introduced into this place several years ago providing for the Federal Government and the New South Wales Government to put in $1.5m to rehabilitate the Molonglo River. The state of the river at that time was caused by the ravages perpetrated by the Lake George Mining Co. That company no longer exists. I sat on a committee, though not one I am always involved with, together with Senator Bonner and Senator Keeffe dealing with Aboriginal matters. Representatives of the Australian Mining Industry Council were called before that committee. I asked them about that matter. They told me that in the days that this occurred, society did not expect companies to observe standards. This is what this is all about. If an active minority is vigilant, they make big business do a little better. I am not obsessed about matters for which I have concern but I can say that companies do like to have a good image today. The British Petroleum Co. of Australia Ltd has gone to great lengths on Barrow Island to protect the habitat of particular rock wallabies. It now advertises that BP cares for the rock wallaby. It is getting the spin-off in the form of a good public image and our wallabies are being protected. It is a case of sanity.</PARA>
<PARA> The other classic case involved one of our pioneering committees, the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution. We went to the Northern Territory. I am not indicting only private enterprise; government establishments are just as bad. Consider Rum Jungle and what was done to the Finniss River. Honourable senators know that the Australian taxpayer was slugged but if a mining concern had been more vigilant we would not have been forced to put our hand in our pocket to rehabilitate that river. </PARA>
<PARA> Every time I play a game of golf at Massey Park on Exile Bay in my own area, I see the pelicans gliding into the river. I think it was a Senate committee that exposed not only the damage that the Australian Gas Light Co. was doing to that river but also the fact that State government authorities in New South Wales were not talking to each other. As a result of our vigilance, the river pollution was reduced to an absolute minimum. Pelicans have now come back to the Parramatta River. </PARA>
<PARA> These are vivid illustrations. I know that Senator Missen is on my side 100 per cent on these matters. I am not utopian. I know that in my own State there are occasions when one has to say to the present government: 'You will not get all you want for the border ranges national park but you will get something'. The powerful Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment went to Senator Missen's State several times to the forests. Three years before the Victorian State authorities had given evidence about the Leadbeater possum and forest enclaves of old gums. We were told: 'Yes, it will be all right'. Two years later we knew that it was not all right. Senator Melzer, a very active senator from Victoria, and I went back to this area on a sub-committee and the authorities admitted that they had been a bit sluggish. I do not know that the Victorian sawmillers are affected simply because of a few forest enclaves. </PARA>
<PARA> I join with all my colleagues in this place in defence of the cause of conservation by saying that as in everything else there have to be restraints at times. Perhaps I can use a better analogy. Some people-fortunately there are few of them-want to emasculate completely the trade union movement. If that happened I know what would happen to industrial safety conditions for example. The same situation applies to conservation groups. If we did not have them we would not have had the achievements we have seen. It simply means that the conservation people have said to mining groups and other groups: 'You have to do a bit better '. The vast majority of commercial enterprises realise that if they do the right thing they will get good publicity, as BP Aust. Ltd did. But there are others who never have any social conscience. They are the ones that the conservation movements and their Senate friends will always be watching closely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to offer a few comments on the debate that has taken place. There is a big difference between the position put by Senator Missen and that put by other contributors to this debate because there is a balance between government revenue and government expenditure. When speaking on matters which have come before the Senate Senator Missen has consistently supported the need for governments to get revenue to use for the support of various issues. Those who consistently refuse governments access to revenue and call on governments to spend more money are living in a world of unreality. Senator Mason is competing for the tautology prize of 1982. He solemnly advised the Senate that it takes 1, 000 years to grow a 1,000 year-old tree. We will make sure that that is made known to those who award the tautology prize.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank honourable senators for the kind remarks made about the Australian Conservation Foundation, of which I am a member, and about my old union, the Australian Workers Union. But I want to make some suggestions to Senator Mason on this question of giving governments the revenue to work. We were impressed by his statements on 21 October 1978. Senator Colin Mason presents himself as an honourable man from an honourable party, a party that goes to the electors saying: 'We are the honest people of politics; trust us'. Senator Colin Mason, on national radio-are we to believe him?-said:</PARA>
<PARA> No, we will not be blocking them then for reasons which we have stated time and time again that the Democrats have said that we will not precipitate a re-run of November 1975. We see that if the sales tax legislation were blocked permanently from the Government it would be interfering with their budget . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Mason had to say. Was he misleading the Australian public on that day? I would not dare think so. After all, his party presents itself as a party of honesty. Senator Mason spoke in this place on 16 September 1981 on behalf of himself, Senator Macklin and other people. He quoted from the statutory declaration which the Australian Democrats have sworn. The quote included these words:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the Australian Democrats, if gaining a position of 'balance of power' in the Senate would not use their voting numbers in such a way as to cause the blocking of supply or money bills in a manner which would prevent the majority party in the House of Representatives from governing. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mason also quoted these words:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and thus shall never during my tenure as a Senator--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not my intention to take part in this debate at all until I heard Senator Peter Baume's latest effort. Before I make some remarks about what he said in the Parliament I would like to refer to what Senator Gietzelt said about conservation groups. He said that when he was president of the Sutherland Shire Council-I think it was in the early 1960s- there was an idea that filling in the tidal land and the land around the coast to build football fields, reserves and parks was the right thing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall give an example of the way in which the wheel has turned as far as conservation movements are concerned. In the early 1960s I was a member of the Dee Why Surf Life Saving Club in Sydney. We formed a committee which was to work towards filling in the Dee Why lagoon and turning it into football fields which could be used by the surf club during the winter season. We were opposed by a very small group at that time. We went along with the usual theories: We thought that they were all ratbags. We wondered why they would want a smelly old lagoon kept at Dee Why when they could have nice green playing fields. Legal action was taken by a small group of people and we finished up not getting our playing fields. The years have gone by and we have found out that the Dee Why lagoon is the last natural tidal lagoon in the Sydney metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of us who were in the surf clubs and the football teams in the early 1960s and who were trying to get this lagoon turned into a football field now realise the ridiculous situation we were involved in. We are all members of the Dee Why Lagoon Committee fighting to make sure that we can reclaim the lagoon and that it stays completely as a natural estuary because it is the last one left in the Sydney metropolitan area. That is by way of an aside. I was very interested to hear what Senator Baume said about people and political parties who changed their minds. On 20 August 1981 Senator Baume, when speaking about the Liberal Party, said:</PARA>
<PARA> To seek or accept a public subsidy is a political party's admission of failure. That it should need to look to public funding is an admission that it cannot get support from those who should be attracted by the force of its ideas and its ideology. The need for public funding reflects a lack of confidence in the acceptability of the party's objectives, a lack of confidence in its policies, a lack of confidence in its performance and an unwillingness to make the necessary efforts to raise its own funds. It is an assertion by an unsuccessful and failed party. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I will restrict my remarks specifically to the ninth annual report of the Criminology Research Council. The Criminology Research Council was established as a result of an Act of Parliament in 1971 and was formally established in 1972 . We have before us its ninth report. As we are dealing with some 47 reports this afternoon it is likely that the work of this important organisation may well not be recognised by the Parliament. I have certainly been very impressed in following the work of the organisation over the years. I am particularly impressed by the work that the organisation still has in the pipeline. I became aware, I suppose in the last 10 or 15 years, of the importance to human behaviour of the problems that flow as a result of a whole number of environmental effects upon individuals-what they do to the individual and what they do to society and humanity generally. Therefore, I commend the decision of the national Parliament some 10 years ago to establish this organisation and to review the work that it has carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure Senator Baume would be with me 100 per cent on this because I know that he and some other members of his party are concerned with human behaviour and the great difficulties that we have with recurrent criminality and the problems of anti-social behaviour that are so much a part of modern civilisation . Therefore, it is with regret that we see this organisation having to say in its report that it has to draw the attention of the Parliament to the relatively low level of income provided to the Criminology Research Fund. I hope that we will not be as at daggers drawn on this debate as we were in the previous one. As the report indicates, the Council's current income of $100,000 per annum is the same amount as it received in 1972. As we know, the rate of inflation has increased several times in that period. It is clear that the work of the organisation is considerably retarded by its receiving the same amount in money terms as it received in 1972. It therefore ought to be of some concern to the Senate that the Council has provided funds for 77 separate research projects over those years to a total of $803,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the work that the Council has done. A program inquiring into juvenile delinquency in planned urban areas, a survey of juvenile offenders, a study of migrant crime in Australia, an examination of a children's court hearing and what that does to teenagers, a study of community-based treatment for young offenders, a study of the behavioural effects in three simulated prison environments and a whole number of projects have been carried out by this organisation. In the brief moments that are left to me I want to refer to the projects that are currently being considered by this organisation. These include a study of the impact of Australian criminal law on remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. Surely that is one project that would be of interest to members of the Parliament and particularly to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). I have had the opportunity, as I am sure the honourable senator has, of visiting those areas. We can understand what impact white civilisation has had. This is important work that the Council is doing. The Council has approved research grants for a literature review on recidivism which is, of course, important because of the repeated turnover of criminals in our penal institutions. A grant has been made for a project to be conducted on juvenile runaways and alternatives to incarceration. </PARA>
<PARA> A very important survey is under way into mental retardation and its relation to stealing. It appears that there is a high incidence of people who are partly mentally retarded who also have an impulse to steal. We know what that means. When those people get into the hands of the authorities, the police, they are treated in exactly the same way as people who have all of their faculties. The Council has provided funds for research into criminal law in the bedroom as a result of the legislation carried out in the South Australian Parliament. I will not extend that issue. There is a pilot scheme dealing with diversion and prevention of juvenile delinquency called the 'Time Out' program which was initiated in late 1978. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> It was hoped to establish a program that would be attractive to a group of young people, seen as being 'at risk' by the teachers at the high school they attended. In the short term, the aims were merely to involve these young people in enjoyable activities in an effort to promote the constructive use of leisure time, and to aid the development of initiative, confidence and feelings of self worth. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely that is a very important work that is being carried out by this organisation. I do not believe in the Government's general philosophy that if we spend money in these areas it is a misuse of public funds, that the funds all ought to be diverted to the private sector in the hope that somehow or other they will rectify all the ills of modern society. I hope that the Government, having regard to the excellent work being done by this organisation and by many people in the academic area, will ultimately allocate sufficient funds to enable this work to be proceeded with, completed and extended. We must avoid the tremendous waste of human activity, the tremendous waste of public funds with people being incarcerated-some 9,000 people are in our prisons in Australia-and the high turnover of people who commit crimes regularly. They need some understanding by Governments and by communities. This sort of work should be carried on so that we will have a more rehabilitative approach to these sorts of problems instead of just putting people in penal institutions. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I have been waiting for some time to speak on this subject. It is some irony that under General Business for tonight honourable senators will see listed the same kind of report, I think, going back to 1979. We are only just starting to debate that. It is rather nice, I suppose, to be able to debate a report that is a little more recent even though we have had this study waiting to be dealt with since 26 November 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak to it to make it quite plain that the Australian Democrats are flatly opposed to the establishment of a uranium enrichment plant in Australia because we believe that such an industry would introduce to this country all of the least desirable aspects of the uranium industry. I think it has been shown in many parts of the world that enrichment is a dangerous enterprise in itself, whichever technology of the three that are available is used. It is dangerous not only because radioactive materials have to be handled constantly and this somehow has to be reconciled with the safety if the human beings who are working with them, but also because of the constant risk of criticality of enriched materials in quantities-not very large quantities; just a few kilograms- accidentally come together. That, of course, can result in a nuclear explosion. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may recall that there have been persistent reports of a huge disaster in the Soviet Union-reports which have been so persistent, I think , as to be worth giving some credence to. This disaster is considered by many respectable authorities to be due to amounts of plutonium held together as waste coming into contact and exploding. Of course, it is a known scientific fact that if highly enriched material beyond a certain volume is brought together it certainly will explode. That is the way the nuclear process works. </PARA>

Perhaps the Minister can take that one on board and give me that assurance when he is ready to do so. If he did that it would reassure a large number of people in Australia who are concerned. This is really the point at issue. There are people in Australia who take the view that I do. Very many of them are concerned that there should be any type of industry in Australia which associates itself with the nuclear process. Having got one I think it is quite likely that we will get the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We might eventually consider, as we have large amounts of U238 which are available as a result of the enriching of uranium extensively in U235-honourable senators will know that U238 is a by-product of that process-that we will get into the fast breeder technology as well. It appears to be an attractive proposition from one point of view. I think we have to look very carefully at all aspects of the beginnings of a nuclear industry in this country. That is really what this matter is about. The Government has said now that it is considering looking at an enrichment program. I see this as a first step towards a complete nuclear industry in this country in all its aspects. If the Minister is in a position to reassure the public that that is not the case I will be only too grateful to hear that reassurance from him during this debate. As I said, it is salutary to note that there have been persistent reports of a huge disaster in the Soviet Union due to amounts of plutonium being held as waste coming into contact and exploding. Of course, it is not possible also to retain the security of uranium that has been enriched to a certain proportion which can then be taken by some other person at some stage and enriched to a greater proportion. The history of the world's security precautions for nuclear materials is such that we cannot derive any comfort whatsoever from it. There has been a persistent history over the years of the loss of nuclear materials in quite substantial quantities; certainly substantial enough quantities to make nuclear weapons. Probably some of those things which have been lost have been made into nuclear weapons-certainly that uranium oxide which was carried in the cargo of the ship Sheersberg A which went missing. When the ship arrived at its destination the uranium oxide had disappeared. It went somewhere. It has been said frequently by a number of people-this is a matter of record-that it went to Israel where it was used to make nuclear weapons. That may or may not be so but the amount of money and the amount of time and effort that went into the Sheersberg A exercise were such that obviously it was not done for fun. Somebody put enormous amounts of money into the diversion of that cargo. It is of great interest to us that in the report of the Uranium Advisory Council it has got out from under on the question of the economy or otherwise of the industry. It says on page 8 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA> The second consideration relates to the economics of enrichment processing-the balance between construction and operating costs and marketing prospects. The Council does not regard itself as competent to offer a valid judgment as to the economic viability of an enrichment project. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought that this was something to which the Government would have been giving its mind. I hope that it is because I think in more ways than one one of the 64 dollar questions is: Whether or not there is value in this country having a nuclear enrichment process. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the case I would like to draw to the Government's attention one other implication which I think should be taken into account-an important implication for ordinary Australians, for everbody in this country who owns a house or any other type of real estate. It derives from the fact that any damage caused to homes or other property through any accident involving such nuclear materials that will be moving around the country if we start to develop ourselves into nuclear technologies would not be covered by insurance. As anybody who has read the fine print on his insurance policy will know, there is now what is called 'a nuclear exclusion'. That means that if enriched material or any nuclear material is in transit in any kind of vehicle and there is an accident that damages or contaminates property the unfortunate owners of that property will not get a single cent to compensate them, even though they have fully paid up insurance policies. There are too many people in this country who have not read that fine print or who have not understood it. I believe it is time that the Government had a look at it as indeed the Government in the United States has had to do. If we are to set up an enrichment industry in this country or we are to have reprocessing or fast breeder reactors or whatever-Western Australians have said that they will have a nuclear powerhouse-then there should be--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not objecting to the interjection. What worries me is that I do not have an honest reply to it. To return to the point, this nuclear exclusion in insurance policies has to be counted as a huge debit cost to Australia of a nuclear enrichment industry. As I have said, it will leave people with fully paid up insurance policies who ought to be protected-who are protected in every other way-not protected at all as the insurance industry has washed its hands of that kind of risk. The mere fact that it has washed its hands of that kind of risk is highly significant. It did this more than a decade ago; it did this because it understood then, being very concerned with money, that the time would certainly come when huge pay-outs would have to be made under policies unless the nuclear exclusion was there. That was why the nuclear exclusion was put into the policies. I think it is time that the Government looked at that matter and gave some sort of assurance to the people of this country. If indeed we are so foolish as to have this industry here, if there is an accident, if there is damage, or if there is contamination of people's property, the Government should give an undertaking to underwrite that damage completely. That is the only basis upon which the matter could operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many millions of people throughout the world-I suggest possibly tens of millions now-who are very concerned at a process of gradualism in which high fall-out, dirty, fission-type weapons, the crude Hiroshima-Nagasaki-type atom bomb, will proliferate in the world and will come into use in an increasing range of regional wars. There is evidence that a number of countries are already using their nuclear reactors to breed material. It is a fact that many types of ordinary, so-called power reactors will produce plutonium far more quickly than a fast breeder reactor which produces it rather slowly. When I use the word ' fast', honourable senators will know that I am referring to the speed of the neutrons. </PARA>
<PARA> What will be the situation if the atom bomb continues to proliferate in the world and comes into use in a range of regional wars? Of course, contamination will result throughout the world with accelerating rates of spontaneous abortion , foetus malformation and very much higher rates of all forms of cancer. As to the risk of an explosion of fission weapons I would welcome a reply from the Government to the effect that those consequences would not ensue. I think it has already been demonstrated that they would. These would become permanent factors of life generation after generation, because it is the nature of such contaminants to remain in the environment for many centuries, sometimes for thousands of years because of their very long half-lives. So we could have a situation in which regional wars took place, wars which we could see only on our television screens, and quite unknown to us, quite unseen by us, the contamination would continue and its often fatal and always health diminishing consequences would reap their silent effect on our people from the time they were in the womb to the time they died. I cannot believe that Australia and the Australian Government would willingly want to contribute to such a process. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned-and here again I put this matter to the Minister-at the apparent lack of government concern because of its want of any response or reply to recent publicity asserting that Australian uranium will find its way into nuclear weapons. There was this interesting point on page 9 in section 26 of this report:</PARA>
<PARA> The risk of nuclear proliferation 'inherent in enrichment technologies' also has to be considered. The Council must assume that the Commonwealth Government would not authorise the establishment of a commercial enrichment plant without ensuring that it was subject to the effective international safeguards, institutional controls and surveillance measures that the INFCE Working Group believes can minimise the risk of diversion of low enriched uranium for production of weapons grade material. </PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting the report, not some statement of my own. I draw particularly to the attention of honourable senators the word 'minimise'. This is a new word. In the past it was said that these safeguards worked; that there would not be any materials. But the word 'minimise' is rather a subjective word, is it not? One can minimise something if one reduces the risks from 100 per cent to 80 per cent . One can minimise something if one reduces the risk from 100 per cent to 95 per cent. I am saying that that sentence does not hold water; that if that sentence is taken into policy it will mean that Australian uranium in dangerous quantities could find its way regularly, persistently and continuously through to weapons grade material. That is something which should lie very heavily on our national conscience because it is not necessary for us to indulge in this industry at all. </PARA>
<PARA> A final point needs to be made about suggestions that the United States would find in Australia a handy source of enriched uranium for its weapons program. This is another matter on which some statement from the Government would be very welcome-whether in fact such action is contemplated, whether the Government would entertain such an approach, whether it would feel that it was the right thing for us to do to provide enriched uranium to the United States for the large and increasing numbers of new nuclear weapons which President Reagan now proposes to make and for which he is going to find great difficulty in getting weapons grade material. This could result in the most appalling consequences for Australia, especially that part of Australia in which the enrichment facility was located, since an enrichment plant providing weapons material to an ally would be a prime nuclear target in time of war. The consequences of its being bombed during an operational phase when it had large amounts of fissionable material within it, I think, are rather alarming. I would like to feel that we in Australia are not quite reconciled to the fact that our enriched uranium will be diverted to make weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> With all respect, I make a plea to the Australian Labor Party on this matter because I think nothing could be more important than that it should maintain the stand which so many members of the Australian Labor Party and so many ALP members of Parliament, including senators, take on this subject. I think they agree with the uncompromising stand that the Australian Democrats take; that we should not be exporting uranium, that we should not have an enrichment industry, that we should not have nuclear power houses; and that by doing so we are merely indulging in a lemming-like rush towards a brink. At times in the past Senator Carrick has said to me that the alternative is for the illegitimates to be cold in the dark, and things like that. I suggest that it is much better to try to cope with that in other ways. Perhaps whoever is cold in the dark might put on an extra cardigan or something like that if they are short of electric power. I would have thought that the other prospects, of proliferation of fissionable weapons, of major contamination, of difficulties in getting rid of waste materials and of the long term effects on generations to come, would have been more serious and that we should try to seek other solutions to problems of energy in the world rather--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, that is true though I would like briefly to comment on that point. We talked earlier today about electricity in New South Wales. There is no doubt at all that a genuine, dedicated and well-thought-out electricity conservation program can cut consumption down to perhaps 50 or 60 per cent of what a community would normally use. That certainly was the case in California and elsewhere. In Sydney one still sees the lights on in buildings at night and things of that sort. I would have thought that there were approaches that could be made. One is that the Government could go further, as I have suggested here before-let me suggest it again-and give genuine tax concessions, along the lines of those given in California and in many other States of the United States as well as in Japan and many other countries, to people who install energy saving devices such as solar appliances, insulation and things of that kind. I think the time is right for the Government to consider that idea. I think it would find most Australians on side because there are now about 110,000 solar heaters in Australia. Everybody wants to put one in. Why should they not be helped with that rather considerable initial capital cost if it is going to reduce our requirement to build new powerhouses and to go on producing energy? Why produce energy simply to waste it? Why do it if there are other alternatives? That is the point that needs to be made here.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not think so. I think that on this matter we are not likely to change our policy. We have not changed our policy on anything. We simply change our tactics. I want to put one other point. I suggest that Senator Button listen to it because there is a point to it so far as jobs in the nuclear industry are concerned. Jobs in Nuclear Fuel Services did not pan out terribly well for the people who took them, especially for some of its casual workers. It was the custom in that organisation to hire people regularly to do work where there was a high radioactivity risk, such as in maintenance and so on. Young unemployed people and people of that sort took the heaviest possible doses of radiation in a short period for very high wages. There was no control over whether these young people might eventually go to another place where they would also go through a similar situation and be exposed to high radiation for a certain time. It is increasingly becoming the view of respectable scientists that there is no really safe minimum dose of radiation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is unfortunately the case-as Nuclear Fuel Services proved-that if one is going to maintain or keep running any facility which has to be repaired and which does have areas that are radioactive, one must accept the risk of having to use people in high risk situations. I would have thought that this was not an area of employment which would be particularly appealing to anybody. These technologies, of course, are not particularly labour intensive-they are capital intensive-but, and the word 'but' is important, when it comes to having to repair things or to pull then apart or to do work of high risk-there is a labour intensity and one which costs very dearly because not only does it use up man hours but also it exposes people to degrees of radiation over a period which remains with them and can cause problems throughout the rest of their lives. I say, with respect, that the ALP ought to consider very carefully whether it should hold to the view-I know many of its members and senators do-that we should not have a nuclear industry at all, or whether it will allow itself to be tempted by expediency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the tabling of a paper by the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia called 'Pre-feasibility Study for the Establishment of a Uranium Enrichment Industry in Australia'. That paper has been tabled against the background that in the world around us, operating now and over the past 20 years, there are 220 or more nuclear reactors providing electric power. An equal number of such reactors are under construction and a roughly similar number are on the drawing boards. So, the world around us has a very considerable number of nuclear reactors which are vital to its electric power supply, and that number will double or perhaps treble. There has been 20- odd years of practical commercial and domestic experience in the use of those reactors. That is the first situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second situation which is important is that, despite what Senator Mason has said, the International Energy Agency, which comprises some 21 nations of this world and therefore has some collective wisdom, has representation from governments of all political faiths-of socialist faith and of Liberal faith. That agency has said that no matter how much energy conservation there is, no matter how much use of renewable energy such as solar power there is and no matter how much use of coal or gas there is, it will be vital for the world's living standards and for the economic and political stability of the world that there be a growing use of nuclear power generation for peacetime purposes. Let me get that quite clear. It is facile to the nth degree to say: 'Could we not have solar power?' I would be the last to say anything in denigration of the use of renewable power, but I ask those who speak here to understand the state of the art today. I remind them that most of the processes for the generation of solar power in use today consume more energy in their construction than they save in their use. The fact is that it is facile to talk of solar power. I do not want to denigrate solar power in any way. But I repeat that the International Energy Agency is made up of 21 nations of all political persuasions, every one of them composed of people who have at least as much regard for human life as Senator Mason does, who have great concern that we do not get any genetic mutations or damage people and who are unanimous in one thing, that despite the use of alternatives, the world cannot survive for the future unless it uses nuclear power for peacetime purposes. That is the background which was conveniently overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that was conveniently overlooked was that a commission of inquiry was set up in Australia-it has come to be known as the Ranger inquiry or the Fox inquiry-to study the various steps; and it indicated that it was perfectly safe, under reasonable conditions, to mine and mill uranium. It went on to say that it was safe, under proper safeguards, to enrich uranium and that the operation of nuclear power stations was safe under ordinary safeguards. It could have gone on to point out-this is a thing on which the opponents are silent-that the use of coal in power generation has a very bad record in terms of health. The people of the world with some knowledge of the effect of coal upon human health, of the effect of coal in creating a hot house situation in the destruction of the ecology, and of the effect of coal in creating acid rain believe that the increased use of coal will be a much greater threat to the total ecology and ecosystem of this world and a greater danger to the health of the human race than any alternatives. This is all recorded and documented and can be provided. I wish that those who are pursuing a political line would at least concede that, although there are needs for safeguards, the track record of uranium is that it is much more healthy and much safer than other ways of generating power. Indeed, the radiation fall-out of coal fired power stations is a genetic threat to the population. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not to solve it, but to mitigate it, yes. Of course, we would want to do that. Let me say this: We all absorb radioactivity in the courses of our lives from our bodies, from the rocks around us and from the atmosphere above us. Of course, one has a choice between elective absorption and compulsory absorption. Should one elect to live in Sydney, which would be a wise choice, one would be absorbing from the ordinary ecosystem about 100 millirads of radioactivity at any time. One would be absorbing it from the rocks, from one 's body and from the atmosphere. In addition, one would be absorbing two more millirads, making it 102, because of the residue from all atomic bomb tests of the past. Should one elect to live in Canberra one elects to add two more millirads. That is the amount that the residue from all atomic bombs has put into the atmosphere over a period. I say that not to justify atomic testing but to illustrate the relative situations. Should one elect to fly from here to Perth one would take on much more radioactivity, and should one elect to live in altitudes such as those in Brazil one would absorb much more indeed. So, one must be very careful about trying to frighten people about these kinds of situations. Of course, there must be safeguards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that the world around us has nuclear power stations and will build twice as many of them, let me state what this report is all about. A group of four Australian companies was asked to look at the commercial feasibility of enriching uranium for peacetime purposes. At the moment Australia is exporting yellowcake and will continue to do so to provide the world with its basic fuel for reactors. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chipp" NAMEID="3V4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I emphatically deny that Australia is exporting any yellowcake for any purpose other than for peacetime nuclear power generation . I will elaborate on that and make perfectly clear the degree of control. People constantly talk of yellowcake as though it were some highly radioactive material. In fact it is poisonous to eat but it is very low in radioactivity. Yellowcake is exported but it needs to be enriched to a certain extent to be used in nuclear power plants. The enrichment that is necessary for the use of yellowcake-that is, taking it through two stages from yellowcake by conversion to uranium hexafluoride, which is a combination of the yellowcake plus the gas fluorine-is a chemical process. It is in any way dangerous only in the sense that any chemical process is dangerous; otherwise it is not. Then the gas, the uranium hexafluoride, is basically spun around to separate U235 and U238.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the original percentage of about 0.7 per cent is raised to about 3.7 per cent. The yellowcake is in no way enriched to a level that could be of any use at all in making nuclear weapons. Indeed, no government that has signed the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons would allow within its community an enrichment plant that would in any way lift the level of its enrichment to nuclear weapons percentages. Let it be quite clear that when that process is undertaken all we are doing is enriching the fuels and providing more of it for use inside the reactor. The enrichment plant itself constitutes no particular radiation hazard. It is like all plants of that kind. It is necessary for it to exercise the ordinary safeguards for health but it is in no way a health hazard. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Mason talked about bombing. Of course no one would want an enrichment plant to be destroyed but it would not constitute any more risk in that regard than bombing some other toxic manufacturing plant. The enrichment itself is for peacetime purposes. Australia, as the result of the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, set up a code of safeguards in this country, signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and established the Australian Safeguards Office. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty insists that the countries that sign it will not sell their fissile material to anybody for use in weapon making or to any nation that has not signed the Treaty. </PARA>

At the risk of annoying people, shall I say that it is another error of judgment. The fact of the matter is that Russia is awash with plutonium. That is one of the tragedies of this world. Indeed, so is America. The concept that Russia would sneak a little and put it in its pocket to make a weapon-assuming that it could do so-is to the nth degree ludicrous.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable senator's interjection I simply say that Russia has an abundance of its own uranium ore and an overabundance of plutonium, and it is not within reasonable thought to believe that Russia would want to sneak some extra uranium for its own purposes. It is not a question of trusting Russia; it is simply a fact that it would gain Russia nothing to do so. In any case the journey along the way is audited at every point. The International Atomic Energy Agency does the auditing along the way and the Australian Safeguards Office audits all the way also. If in fact there is a need to strengthen the auditing procedures, there is an argument for so doing. The fact is that we are now debating a reality in this world. Yellowcake is moved around this world as the preliminary fissile material for nuclear power stations. A process is necessary for its enrichment so that it can be more effectively used in power stations. That process in itself does not make bombs; it does not contribute to the bomb stock of this world. The enriched uranium is not an explosive material in itself. Contrary to what has been said, enrichment is a normal process in the journey of the nuclear cycle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course there are elements of danger in the handling of radioactive materials , just as there are elements of danger in the handling of coal or any toxic material. We do not ban coal or natural gas because they are potentially lethal; we lay down rigid standards for the use of these things. This world of ours has to make sure that more and more of these safeguards are applied to uranium over its journey so that we get as near a perfect control as we can. It is easy to talk of mutations. Everybody loathes the thought that we might get genetic mutations. Everybody loathes the thought that there might be a use of bombs. The reality is that there is a capacity in the world to make atomic bombs. Great powers have not only the knowledge but also the capacity to make them and however saddening it is nothing will destroy that knowledge, however much we might work for the reduction in the arms race or the reduction of stocks. The knowledge of how to make an atomic bomb can be taught theoretically in a lecture hall or a laboratory. It cannot be driven out of men's minds. It is there and it will be worked on. Sadly it will be improved upon. The world must learn how to use the good things and how to prevent the bad things. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough simply to knock the use of atomic power. In the first place one has to put it into the real context, that it is vital to the survival and living standards of mankind across the world. It is no good saying: 'We will do it better; we will use solar energy'. Is there any scientific evidence in the world to justify that statement? The best that can be said is that solar energy might, in 20 years time, provide about 8 per cent of our needs. Those are the scientists' figures and I will obtain details for honourable senators if they so desire. The figure of 8 per cent at the most is being reduced now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to be sarcastic; I want to be helpful in what I am saying. Let nobody believe that I am being critical of solar energy. The world ought to carry out maximum research in trying to get renewable energy. It should look to see whether it can make ethanol from crops, from biomass and so on. But, as I said to Senator Mason, we have to be careful that there is no conflict between food and fuel and that we are not using land for fuel which we should be using for food. We have to be careful that in the growing of those crops we do not use significant energy so that the net advantage is small. With the distillation process of ethanol, the use of fertiliser to grow the crops, the running of the farm and the processing in the factory we may not gain much in the end. These are frontiers that we have to break through. We could take natural gas, turn it into methanol or gasolene and lose energy all the way. We ought to work on it so that we will get there in the end. But it is not a solution at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The solutions at the moment lie firstly with energy conservation. I have said in the Senate on many occasions that an affluent society like ours is capable of making an energy saving of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent. I would applaud such conservation, for its importance not only for the present energy crisis but also for the limited ecosystem in which we live. We should all be using everything sparingly. We have to face the fact that oil will run out. We will then have a choice between coal, gas and nuclear energy. Those who best understand these things believe that however much coal we use it will not be enough. If we use it in large volumes it will cause a massive health problem. That must be faced up to. We should see that the nuclear energy process is made as safe as man can make it. We should give it maximum protection. We are not protecting uranium against the present weapons system nations. They are awash with plutonium. They do not need it. Safeguards against the stealing of plutonium or enriched uranium are needed against terrorists, nations or societies that want to make a bomb on the side. </PARA>
<PARA> This report basically looks into whether it is feasible to enrich uranium in Australia. We export the yellowcake. Why not take the next step, which is to enrich it to a safe level, well below the weapons state? The British enrichment system has two quite separate factories, one to enrich uranium at a low level for peacetime power stations and the other to enrich it for the weapons system. Senator Mason asked whether we will provide enriched uranium for United States weapons. Does he really believe that the United States is short of fissile material to make weapons?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know the amount we are exporting. We export uranium for peacetime nuclear purposes. If the honourable senator is about to ask: 'What about the reprocessing?' I will come to that in a moment. America has an abundance of fissile material and plutonium to make its weapons. Australia will sell its uranium only if the whole cycle of reprocessing, including the reprocessing of the waste, is for peacetime purposes. We will confront a situation to the contrary if it should emerge. As I understand it, Mr Reagan said that he proposed that the reprocessing should be carried out on a commercial basis and that it should not be done by governments. We will ensure, wherever we provide uranium, that when it is reprocessed an equivalent volume comes out so that none is lost to weapons making. I make that point abundantly clear to honourable senators. There is no way in which we will willingly allow a system in which an audit would reveal that a gap existed. The world will build more and more power reactors because it says it must. It is using and enriching uranium for those purposes. The International Atomic Energy Agency is monitoring the situation. In Australia the situation is monitored by the Australian Safeguards Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We in Australia say: 'We will ship uranium from our shores only to those countries which conform with our safeguards and we will monitor that volume of uranium through the whole of its journey to its final waste product. In no way will we tolerate any of our uranium being used to make weapons. We will ensure that it is used entirely for electric power generation'. We believe that we have a duty to the world to contribute to solving the world's electric power shortages. That is the basis on which UEGA was set up and on which it has made its pre-feasibility report. So far it has said: 'We have looked at the world around us and the nature of an enrichment industry. We have said that by 1990 the world will have a market for enriched uranium, assuming that Australia makes it. We believe that Australia has the ability to have such an industry. It is an industry that creates jobs and encourages skills.' It is now busy looking towards a kind of technology that can best be used as a choice between a centrifuge, gaseous diffusion or chemical exchange and the possible markets. That is an important study. </PARA>
<PARA> As yet Australia has not made any decision as to whether it will have an enrichment industry. But if it should so decide it will not increase in any way at all the dangers to Australia or the world. If we enrich yellowcake and export it, that will not in any way change the shape of the world's general problem in the control of fissile material. That is all we are doing at this moment. Australia has not made any decisions to establish nuclear reactors. That may well be down the track. In any debate that we have on this whole question I would never deny risks of radioactivity. I am acutely sensitive to it in many ways and for many reasons. It is the responsibility of every Australian, certainly of every responsible Minister, to ensure that compulsory radioactivity , that is that forced upon people, is kept to an absolute minimum.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator may put that question on the Notice Paper and we will put this matter under study, but it is irrelevant. The fact is that at this moment we are providing uranium to the world. The world is taking that uranium and enriching it. The process of taking yellowcake and making it into enriched uranium does not add one extra bit of radioactivity to the world or one extra bit of hazard to the world that was not there when yellowcake was being moved. There is a lot of misunderstanding-some of it deliberate-about the nature of yellowcake, the nature of conversion and the nature of enrichment. On that journey we have not added to the risks. Of course we do not want incidents such as occurred at Three Mile Island but, taking that into account, the fact of the matter is that over the past 20 years the health record of nuclear power stations in this world has been immeasurably better than the health record of power stations generated by other fuels such as fossil fuels, coal and oil. I do not want to say there are no risks, but I do ask honourable senators that when they debate these matters they do not do it in black and white or misunderstand the alternative risks, which are enormous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make it perfectly clear that as far as this Government is concerned we will emphasise at every level that wherever the hazard may be, whether from coal or uranium, our job is to see that the health of the Australian society and the world outside is protected. Whilst this report has given us a chance to talk in the wider sense-I think that is good-it is simply a question of whether we change yellowcake into enriched uranium through the conversion process. That in itself has not altered any of the risks that lie around. It has not created an additional industry that will create more radioactivity. It has not added to the ability of the world to make bombs or weapons. It is utterly wrong to distort that. Of course, in that journey and at every step we should make sure that we strengthen nuclear safeguards, be it on the international level or the Australian level. I would always invite discussion and debate in this chamber and elsewhere on those matters. </PARA>

<PARA> A move by the Reagan Administration to make nuclear weapons with plutonium from civilian power plants threatens to seriously embarrass the Fraser Government over its uranium export policy. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a bit of politics, but let us go to the gist of the thing that worries me. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA> The idea that plutonium from commercial nuclear reactors should be used in nuclear warheads comes from the US Energy Secretary, James Edwards.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The work of the Special Broadcasting Service was a matter of some discussion in the Estimates committee last year. The Estimates committee in question was concerned that the report of this body had been considerably delayed. If I am correct, I think that the matter was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. I think the first matter to draw attention to is the Auditor-General's report which appears on page 44 of the report of the Special Broadcasting Service. It notes a number of unapproved expenditures which were entered into by the Special Broadcasting Service in the course of the year ending 30 June 1981. I hope that those conspicuous expenditure tendencies of the Special Broadcasting Service will be curbed somewhat in the coming year as a result of the comments by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is a splendid looking document. In reading it, one would think that all was totally satisfactory in the world of ethnic and multicultural broadcasting in Australia. Anybody who knows anything about ethnic and multicultural broadcasting in Australia knows that that is not correct. For example, the report at page 11 states:</PARA>
<PARA> SBS firmly believes that in its first eight months of operation it has, through its programming on Channel 0-28, succeeded in substantially achieving the aims and objectives of the multicultural television service . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If the SBS seriously thinks that it can make a statement like that in its report without any qualification, it is rather a glib view of the situation because most people think that Channel 0-28 has a long way to go.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just let me finish the sentence. It is, of course, a very low- rating channel in Melbourne and Sydney. The reasons for that, I think, in fairness to the SBS, should be stated. There are a lot of technical difficulties particularly in Sydney in the transmission of SBS programs and getting a clear image on the television screen. Not as many people as ought to are receiving adequate reception from Channel 0-28, mainly in Sydney. Senator Sir John Carrick interjected a minute ago and said that Channel 0-28 is a good channel. I think there is a lot to be said for that view. Channel 0-28, for example, provides a news service which absolutely shames both the Australian Broadcasting Commission and commercial television in this country in the quality of the coverage and service which it provides. That in itself reflects a worthwhile and totally praiseworthy initiative and skill on the part of the SBS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certain difficulties arise. First of all there are technical difficulties of reception, which I have referred to, which greatly militate against the wider dissemination of Channel 0-28 programs. Secondly, while the programs are very good for a sophisticated audience, what one is, in fact, getting in Channel 0-28 is a sort of Continental cinema in one's own sitting room. That is to say one gets, on the whole, fairly high quality European or Continental films which used to be shown in picture houses such as the Savoy cinema in Melbourne. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As represented in this Parliament by those who interject when I am speaking on this subject. Of course it would be unfair to gauge the sophistication of the people of Warrnambool by the representation which they have from Senator Lewis, but I am not doing that. I am making the point that if the target and ambition of Channel 0-28 is to be a truly multicutural channel and, in a sense, an ethnic channel, which is a slightly different thing, it is probably not achieving that purpose. I am not condemning it for that. I am saying that this must be a matter of concern because I suspect that the basic audience of Channel 0-28 is the more highly educated section of the more traditional Australian population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other comment I should make is that one hopes that the very good qualities of Channel 0-28 will impinge and influence standards across the broadcasting spectrum generally. Multiculturalism should pervade all sections of the broadcasting media and it should not be segregated in one channel or one radio station. I think it is important that the value of Channel 0-28 is seen across a much wider spectrum. The comment I make really relates to the failure of the Special Broadcasting Service report to raise and discuss these issues other than to say that it is a pretty good service and that it has succeeded in achieving the aims and objectives of a multicultural television service. It seems to me to be a complacent statement which is not justified by a critical examination of what in fact is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out also that Channel 0-28 is a very expensive service in broadcasting terms. One hopes that in the future in some rationalisation of government finance in regard to broadcasting more adequate arrangements can be made to accommodate Channel 0-28 in a new service of a somewhat wider kind. This is a view which we in the Australian Labor Party hold and, of course, which half the Federal Council of the Liberal Party, minus one, hold following debate on this matter at their council meeting in, I think, October last year. I was very disappointed to see that what I regard as a more sophisticated view was in a minority, but that may well change. I am not making any criticism in saying that . </PARA>
<PARA> I think the SBS report is also somewhat complacent about the ethnic radio side of its activities. I and other members of the Labor Party have always taken the view that ethnic radio broadcasting should be accommodated in this country in the public broadcasting sector. That is to say that it should not be segregated into the area where it now is-radio station 2EA in Sydney and 3EA in Melbourne, basically, plus a complementary scheme which provides subsidies for public broadcasting stations which provide ethnic programming. We see no reason why the broadcasting aspirations of ethnic communities should not be treated in exactly the same way as are other communities of interest which are accommodated in the public radio broadcasting sector. The cost of the two SBS stations, station 2EA in Sydney and station 3EA in Melbourne, is in the order of $4m a year. The SBS provides to public broadcasting stations which broadcast ethnic programs subsidies in the order of $400,000. If we examine the relative broadcast times in the public broadcasting sector-that is, on community radio stations-and the broadcast times of stations 2EA and 3EA we will find that the delivery of ethnic radio services through the public broadcasting sector is much more cost effective than maintaining the two stations 2EA and 3EA in those two cities of Sydney and Melbourne. I think they are matters which should be discussed in relation to any report of the SBS. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also a lot of rumblings of discontent in the ethnic radio stations 2EA and 3EA, largely turning on the question of the level of professionalism and the appropriate payment for professionals in those two stations. What we believe should be developed as a matter of policy is the notion of ethnic communities controlling their own ethnic broadcasting. In that sense we believe, as I said, that public broadcasting provides a much better model for future development than does the segregated 2EA and 3EA type of station. I have already commented on the cost effectiveness of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad thing is that nothing in the report on these matters lies at the eye of the storm of any proper debate about the future development of ethnic broadcasting in Australia. From recollection, I believe the Government has taken some steps-I think this is very important-towards bringing Channel 0-28 to Canberra and perhaps, in a very tentative way, to Wollongong. The sad thing about the development of ethnic broadcasting in Australia is that the emphasis, both for demographic and political reasons, has been very much on Sydney and Melbourne. There are significant ethnic communities in Canberra and Wollongong, as indeed there are in other cities of Australia, which should have the benefit of those services. Of course in Canberra there is a middle class, middle brow community which is not an ethnic community and which would be very interested in the other qualities of Channel 0-28. I regret, as I said, that there is nothing in the report on these matters which are the real issues relating to ethnic broadcasting and the role of the SBS. I repeat what I said in relation to the report of the Department of Communications earlier today: The fault lies with the Government in not having clear policy guidelines and not perhaps with the SBS. I think we as members of the Senate can all welcome the arrival of the SBS. That does not debar us from being critical about some of the issues which concern it and which concern the community which it purports to serve. It is in that spirit that I offer these comments. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to say very little about this report. The Government's decision on the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission chaired by Mr Dix will, I hope, come fairly soon. The report of the Dix committee has now been around for many months. For that reason it is perhaps not appropriate to go into a full analysis of the performance of the Australian Broadcasting Commission at this time. However, the Dix committee report was important in that it was, in my view, a very sound diagnostic approach to the problems and difficulties of the ABC. The recommendations arising from that diagnosis will be the subject of a great deal of discussion in the immediate future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dix report identified many shortcomings in the Australian Broadcasting Commission and, I think, made an important contribution in pointing out that even if, as the Australian Broadcasting Commission claims, it has been starved of funds by the Government and has experienced a decline of 22 per cent in funding in the last five years, the Australian Broadcasting Commission has problems which are different and which are not attributable to the decline in funds from government sources. One would hope that in dealing with the recommendations of the Dix report the Government will deal particularly with the deficiencies in management. That should be the main area to be confronted by the Government when it takes decisions about the ABC and its future directions. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe generally that it can be said that the Commission has not been able to determine just what role it should play in a television and radio industry dominated in number, and presently in audience appeal, by commercial operators. We hope that the outcome of the Dix inquiry will be that the ABC will be put on a firmer footing and that its management and staff in the future will have clearer ideas about its direction and goals as a national broadcasting service. We hope that that direction, those ideals and those goals will be in the spirit of a great public broadcasting service as the British Broadcasting Corporation has been and remains and the ABC used to be but no longer remains. These goals, I hope, will include four areas that the Dix committee of inquiry drew attention to. There is, first of all, the suggestion that the ABC has a cultural bias in that it is too British looking; secondly, that it provides inadequate services to non-metropolitan areas; thirdly, that it fails to reflect the needs of important groups in Australian society such as Aborigines, non-Anglo-Saxons and women; and fourthly, that it has failed to decentralise its resources effectively in the States and regions to reflect the interests of the whole country. Four important points arise from the Dix committee of inquiry. In dealing with the recommendations of that inquiry we hope that the Government will face up to those four issues. I commend a study of the report of the Commission to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch I was speaking on the report dealing with the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the comments that had been made as a result of the United Nations Mission visit to that group of islands which comes under the jurisdiction of Australia at this stage. The mission has made a number of points about the need to assist in the cultural, political and social development of the people who make up the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the need for them to have a diversified economy, particularly to involve them perhaps more than has been the case in the past in the establishment of a quarantine station as a result of our legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The mission refers substantially to the judgment that the people of that group of islands have to make shortly in respect to their future. They have three options available to them. Firstly, they could be integrated with Australia. Secondly, they could have a free association; that is, they would determine their own affairs with some assistance from Australia in respect of foreign policy, defence and so on. Thirdly, they can opt for the ultimate which is so much a part of the changes in the post-war years of independence, and establish themselves in their own right. The suggestion has been made that this may be a judgment which the people will have to make some time during 1982. Having read the report that we are discussing, the comments of the United Nations Mission and the comments of the Australian Government representatives on that mission's report, I wonder whether the people there are yet able, on the basis of their evolution, their thought processes and their participation in day to day affairs , to make a proper judgment in respect of their future. I am encouraged in that belief by an article written by Cyril Ayris which was published in a number of newspapers. I am referring particularly to an article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald which states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is certainly some anger by the council towards the Australian Government because of its failure to remove from Home Island their former ruler Mr John Clunies-Ross. </PARA>
<PARA> Whichever of the three choices the Malays take the future of Mr Clunies-Ross appears to be in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Malays have the bargaining power to force his removal and unless there is a change of council, they will undoubtedly use it. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not have to stay long on the islands to realise that the happy-go- lucky Malays are sitting ducks for exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA> They have only just started earning Australian dollars for their labour and they have come close to worshipping its buying power. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet they receive less than $30 in hand for their week's work. The rest goes into the co-operative society to pay their rates and power. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a true socialist system. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the correspondent, who wrote that article for the Fairfax organisation in Australia, had to say. Whilst I applaud that that is the summation of his concept of the way in which the islanders are conducting their affairs, it is clear that they need a great deal more assistance and perhaps time to make that value judgment on whether they should be involved in the process of independence, integration or partial integration with Australia. One has to have some regard to the proximity of these islands to one of our powerful neighbours-Indonesia. For those who express the view that Timor should have been part of Indonesia, if that were a logical argument, certainly these islands should be integrated with Indonesia. But of course that may be a convenient way out at this point in history. It might not necessarily be a satisfactory arrangement. So some strategic influences are involved in the future of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands area. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This question has now been before the Parliament in some shape or form for several years, yet the Government has done nothing about it. In particular, in May 1976 the following motion was passed in the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> That in the opinion of this House, the Government should implement as soon as practicable, a natural disaster insurance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> This was followed in December 1976 by the tabling of a discussion paper on 'A Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme for Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to remind honourable senators that Australia is subject to a very wide range of natural disasters including bushfires, floods, cyclones, droughts, storms and even some earthquakes. Many of these stand out in memory, such as the Tasmanian bushfires of February 1967 which cost insurance companies $14m and drew Commonwealth grants and loans of $10m; the 1968 earthquake in Meckering, West Australia which cost insurance companies $2m and drew Commonwealth grants and loans of $250,000; cyclone Althea in Queensland, 1971 which cost insurance companies $22m and drew Commonwealth grants and loans of $2.6m; cyclone Wanda in Brisbane 1974 which cost insurance companies $88m and drew Commonwealth grants and loans of $54m; and, of course, cyclone Tracy which hit Darwin in December 1974 and cost insurance companies $220m and drew Commonwealth grants and loans of $224m. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that the present ad hoc system of compensation was replaced by some form of planned national scheme. As long ago as 1974, the Insurance Council of Australia pointed out that, 'the potential for natural disaster damage in Australia is enormous'; and that, 'if a major earthquake were to occur in a major capital city the damage could run into several hundred millions of dollars '. That was in 1974. The figure would now obviously be in the billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote further from the Insurance Council's 1974 report:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Evidence suggests that the potential risks of earthquake in Australia are significant . . . and increased awareness by some insurance companies of these risks is leading them to reassess their ability to provide cover against this hazard without unduly risking their solvency . . . the possibility exists that one single event could bring about a catastrophic loss'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that no one has yet been killed by an earthquake in Australia and that property damage caused by earthquakes since 1950 has only been about $10m. But Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth are all subject to a degree of earthquake activity, and now is the time when we should be making plans for the future handling of compensation requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Private sector insurance companies find it very difficult, if not impossible, to provide adequate insurance cover against natural disasters, for a variety of reasons. The infrequency of these disasters lulls most people into a false sense of security. Figures show, for example, that prior to the 1974 Brisbane floods, only 10 per cent of domestic policy holders had arranged any form of flood insurance, even though they knew that large areas of Brisbane were flood prone. In these circumstances, the Commonwealth is virtually forced into providing support. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of some types of natural disaster, potential losses are so large that they would eliminate or exceed a private insurance company's reserves. Cyclones often fall into this category. In 1974, for example, the combined impact of cyclone Tracy and several floods in eastern Australia placed the insurance industry in a situation where they were looking at losses from those two occurrences totalling some $400m against an annual premium income of only $ 340m. Fortunately, most of the $400m was met by reinsurers from the world market ; but reinsurance is now becoming increasingly expensive and Australian companies would be much harder hit in the event of another cyclone Tracy. This is yet another reason for Australia to adopt a comprehensive natural disaster compensation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The joint parliamentary committee which we propose should be set up will have many important questions to answer. One of these obviously relates to the question of compulsory insurance levies. Should the public be obliged to contribute a certain proportion of their incomes to a natural disaster compensation fund? Should some form of reserve system apply? What role should private insurers play? What exactly is meant by the term, 'natural disasters'? What kind of authority is most suitable for administering the scheme? These are all questions which are best left to the expertise which would be available to a joint parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would urge honourable senators from both sides of the chamber to support this motion. This matter has been placed on the shelf or in the too- hard basket for far too long. It is a problem which will not go away and it is one which affects a potentially huge number of Australians. Do we need another cyclone Tracy to remind us of our responsibilities to fellow Australians who, through absolutely no fault of their own, find their homes irreparably damaged or even totally destroyed? A promising start was made in this area with the House of Representatives motion and the discussion paper of 1976 which I referred to earlier. Let us now set up a joint parliamentary committee which can finish the job. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate supports the holding of a further session of the Australian Constitutional Convention in Adelaide this year. </PARA>
<PARA>I am indebted to the Senate for allowing me to bring this matter on for debate tonight. The reason for seeking to do that is, of course, obvious in that the Premiers Conference will be held tomorrow and this will be an item for consideration. One hopes that a resolution of the Senate, particularly if it can be a unanimous resolution or one without dissenting voice, will be taken seriously and influence the deliberations of the Premiers accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> It ought to be possible for unanimous support to be achieved tonight on this motion. The motion does not in terms refer to any substantive issue. There is nothing remotely tendentious about its terms. It simply affirms that the process of constitutional review which has been so laboriously pursued now through the meetings of the existing Constitutional Convention on four occasions since 1973 should continue. It simply proposes-putting it another way-that the momentum which has visibly been gradually developing in the community in favour of rethinking the terms of our Constitution, especially in the light of the forthcoming bicentenary year in 1988, should get some further assistance. It is clear that there is a desire for constitutional change from a really quite extraordinarily diverse collection of viewpoints. The desire for constitutional change is by no means confined to the radicals or Left Liberals in this community and by no means confined to those who are obsessed, it might be said by others, with the events of 1975 and the desire to change or to amend the institutions and procedures which gave rise to that trauma. </PARA>
<PARA> There are in fact a really quite extraordinary number of different people from a number of different perspectives who are arguing in one way or another for constitutional change. There are those who, from a variety of perspectives, want a more rational distribution of power between the different levels of government -a distribution of power which reflects perhaps more adequately than was the case with the distribution worked out at the turn of the century the changing socio-economic character of the Australian environment, the fact that among other things we are now an integrated modern economy with all that that demands in terms of macro-economic management, business regulation and so on. There are those who are unhappy often from a quite different ideological perspective with the present system of Federal-State relations, especially Federal-State financial relations. There are those who perhaps may be seeking a more fundamental restructuring of the Federal system-to do away with the States altogether, to create a regional system or a unitary system or something of that kind. There are those, not all of them radicals by any means, who would like our Constitution to reflect more specifically Australia's independence from Britain. There are those who might not necessarily want any change at all in the actual institutional arrangements of the present Constitution, but who would want it to describe more clearly the institutions of government and the way they work in practice, who would want it to talk specifically in terms of the Cabinet, the Prime Minister and so on rather than employ the circuitous language of the Executive Council and rely on 'conventions', to fill out arrangements not described in the text of a constitutional document. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those who want more stability or certainty in the institutions of national government-the Senate, the Governor-General and the other institutions which have caused difficulty of one kind or another in recent years. There are those who want a more rational system so far as the administration of justice is concerned, who are upset at reading, as we all have in the last day or two, about custody cases being dragged on for 12 months or more through three separate courts, the High Court, the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Family Court, because of doubts, uncertainties and problems in the division of power and in the administration of court responsibilities as between the Commonwealth and the States. There are those, from a variety of political perspectives, who want more protection for individuals against the misuse of government power than is contained in the present document. There are those again who want flexible machinery for constitutional change without perhaps being clear at all as to what change might be required here and now but who think that at least the kind of machinery for initiating and implementing proposals ought to be more flexible than the existing section 128 which has proved such a difficult barrier over the years to those who want to work fundamental change. </PARA>
<PARA> The things that all these different kinds of people, different kinds of interests, want to achieve can perhaps be summarised broadly in four categories. Those in the first category of issues, if we relate to the institutions of national government-the position of the Executive, the position of the legislature and the position of the judiciary, and the various interrelationships between them. I do not think I need do any more here than simply refer to the multiple questions that have been the currency of public debate, of community interest, particularly in the last six to 10 years, about the powers and position of the Senate, about the position of the Governor- General, about the nature of our institutional relationship with the United Kingdom and in particular the monarchy, about whether we should be a republic in the sense of severing our monarchical connection and about whether we should be a republic in the American sense of developing a presidential rather than a parliamentary system of government. There are varying degrees of difficulty in the issues which have been identified under those various heads. There are varying degrees of reality about them in terms of the likelihood of their acceptance by the Australian people. But there can be no doubting that they are issues, and issues which are of quite fundamental importance, many of them, although some of them are merely of symbolic importance, in the way in which we conduct our nation's affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The second category of problems relates to the operation of our Federal system of government. At one level the problem might be perceived in terms of the structure of the Federal system itself-the existence of Federal, State and local governments involving 950-odd full-time parliamentarians and over 11,000 politicians altogether; if one includes local councillors; all serving a population of less than 15 million people. Is this, many people are asking, the best, most rational way of governing the affairs of an economically integrated modern society such as Australia? At less radical level, and a perhaps more realistic perspective, there are those who, on looking at the Federal structure, say that maybe it is unrealistic to think in terms of any of our present lifetimes about changing the elements of that structure but that certainly it may be possible to devise a more rational and workable division of legislative powers and financial responsibilities between those existing levels, especially in the areas of overall economic management, of business regulation, in relation to questions of national development and the administration of welfare and in relation to questions of human rights and law reform generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The third category of problem relates to the whole question of whether or not our Constitution should contain guarantees, which it does not at the moment of course, of individual rights and liberties. Our Consitution is very different in that respect from most other constitutions of other countries and there are many people in the community, from a variety of perspectives as I said before, who would support changes of that kind. And the last category of problem, I suppose, relates to the question of the machinery of constitutional change itself. Has the section 128 formula enabled the responsible reaction of our constitutional arrangements to the changes that have been all so visible in the course of this century? More than that, is the process that presently exists for the initiation , the generation of ideas and proposals for constitutional change, not just the final implementation but the initiation, to be approved?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very fair point. Because of the way in which the Constitution is drafted at the moment, the question of what goes to the people is essentially in the hands of the government of the day in the Commonwealth Parliament only. That is obviously a very narrow potential funnel through which constitutional ideas abroad in the community can be channelled. So there is a very quick check list of the basic categories of people who want change, the basic issues which demand to be resolved in any systematic attempt at constitutional reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question before us now is a rather less extensive one: How would the holding of another session of the existing parliamentarians Constitutional Convention in Adelaide later this year-I mention Adelaide because I understand that there is a standing offer on foot from the State Government in Adelaide to host the next session of the Convention there, whenever it may be-advance the cause of constitutional reform? I think there are two levels on which we need to approach this question. One is in terms of the actual substantive change which might be accomplished by another series of sessions of the existing Convention. A second perspective through which we ought to look at what might constructively emerge from such a session is in terms not so much of a substantive change but in terms of the procedural issues which might there be debated and what might be determined so far as the process of reform for the future is concerned. At the level of substantive change one could, of course, be forgiven for perhaps demonstrating a degree of cynicism about the extent to which achievements have been accomplished in the four sessions of the parliamentarians Constitutional Convention that have been held to date. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, cynicism, I suppose, to the extent that I for one, having attended all four sessions of the convention, wearing a variety of different hats since 1973, have been moved on various public occasions to refer to the grinding inconsequentiality of it all. That is the way it tends to seem when one is sitting there for five days at a time and nothing very much seems to be moving compared with what we all know to be the gigantic array of major issues which are in fact on most people's mental agenda of things requiring constitutional reform and attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is clear, when one exercises a bit of objectivity about it and looks back perhaps a little less cynically, if one can, at the record in the past, that a momentum of a kind has in fact developed. It is true that at the first session of the Convention in Sydney in 1973 the Convention was essentially devoted to rhetoric and to the assignment of matters to various committees for further detailed consideration. The substantive achievements from that point of view were negligible, although a lot of issues were raised. In Melbourne in 1975 , at the rump session of the convention, if it can be so described because for political reasons prevailing at the time it was not fully attended by one section of the delegations and as such the deliberations were not substantial, it was very difficult to see at that time that any achievement was made at all. But then again, when the Convention met in Hobart in its third session in October 1976, there was a rerun of the Melbourne Convention, this time with a full set of delegates, and in fact, what had transpired at Melbourne was very much taken on board by the full array of delegates and there were a number of achievements, including an agreement to recommend to the Government that four matters at least be put to referendum. They were, of course, the matters that went to the people in 1977, three of which related to the retiring age for judges, Territory voting rights and casual Senate vacancies, and all three of which were passed by the Australian people. That brought the total number of measures passed up from five to eight in one fell swoop, which is a significant arithmetical achievement, if not otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> Another proposition agreed to in Hobart relating to simultaneous elections of the House of Representatives and the Senate was in fact approved of by 62 per cent of the Australian people even though it failed by reason of not satisfying other elements of the constitutional formula. Then in Perth in July 1978 further I think significant achievements were recorded. There was on the agenda in Perth a mixture of both highly technical and highly contentious items which at the time were not such as to make one believe that anything very much was happening. But there were a series of matters relating to the appointment of High Court judges, the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court, advisory opinions of the High Court and the closer integration of Federal and State courts which, although it is boringly technical to recite them in that way, were of quite fundamental significance for the more rational distribution of institutional power in this country in the future. Although there was a massive fight over the question of Senate powers at that stage which was only very narrowly resolved in favour of one formula rather than another, at least the air was cleared, I suppose it might be said, and the ground rules for the warfare were established. As a result, a lot of people were minded to think more seriously about what the final institutional solutions had to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at it from a substantive point of view, the agenda for this year, I believe, could contain many items of really quite substantial significance on which it might well be possible to make a significant advance-to make substantial strides. Apart from the vexed question of the relationship betwen the two Houses, on which I personaly hope that there may be some movement in the context of the fixed term parliament proposal in the next few weeks, there are several other categories of matters which have been the subject of very extensive discussion in one of the standing committees of the existing Convention and on which it is very evident from my perspective as a member of one of those committees that a process of consensus is gradually coming about. I am referring to the possible insertion in the Constitution or in an associated declaratory document of a statement of conventions that govern the role of the Governor-General and a whole series of other areas that determine how the Constitution works. It is evidence that there are a number of issues relating to the constitutional role of Parliament-the length of parliamentary terms, questions relating to classification qualification of members and questions of Territory representation-which could I think be resolved were they to be put on the agenda. There are matters relating to the court system-advisory opinions, the jurisdictional questions that we have been talking about in recent weeks in the context particularly of family law-which are looking far more capable of solution than anyone could have believed only a year or two ago. There are some basic questions of the distribution of constitutional power in the area of family law, of industrial law and in terms of the operation of section 92 which are also very viable items for rational discussion at a Convention this year because there is already a foundation of quite extensive discussion and consultation on which to build. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from substantive issues of that type which I think in themselves would justify the holding of another session of the existing Convention, I think by far the most important item on the agenda for any session of the Constitutional Convention that might be held this year, if it can be brought together, is a re-evaluation of the process of initiating proposals for constitutional change. The present model, as we all know, is a representative assembly comprising delegations from Commonwealth and State parliaments and from local government. It is a model which has not worked especially well, it must be acknowledged, in terms of capturing the imagination of the community. It is not a model that has worked especially well in terms of divorcing the attention of the delegates at the conference from considerations of day to day partisan warfare and elevating their minds to higher things. The question arises whether the existing mechanism is the best way of dealing with a fundamental rethinking of where we are in terms of our Constitution and what could be done to improve it. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it possible, I think this session of the Convention should be explicitly asking itself, to devise machinery which will deal in the future more systematically and less superficially with the array of problems I have mentioned, which will perhaps involve a much wider group of people in the community at large in the process of discussion and implementation of recommendations, which will create more awareness in the community of the desirability of certain kinds of constitutional changes and which will create as a result more confidence in the breasts of the decision-makers that propositions that are put to the community will in fact be passed ultimately at referendum because people will have had the opportunity to familiarise themselves with what is involved? It is worth asking, and I hope this Convention would ask, whether it is possible in some way to devise a machinery for the future which could catch the wave, which could develop further the kind of momentum which I believe is gradually developing in the community around the idea of a major renewal of our Constitution by the 1988 Bicentenary year. One such mechanism that one hopes would be discussed by such a Convention is the idea of a 'Popular Convention', a directly elected assembly with the Australian people having not just a representative voice through their existing parliamentarians but a direct voice through some electoral process in establishing the composition of the body. That is not nearly as trendy an idea as it sounds, to the extent that in 1897-98 that was the model which was adopted, which lifted the whole federal movement out of the apathy into which it had rather sunk in the middle 1890s and which created the degree of popular involvement that was crucially important in bringing about the Australian federation by the turn of the century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The loquacious lawyers in the land are an obvious category of persons who would stand for election. Whether they would be elected would be something on which Senator Haines and I may bet rather differently. It could be expected that the respective parties would run their own tickets just as the Age and Argus newspapers ran their own tickets for rival factions in the 1890s. Of course, that would be so. But at least it would open up the process. I do not go into that now. There will be ample opportunity in future to talk about potential models. It is possible that that is too grandiose, too expensive, an idea to be capable of realistic application. It is equally possible though, even if one adopts that point of view, that there are compromise positions that can be thought about seriously and debated seriously at some session of the Constitutional Convention-for example, some model whereby the exisiting composition of the Convention was retained but added to it was some smaller electoral component or even some appointed component, with the respective parliaments nominating their own additional delegates from outside the category of parliamentarian. There are all sorts of possibilities. I simply raise the larger issue that it is important, I think, if we are really serious about addressing the whole series of problems to which I have briefly referred, that we consider ways in which the structure of the constitutional reform process can reflect the variety of interests that are involved and the diversity of people and interests that need to be accommodated if something is really to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also important that a structure be evolved which is capable of actually doing some hard work. It is not really apparent that a session of the Convention occupying four or five days every two or three years is really going to be able to do much more than inch forward the process of constitutional reform. If we are serious about any fundamental or systematic rethink, obviously we have to be thinking in terms of some Convention model which involves delegates meeting together for weeks, perhaps even a couple of months, at a time over a period of three or four years to do the really hard work. I simply raise these as the questions which seem to me to be the most fundamental and the most important- more important than any of the immediate substantive issues which might otherwise be on the agenda. I believe it is possible then for a Convention held this year, structured on its present lines without any radical change in its composition before then, to take all these matters forward. I believe it is possible with a degree of good will and cross-party support, particularly if it is demonstrated in this chamber tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a momentum abroad in the community. We would not be going out on a limb in expressing this view tonight. We would simply be reflecting a view which I think is very visible. One demonstration and indication of its visibility is the New South Wales Law Foundation project which I described in this chamber on 24 September in the context of replying to a constitutional statement which Senator Durack had then put down. The consultative committee for that project met in Sydney last week-on Friday, 12 February. It really was an extraordinary occasion. Gathered around the table were a number of very distinguished Australians from most political parties-certainly from both sides of politics- from every State in Australia. I will mention alphabetically those who were there. They were: Franca Arena from New South Wales; Bob Hawke; Donald Horne; Justice Michael Kirby; John Maddison, former Liberal Attorney-General of New South Wales; Senators Kathy Martin, Alan Missen and Peter Rae; Sir John Moore, President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; Paul Munro, a very prominent white collar trade union leader; Jack Richardson, the Commonwealth Ombudsman; Dr Ella Stack, the former Mayor of Darwin; John Valder from the Institute of Public Affairs and the Sydney Stock Exchange; Sir Clarrie Harders, former Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department; and Ronald Sackville, Chairman of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> From all parties and none, from all parts of Australia, these people came together, sat down around a table for four hours and in a very constructive set of discussions committed themselves to support for this process of constitutional reform. They did not agree upon any particular substantive change ; agreement about that is obviously a long way off, but agreement about the process of change and about the desirability of re-thinking where we are at is very close to us. Of course, there were many other people on that consultative committee who could not attend that particular meeting but who have also associated themselves with that project. They include Robert Holmes a Court, Don Chipp of the Australian Democrats; John Hyde of the Liberal Party; Sir Laurence Muir; Professor Geoffrey Sawer; Frank Walker; Graeme Miles from the Local Government Association; and Haddon Storey, the Victorian Liberal Attorney- General who has been very active on the supervisory committee for the project. I mention these names because it is a demonstration that it is possible to bring people together to talk rationally, systematically, coherently-and idealistically-about the options for change in this really very lethargic community of ours. So long as this is happening, so long as there is a willingness to talk across party lines and across geographical boundaries, so long as there is this willingness to try to build together a concensus for change, I believe that major constitutional reform this decade-by 1988-is not a pipedream. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General wrote a very lucid and interesting article in 1967 before he came into this Parliament about the necessity for constitutional change and the desirability of there being a constitutional convention. The reference is Durack and Wilson 1967 Australian Law Journals in an article entitled: 'Do we need a new Constitution?' He answered the question in the title 'No, but we do need to rethink the present one very substantially and we should have a convention to do it'. There are people in the present Government who appreciate these difficulties. Many people on all sides of politics are prepared to work to solve them. I believe that we can take a very significant step along this path together by voting-I hope unanimously, without dissent-in support of the motion which is before the Senate tonight, supporting in this way the idea for a further session of the existing Convention this year and thereby conveying our view to the Premiers Conference tomorrow that from all sides of this Parliament there is a belief in, and a commitment to, the idea that the process of constitutional rethinking should continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a statement which I made to the Senate on 24 September last year entitled 'Constitutional Review' I acknowledged the resurgence of interest in the possibilities of constitutional reform. I think there was some momentum in this regard in 1976 and 1977 when, the Senate will recall, a Constitutional Convention was held and followed by a referendum which was, one might say, surprisingly successful, certainly in the context of the general history of referendums in Australia. In that atmosphere another Constitutional Convention was held in Perth in 1978. I think it is fair to say that that Convention was not a successful one. Nothing seemed to emerge from it. There was no concensus which would have encouraged any referendum proposals. There may have been some value in meeting, but by and large nothing very specific or encouraging emerged from that convention. However, it is true, as I acknowledged in September and as Senator Evans has emphasised in his remarks tonight, that there is now a renewed interest in the subject. I welcome that interest, which indeed I made clear in the statement I made in this chamber on 24 September. I stated then-I think all I can do tonight is to restate it-the Government's attitude in relation to the holding of another Constitutional Convention. Certainly, that possibility has been considered by the Government but the view of the Government is that there should be another plenary session only when there are substantial proposals which have been sufficiently developed and digested to form the basis of a successful meeting. Furthermore, we need to have the views of the States in relation to holding another Convention. They form a very important part of the Convention and therefore it is not much use having another one unless they are prepared to co-operate and show some enthusiasm towards having one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One standing committee of the Convention has been working since 1978. That committee last met towards the end of last year and commissioned some further work to be done. Some of the sub-committees that were set up then are working now. A number of papers have been commissioned by various constitutional experts , most of which probably have now been finalised and submitted. I believe that there is still quite a bit more work to be done before sufficient material is digested, along with other subjects for debate, some of which have been suggested by Senator Evans tonight. Others may come to mind as a result of further considerations in Committee D or further suggestions that may be made. However, undoubtedly quite a number of positive steps are being taken along the path of constitutional review which may give some encouragement to the idea that a further Convention would be justified and might be successful.</PARA>
<PARA> However, at this stage the Government has an open mind. We take a neutral position on the motion before the Senate tonight. As I have said, we are interested in the prospect of another Convention but we believe that it is no good holding one unless sound preparation has been made for it, there is a willingness and spirit of co-operation about holding it and there is a prospect of success. Senator Evans has suggested-I said this in my statement-that the Government should take an opportunity to consult with the States. That matter is fact has been put in train. On the agenda for the Premiers Conference to be held tomorrow is this question of the attitudes of the States to the holding of another Constitutional Convention. We will be particularly interested in what the States have to say. We will be interested in what is said in the Senate tonight. We will take into account the views expressed and we will have regard to the progress that is taking place in Committee D. I hope that in the not too distant future we may be in a position to reconsider the question of holding a convention. Whether it should be held later this year is a matter which will have to be considered in the light of the circumstances at the time the matter comes before the Government again. As I said, the Government is in a neutral position on this motion. We are interested in the debate here and the views expressed. We will be consulting with the States tomorrow at the Premiers Conference. I hope that the work of Committee D will progress to a stage where there may well be a number of sufficiently well researched, well prepared topics to form the basis of an agenda for any future meeting of the Convention. </PARA>

What we are at least unanimously agreed on, from lukewarm to red hot, is that the Constitution that this country has at the moment is seriously out of date and is in need of change. Unfortunately, the parties, the individuals and the community organisations involved are not as ready to agree on the direction and the detail that the constitutional changes and the considerations of constitutional amendments should take. For all Senator Evans's optimism, this disagreement and the acrimony involved on occasions has considerably impeded the progress of previous conventions. I attended as an observer the 1978 Convention in Perth. If it seemed pointless to those, like Senator Evans, who took part in it, it seemed absurd to those of us who were simply watching it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sentor Evans-You could be forgiven for that response. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Evans. You are too kind. I am not saying that disagreement amongst delegates is a bad thing any more than disagreement on the different sides of this chamber or within parties, as Senator Missen would know, is necessarily a bad thing. I am saying that it has in the past caused problems because of the intense partisanship of some of the delegates to the conventions- a partisanship which, very clearly, has increased since 1975 despite what Senator Evans asserts about the concensus being achieved in the 1976 and 1978 conventions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Compounding the problem of amending the Australian Constitution has been the fact that, over the years, referenda in this country have been turned into mini- elections. That applies regardless of whether they have stemmed from constitutional conventions or not. Of the 38 items presented to the people of Australia between 1901 and 1977 only eight have been agreed to. This proportion will have to change dramatically if the results and benefits jof the constitutional conventions that are held in the future are to be readily effected. The dismal record of the response of Australian electors to the various referenda that have been put to them has not been helped by the Constitution's own requirements-somewhat straight jacketing requirements they are-that ratification requires not only a majority of voting support but also a majority of State support. It is not always easy to combine the two. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, it was never envisaged in the early determination of the Australia's Constitution that partisan politics would develop as bitterly as they did so soon after the drafting of the constitution initially. That is not to say that ideological differences did not exist before the turn of the century , merely that considerably less vitriol and considerably more desire for compromise were present in debates and decision making than appear to exist today, at least in some areas. What some members of this chamber like to refer to as a spirit of friendliness and co-operation certainly was more apparent during the making of our original Constitution, it would appear from all the records that have been kept, than has been evident in any constitutional convention that has been held since then. This no doubt, had a lot to do with the composition of the group and with the sorts of men who attended the 1891, 1897-98 conventions. They were predominant small Liberals although there were some hard line conservatives. I think-Senator Evans will correct me if I am wrong-ther was only one Labor delegate. These people, because basically they were small 'l' Liberals, were much more open, I think, to compromise and conciliation than might have been expected. </PARA>
<PARA> Their flexibility and determination to look to the future and put aside rigid ideologies made them much more ready to look to the needs of the coming Federation and the requirements that its people would face. This is certainly something that some delegates in more recent conventions could learn from: I suggest this means that what we need in future constitutional conventions are more middle of-the-roaders and fewer extremist elements so that, while there may still be divergences of opinion over emotive issues, such as the power of the chambers and what the High Court of Australia should or should not be allowed to do, there is much more likely to be some spirit of conciliation and compromise. The fact that the 1978 Convention consisted very largely of some largely rather bitter debating on the powers of the Senate and the relative strengths of the upper and lower Houses indicates only that some things never change. One wonders , for instance, whether, under present day conditions, a man like James Henderson Howe would have succeeded in what in his day was an extraordinary achievement in getting age pensions included in Part V. of the Constitution or whether men like Kingston and Higgins would have had their way on the still contentious matter of industrial arbitration powers. I suspect not. </PARA>
<PARA> Even something as apparently trivial as Abbott's inclusion of astronomical and meteorological observations has proven of great value to Australia. For instance , if Reid had his way in 1897-98 it is quite likely that Australia would not have achieved what it has in the field of radio astronomy. However, notwithstanding all that it is an unarguable fact that the serious obstacles placed in the way of altering the Constitution, and placed there for the very best of motives by the original drafters, have impeded attempts to bring the Constitution up to date or in step with a rapidly changing world. A lot of the problem stems from the fact that there is no permanent, truly independent body in existence which can look regularly at the Constitution and recommend changes which can be put directly to the people without the added circus of partisan political interference. Senator Evans suggested a sort of popular convention. It has been suggested by John La Nauze that this very idea of a permanent independent body which constantly looks at the Constitution for anomalies and needs for amendment would be the best way of going about it. Unfortunately to date all that we have been able to come up with has been a Convention which is made up of members of parliament, largely lawyers, local government officials and community representatives. The last two groups have tended to be swamped by the rather loquacious nature of the legal delegates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most legal delegates are lawyers. I am not saying that none of the Conventions that have been held during the 1970s have achieved anything because I do not believe that that is true. In fact, considering the obstacles, I make the point that they have achieved a great deal. Judges of the Federal Court of Australia now no longer hold office until they die, regardless of their ability, effectiveness of incipient senility. Territorians are no longer non- people and are able to vote at referenda for constitutional alterations. Housekeeping amendments of one sort or another, which relate among other things to the numbers of Ministers and their salaries, have been made. However, we are still awaiting implementation of the 1976 Hobart resolution on the question of defamation. We all know what problems have been caused by section 15-the section that relates to casual Senate vacancies-both before and after its amendment in 1977.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite all the pleasant things that Senator Evans had to say about the 1978 Convention in Perth, it was turned into a three-ring circus because of the security arrangements that prevailed at the time. This was partly due to the fact that there was a Cabinet meeting in Perth at the same time and partly because of reaction to the Hilton bombing. In adition, that Convention spent the largest part of its time bickering futilely and acrimoniously about the powers of the Senate and the referral or otherwise to the High Court of questions regarding the validity of federal parliamentary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, despite the problems inherent in expecting a convention consisting largely of members of Parliament to settle their ideological differences long enough to concern themselves with what John La Nauze called ' the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth of Australia', these Conventions are better than nothing. For that reason the Democrats support the motion before the Senate. I agree with Senator Durack that we do need details of proposals, that it does need to be well organised, that the States do need to approve them and that we do require their co-opeation because otherwise the great deal of work that is done in preparing papers and treaties and so on is simply wasted. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am disturbed about one other factor that is involved in future Conventions and that is that the resolution defining the composition of the Senate delegation remains the same as the one moved by Senator Withers in 1978. If that was not the same it was very similar to the composition of the Senate delegation in 1976. It makes no allowance for the fact that there are other members of Parliament other than Labor or Government members. It seems to me-I made the point in 1978-a rather extraordinary action by any government to ignore the existence of senators who do not represent either of those two party affiliations-either Labor or Government members-but do represent a not inconsiderable number of voters. In the case of the present Senate that amounts to well in excess of one million voters. I do not think it unfair to suggest that perhaps one of the 16 Federal parliamentary delegates should come from a senator who is either an independent or a member of a minority party. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978 I suggested an amendment to Sentator Withers' motion which, for a variety of reasons, including, I suspect, a certain amount of lily-liveredness on the part of senators on both sides of the chamber, lapsed for want of a seconder. The amendment that I moved in 1978 is, I think, still pertinent now. I ask senators from both the Government and the Labor party to consider the merits of the amendment which was moved on 26 May 1978. It is readily available for perusal. In effect it simply removes any mention of party affiliation with regard to the composition of the Senate delegation. Instead of mentioning two Liberal and one National Country Party senator and three Australian Labor Party senators, it refers to three Government delegates and three non-government senators as delegates. I do not think that is an impossible request for this Parliament to consider. It leaves room for the Senate, rather than the Government, to decide which, if any, independent senators or senators from minority parties may be included amongst the delegation. </PARA>

I suggest that, since non-ALP members make up twice that number on this side, we have at least equal right to some representation. If this idea is unacceptable to the major parties, one wonders just how serious they are in their attempts to change the Constitution by consensus for the good of all and how much they are simply bent on point scoring.</PARA></TALK.START>

I support the motion moved by Senator Evans, namely, 'that the Senate supports the holding of a further session of the Australian Constitutional Convention in Adelaide this year'. However, after less than one hour of debate on this motion in the Senate, I am not sure why we have inflicted it on ourselves. Nevertheless, there are some serious issues that need to be considered. I do not intend to canvass those issues in any detail tonight. Senator Evans gave us a pretty thorough rundown on the issues that may or may not be involved in any constitutional review. I do not want to canvass those issues; I will just make a couple of points from a slightly different point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The lesson of past constitutional conventions is that if the object of the exercise within the Convention is either grandstanding by politicians or compromises that are hammered out between politicians, without due regard or sensitivity for the people who will finally determine the outcome of them, then they are a waste of time. In the hope that some lessons have been learnt from experiences with the Constitution in recent years, I would support the holding of a further constitutional convention in an attempt to get some momentum into the issue. It is very important that we do not just shrug our shoulders about very real difficulties that exist under the present Constitution. However, we ought to bear in mind that it is possible that after as thorough a review as we may make of our Constitution we may find that, in fact, very little change is either necessary or practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> Much reference has been made to what is happening in Committee D of the Constitutional Convention, which is, of course, the Committee with which the Senate would be the most concerned. It is my very earnest hope that those who work in Committee D review the lessons of the fate of the first issue in the 1977 referendum. I do not intend to review the issues of that referendum, but lessons should have been learnt from them. One of those lessons, and one of the most salient lessons, of the 1977 referendum is that it is not enough for political leaders to agree in a way that suits the leaders if they have overlooked fundamental factors in the electorate and in the Constitution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the honourable senator's depth of feeling. I was being very restrained in trying not to re-raise those issues. On the one hand, we cannot be complacent. We must recognise that there are real issues related to our Constitution that deeply trouble a large number of people. On the other hand , I think it would be as well to realise that there are a large number of issues which may deeply trouble two or three people here which are of no import at all to the general mass of people. That does not necessarily mean that we know better; it may well be that the people know better than we do about what is important to them. In that context, one should always ask the question: What is the purpose of a constitution? It is a legal document that the people of this country live under.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, of some of the instances that have been raised the most notable one is that of courts and jurisdiction. In that case a lot of average people who do not consider that something as esoteric as a constitution, something as perhaps awe inspiring as the courts and something else called Parliament, has much relevance to them in their day to day lives. They receive a rude shock when, through an unfortunately common personal circumstance they find that they and their children are put through quite harrowing situations because of this particular quirk of the Constitution which relates to jurisdiction of the courts . More people will be aware of that; that is an outstanding example. For that reason I think we need to show a willingness to continue to look and attempt to improve things where we believe they can be improved and should be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there are some areas that clearly cause problems that must be resolved, it must be clear also to Australians that the motive of seeking a resolution through some change in the Constitution is not a political one. There is, we must face it, in this chamber a basic distrust of the motives of politicians when they start to rearrange power in a legal document. One of the lessons of the 1977 referendum, I believe, was a reaction on the part of many people to just that issue. Without the people necessarily wanting to hear great arguments about the technicalities of what the power of the Senate ought to be and what the power of Prime Ministers ought to be, there was in my experience-it was not part of a campaign-there was a totally spontaneous response within the electorate. It was not a very flattering one, but I cannot deny that it is a fact. A number of people said to me: 'If Mr Fraser and Mr Whitlam want to do this, something is wrong; so I will vote no'. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans laughs. In a sense, I suppose it is amusing but those people who had that hunch were right: There was something wrong when an ex -Prime Minister and a current Prime Minister were so enthusiastic about the subject of their powers versus the Senate. I do not want to canvass that issue. That is an illustration of why we have to be enormously careful. For that reason there are good arguments for making sure that a lot of people are involved, that the best possible advice comes forward, that all the important angles are canvassed, that all the relevant material is brought up and we are in a better position to judge it. We can stand here tonight and debate the Constitution. We can push our little barrows on this and that. But, in fact, what we say here tonight might be utterly irrelevant to the Australian electorate. For all we know, after undertaking this process and perhaps working on it very hard over several years, we might find that the ultimate judgment from the Australian people for all our labours is that they really do not want it changed. That would have to be a verdict that would have to be accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that we need a broad involvement and a wide consultation. However, the last thing I want to say is that in all circumstances, whoever is doing this , whether it be the Constitutional Convention or some review committee, whether it be a convention broadly-based or narrowly-based, whether it even has the Australian Democrats-if it is that broad-whatever the composition of the people who are talking about it, it must always be in the context of reality. One has to be a little careful here when making comments on the Senate and the Senate's powers because the purpose of tonight's exercise is not to open up a debate about the Senate's powers. But as a Queensland senator I want to put one caveat on this entire thing. I hear people saying all the time: 'The year is 1982. It is 80 years since Federation. We have a document that is 80 years old. It is irrelevant in large part and we must rewrite it so that it is relevant to Australia of the 1980s'. They may have a point. Nobody is suggesting that the principles of Magna Carta are irrelevant just because they are old. Principles that have been established for some time are not necessarily wrong because they come from a previous age. It is very important in this context that people do not delude themselves on this point. The very specific instance I am given over and over again relates to the Senate and to division of powers. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite any Victorian or New South Wales member of parliament who has this view to spend a little time in my State, not because there is anything peculiar about my State-not at all. They would have a good time, but they would learn a lesson. They would learn that the fundamental free trade versus protection debate that had so much to do with the present structure of the Senate is as strong and as real in terms of day to day life and in terms of its real effect on the citizens of Queensland as it was 80 years ago. Those people, recognising the reality of a particular economic program and of particular policies, still would look to a situation in which there is some balancing factor in power. I mean no offence to any New South Wales or Victorian senators here tonight. But protection policies favour them more. They are not aware of the sharp effect in terms of political reaction that they have in a State such as Queensland. They are not aware of the political reality that that throws up for anyone within Queensland attempting to move through the political process. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not mean, of course, that I am saying that Queensland politicians are crass and that they capitalise on it. I am one who will continue, on behalf of Queenslanders, to speak on the subject of protection and free trade and all the issues associated with it, not because I must just because I am a Queenslander but because it is in the national interest. It is important that most, if not all, of our citizens feel that on the whole they are getting a fair deal, that there is some sort of safeguard there for them and that, if there is one area of government policy that clearly is not in the interests of one region, there is some balancing factor. That is an essence of what our nationalism is about and I believe that is an essence of the debates of the founding fathers. In my opinion very substantial parts of the Constitution are still relevant. If we discover through the process of debate only why those parts are still relevant and exactly what they are we will have moved a step forward because we will have brought a little more enlightenment and understanding to those who lead this country as to what those factors are. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that in the next few years there will be many occasions on which we will discuss this matter at great length, and I am sure that in the near future there will be some occasions on which we will discuss them at some length. I think there has been some value in saying a few words to Senator Evans's motion tonight. I am pleased to support it. I do not support it in any half-hearted way . I appreciate that it may happen that the Constitutional Convention is not necessarily held in Adelaide and that it may be held on 2 January next year. I note that Senator Evans is nodding his head. Nevertheless, the Senate is making its intent clear: To proceed rather than to put aside the fact that there are real concerns about our Constitution is the far wiser event. I hope that those who proceed will proceed with some courage and some vision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make the shortest speech on this subject tonight and I do not think I will have much trouble doing that. I got the impression that the approach of those on this side of the chamber who spoke earlier was perhaps a little lacking in great enthusiasm for the proposal and, as one who is very keen on the idea that there be a Constitutional Convention, I think I should say so. I believe that it is important that the momentum of constitutional change be kept up. The fact that we have not had any meeting of the Constitutional Convention for approximately four years is rather serious and I think it is important that we close that gap as quickly as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not to be taken as necessarily being happy with the idea of a parliamentarians' convention as perhaps being the solution in the long run. I think it is important that we meet again and look at the functions of these meetings and the way in which they will be held. I am a strong supporter of a popularly elected convention. I think ultimately that will be required. At least it may require the addition to the membership of the present Constitutional Convention representatives outside the present ranks of Federal or State politicians. At the moment it is really a State members' convention. The great mass of them-I think some 78-are State delegates, and the Commonwealth has some 16 delegates. Senator Haines was upset tonight about not getting on the Convention. She is not alone in that. Various others of us have had the greatest of difficulty trying to get there by some device or other. In fact back bench members of this Parliament generally have a tough job trying to get any involvement in these conventions because the Commonwealth component is very small. Maybe the Commonwealth component ought to be increased. I think it certainly should be. Irrespective of how it develops, I think it is important that we maintain an interest in constitutional reform. The results of previous conventions have been useful in the context of the relatively mild successes which we have had. Even the unsuccessful constitutional change of 1977, to which Senator Martin referred, won 62 per cent of the vote throughout the whole of Australia. Unfortunately in some of the more extraneous areas of Australia the message did not get across. I think it was badly handled in the early stages. A number of us said that at an early stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the suggestion. I regard the Constitution as an extremely important part of the life of every Australian, of every aspect of Australian life. We ought to consider constantly whether we have a need to change the Constitution, whether we are satisfied with what is happening, whether we understand what is happening and whether we are making the most use of what we have. It is for those reasons that I support totally the idea that we ensure that there is a reasonably regular review in a society, in an economy and in a world which is subject to rapid change in every way. I do not think we can sit back and say we will let one of the most fundamental things governing the whole of our society, outside natural laws, sit there without giving thought as to whether it is adequate. Even if the process does no more than create an awareness of what is, it is worth while.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that what is must be is a philosophy which we should adopt. I do not suggest that simply because we have a Constitution we should say that that Constitution must remain for ever and a day unchanged. Nor do I say that because it is, it ought to be changed simply so that we can have the face of change. Somewhat jokingly the other day I took up a suggestion made by somebody discussing this subject that the problem is to get the apathetic mass to consider the Constitution and to talk about it. I suggested that perhaps I could be described as being on the radical wing of the apathetic mass in that I was prepared to talk about it. Whilst not regarding myself in any way as a campaigner for reform, I am a campaigner for review. I think that that is a legitimate position to take along with the others who would like to see a republic of Australia, along with others who would like to tear up the document and along with others who would like to leave it absolutely untouched and never discussed. There is room for those views. My own view is that we should constantly be reviewing, debating and understanding the processes. </PARA>
<PARA> I can hark back only to the sort of jolt that we can get in relation to the Constitution. I am a very firm believer in the preservation of our Federation, in the preservation of States' rights and in the preservation of a clear division as to who in this country fulfils one function and who fulfils another. I have taken a particular interest in the development of what I should have thought, in the view of our founding fathers, was clearly intended to be a national function and not a State by State function. That is something which you , Mr Acting Deputy President, also had some views on and interest in. One of the things that were clearly in mind at the time of drawing up the Constitution was that we should have one national approach to trade, to transport, to communications and to the essential controls in relation to trade, including company law. </PARA>
<PARA> After years and years of work we at last got to the stage of having round two of a national approach. We got a uniform Companies Act at the end of the 1950s, a decade after the Second World War had given a whole lot of people the idea that perhaps we needed some changes in some things like that. We found that within a year the uniform Companies Act was the non-uniform Companies Act. Now we find that before we have finished passing the package of legislation under the co-operative federalism approach in relation to the new system for a national companies and securities code and the creation of a national commission , all of which has been accepted by the whole of Australia, we have been double- crossed-there is no other word-by the States. Whilst we solemnly passed legislation agreed to by the Ministerial Council and presented to this Parliament as the product of the Ministerial Council, giving powers to the national commission which the legislation which we had to pass would create, when the States came to deal with it they revised the powers and reduced the powers in relation to hearings. They reduced those powers to make ineffective the work of the National Companies and Securities Commission, to the degree that that commission has now been very substantially denuded of its powers by the judicial decision in Queensland. Unless amendment is made it will, I believe, remain a neutered body without the most essential power for which it was created and for which it should exist. If that is to be federalism then I believe there is a very strong argument for constitutional reform as opposed to constitutional review. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the way I started. I have been-I think people who know me would accept this-a States righter in most ways in the preservation of the rights of the small States in particular. I have objected particularly to what Senator Martin was talking about-the protection racket which as I see it is imposed by a populous majority of Australians against the interests of the more economically productive areas of Australia. That may be justified. But when there are people who solemnly enter into a co-operative federalism approach, who then surreptitiously change what has been agreed to the stage where without informing this Parliament and in breach of the arrangements, the understandings, which are the fundamentals of the Maroochydore agreement in relation to the whole of the companies and securities agreement, they introduce legislation which has an entirely different effect, then I believe there is every case for constitutional review if not reform. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many matters for discussion. I do not propose to attempt to discuss them all. Senator Martin mentioned one of the matters of great concern-the protection racket-whereby the populous States are seen by many as ripping off the resource-based or more industrious States. We have a situation where industrial disputation and inflation inducing and international trade complicating disadvantages tend to be generated under the protection of the protection umbrella to the disadvantage of the remainder of Australia. These are matters that need to be taken into the balance. There are questions about human rights. There are suggestions that we should have a human rights Bill. There are questions in relation to that that are often talked about. One of these is not often talked about; that is, the right to work. Have people a right to work within a free society? What are the legitimate constraints upon someone's right to continue to work? I am not anti-union. Having had a long experience of being a legal counsel for a whole series of unions I hope that I would be regarded not as a union basher for mentioning this. But I think this is an important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the nature of the right to work? What is the legitimate extent to which someone's right to work can be curtailed? Under what circumstances should it be curtailed? What is the degree of accountability? We have talked often about accountability in relation to ministerial responsibility. We talk about accountability in relation to statutory authorities-the quangos. What is the accountability of somebody else who can significantly affect the ordinary operation of our society, the ordinary operation of the individual rights and opportunities of our citizens? Is there a need to provide for some system of acccountability in relation to the trade union movement and what might be described as its ministerial equivalents, the leaders? If ministerial responsibility is to mean something is there some requirement that other people who have similar responsibility entrusted to them should have some greater degree of public accountability than appears to exist at the moment?</PARA>
<PARA> There is the matter of the popularly elected convention. I believe that that, too, must receive further consideration for a number of reasons, some of which have been canvassed tonight. I do not pause to develop them at this stage. It may be that what we ought to look to is a two-tiered discussion of constitutional review or constitutional reform, whichever term one chooses to adopt. I doubt that we will get the answer by having a whole lot of executive appointed representatives from the parliaments of Australia. I doubt that we will get the answer and its implementation by simply having people at conventions who are nothing to do with the exercise of executive power in Australia. Obviously for implementation of the responses from a constitutional convention or constitutional discussion one needs to have a relationship with and some sympathy from those who hold current executive power. It may be that we can work out a way, a sort of electoral college concept, of having a broad-based discussion about the areas of concern and the areas which people believe need some change and then bring together something closer to the representatives of the executives, or at least the representatives of the parliaments, for some form of implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> A broad cross section of questions need to be addressed if this nation of ours is to obtain the greatest advantage from a working, operating constitution. I warmly support the idea that it is not in any way a waste of time or a waste of effort to join together to debate issues related to the Constitution, however frustrated one may feel at times at the lack of progress which appears to be made in resolving one way or another what the result ought to be. If it does no more than turn people's attention to the questions, if it does no more than remind people of the importance of the Constitution, I think it serves a useful purpose. I am glad that Senator Evans has brought on this motion tonight. I trust that tomorrow the Premiers Conference will have regard to the debate which has taken place. I am delighted as a member of the Government parties here to be in a position to support the motion. I hope that we will be seeing a further constitutional convention in the near future; I make it no more limited than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not propose to repeat that speech, Mr Acting Deputy President. I would not inflict that upon the Senate. But there are one or two brief points-I stress the words 'brief points'-which I think are worth saying on the subject and which I did not say earlier. I will take the liberty of doing so now. I will not be very long about it because we had a very lengthy debate on this matter earlier in the day. On behalf of the Australian Democrats I repeat that we perceive the enrichment of uranium as being definitely the first step on the path towards proliferation of nuclear weaponry. This is a move to which all Australians would not really want to contribute. Indeed, the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation Conference, which was composed of representatives from over 60 countries, reported that the proliferation risk is inherent in enrichment technologies. The earlier report of the Uranium Advisory Council which we are considering here recognises this and speaks of the need for the application of effective international safeguards to enrichment facilities so as to have accurate material accounting and effective surveillance measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier today the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) dealt briefly with this matter. At this stage I draw attention to the fact-I think the Senate should note this-that the Uranium Advisory Council has mentioned the need for upgrading the functions and status of the Australian Safeguards Office, implying that that Office is restricted in its capabilities at present. I think the more complex the situation becomes on the supply of Australian uranium the more tangled the skein becomes overseas. Of course, it is becoming more and more tangled with every day that passes. If we are to honour our obligations and do the things which Senator Sir John Carrick mentioned earlier as those we wish to do, we have to beef up the Australian Safeguards Office and give it all the facilities and staff that it needs to carry out its very important functions. That is one of the additional points that I would like to make. </PARA>
<PARA> A further point is, of course, the costs and market for enriched uranium. The present operating capacity for enriched uranium is 48,300 tonnes in the Western world and another 12,000 tonnes is planned to be ready by 1985. But according to the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, among many other expert groups in this region of the world, the expected world demand for uranium hexafluoride will be much less than supply right through until the 1990s. In other words there is already much more in the world than we can consume. In short, there is an international over-supply of uranium hexafluoride. This will continue for many years to come. Is this the climate in which there is any sense at all in Australia considering setting up a uranium enrichment industry? Indeed, every year since 1974-75-some way back now-the AAEC has reduced its estimate of world uranium demand. In 1978-79 it began reporting that there was no requirement for further enrichment capability world wide. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that the uranium enrichment plants have had a better safety record than the remainder of the industry. Senator Sir John Carrick made this point earlier. I point out that this is only because the small number of enrichment plants distorts the statistics. Let me illustrate examples of what has happened. On 2 July 1977 the security personnel of the COMURHEX plant at Pierrlatte, Southern France, sealed a major leak of highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride gas. The accident was caused by 'an error on manipulation by a staff member'. Quite simply somebody made a mistake. I suppose we might almost say that someone made an error of judgment. The accident caused the local area to be sealed off before the materials pollution could be contained. Nevertheless , it happened. The same thing happened again--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they can insure against that. That is an excellent point, Senator. The same thing happened again at the same plant in November of the same year, only four months later. On 6 December in that same year uranium hexafluoride gas was spilled into the atmosphere from a test rig at Capenhurst enrichment plant in the United Kingdom. There were three major incidents in that year when the whole of the Western world had only four enrichment plants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I merely want to make a final point-a bottom line as it were. When the bottom is falling right out of the future market for uranium, and one can look as far ahead as one likes to go and the projections are all bad, what is the sense of even taking up time in considering this highly expensive, complicated and dangerous industry for establishment in Australia? The Australian Democrats feel that it is a pity that the Uranium Advisory Council has not grasped the nettle in its final report and made it quite plain to the Government that the facts will demonstrate that we should say no to any uranium enrichment in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not surprised that Senator Mason cut his remarks short tonight because those of us who heard the debate this afternoon in which the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick, participated, would have heard all of the arguments that Senator Mason used during that period decisively and conclusively demolished. I can only conclude that the Australian Democrats are taking so many somersaults that they have become quite giddy. They are losing their touch with reality. I suggest that while they want to win the seat in Western Australia that they are seeking so hard, they are moving further and further away from that possibility with the line that they are taking. Even the Australian Council of Trade Unions has recognised that its view is quite different from that taken by the Democrats. I point out to Senator Mason that the trade union movement generally, in Europe in particular, constitutes the leading resistance to the anti-nuclear groups. If Senator Mason and his party would like to get on to a popular issue I suggest that they abandon this one as quickly as possible. As I said, they are being left behind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Mason mentioned that the Uranium Advisory Council report, which is the subject of this debate tonight, suggested that by 1990 the world will be needing much more enriched uranium. I point out to him that that is only eight short years away. I suggest to him also that the technology which is used for the production of enriched uranium is being developed at a rapid rate. There are two established processes already. Work is being done using the laser beam; that is more advanced technology. Even the lead time to build the structures would be at least eight years if we started today. Senator Mason's suggestion that we should not start thinking about this issue until the time comes when the world is short of uranium shows that he is keeping his head totally in the sand. I wish to outline some of the conclusions reached by the Council. The first conclusion is:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council accepts that the AAEC possess the necessary technical skills and experience, as a result of the research that it has already conducted into the centrifuge process, to advise on and if necessary participate in the planning, construction and operation of a plant, and that the Australian industrial structure provides an existing basis for the manufacture of some of the necessary component machinery for a centrifuge plant. </PARA>
<PARA> That is encouraging news. The Senate Committee on National Resources, that I happen to chair, did some work recently on solar energy. That was one of the bases of Senator Mason's arguments this afternoon in a previous debate. It was demonstrated very clearly during that Senate Committee's inquiry-a view which was supported by three members of the Opposition-that apart from some areas of industry application the wide and broad use of solar energy is a long way off; also that the amount of energy needed to construct some of these more advanced technologies in solar energy is greater than is ultimately produced. The second conclusion was that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council does not regard itself as competent to offer a valid judgment as to the economic viability of an enrichment project. </PARA>
<PARA>That second conclusion can be understood if one goes back to the Fox report which recommended the establishment of this Council. The Council was to be made up of people not closely involved with the industry. If we look at the members who make up the Council we see that there are none who are expert in the area of high technology. So that second conclusion is perfectly understand- able. The Council's third conclusion states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council notes that while certain of these effects-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the chemical and other waste discharges at the constructional and operational stages of an enrichment plant-</PARA>
<PARA>would need to be assessed in respect of specific conditions at a particular site , the normal routine operation of the plant would be such as to have little or no effect on the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>The fourth conclusion reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council must assume that the Commonwealth Government would not authorise the establishment of a commercial enrichment plant without ensuring that it was subject to the effective international safeguards, institutional controls and surveillance measures that the INFCE Working Group believes can minimise the risk of diversion of low enriched uranium for production of weapons grade material. </PARA>
<PARA>That leads me to the first point that Senator Mason made in his contribution. He sees a definite link, a complete link, between uranium enrichment and the production of atomic weapons. That view was demonstrated by Senator Sir John Carrick this afternoon to be totally invalid. There is no connection whatsoever. In fact, the Council, in its report, says so quite clearly. It says that the quality of the enriched uranium produced is no closer to the atomic weapons process than ordinary yellowcake. The final conclusion reached by the Council is that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it can see no valid reason against the Government's proceeding with a study of the feasibility of, and perhaps participating in the establishment of, a commercial uranium enrichment industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I wish to repeat the point that if, as the Council suggests, by 1990 the world will be needing more uranium, Australia, as potentially one of the cheapest producers of uranium, has a duty not to ignore the fact that the lead time between now and 1990 is so close that we need to be working very hard now so that we are ready by then to produce this enriched uranium. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate views with grave concern the double standards of the Prime Minister in continually refusing to answer repeated calls from Senator McLaren since 1976 to provide the Parliament with the cost to the Australian taxpayer of his, Mr Fraser's, occupancy of the Lodge, when he so readily provided the costs of occupancy of the previous Prime Minister in answer to a 'Dorothy Dix' Question in the House of Representatives on 24 March 1976. </PARA>
<PARA>I had to give notice of that motion on 26 November 1980 because I found myself frustrated over a long period in trying to ascertain from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) what it was costing the taxpayer to keep him in residence. Had the Prime Minister been an honest man, as he claims he is, he would quite readily have made that information available. He did not want to do so because it would have been of some embarrassment to him. But after coming to office he was very smart in trying to embarrass the Labor Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. I will quote from the Senate Hansard of 16 September 1980, a date on which I raised this matter. That was only one of the very many times I raised this. In dealing with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1980-81, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about the costs incurred to run the Prime Minister's Lodge. Whenever I raise this matter I am told that it has been the practice of all governments not to divulge the costs of the official establishments. Again this year I asked about the cost of official establishments. An answer came back, no doubt from the Prime Minister's Department. Again, it was stated that the traditional principle is not to supply cost figures for individual establishments. </PARA>
<PARA>I raised that question because the honourable member for Barker, Mr Porter, after the Liberal-National Country party coalition came to office in 1975, put a Dorothy Dix question to Mr Fraser on official residences of the Prime Minister. At page 1084 of the Senate Hansard of 16 Sepember 1980 I quoted that question. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> A Dorothy Dix question was addressed to the Prime Minister on 24 March 1976 by Mr Porter, the Liberal member for Barker. It was headed 'Official Residences of the Prime Minister'. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can he inform the House of the cost last year of running the Lodge and Kirribilli House?</PARA>
<PARA>Off the top of his head, Mr Fraser was able to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not have the figures for the whole of last year but have them for the last part of the year for both places. In the last six months of the last year the Lodge cost the Australian taxpayer $64,941. </PARA>
<PARA>I was quoting from the House of Representatives Hansard when I used that information. Mr Fraser went on to talk about the cost of Kirribilli House, but I am not concerned about the cost of running Kirribilli House and I was not at that time. Mr Innes, one of the Victorian members, interjected:</PARA>
<PARA> Tell us about Manila. Tell us about Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, as I said on 16 September, we all know what that interjection referred to. My colleague, Senator Walsh, interjected:</PARA>
<PARA> It is Question No. 3381 on the 1975 Notice Paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In reply, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot get an answer to that; yet we can get an off-the-cuff answer about the cost of running the Lodge and Kirribilli House when Mr Whitlam was the occupant. After the interjection Mr Fraser said:</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable gentlemen opposite do not like the facts of life about their leader. That is why they keep on trying to hide them. But I think that a few people have a right to be able to understand. </PARA>
<PARA>That illustrates the double standards of the Prime Minister to which I have referred in the motion before the chamber tonight. He had all those figures available at his fingertips very early in his life as Prime Minister in an endeavour to embarrass Mr Whitlam. He said that Opposition members did not like the facts of life about their leader being revealed. He said that he thought quite a few people had the right to know and a few people had the right to be able to understand. If the Prime Minister made that statement on 24 March 1976 why did that same principle not apply every time I asked a question about the running of the Lodge since he had become the occupant? Of course I could not get an answer. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time I had to resort to the method I have now used, that of giving notice of a motion to this Parliament to see whether we could flush him out. However, following the effluxion of time, during an Estimates debate in this chamber after the Australian Democrats were elected and the Goverment no longer had the numbers, Senator Chipp entered into a lengthy debate in which I was engaged in an attempt to get this information. He gave a warning to the Government that if it did not produce these figures the next time they were asked for the weight of numbers in this place might hold up the workings of the Senate until they became available. What was the outcome? Lo and behold, when I asked a question during the hearings of Estimates Committee C, of which I am a member, on Tuesday, 15 September last year, some of the figures were made available. The Prime Minister was not game to let the Senate take him on because he thought it might delve into a lot of other things. We got some of the costs of running the Lodge. But what has to be borne in mind is that included in this figure of $64,941 quoted by Mr Fraser for the running of the Lodge for the last six months of Mr Whitlam's occupancy would have been the cost of all the foodstuffs, the refreshments and drink of all kinds. Everything would have been included. What do we see in the figures that were given at the meeting of that Estimates Committee on 15 September of last year? There was nothing at all about foodstuffs, drink or refreshments. All the figures referred to are general maintenance, mechanical maintenance, electrical maintenance, bathroom and toilet fittings, carpets, furniture, shelving, hire of equipment, glassware and all sorts of other things in the nature of repairs and maintenance or flash furniture and crockery purchases for the Lodge. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the figures. The actual expenditure in 1980-81 was $121,065, excluding all the foodstuffs and drink. The estimate for 1981-82 is given as $ 135,000. There we have an increase of $14,000 from one year to the next just for capital equipment-for repairs and maintenance and for whatever the Prime Minister might want to spend on bringing the Lodge up to his standards. But there was nothing about foodstuffs. Of course, that is something that we will be pursuing when we consider the Estimates after the Appropriation Bills are introduced here in a week or two. While Mr Whitlam was in office he put on a party at the Lodge every Christmas for every person who worked in Parliament House. Of course, the cost of all that was included in the answer Mr Fraser gave . Mr Fraser is known to be a very wealthy man, but he is rather mean in many respects. He does not ask the staff of Parliament House to the Lodge every Christmas as Prime Minister Whitlam did to show his appreciation. </PARA>

As I said, Mr Fraser does not put on any of those things for the staff of the Parliament because it would be beneath him to have ordinary workers go inside the gates of the Lodge; he would not suffer them .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ombudsman has now pointed out that, with the passage of the Freedom of Information Bill in this Parliament, we have the wherewithal to take some action . The Government will not be able to hide this extravagant expenditure which it tries to hide. It kept it hidden for years until, with the assistance of Senator Chipp, we were able to force it to give us the information about Government House, Admiralty House, the Lodge and Kirribilli House. It is all set out in the Estimates Committee Hansard of 15 September 1981 for the people to see. Yet for many years Mr Fraser said that those figures could not be separated. Now they are separated, but I warn the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who is in charge of the Senate tonight, that the next time we go before an Estimates Committee we will want to know just what it is costing the taxpayer to feed Mr Fraser and what it is costing Mr Fraser to entertain his colleagues from high places every time they come to Canberra. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, he is a millionaire many times over, but the more money he gets the more money he wants and the more he wants to rip off the poor people. We know that pay-as-you-earn taxpayers are the ones who cannot escape one cent of income tax. But people like Mr Fraser, primary producers, have many avenues to do so. I know, because I was a primary producer at one time. The Taxation Office publishes a booklet to tell primary producers of all the lurks and perks by way of claiming income tax deductions. It is there in black and white for those who want to read it. I have made my point. I warn the Government of what the Ombudsman has said. I will quote it for the information of people who were not here earlier today. He talked about the extensions of the function of the Ombudsman's office and then said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A third likely extension of function is to be found in the Freedom of Information Bill which passed in the Senate shortly after the close of the year. The Bill provides that a person unable to obtain access to information may make a complaint to the Ombudsman under the Ombudsman Act 1976. In this fashion a person will have an alternative avenue of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>The establishment that I am most concerned about is the Lodge. I used to accept what the Prime Minister said and what my own leader said about not revealing those figures. Had Mr Fraser not got someone to do some homework and separate the cost of running the Lodge for the last six months of occupancy by Mr Whitlam , I would not have pursued the matter. But because he took that opportunity to belittle the Labour Prime Minister he deserves to be pursued and made to eat his words. I quote them again. These are Mr Fraser's words:</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable gentlemen opposite do not like the facts of life about their leader. That is why they keep on trying to hide them. But I think that a few people have a right to know and a few people have a right to be able to understand. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words are very much applicable to the present Prime Minister. They are words that he uttered himself, and I throw them back at him. We have a right to know and the taxpayers have a right to know what it is costing them to keep that gentleman in luxury at the Lodge. The sooner he comes clean and tells us, the sooner he will not be criticised in this Parliament. The reason I had to resort to giving a notice of motion on 26 November was to try to get the support of the honourable senators opposite to ensure that when members of this Parliament, no matter which side they are on, ask for details of expenditure of taxpayers' money we will be given an answer. All we want is an answer. If honourable senators opposite do not deem it fit tonight to support this motion, I think it can be safely said that they are in agreement with the action that the Prime Minister has taken over the years. He is quite prepared to reveal what the costs of the Lodge were when the Labor Prime Minister was a resident there, but honourable senators opposite are prepared to support their Prime Minister in a big cover-up by not allowing the taxpayers of this country to know what it is costing to keep the present Liberal Prime Minister in office. I commend this motion to the Senate and I ask for full support for it.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate views with great concern the continued refusal of the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, to answer repeated calls from Senator McLaren for information as to whether he has provided the previous Governor-General with a free telephone service between Great Britain and Australia, and, if so, what has been the total cost to the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not speak for long to this motion because this is another typical matter to which I cannot get an answer from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It again gives me great satisfaction to know that the Ombudsman in his report has pointed out to us another method by which we can get information. Ever since the previous Governor-General was exiled from this country I have been trying to find out what it cost the Australian taxpayer to have him installed in the United Kingdom and particularly what it is costing the Australian taxpayer for his telephone. There is no doubt that he has an office because I received last year an answer from the Department of Administrative Services telling me that that Department provides him with an office. My belief was reinforced by an answer given to my colleague Senator Keeffe when on 11 November he asked for some details about the office. Senator Carrick sent the following answer to Senator Keeffe during the recess:</PARA>
<PARA> On 11 November 1981, (Hansard, page 2007) Senator Keeffe asked me as Leader of the Government in the Senate, a question without notice, concerning the cost of facilities for Sir John Kerr. </PARA>
<PARA>I use the words 'Sir John' because, as I pointed out this afternoon, they appear in this document and I wish to quote it correctly. I think that the Hansard staff and everyone in this chamber knows that I never use the title 'sir' because the policy of my party is that we do not believe in Imperial Honours. That is why I never use such titles. There is no Standing Order which requires a senator to use them. I do not mind calling a man 'mister' but I refuse to call him 'sir'. The answer continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has supplied the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been the practice of successive governments to provide former Governors- General with office facilities, a secretary and access to car transport. The expenditure is covered by parliamentary appropriation. In London, Sir John Kerr has facilities available in line with this practice. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it in black and white. Not only did I get an answer from the Department of Administrative Services but also my collegue Senator Keeffe now has an answer from Senator Carrick to the effect that the former Governor- General in exile does have these facilities in London. Yet we cannot get an answer from the Prime Minister as to what the Governor-General's telephone is costing the Australian taxpayer. As I have said in this chamber on many occasions, the former Govenor-General's infamous book, which one can buy at the bookstalls now for 1c down and on time payment over five months for another 5c, was written over the telephone. I have that information on pretty good authority . I want to know, and the Australian taxpayer wants to know, what it cost to write that book over the telephone. Of course, we cannot get an answer. However, the Commonwealth Ombudsman has given us a clue as to how we can go about it. I expect that, when the Estimates Committees resume and when we meet in the Committee of the Whole, as I had the support of the Australian Democrats previously over the Lodge issue, I will get that support again. We will then be able to flush out the whole cost to the Australian taxpayer of keeping this man in London and particularly the cost of the telephone. We are entitled to know the cost; it is public expenditure. </PARA>

Yet when we have the Appropriation Bill before us and we ask questions about this expenditure we are told, as we were told about our request to have separated the costs of the Lodge, Kirribilli House and Admiralty House: 'It can't be done'. As I have said, the Commonwealth Ombudsman has given us a clue as to how it can be done. I warn the Senate now that if we cannot get the answer when we are dealing with the Appropriation Bills very shortly it might be in for a torrid time. I give that warning.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to delay the Senate in discussing this matter. As often happens in this place one is caught unawares by the calling on of a motion which appears on the Notice Paper. I put this motion on the Notice Paper on the 26 November 1980. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That a Select Committee of the Senate be appointed to inquire into poverty in Australia and the additional information required to determine changes affecting the nature and extent of poverty since the publication of the reports of the Australian Government Commission of Inquiry into Poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That provisions relating to membership, powers and proceedings of the Committee be contained in a subsequent resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>That inquiry was the well known Henderson inquiry. Normally when caught in these circumstances one would have debate on this motion delayed but in view of the discussion that has taken place in the newspapers and on the media in the last couple of days about social welfare expenditure I believe that it is worth saying a few words, initially at least, in support of this motion. Since the production of the Henderson inquiry's main report in 1975 there has been some discussion-I believe it has not been adequate discussion or discussion on a high enough plane-about the incidence of poverty in this country, what we have done about it and what we could do about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Very few changes have been made to the social security system since the thoughtful and careful recommendations of the inquiry headed by Professor Henderson. Professor Henderson has continued to be active in the field and to take a great interest in the subject, but it seems that too often the Government has found the problem too hard. One thing that the Government did was to establish an inquiry into the measurement of poverty in the country. It was embarrassed by the fact that social security payments and welfare payments in general resulted in large groups of people being consistently below the poverty line as established by Professor Henderson and his co-commissioners. The Government, rather than increase expenditure or redirect funds to these people to get them above the Henderson poverty line-the only acceptable and recognisable poverty line that we have-decided to conduct an inquiry into the subject. The result of this inquiry was, in the minds of most of us, very disappointing. The inquiry seemed to come to the view in its rather general findings that poverty was something that was subjective, that it was in the eye of the beholder and that we had no real way of measuring it; it was too hard. Therefore in one chapter it came to the extraordinary conclusion that those who used the Henderson poverty line should have to justify its use and its accuracy whereas in other cases there was no real measurement of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> Geoffrey Barker, after reading this report, wrote in the Age of 21 November 1981 a critical article, the final words of which I believe are worth quoting because they sum up the situation as many of us see it. He pointed out throughout the article-as many of us see it-the unsatisfactory nature of the report, referring to the way in which the report thought that the problem was too hard. Often addressing his remarks initially to the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, finally he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney would do well to recognise that we do have a clear concept of poverty. It may be relative; it may be fairly arbitrary. And it may not be possible to define the concept in necessary and sufficient terms. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is recognisable: you know it when you see it (even if a lot of poverty is not immediately visible). It is therefore reasonable . . . that poverty is something in the world, and not just in our heads. There are real states of affairs corresponding to it; real people are suffering because of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge facing social scientists is to find adequate ways of assessing it ; the challenge facing Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a challenge facing Parliament--</PARA>
<PARA>is to implement action to ease it. Neither can avoid the issue by simply insisting that poverty is something in the eye of the beholder. That is a counsel of despair or moral cowardice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was published in the Age of 21 November 1981 and was written by Geoffrey Barker. I think his words are worth quoting and worth this Parliament taking note of. In fact, parliaments and governments have to do something about poverty. To insist that poverty is something in the eye of the beholder, in the way in which the subsequent report appears to have done, is in fact a counsel of despair and moral cowardice. Therefore we should take note of what Professor Henderson and his colleagues developed between 1972 and 1975. We should make sure that the findings that they produced and the data on which they produced them are continually upgraded so that we in this Parliament have some real concept of what poverty is, where it is and what we should do about it. One of the first statements in the findings of the poverty report which was released in 1975 made the quite clear statement that when poverty before and after housing is compared, fatherless families are clearly the poorest group. Since then, on any comparison of groups in the community likely to be in poverty, fatherless families and lone parent families, 90 per cent of which are headed by women, are the poorest group. They are consistently below the poverty line. They are consistently the ones in great difficulty. A greater percentage of them are poor than applies to any other group in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is disturbing and coincidental that, on the day this notice of motion comes before the Senate, we should see reports in the Press about this very group of people. In particular, we heard reports on the radio last night about Government members and this group of people. I refer to the Queensland Government supporter , Mr Donald Cameron, who is well known for his obsession about lone parent families, particularly deserted wives. Mr Cameron is also known as the gentleman who organised a party in the Parliament one night, the star event of which was a young lady jumping out of a cake to give pleasure to those members of Parliament who became members at the same time as he did. </PARA>

He has said such things in the past. He persistently makes speeches inside and outside the Parliament about what he sees as hordes of lone parents wandering around the community taking money out of the public purse. He has a general obsession with the level of welfare expenditure but he has a particular obsession with lone parents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, lone parents are usually the poorest in the community. There is no incentive for them, because of the nature of the means test in our social security system, to go out to work. The harshness of the means test affects not only the level of income they receive from their pensions but also the assistance they receive through fringe benefits. They have to suffer, as well as inadequate social security payments, the scorn of people such as Mr Cameron and his colleagues who seem to pick on this group because they are not organised politically and not large in number. He does not see them as a threat to the votes he needs. He sees them as a convenient group to pick as a scapegoat in his crusade against welfare expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Henderson and his colleagues came out with a disturbing report which told us that many more people than lone parents were in difficulty. We all knew that. As honourable senators know, he and his colleagues came to the conclusion that 10 per cent of families were in difficulty. They said that fatherless families and recent migrant groups were in particular difficulty. The figures Professor Henderson gave related to 1972-73. He said that the unemployed were also a very poor group as were females and large families. There were many others in difficulty but they were the groups that Professor Henderson picked out in particular. Since the report of this inquiry came out unemployment has increased enormously. We have made changes to our benefits system so that single unemployed people in particular do not receive the benefit of regular indexation and regular increases in payments. Recently the standard pension and benefit has dropped to a level of 22.4 per cent of average weekly earnings, the usual parameter on which we judge the value of pensions and benefits. We know that projected figures suggest that by June this year that level will be down to about 21.6 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no attempt to continue the work of the poverty commission to monitor the level of poverty in the community and to ascertain where it is and who is suffering from it. Obviously, we know from our experiences with the voluntary agencies, and the assistance of the Department of Social Security and the State departments of social welfare that there have been increases in poverty in certain areas, particularly the western suburbs of our two great cities, Sydney and Melbourne, where unemployment is so high. Unemployment is again very high in our rural areas. We know that there has been a general increase in unemployment but we do not have exact figures. We do not know exactly what is happening. We know that housing is becoming an increasingly difficult problem and that people are unable to afford their own houses because of increasing costs and interest rates. This throws more people back on to the private rental market and into the welfare housing area. It therefore puts pressure on those very needy people who have traditionally relied on this area. We know from Professor Henderson's report that housing and its cost are absolutely crucial to the determination of whether someone is in poverty. The poorer one is, the higher the percentage of one's income that will have to be spent on housing. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many factors which we need to know if we are to plan sensibly our attack on poverty and achieve not only its alleviation but also its prevention. There are many facts and figures which we should have known from the Census but which were limited because of the Government's short-sighted attitude towards asking sufficient questions about getting sufficient information. We could cull a lot of information which we do not have from welfare organisations, both government and non-government. This Government and the Parliament simply cannot plan properly and judge sensibly welfare legislation and welfare measures until they have this data and some means of evaluating the effectiveness of their programs. The fact that we do not have this knowledge allows people like Mr Cameron and his colleagues to make ill-conceived, heartless and unfair attacks on groups in the community. If Mr Cameron is not attacking lone parents, Mr Lynch is saying that unemployment is a myth and that the unemployed are all dole bludgers. Our ex-colleague in this place, Senator Sheil, used to talk continuously about dole bludgers who were, to use an unfortunate expression he once used in this place, fornicating on the foreshores and somehow striking at the economic heart of this country by eating up our welfare funds. </PARA>
<PARA> This ill-informed debate goes on and such people are able to attack the welfare system. They are able to do it firstly because in many cases there is inadequate information about the extent and nature of poverty, and secondly because in times of economic difficulty people in the community are always willing to look for scapegoats. People such as lone parents and the unemployed are convenient scapegoats for those in employment and who are well off. It is because of this that we need to extend our knowledge in this area so that Senator Chaney, or whoever else is Minister for Social Security, his colleagues and public servants can properly plan and properly present proposals to this Parliament; so that the Opposition and welfare agencies can make sensible proposals about what should happen to the welfare scene in this country, and so that we can have a sensible and rational debate. We believe there should be an on-going oversight as to just what is happening in this area in the community. It is for this reason I still consider it reasonable that a Senate select committee should take up where Henderson and his colleagues left off and look at the situation as they saw it. Henderson said in his report that it was only a snapshot of the poverty situation at one time in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that a Senate Select Committee should be set up so that we can have continual monitoring of just what is happening in this difficult area in the community and, above all, so that we can have an informed debate. We would not have to put up with the sort of headlines we saw on the front page of the Australian today and we would not have to put up with the ravings of Mr Cameron on PM last night. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for those reasons that I moved this motion. I hope that at some time the Senate will support such a motion. I realise that the time available to debate this motion tonight is short. This motion has been sprung on myself and the Senate tonight because of a sudden decrease in the verbosity of the lawyers who spoke earlier. However, these things happen and I hope that this debate can continue at another stage so that we can all develop our arguments more carefully, look at the problem more closely and perhaps come up with an inquiry from this chamber. In the past Senate Committees have produced bipartisan reports which have looked carefully at problems like this in the welfare area. They have been useful to governments but they should have been more useful to governments on more frequent occasions. If the Minister for Social Security is willing to continue the debate at another time, I am certainly willing to join in. As mover of the motion I suppose I will get a second bite of the cherry when closing the debate at that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would welcome a debate in considered terms on the subject raised in the motion moved by the Opposition spokesman on social welfare, Senator Grimes. Like him, I express concern about the fact that there does exist in Australia some element of what we would describe, without any argument, as poverty. There is nothing in the report which was put down by the social welfare policy secretariat which suggested that that was not the case. The situation is that that report, whatever other contribution it might make, has already served to some extent to clarify the debate on poverty in this country. For example, I note that prior to the issuance of that report it was commonly said by people who are concerned about poverty in Australia that there are now more than two million people who live in poverty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think one of the useful things stated in the report was the careful application of the statistics available to the Henderson poverty line. The number of people who might be regarded as being in poverty-if one accepts that line-is assessed as being in the order of one million, or slightly more-about the same level that applied in the early 1970s. Those who claimed two million people were in poverty, prior to the issuance of that report, now seem to accept and state that the figure is about one million. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Grimes says: 'That must make you feel good'. I confess it does not make me feel particularly good. To identify a group of one million people who might be in need of greater assistance is a more productive thing than identifying two million, four million or five million. The view is based on common sense. If one can isolate those who generally need assistance one can provide assistance to them. The job is possible. However, on the other hand, if one tries to apply a broad blanket measure to the whole population of Australia it is unlikely that any success will be achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is very little time to continue the debate this evening but I wish to make some brief comment on the concern expressed by Senator Grimes about the fact that the supporting parents benefit had been raised in public discussion recently by Government supporters in the House of Representatives. I do not think it is surprising or that it is objectionable that the rapid growth in the numbers receiving supporting parents benefit should give rise to some debate. It is a fact that there was a very large increase in the total number of sole parents who were assisted between 1973 and 1981. The number of sole mothers assisted has increased to about 120,000 and sole fathers to 6,000. The increase is very considerable. Currently I think it would be the fastest growing area of the benefits system and that is a matter which naturally attracts attention. One is entitled to ask: 'What are the social implications of the changes which are occurring?' In a welfare system in which the demands, almost by definition, exceed the supply of money which is available, one is entitled to ask whether any particular section of the benefits represents the best possible application of moneys. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe a single Government supporter would deny that mothers who are supporting children without the assistance of a husband are people whom the community ought to be concerned about, both for the sake of the mothers and the children. But a growth of from somewhere around 20,000 to 120,000 over a few short years suggests that changes are occurring in the community about which all members of this Parliament ought to be concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the breakdown of the figures there is room to be concerned about the growth of families which consist of an unmarried mother and a child or children. One is equally entitled to be concerned about the very rapid growth in the numbers of divorced or separated families who require the support of the State. There is no time to develop that point this evening but I suggest that that sort of change occurring in Australia over a relatively short period is something which deserves attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I wish to address this evening, in the very limited time available before the adjournment, is the social welfare policy secretariat discussion paper which was issued late last year. I think it makes a valuable contribution to the discussion of poverty in Australia. Indeed, the findings which it makes seem to be consistent with the current views put forward by Professor Henderson and his associates and are consistent with the views which have been put forward by the social welfare agencies with which I have had contact. For example, the report indicates that whilst the number of people who may be described as being in poverty under the Henderson measurement has not changed to any great extent, the composition of that group has changed over the last ten years. One finds for example that on the basis of theoretical measurement the relative position of the aged has improved. So one finds that the theoreticians, both of the social welfare policy secretariat and, as I understand it, also of Professor Henderson-I am relying here on his published comments following the release of the secretariat report-say that in a relative sense the position of the aged has improved. They would also say, commonly, that there is a larger number of single parents and a larger number of unemployed who might be in a position of real hardship in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I respond to a question that was asked by my colleague Senator Lewis and responded to by my colleague Senator Peter Baume yesterday. Senator Lewis was rather selective in reading from the editorial of the Courier-Mail of 9 February 1982 in supporting his question of Senator Peter Baume. The part he read from the Courier-Mail said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Middle Ages learned academics gathered for the medieval equivalent of weekend seminars to discuss how many angels could dance on the head of a pin. </PARA>
<PARA>What he failed to do was to read the last part of that editorial, which says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Day committee is worried about the lack of patriotic fervor. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that most Australians have pride in their country but there is an appalling ignorance about it and why we have Australia Day. </PARA>
<PARA> That is where education is needed. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the final paragraph of the editorial of the Courier-Mail, but my colleague was very selective and failed to read it. Tonight I rise to defend the Chairman of the National Australia Day Committee, Mr John Newcombe, from an unwarranted attack, one which I might add originated from a totally unexpected quarter. Senator Lewis cast aspersions on the Committee, of which I am also a member. He questioned, in my opinion, the integrity of the Committee when he suggested that it might be functioning outside the limits of its charter. He also denigrated our efforts by suggesting that we were committing a folly. I am sure that I speak for my Chairman and fellow members when I say that we take our duties most seriously. No doubt the honourable senator will receive a detailed reply from the Minister outlining the scope of the Committee's charter. I am sure that that will be forthcoming. However, in the meantime, I quite categorically state that it is within the Committee's charter to promote an awareness of the Australian identity, and to encourage people to focus on what it means to be an Australian, what is so special about this nation and why it is necessary to defend it and our way of life should it ever be threatened. In what better way can this be achieved than by holding a seminar and pooling the ideas of the many ethnic and cultural groups which are now represented in our Australian population?</PARA>
<PARA> John Newcombe has not suggested that he, his Committee or the many people who will contribute to such a seminar will come up with the complete answer. But it is a starting point and is innovative in that it has never been tried before, to my knowledge. If it does what I am confident it will do, that is, promote an awareness as to what it means to be an Australian, then in my opinion and in the opinion of the Committee it is not a waste of money. Perhaps Senator Lewis has some ill-informed opinion as to the mental capabilities of sports men and women and believes that because of their physical attributes they must be lacking in other areas. If this is so it is, in his words, 'folly' as this Committee was formed some three years ago under the chairmanship of Mr Herb Elliott, whose academic qualifications cannot, I believe, be challenged even by such a distinguished lawyer as the honourable senator. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Lewis underestimates John Newcombe, or 'Newk', as he is known to his myriad of fans throughout this nation and indeed in every country of the world. With the publicity he has already received has he not, indeed, achieved the aim of the Committee? People, the Press and other media have already started to question what an Australian is and what it is to be an Aussie. Even Senator Lewis has now put his point of view forward. What the Committee has done has at least got people talking and thinking about whether we have an identity crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I reiterate my and my fellow members' confidence in the Chairman and my disappointment that a member of this chamber has sought to question the capability and, indeed, credibility of perhaps Australia's best-known and best- loved son, a man who by his sporting prowess, humility and great national pride has shown this nation and the world at large what a great ambassador he is and in every respect what it is to be a proud Australian. Therefore, on behalf of this man who has no doubt as to his true national identity may I deliver to Senator Austin Lewis a full-blooded backhand. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Baume says he has some information. I asked my Whip's Office to send a message to the Minister that I would be raising this matter tonight. The matter relates to the way in which the Government is squeezing various departments, particularly the Department of Administrative Services. I want to find out whether the same squeeze is applying to the Parliament. Before I pose my question I remind the Senate of a report to the Senate of Estimates Committee A in October of last year. I will read page 2, which deals with parliamentary departments. The committee said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A feature of the examination of the Estimates of all four parliamentary Departments was the Government decision, effected by the Department of Finance in negotiations on the original estimates, to impose a 3 per cent across-the- board cut on proposed expenditure, only in the case of the Parliamenary Reporting Staff was that decision reversed. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more disturbing was the fact that, following preparation of departmental estimates in accordance with the 3 per cent across-the-board reduction, further reductions in proposed expenditure were made by the Government without consultation with the Presiding Officers, which, as Mr Speaker indicated during hearings of the House of Representatives' Estimates Committee A (H. of R. Hansard, 8 September 1981, pp. 2 and 3), was clearly in breach of well- established arrangements. The Department of the Senate, for example, made bids totalling approximately $174,000 for the upgrading of printing equipment and for the purchase of a six-station word processor. The Committee was advised by the Department that both bids were substantially rejected. Similiarly, the Parliamentary Library had imposed upon it a further reduction of 18 per cent for reprographic services. The Joint House Department, too, found that $50,000 had been subtracted from one bid, and $117,000 from another, without explanation or consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these general and specific reductions in proposed expenditure, all Parliamentary Departments examined were limited by a directive on staff ceilings and each department suffered a nett loss of full-time positions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee expresses its grave concern at the unilateral imposition of government controls upon the Parliament, and draws attention to the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, which it trusts will soon be debated at length in the Senate and to which it recommends that the Government give urgent consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading 'Departmental Priorities' the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Given the constraints under which the Parliamentary Departments were forced to operate in the preparation of the Estimates, the Committee expresses some surprise at the priority accorded certain items in the Estimates it examined. </PARA>
<PARA>Then the report of Estimates Committee A goes on to deal with the Parliamentary Library. I will not engage the time of the Senate in discussing that matter tonight. I was disturbed today when my leader, Senator Button, posed a question to Senator Guilfoyle about a matter which was raised on a television program this morning. It must have been an early program. Senator Button asked:</PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister for Finance whether she said on a television program this morning that the Department of Administrative Services had 'mishandled' instructions from the Government to reduce spending. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Guilfoyle answered Senator Button's question and then Senator Button asked a supplementary question. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to ask the Minister a supplementary question. Firstly, do the instructions which were issued apply to the Parliament? Secondly, is it normal practice for a Minister to send directions of this kind to a department without informing the Minister who is responsible for that department?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Guilfoyle said:</PARA>
<PARA>Which instruction was sent by a Minister to the Department? I seek clarification of the second part of that question. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button gave a clarification of the second part of the question but Senator Guilfoyle did not answer the first part; that is, whether these restrictions in expenditure applied to the Parliament. There is no record of her having answered that part of the question. The question I wanted to ask the Minister today, and I ask it now, is this: Has the recent direction of the Department of Finance on further restricting expenditure been issued to the Houses of Parliament as well as to Government departments? If the answer is yes, does this mean that the Government has completely ignored the concern expressed by Estimates Committee A and endorsed by the Senate and that it is now treating the Parliament with contempt?</PARA>
<PARA> Last Tuesday I raised with the President a matter concerning the Parliamentary Library. I had a discussion with him about that matter today and I am assured that an answer will be forthcoming next week after he has had discussions with the people in the Library, so I will not pursue that matter tonight. Now that the Minister for Finance is in the chamber I would like to know whether I can get an answer to the question I posed to her tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear the early part of Senator McLaren's comments with regard to the Estimates Committee but I take it no response is required with regard to that matter. I will make my remarks and if there is any further comment to make I will do so. With regard to the expenditure for both Houses of the Parliament, a practice and procedure has been established between the leaders of the Houses and the Presiding Officers. Together they work on the requirements for the Parliament. The negotiations at present with regard to the Additional Estimates would have been discussed between Mr President and me this evening had I not been on duty in the House. An arrangement has been made that we will discuss those matters early next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as all departments are concerned, including parliamentary departments, there is sufficient warrant to carry out essential activities until such time as we settle the Additional Estimates. There is no need for concern from the Parliament or any of the parliamentary departments until such time as the Additional Estimates are settled. When I meet with Mr President and, if it is necessary, with Mr Speaker, the Additional Estimates will be settled. As I have said, a role has always been played by the leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives in determining the levels of expenditure. I think I can give an absolutely unqualified assurance to the honourable senator that the requirements of the Parliament and of the members of the Parliament are of very great concern to the Government. It is our task to see that this place and the other place function in the way that is required for us to meet our responsibilities. I give an assurance that in my discussions with the Presiding Officers those requirements will have the most serious consideration. I do not believe that there is any need for concern by Senator McLaren. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in answer to Senator Button and others earlier today, in the procedure adopted for the settlement of the Additional Estimates this year a consultation process is to be undertaken so that we will be able to determine as effectively as possible the lowest level of additional expenditure, bearing in mind, as I said this morning, that there has been a reduction in the revenue and that there have been considerable salary increases and other increases in costs that we would like to see absorbed to keep our Budget as much on line as possible. The question does relate to the Parliament and, as I have said, I have an appointment to discuss this matter with Mr President early next week. I can give an assurance that the requirements of the Parliament in every sense will have my personal consideration and the requirements of a properly functioning parliament will have the Government's support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Senator Bonner raised some issues which arose out of a question asked yesterday. As I recall, the question was a serious and quite good-humoured question about a proposal for a seminar. Senator Bonner has been concerned that the question, which was asked by my colleague Senator Lewis, may in some way have reflected upon the Chairman of the National Australia Day Committee, Mr John Newcombe. As I heard the question, nothing in it reflected upon Mr Newcombe or the members of the National Australia Day Committee, who are sincere and dedicated people trying to do an important job. I did not hear anything in the question-I think it is important to answer this point made by Senator Bonner-that in any way suggested that because people are sportsmen they are in some way less able to make certain decisions of the kind that have been undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did hear Senator Lewis address the question of whether a seminar as proposed is the best or most appropriate way of achieving the goal which the National Australia Day Committee has identified as a desirable goal. I would understand Senator Lewis to agree with the goal. We want to increase national consciousness and the national sense of identity. The only issue that came up was to test the particular proposal for achieving this goal. To subject something to critical examination is one of the roles of the Senate. It is a proper role of the Senate . I sat with Senator Bonner when I first came into this place and one of the things he told me about the Senate was that it was our job to test, review and examine matters. I thought the question was entirely proper. It was couched in moderate and careful language. The fact that it used a little humour I thought added to the question rather than detracted from it. </PARA>
<PARA> The aim of the Australia Day Committee is to alter our national consciousness and perception. It was a question about concepts. I am not at all sure that seminars, which are ideally suited to some purposes, are necessarily ideally suited to all purposes. Because that is the case it was proper for Senator Lewis to bring the matter to our attention. If Senator Bonner feels there was anything in the question that reflected upon the Chairman of the Australia Day Committee, I ask him to read the question again carefully. He may find he has read into it intentions which are not present. </PARA>
