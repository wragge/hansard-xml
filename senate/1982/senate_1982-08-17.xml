<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 20 July 1982 of the Honourable Norman John Oswald Makin, A.O., a Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Hindmarsh from 1919 to 1946, Speaker from 1929 to 1931, Member for the Division of Sturt from 1954 to 1955, Member for the Division of Bonython from 1955 to 1963, a Minister of the Crown during the Second World War, Ambassador to the United States of America from 1946 to 1951, and President of the Security Council of the United Nations in 1946 and 1947, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA> Norman Makin was one of nature's gentlemen. He was a man literally for all seasons. Those who knew him knew him to be a man of quality and of particular dignity. He was fortunate to live a long and very full life. He was born on 31 March 1889 and he died on 20 July of this year, so his life spanned nearly a century. He was educated at Broken Hill Central Public School. He was president of the South Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party from 1918 to 1919 and, as I have said, he was elected to the Federal Parliament in 1919 as member for Hindmarsh. He made his maiden speech in March 1920 when he spoke about wartime profiteering and the dangers of sectarianism in politics. </PARA>
<PARA> He had wide-ranging experience. He was temporary chairman of committees and was elected Speaker in the period 1929 to 1931 when the Scullin Government ceased. He was Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions during the war years. He was Minister for Aircraft Production from 1945 to 1946. He was a member of the War Cabinet from 1941 to 1946. He resigned in 1946 to become Australia's first Ambassador to the United States of America where he remained until 1951. He was the first President of the United Nations Security Council and served in that post with the support of all those involved. He returned to national politics in 1954 as member for Sturt and transferred to the seat of Bonython in 1955, which he retained until his retirement in 1963. </PARA>
<PARA> He served his country and the movement which he loved with a great deal of pride. He was active over the years, over the almost century of his life. We are the better for his life. We are the poorer for his going. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion moved by Senator Sir John Carrick. I want to add a few brief comments to the remarks made by Senator Carrick, which I endorse and support. Norman Makin was 93 years of age when he died. He held a highly revered place in the hearts of members of the Australian Labor Party. Probably no one man was more respected in this Parliament and no one better displayed the qualities of courage and doggedness that enabled him to rise above adversity to some of the highest positions which this country has to offer. He emerged from a poor background to become Speaker of the House of Representatives, a Cabinet Minister, the first President of the United Nations Security Council, Ambassador to the United States of America and Chief Australian Delegate to the United Nations. He spent 36 years in this Federal Parliament. It is interesting to recall that he was Speaker 53 years ago , during the term of the Scullin Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He was, as an individual, renowned for his gentility and courtesy. He once confessed publicly that he was never confident in any one of the positions of high authority which he held. That is an expression of humility which is rarely made, either in this chamber or in the House of Representatives. I think that he drew great comfort from his life-long adherence to the Methodist Church, of which he remained a lay preacher until the end of his life. His lack of belligerence and his courteousness to all people were a by-word amongst all those who knew him. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that he was a man whose life spanned a great and significant period of Australian history. He was an observer of and a participant in some of the great events of this century which concerned this country, not only in a national sense but also internationally. It is perhaps important to recall that during his periods as a representative of this country overseas he established very close relationships with people such as President Truman, Dean Acheson, Lester Pearson, Averell Harriman, and Eleanor Roosevelt. It was a great and a long life and a great contribution to this country. I have pleasure in seconding the remarks made by Senator Sir John Carrick. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want briefly to support, on behalf of the National Country Party and personally, the motion that is before the Senate. Norman Makin, at 93 years of age, had seen a very long and distinguished career, both as a politician and indeed as an ambassador. He was quite distinctive in that field, having been the first Australian ambassador appointed to the United States of America. Norman Makin had, as the previous speakers have indicated, a long career in the Parliament. He certainly left his mark in this institution and, indeed, in the annuals of Australian history. Perhaps we will remember him most because he was a quiet and relatively conservative man-I think there is a real message in that. The Honourable Norman Makin served this nation well. I certainly extend the sincere sympathy of my party to his family on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to associate the Australian Democrats with this motion of condolence. When I entered the Parliament in 1960 as a callow youth Mr Norman Makin greeted me, as he did all inexperienced persons, with kindness and a spirit of helpfulness and generosity. He was a gentle man and a gentleman. He had a kindly word for everyone. I have never believed that there was that mythical creature, the classical old-time Labor man. But if there was, Norman Makin was it. All of us, as we go through life, meet many people who profess to be Christians but who sometimes behave in a manner of which one would think Christ would have been ashamed. Norman Makin was one of several people I have met who professed to be Christians and behaved in all aspects in a manner of which I am sure Christ would have been very proud.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to join with the previous speakers in this motion of condolence for the late Norman Makin. Norman Makin, as we in the Australian Labor Party all know and as members of the other parties have said in this place, was one of the real greats not only of the Australian Labor Party but also of Australian politics across a very wide spectrum. He was a Labor man from beginning to end, with great courage and high ideals second to none. During his long political career he held practically every important position in the party that was so dear to him. He enjoyed the complete confidence of Labor Prime Ministers and all Labor leaders. He served his country and in particular the State of South Australia with dignity and ability in many capacities as a member of the House of Representatives and later as Australian Ambassadsor to the United States of America. Norman Makin was one of the very few politicians who retired from active politics to take up the duties of an ambassador and then, on completion of those dities, return to active politics. Such was his intent and desire to help his fellow man that he stood for the marginal seat of Sturt on his return, was successful and went on to represent that seat with great distinction. He maintained an active interest in his party until shortly before his death. The Labor movement in South Australia, in mourning his passing, places on record its highest possible tribute to the late Norman Makin for his services to it and to the nation. He set us all a very great example. We will long remember him. The South Australian members of the Labor Party in this chamber extend our very deepest sympathy to the surving members of his family.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 22 June of the Honourable Sir John McLeay, K.C.M.G., M.M., member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Boothby from 1949 to 1966 and Speaker from 1956 to 1967 and places on record its appreciation for his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Like Norman Makin, Sir John McLeay's life spanned a great period-almost 90 years of crowded public activity of great merit. He died on 22 June. He was born in Port Clinton in South Australia in 1893. He was educated at Port Clinton, Unley Central School and later took a commercial course at Muirden College. In 1915 he enlisted in the 1st AIF and served with distinction as a stretcher bearer with the 13th Field Ambulance. He was awarded the Military Medal at Villiers- Bretonneux. He maintained a life-long interest in exservicemen. He was a past President of the South Australian Legacy Club and a board member of the South Australian Branch of the Returned Services League.</PARA>
<PARA> He was always interested in public life. Before entering Federal Parliament in 1949 as the member for Boothby he served on the Unley City Council from 1925 to 1946 and was Mayor from 1935 to 1937. He was on the Adelaide City Council in 1941 and was Lord Mayor from 1946 to 1950. He was the member of the South Australian House of Assembly for Unley from 1938-41. </PARA>
<PARA> He made his maiden speech on 8 March 1950 and spoke of the problems of local government and of the need to ensure that legislation passed was in the interests of the nation. He served on a wide number of committees-Privileges Committee, Standing Orders Committee, Library Committee, House Committee and the Joint Committee on Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. He was elected Speaker in 1956 following the death of Archie Cameron and he held that post until his retirement in 1967, his 10 1/2 year term being a record. He was almost an institution in the chair and was well respected by honourable members on both sides of the House. He represented Australia at the tenth anniversary of Ceylon' s independence in 1958. He led the delegation to the meeting of the Papua New Guinea Legislative Council in its new chamber in 1960. He attended the 53rd Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Copenhagen in 1964. He visited the United Kingdom in 1965 to attend the Commonwealth Speakers' Conference and celebrations for the 700th anniversary of the Parliament of Simon de Montfort and the 750th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the McLeay family have given much service to the national Parliament. Sir John's brother, George, as we all know served as a distinguished senator and Minister. His son John succeeded him to the seat of Boothby and served as a Minister before his appointment as Consul-General to Los Angeles. This is a life of dedication and of great service. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion which has been moved by Senator Sir John Carrick, who has dealt with the main and very distinguished features of the life of Sir John McLeay. I would add only some reference to the unique position the members of the McLeay family have held in South Australian politics and, indeed, in national politics. One might be doing this, if we may elevate ourselves for a moment, in the House of Lords context because it almost seems to be hereditary amongst the members of the McLeay family in respect of their contribution to national political life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would just like to make some brief comment about Sir John McLeay himself. I speak, of course, from hearsay but I am told that he was regarded by both sides of the Parliament as being a Speaker of the House of Representatives of great tolerance and fairness. He had a jolly sort of personality and he was renowned for his sense of humour and his ability to mix with members on both sides of the House in the easiest possible way. It was said of him on one occasion that he was not only one of those people who are capable of a good after dinner speech but he was also capable of being witty before lunch which, of course, is a rare attribute for politicians and one for which he will no doubt be remembered as he will be for the very distinguished service that he and members of his family have offered to this country. I support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of my party, I too want to support this motion. The contribution that Sir John McLeay has made in his particular field in this country has been evidenced over a very long period. He had distinguished military service, distinguished parliamentary service and, as I understand it, he was a very basic, down to earth Australian. I read one fellow's comments on Sir John McLeay which suggested that he was loyal, down to earth and wise. I suppose one could hardly put together three more important adjectives if one were describing any human being. I extend the sincere sympathy of my party to the relatives and friends of the late Sir John McLeay.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats wish to associate themselves with this motion of condolence and to express sympathy to the loved ones of the late Sir John McLeay. I was privileged to serve in the House of Representatives when he was Speaker, and I do not think he or any of his loved ones would mind if I said that he did not have an intimate knowledge of the Standing Orders. He will never go down in history as being the Speaker who knew Standing Orders better than any other Speaker, but when things became tense in the chamber he seemed to have that unique knack of making a funny remark, of cooling things down, quietening things down. He had that capacity to which Senator Button referred of being able to mix with members of all parties. Therefore, he will go down as one of the good Speakers of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I associate myself with this motion because Sir John McLeay's son, Jack McLeay, has been a personal friend of mine for many years. Together with Senator Chaney' s father and several other distinguished then members of the House of Representatives, he was a member of the famous Mushroom Club. Recently I had the privilege of enjoying John McLeay's hospitality in Los Angeles. I express my personal sympathy to him and to Sir John McLeay's loved ones. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to identify myself and my family with the motion of condolence on the death of Jack McLeay. My association with him goes back many years to the days when my father went to the Unley Central School with him. They lived as neighbours in the Unley district for many years. However , I had no personal knowledge of him until the 1966 Federal election, when I sat on the same platform as his son when I was candidate for Grey. I found myself elected unexpectedly to the House of Representatives and I sat with John McLeay in that House for three very happy years. One of the first people who telephoned me when learning of my victory on that occasion was Sir John McLeay, and I remember his words of wisdom very well. There was never an occasion when I needed his advice that he did not come forward with very sound and wise words from the depths of his great experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from his service to the Parliament to which reference has been made, I think of Sir John McLeay as a man who was interested in the common enjoyment of people in his electorate, in his State, and in Australia. For many years, of course, he was President of the Sturt Football Club, with which I am associated. In fact, he was President of that club for 14 years, patron for 20 years, and a life member for more than 25 years. That says a lot for his interest in young people and their recreational habits. I often called in at John McLeay's home after the football to recapitulate some of the incidents he had seen on television during the afternoon. I want to identify myself and my family with this condolence motion and to extend our sympathy to his sons, daughter, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the condolence motion in respect of the late Sir John McLeay, who at the time of my entry into Parliament in 1962 was the Speaker of the House of Representatives. As the Leader of the Government (Senator Sir John Carrick) has said, Sir John occupied that position for about 10 1/2 years. Indeed, for some of the time he was Speaker I had the honour of being a member of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, over which Sir John McLeay presided at that time. During the time I was a member of that Committee under the chairmanship of Sir John McLeay I came to respect him enormously. As has been said, he was a highly popular Speaker and was well regarded by members on both sides of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, during the time that he was Speaker, he had great professional parliamentarians with whom to contend-men such as Eddie Ward, Les Haylen, Reg Pollard and Fred Daly, all of whom firmly believed in the philosophy of the Labor movement, were men of great intellect and were colourful personalities. Indeed, I think the task that Sir John McLeay had as Speaker in those days was probably much more difficult than is the task of the Speaker today. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Government in the Senate has said, Sir John McLeay won the Military Medal for gallantry during the First World War. I know that, although they were of different political persuasions, because of their joint service in France in the First World War he had a particular affinity with Reg Pollard and Les Haylen. He had a tremendous sense of humour. He was a man of great dignity. He was a great Speaker, a great Australian, and a great parliamentarian. Those who knew him well will mourn his passing. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 14 July 1982 of the Rt Hon. Sir Philip McBride, P.C., K.C.M.G., a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Grey from 1931-37, a Senator for South Australia from 1937-44, a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Wakefield from 1946-58 and a Minister of the Crown for 11 years; places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service; and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, today we are paying tribute to very distinguished Australians indeed-to Australians who lived, as I have said, full, long lives. Sir Philip McBride, whom, like the others, I was privileged to know, lived 90 years-and they were full years. Born in 1892, he was educated at Burra Public School and later at Prince Alfred College in Adelaide. He entered the House of Representatives at the 1931 general election as member for Grey. He was re- elected in 1934 and in October 1937 resigned his seat to seek election to the Senate to fill a casual vacancy. He successfully sought re-election in 1938 and was defeated in 1943. His ministerial career began in the first Menzies ministry . He was Assistant Minister for Commerce from April 1939 to October 1941. He was Minister for Supply and Development and Minister for Munitions from 1940 to 1941 . He was a member of the War Cabinet and the last surviving member of the first Menzies ministry. He was very highly regarded by the late Sir Robert Menzies. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1946 he was re-elected to the House of Representatives as member for Wakefield. He retained that seat until his retirement from politics in 1958. He resumed his ministerial career in 1949 as Minister for the Interior following the return of the Menzies Government. Sir Philip was a leading figure in the establishment of the Liberal Party and was Federal President from 1960 to 1965. He was created a KCMG in 1953 and a Privy Councillor in 1959. He had a lifelong interest in pastoral circles. He was, for a time, President of the Stockowners Association of South Australia and represented that State on the Australian Wool Growers Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I think of Sir Philip McBride as a man of gentle dignity and great courtesy, a man who had immense interest in his fellow men, a man devoted and dedicated throughout his life to public service, a man who would serve quietly and with great dedication wherever he was appointed. It is with sadness that I move the motion of condolence. </PARA>

Sir Philip McBride and the McBride family are well known pastoralists in South Australia and are very highly regarded by the South Australian community. It is worth recording that no other South Australian representative in Parliament has held as many portfolios as Sir Philip McBride. As mentioned by, I think, Senator Sir John Carrick, Sir Philip's positions ranged from Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, through eight portfolios until finally he was Minister for Defence for eight years. I simply record my regrets at his passing and wish to pass on my condolences to his family-in particular to his wife, Rita, his sons, his sister, Mrs Pat Taylor, and his brother, Jim McBride.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 17 May 1982 of Charles Edward Griffiths, a member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Shortland from 1949 to 1972 and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Charlie Griffiths-as he would want to be known and as everybody in the Newcastle area knew him-lived some 79 years. He was very much a part of the community in which he lived and served. He was typical of the type of Australian who faced the difficulties of the coal fields area. The people he served came to know him and to respect him. On leaving school he joined the New South Wales Railways. He became actively involved in union matters. He became a State councillor of the Australian Railways Union and served as State Secretary from 1940 to 1952-a very significant role indeed in a very great Australian union. He was first elected to the House of Representatives at the general election in 1949 and so by an odd set of circumstances, leaving in 1972, he was always in Opposition. He always sat on the Opposition benches. He served on the Printing Committee and the Public Works Committee. He was a member of the Australian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 1964, member of a fact finding mission to South East Asia in 1966 and member of a fact finding mission to Hong Kong, Japan , Korea and Taiwan in 1969. I think Charlie Griffiths would want to be known for his service to the trade union movement. He served it well. He was a distinguished trade union official. He would want to be known for his representation of the Shortland area and his association with very vigorous and typical Australian people. They will remember him for the life that he led and the work that he did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion moved by the Leader of the Government. Senator Sir John Carrick has indicated the major points of Charlie Griffiths's public career. I want only to add something to that and say that, quite apart from the respect he enjoyed here and in public life, he was very widely respected in the Newcastle area because, apart from being a parliamentarian, he was a great battler, if I can put it in those terms, for many important social causes in the Newcastle district. It is said of him that thousands of his constituents would not have received the assistance and benefits which they got from Government programs and so on without the work which he put into pressing their causes with both the bureaucracy and Ministers in government. He was a family man who did not in a political sense seek the limelight. He was a respected member of the Uniting Church in Australia and was very much a contributor to his local community. Senator Carrick mentioned that he came into Parliament in 1949 and went out in 1972; that is, he came in with the Menzies Government and went out at the same time as Billy McMahon's Government. That he never sat on the government side is said to have been one of the great regrets of his life. Even in the Australian Labor party, if we are here for a few years, we have a reasonable chance of serving in government. He spanned that very long period in Opposition and did not have that opportunity. It was a source of great regret to him. In expressing to his family our regrets at his passing, we are also in a sense saying something for the people of Newcastle and the people of the trade union movement in New South Wales, who greatly respected his life and career.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to support the motion that expresses condolence to the family of the late Charlie Griffiths. Indeed, as has already been said, Charlie Griffiths served in this Parliament for a very long time-23 years-and I do not doubt that he served it extremely well. When I was looking at some material on Charlie Griffiths I noted that he was educated at the Bribbaree Central School. That is about 40 to 50 miles from my home. The conclusion I came to was that anyone who had the good fortune to be educated in those pleasant fields and among those gum trees would have a lot of common sense. I am sure that Charlie Griffiths, in his long service in this Parliament, exhibited just that on behalf of the people he served. He had a conviction which I am sure was evident in the things he said and did. I certainly join in extending my sincere sympathy to the family of Charlie Griffiths.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Australian Democrats)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Australian Democrats with the motion of condolence and add my personal message of sympathy to the loved ones of Charlie Griffiths. I was privileged to know Charlie very well and for many years. He was a tenacious battler, as Senator Button has mentioned. I found that out to my cost when I was Minister for Customs and Excise and Charlie was pursuing a complaint by one of his constituents about a relatively small matter. I think that number of visits to my office that Charlie made personally, until he got justice for his constituent , was about 14 or 15. He was a remarkable battler for causes in which he believed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall never forget how, only a couple of years ago, he came into my office, still as the tenacious battler. Someone who had been an officer in the Army and who Charlie knew only slightly had been killed in a crash at an intersection. It seemed as though the officer had a heart attack going through a red traffic light, crashed and died. Although Charlie knew the fellow only very slightly, and although he knew that he belonged to a different political party, he believed that this person's death was due to war service and should have attracted the repatriation pension. I think that Charlie personally saw about 15 or 16 members of parliament about the matter. He journeyed to Melbourne at his own expense, at the suggestion of his good friend and my good friend Hec McIvor, and spent two and a half hours of his time on the matter, bringing three or four suitcases of files with him. He confided to me in passing that he had already spent $3,000 of his own money in pursuing this one case to get justice for the dead person's family and that he was prepared to spend his life savings to get justice. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the kind of man Charlie Griffiths was. I am pleased to be able to put that little anecdote in the Hansard record so that when, as I understand is the custom, a record of these speeches is sent to his relatives, at least that anecdote can be read and treasured by his loved ones. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse all the sentiments expressed by honourable senators. Charlie belonged to the same union as I. I know that Charlie took up particular social security cases of retired union members in the Lake Macquarie area of New South Wales. He had a lengthy trade union career before he entered the national Parliament. Senator Carrick referred to Charlie's union activities. They were typical of him. He probably could have come into Parliament earlier, but at the start of World War II the Australian Railways Union had some turbulent leadership problems, and Charlie played a notable role in cooling people off and getting the union on an even keel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point, as Senator Chipp mentioned, was that Charlie had a remarkable memory in relation to social security decisions. He worked for the New South Wales railways where one got that no man's land in regard to eligibility when people are in receipt of certain railway superannuation payments. Tenacious advocate as he was, he would persist with matters. I think that Senator Grimes would agree with me when I say that, looking back on Charlie's career and considering the research facilities available today in regard to social security matters, Charlie Griffiths and his contemporary Allan Fraser would spend an immense amount of time going into the field to collate facts. Once they established the precedent many other people also got the benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Newcastle and the Australian Railways Union should be proud of Charlie Griffiths. I am sure that they are. He gave his all right up to the last . There were no half measures. He was a fierce advocate in caucus, but if he lost on an issue there was no malice; he had done his best. That was the way he liked to be regarded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in supporting the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick. No one worked harder for his constituents than did Charlie Griffiths and his wife, Jess. There was no one in his electorate whom he did not know, and no one could have represented the people of his electorate better than Charlie Griffiths. Everyone, particularly people in the Labor movement, knew of his dedication to assisting the under-privileged section of the community. Indeed, only last Sunday, when I was returning from a meeting of my party in a country area north of Newcastle, I met people who had been constituents of Charlie Griffiths. They spoke of him in very warm and glowing terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chipp mentioned the name Hec McIvor. Charlie would have liked me to mention that he was a very close associate of the then member for Gellibrand, Mr Hec McIvor. I think that they served in the Parliament for about the same length of time, and they and their wives, Lorna and Jess, were inseparable companions. Both were very great members of the Labor movement. Charlie Griffiths served not only his constituents and his union with distinction but also the Australian Labor Party. As Senator Mulvihill would know, for some years he was a member of the Executive of the New South Wales branch of our party. He gave the people of his electorate outstanding representation, and his memory certainly will live on in that electorate for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable senators standing in their places. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly take this opportunity to refer particularly to my three former colleagues and friends from South Australia. I refer to the late Norman Makin, who served in the Federal Parliament for many years, including periods as a senior member of the Ministry and also as the Speaker of the House of Representatives. After retirement Norman Makin was appointed Australian Ambassador to the United States of America and later Australia's chief delegate to the United Nations. He was also the first President of the Security Council. All this was quite an achievement for one man in his span of lifetime. Norman Makin was, as I describe him, a very gentle man within himself. He was an outstanding Australian who gave great service to the Parliament, gaining the respect of all with whom he worked, both inside and outside the Parliament. I join in extending to his family my sincere condolences on his passing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir John McLeay was a very close personal friend of mine and had a long and distinguished career. As has been stated, he served in World War I and was awarded the Military Medal. Later, in public life he served as Lord Mayor of Adelaide and then as a member of the South Australian Parliament. Finally, he served for many years in this Federal Parliament, where he was the Speaker of the House of Representatives. He served in that capacity for a great number of years until his retirement, and still has the record for the term in that office . During this period Sir John won the respect and esteem of a wide range of people. As I said earlier, he was a very close friend of mine. We enjoyed many friendly chats, which always included the activities of the Federal Parliament- incidentally, may I add that that included the activities of both chambers-in which he took a very keen interest. He was a most avid listener to the parliamentary broadcasts. To the McLeay family, to his sons John and Peter and their families, and to his daughter Barbara, I join in extending my sincere condolences.</PARA>
<PARA> Sir Philip McBride was closely associated with Sir Robert Menzies. He served in his party, both in government and in opposition, over a period of some 30 years. He was a member of the Senate as well as a member of the House of Representatives. He was the only South Australian this century to be created a privy councillor and was one of only three persons to have held that honour. He also served for a number of years as a senior Cabinet Minister. For many years- in fact, some 50-odd years-he was the chairman of the well known family pastoral firm, A. J. and P. A. McBride Pty Ltd, a name which is held in high esteem in Australia, particularly in the pastoral and the wool industries.</PARA>
<PARA> Sir Philip always had time for a friendly chat. He encouraged many people, and I add on a personal note here that he gave me great encouragement in my youth to take an active role and participate in Parliament. He made a great contribution as a true Australian and I again join in extending to his family my sincere condolences. I also join in the condolences to the family of the late Charlie Griffiths.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef is unique and is included on the World Heritage List.</PARA>

<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> A. 1. The real value of Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards (CPA's) in 1982 is below the Henderson Poverty Line for single postgraduates and far below it for postgraduates with dependants.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The number of new CPA's in 1981 was the same as the number in 1971, leading to a considerable reduction in the proportion of the population undertaking higher degree research.</PARA>
<PARA> B. 1. The Government's proposed student loans scheme is not a viable alternative to improvements in the CPA scheme. The loans scheme will charge commercial interest rates and will discourage university research with indebtedness. It will further restrict the entrance of low income earners, women and mature-aged students into research.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The loans scheme and low value and number of CPA's will seriously decrease Australia's research capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> C. 1. The Government will increase the level of CPA's by at least $1,500 per annum and withdraw taxation of the awards.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the rule of court which is the subject of the notice of disallowance is to fix a rate of interest on judgment debts. The rule of court stipulates that every debt entered into before 21 April 1980 shall carry interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, while all subsequent debts shall carry interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum. Prior to 21 April 1980, the rate of interest on judgment debts was prescribed under the High Court Procedure Act 1903, which specified a rate of 5 per cent. That Act was repealed on 21 April 1980 by legislation which empowered the High Court to make rules specifying the rate of interest on judgment debts. On 17 March 1982, the High Court made a rule which doubled the rate of interest retrospectively from 21 April 1980.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 5 May 1982, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances wrote to the Chief Justice of the High Court, indicating its concern at the retrospectivity of the rule and seeking advice on two matters: Firstly whether there were any special circumstances which led to the delay in making the rule; and secondly, on what basis the rates of interest under the rule had been determined. The Chief Justice indicated that 'no question arose in practice with regard to interest until the matter was brought to notice by an inquiry in one case in which the successful party intended to include interest on his taxed costs', and that 'those responsible for the administration of the High Court Procedure Act and the Judiciary Act did not invite the attention of the Registrar of the Court to the fact that the repeal of the former of those Acts and the enactment of Section 77N of the Judiciary Act necessitated the making of a new rule of court'. He also advised that 'steps were thereafter taken to amend the Rule'. The Chief Justice indicated that the new rate chosen by the High Court was fixed after regard was had to the rates of interest allowed on judgment debts in the various superior courts of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has had further correspondence with the Chief Justice in relation to the matter, and wishes to consider the most recent response from the Chief Justice in more detail before reporting to the Senate. As today is the last day on which notice of disallowance may be given, I have given the notice to permit the Committee to complete its examination of the rule.</PARA>

If everybody wished to get more tax equity, the Opposition would co-operate with the Government in seeking to bring about restraint in the upward pressure of prices which in themselves have the basis of a wage upsurge throughout Australia which last year was 17 1/2 per cent . Mr President, the fact is that if we have wage upsurges of that kind we will have inflation and that will mean of course there will be higher taxes and there will be less equity in the tax distribution. If all honourable senators wish to have tax equity in this country they will no doubt join this Government in its very significant campaign at this moment to bring about wage restraint and therefore tax equity.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the light of these developments, will the Attorney-General now exercise his good offices to persuade the New South Wales Government, firstly, to produce for inspection and tests by Mr William Sinclair and his legal and forensic advisers the alleged 'original' document; and, secondly, thereafter produce such document to the Thai court where a photostat rather than the original was presented, despite assurances to the contrary by the same police officers, so that the rights to justice by this Australian citizen in a foreign court can be properly preserved?</PARA></TALK.START>

My view was that most of the matters-I think all except one-were really not within my jurisdiction or indeed that of the Australian Government. One of those matters certainly comes within the responsibility of the New South Wales Government, and I pointed that out to Senator Missen. I am pleased to note that, as one would expect, he has taken up that matter assiduously.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. I might invite Senator Gietzelt to co-operate with the Australian public-people in overseas countries have done this-to overcome inflation. What has happened is that overseas countries, because of a lack of foreign exchange and because of recession, are buying less and paying less for primary products and, particularly, for minerals. Australia, therefore, is moving towards recession. I remind Senator Gietzelt and his colleagues that those countries which had higher inflation rates than Australia have all adopted wage restraint, to a point where wage restraint has been taken as a significant weapon in getting down inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has happened is that overseas as wages fell so inflation fell, whereas in Australia wages rose. What we are saying now to the Australian people is that if they wanted to be able to restore their place in the world trade then they should adopt the general tactics adopted by overseas countries, and I include governments which are not of Liberal faith, and co-operate generally throughout the nation to get costs down. This can be done primarily by exercising wage restraint and, secondly, by reducing the incidence of industrial action in Australia, which forces up costs, causes great harm to the reputation of Australia and results in the loss of trade.</PARA>

Is the Minister concerned that 'full-scope' International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards do not apply to trading in nuclear technology between West Germany, which has been notorious for selling nuclear secrets to Argentina, and Argentina?

If Senator Chipp examines carefully-as he will-the details of that letter he will find, in fact, specific answers to what he is asking. First, not only has there been an expression of concern by Australia but also actions have been taken by it in regard to that concern.

The Australian Safeguards Office has the absolute responsibility of monitoring the progress of every kilogram of yellowcake that leaves Australia, including its change into various forms as it is procecessed- whether it is upgraded, enriched, made into fuel rods or reprocessed, indeed wherever it goes. Therefore, we are able to indicate that it will not be used for the benefit of others who are not signatories to the NPT. That is the role of the Safeguards Office. It is one that as Senator Chipp will understand, we are endeavouring to strengthen. Indeed, only recently in Vienna I had fairly lengthy talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency on exactly these matters, on how we could tighten to the nth degree what we are doing. So in keeping with its policy, the Government is paying close attention to Argentina's nuclear program and to safeguards arrangements which apply to nuclear items supplied to that country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Australia made suggestions for strenghtening the safeguards arrangements for these facilities in discussions of the Board of Governors of the IAEA in Vienna last year and in consultations with other governments. We made the various suggestions that I have set out. Australia called attention to the fact that in the case of a country such as Argentina, which has not accepted the legal obligation to apply full scope safeguards, the resulting safeguards coverage by a number of separate agreements resulted in fragmentation. So we are active not only in expressing concern but also in our role in the governing body of the IAEA in trying to get an upgrading of the safeguards. The Government would welcome a legally binding agreement by Argentina to place all of its nuclear facilities now and in the future under IAEA safeguards, and the Government will continue to direct its efforts towards this objective. I will underline to our representative on the governing board, Professor George, that it is imperative that we try to achieve these goals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent weeks the Government-I in particular-has been very active in regard to water resources in Australia. Some honourable senators will know that I spent the last three days of last week on a very detailed inspection of the River Murray, from mouth to source, in which course of time some honourable senators joined me. We received something like 30 deputations, both written and verbal. I am happy to say that the River Murray Agreement has no obstacles in its way. The Victorian Government has announced its willingness to sign and the signing is proceeding, from the Commonwealth to the six States. I believe that the signing should have taken place within the next week or two. The legislation is drafted and it should be possible for it to be in this Parliament and in the State parliaments in the immediate future. So it is good news on the River Murray. Work is being done particularly on strengthening quality control for the River Murray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked about the CSIRO. He will know that the Government asked the CSIRO to look at all the various water resource activities throughout its very big organisation and to determine whether it could get co-ordination, in terms of both ground water control and water quality. My understanding is that that, at least in concept, has been finalised and decisions have been made that that can be done. I should add that it has gone further than that: We have determined that there should be a complete link between the CSIRO and its facilities, the Bureau of Mineral Resources in its water activities, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Atomic Energy Commission. We are pulling the whole of the act together. Some time ago the ministerial council, the Australian Water Resources Council, made a series of recommendations, one of which was that there should be a national water research council of a kind similar to the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council. I announced this last week and I announced that we will be setting up its actual membership in the very near future.</PARA>

Indeed, since she queries this , tomorrow I will bring with me a copy of the actual phrases. I have no doubt at all that what the Governor-General said in 1980 was what Mr Hayden knew in 1975 but did not practise. Indeed, everybody knows that if there is an undue expansion by deficit financing, by simply inflating a currency and bringing pressure upon interest rates in a community, it creates an upsurge of inflation and creates unemployment.

If so, will the Minister consider appointing a representative from large industries, which of course will become increasingly reliant on adequate supplies of good water in the future? Will it be within the competence of the council to deal with the diversion for inland use of the more than 50 per cent of Australia's rainfall that currently flows wastefully into the sea?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Water Resources Council will be one of the significant instrumentalities in supervising the long term conservation and use, both in quantity and quality, of our most limited resource-water. I announced that its goals would include advice on goals for water research, a continuing overview of water research to develop an overall balanced national water research effort, recommendations on national water research needs, priorities, funding levels and appropriate programs and projects, and advice on an effective program of technology transfer to water authorities and users. With regard to Senator Jessop's second last question-I think this relates to his whole question-the council would have a wide-ranging interest in looking at the whole of the uses of Australian water, and particularly the fact that we are sending into the sea about half of the precious water that we have.</PARA></TALK.START>

With regard to the honourable senator's comment on the discharge of river waters into the ocean, it would not be appropriate for me to foreshadow the extent to which this occurrence will influence the deliberation of the council, but of course it will be very significant indeed.

At least the present Government attempted to introduce tax indexation. Of course, it is true that if one has inflation and does not make adjustments, one is harvesting inflation and getting in higher taxes. That is beyond doubt. It is true that if, indeed, a government is to be compelled to keep its costs down and to keep government small, perhaps the most effective way is through tax indexation and that, I have no doubt, is what Mr Fraser had in mind.

This of course is government policy in order to maintain some kind of parity with the mainland.

As a result, the agency is pocketing large sums of money since the true Taxation Office refunds are usually a great deal more than the original sum paid to the unsuspecting clients by the agency. Further, I ask the Minister: What are the powers of the Tax Agents Registration Board in dealing with such an agency? I ask this because I have good reason to believe that the Board has known about this agency's operation for some time but has not done anything about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister did say those words in 1977 and they are abundantly true. When the Government came to office in 1975 the inflation rate was running at 17 1/2 per cent according to the Australian Statistician. We managed to reduce it to 9 per cent. It is now something over 10 per cent. So we did, in fact, very substantially reduce the rate of inflation. We were able to so modify taxation that, instead of having six or seven stages of the tax scale, we brought it down to three, and the great majority-something more than three quarters-of all taxpayers were in the 32c in the dollar bracket and not in the higher bracket. So quite major reforms were undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the sad situations is that as the world recession has forced other countries to lower their rates of inflation, in Australia wage spirals and industrial actions have forced costs up. In the immediate past the inflation rate moved upwards. The pressure of overseas interest rates plus our difficulties have given us very high interest rates indeed; one admits that. One of the important things to keep in mind is that this Government has shown that it is willing to go out and attempt to do those things, however unpleasant, that are necessary in order to bear down on inflation, to bear down on costs as such and to seek to overcome industrial unrest, whereas that was not done in the past .</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall make a brief statement relating to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare concerning homeless youth. In considering this report I believe the main issue at stake is whether we, as a community-that includes both the Commonwealth and State governments-are prepared to spend time and resources now to try to redress this problem. Failure to do so will simply allow a growing number of unfortunate young people to drift into a Skid Row type of existence. There is already ample evidence to show that the average age of our Skid Row population has fallen dramatically over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that our Committee cannot stress strongly enough is that programs for homeless youth should not be developed in conjunction with the traditional homeless persons program. It is not appropriate for homeless youth to be housed with the older hard-core homeless. It would be an admission of failure if we did not develop specific programs for homeless youth. If we can help these young people become productive members of our society, the time and cost in the short term will surely be outweighed by both the social and economic benefits gained in the long term. A recent United States Senate report stated that homeless youths' needs are hardly extravagant and certainly fall within the inalienable rights of all people. I believe this to be so for homeless youth in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's recommendations are, I believe, both sound and practical and cannot be categorised as extravagant. Therefore the implementation of our recommendations, even under the current economic conditions, will go a long way to help redress the plight of homeless youth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Civil Aviation ( Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill is to amend Part IV of the principal Act, the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, to raise the limitation on damages for personal injury suffered in a commercial air accident from $45,000 to $100,000, operative from the dates to be proclaimed. I think a significant feature of the debate on this legislation in the dying hours of the House of Representatives in May this year-it seems that this feature will recur in the Senate-was the lack of Government interest in the legislation. One wonders why there is no concern on the back benches of the Government parties about a proposition that falls far short of what should be the liability requirements with respect to air accidents in the Commonwealth of Australia. It may well be that honourable senators opposite take the view that increasing the limitation on damages from $45,000 to $100,000 is adequate. However, based on the criterion of previous determinations that have been made by Liberal and conservative governments the Opposition has put up a case for a cover of at least $130,000. Of course, we have raised-I intend to do so again when moving a second reading amendment to the Bill-the whole question of third party insurance for passengers who travel by both private and public aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it must be generally recognised that since the House of Representatives dealt with this legislation there has been a very significant downturn in air traffic movement throughout the world as well as in our own country. In fact, the evidence shows that the airline industry generally is in a state of decline and near bankruptcy in many countries and that the crisis which has overtaken the airline industry overseas has had some impact upon our international airline , Qantas Airways Ltd, as well as an influence on the financial capability of the two airlines-one government and one private-which operate in Australia. Of course, in recent times we have seen a very decided downturn in transport service in this country in particular. I do not think it is good enough to increase the quality of the food or the amount of alcohol offered to passengers if in fact there is a deterioration in the transport service itself. This deterioration is particularly marked in aircraft operations in and out of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a dramatic change in the whole airline industry since this matter was debated in May. Consequently one would think that if Government members in particular were interested in the airline industry and the rights of passengers, the consumers, they would have been prepared to participate in the debate. However, they did not do so in the House of Representatives. Debate was left to the Opposition with the exception of a brief interlude by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron), who supported a proposition relating to compensation following an aircraft accident near a Brisbane airfield. One can only say that there is a lack of concern by the Government about this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred to liability provisions in respect of airline passengers. The legislation also provides for the limit on liability for damage to registered baggage to be raised from the existing $300 to $900 and for the limit on hand baggage to be raised from $30 to $90. Clause 3 of the Bill widens the definition of airline licence and charter licence to ensure that carriage by operators following the introduction of the new air service licence classifications later in 1982 will be covered by the provisions of the principal Act. In the view of the Australian Labor Party the increased limits of compensation provided for in the Bill are inadequate, although, of course, increases are long overdue. Because they are long overdue the Opposition does not intend to oppose the Bill. However it wishes to express some concern. Therefore I propose to move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that provision should be made for the introduction of third party personal injury insurance in respect of all aircraft operated in Australia and which are not covered by this Bill and the principal Act'. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it has to be said that compensation is rarely paid with respect to aircraft accidents in Australia. Everybody in Australia and in the Parliament accepts the very high standard of safety control that has been determined by the Department of Aviation. We are aware of the fact that we have a very high standard, if not the highest standard in the world. If we accept that as being part of conventional wisdom-I think we can-one wonders why we haggle over compensation. If that standard is maintained, particularly with respect to the major airline operators, it is clear that the compensation liability ought to be subject to rises commensurate with rises in the standard of living based on average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate-this might have escaped the attention of honourable senators-that in the last few months we have not had so many small aircraft accidents resulting in injury and fatalities as occurred early this year. However there have been one or two in the last few months. Although small private aircraft and charter aircraft are becoming a popular means of transport in our country passengers do not necessarily understand that they could be inadequately covered in the case of accident or death. The Opposition has been put in the position of being the watch dog for the general public. There is enough evidence to show that this legislation is inadequate. Although we recognise that inadequacies and shortcomings exist we are not prepared to cut off our nose to spite our face. We are prepared to recognise that, notwithstanding all the limitations I have referred to, there is a case for supporting the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have moved a second reading amendment calling for the introduction of a third party personal injury insurance for passengers on all aircraft operated in Australia. We believe that it would be untenable for the Government not to take this proposal on board. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) acknowledged in the House of Representatives that the shadow Minister for Transport, Mr Morris, made some significant suggestions in the debate. Nevertheless, the Government was not prepared to accept the Opposition's amendment or to give any definite assurances in relation to the criticisms which our party made in the House of Representatives and which we make in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that compensation payment of $100,000 in respect of a death is totally inadequate. We know, for example, that in Sydney the cost of a very modest three bedroom house is more that 80 per cent of the proposed amount of compensation payable to the surviving members of the family if they were to lose the breadwinner. The average price of a home in New South Wales is such that this level of compensation is quite inadequate in terms of the current inflationary cost of accommodation which has largely been brought about by the economic policies which have been pursued by this Government. This Government never shows a preparedness to take on board any justifiable points which are raised in debate even though a Minister, as the Minister for Transport did on this occasion, may accept that some significant suggestions had been made. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation affects the rights of consumers. As we recognise, a very large section of the Australian community uses aeroplanes as a means of transport. Whilst we accept that there is a high level of safety control in the movement of air traffic, particularly in the major airlines sector, we cannot understand why the Government is reluctant to relate the amount of compensation liability to average weekly earnings which was the basis upon which the legislation was originally introduced in 1959. The Senate should know the basis upon which liability in this area is assessed and I think the public also should know. I am sure that we are on good ground when we assert that the average person using charter flights in this country is not aware of whether he is adequately insured in respect of injury or death as a result of an aviation accident even having regard to the standard of safety which exists in this country. We are very fortunate compared with other countries in that we do not have the extreme weather conditions experienced in European countries and the United States of America. We have a much more temperate climate. We are in a position to expect that high standard and a low incidence of fatalities arising from aircraft accidents. I remind the Senate of the incident involving an airline aircraft that was returning to Australia recently. It encountered volcanic ash over Indonesia. That was quite an incident. A disaster involving the whole of the aircraft could have occurred. I suppose it was good luck and also good management that the pilot was able finally to get his plane to Australia thus preventing what could have been a disaster like that which is fairly commonplace in many other parts of the world where a plane goes down and all of the passengers lose their lives. One never knows when a passenger may be placed in a position in which the question of the level of compensation is a very important factor for the passenger who is injured or for the members of the family of persons who may lose their lives as a result of an aviation accident. </PARA>
<PARA> The essence of the principal Act is that the question of negligence by an air operator in the event of an accident is not contested by the operators, except where the claimant party is shown to have contributed to the cause of the accident. What strikes me as somewhat interesting here is the basis for this legislation. It has the support of the airline operators generally. Of course, they have a vested interest in this matter. I suppose it is part of the cost structure. But we have an overriding responsibility to the general public. If the Parliament does not accept its responsibility to look after the interests of the general public, I am sure nobody else will fulfil that obligation. I think it is our duty within the area of public interest to make sure that the public interest is protected in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> In return, a limit is applied to the amount of damages that can be awarded to a claimant or claimants by the court. In effect, this constitutes a trade off, an admission of liability, in return for a limit on the operator's liability. It thus constitutes a form of no-fault insurance, with resultant savings in litigation costs for both parties. It seems to us that in such a system it is essential for the Parliament to ensure that the limit of compensation be adequate and subjected to regular review in light of changes in money values and personal earning capacities as measured by movements in average weekly earnings. The Government of course has rejected that view which was very strongly put by Mr Morris. The Minister expressed a view relating to variations in international agreements. I think the Warsaw convention tries to achieve some rationality in respect of accident liability. It is desirable to have rationality and uniformity but we should bear in mind the differences in living standards in the various countries. We say that compensation of $100,000 in Australia is not adequate. However, in Thailand, for example, that amount of compensation would represent a fortune. It is difficult to look at this matter in terms of uniformity. Consequently, we must fight the issue on the basis of the local environment to ensure that there is an adequate level of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> When the original legislation was established 23 years ago back in 1959 there was a compensation limit of $15,000. Of course $15,000 in those days represented a lot more in money values than $100,000 represents in today's conditions. It took 11 years before the Minister for Civil Aviation, then Senator Cotton, agreed to double the level of compensation to $30,000 in 1970. In the second reading debate in the Senate he used the increase in average weekly earnings as the basis for increasing the compensation to $30,000. It took another six years to increase the limit by 50 per cent to $45,000. Of course, we all know what the rate of inflation has been in the last six years. It is considerably more than the increase proposed in this legislation. If the rate of inflation or the rate of average weekly earnings is in any way to be the yardstick in this matter, the Opposition is strongly of the view that nothing short of a payment of $130,000 should be laid down in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither the Minister for Transport in the other place nor the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) who introduced these Bills into this place in the dying stages of the autumn session gave any reason for plucking out of the air, as it were, a figure not related to anything other than just some general determination by the Department or by the responsible Minister. The only explanation given was that it had the agreement of the major air service operators and the Opposition expresses its dissatisfaction with the legislation to that degree. The Opposition recognises, of course, that it is an improvement to increase the amount from $45,000 to $100,000. We will not press the point by opposing the legislation because that would certainly disadvantage a number of claimants. A number of small-operator accidents have occurred in the last year, and we would not want to place in jeopardy any of those claims or claims that might be made after the passage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is true to say that this Government has had a somewhat negligent, ' don't care', even callous attitude. This was graphically illustrated in the events surrounding the tragic Advance Airlines crash of 21 February 1980. As the Press has reported, there have been tragically long delays and difficulties for the families involved. The level of compensation capable of being paid with respect to that case was nowhere adequate to cover the loss of earnings of those who were killed or injured in the accident. Due to the refusal of the Government to adjust the levels of compensation the families affected have suffered very serious disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not generally realised that passengers travelling by air in other than airline or chartered aircraft covered by this legislation do not have automatic protection in the event of an accident. I know that many honourable senators take advantage of charter arrangements. Whilst it may be argued that that they are covered, people leaving the tarmac at the same time in other aircraft- ordinary members of the public-are not necessarily covered to the same extent as are honourable senators. For example, statistics show that in the years 1976 to 1980 people flying for private and business reasons were involved in 52 per cent of the 1,209 general aviation accidents that occurred. The statistics indicate that there is a lack of cover and that there are management problems in respect of small aircraft because private and business flying hours comprised only 33 per cent of the total hours flown by general aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> The absence of automatic third party personal injury insurance coverage can cause financial ruin for pilots and passengers who are unfortunate enough to be involved in an aircraft crash. Many times I have read of people who join such flights at the last minute for reasons that have not been planned, and often those people find that they are not covered by adequate compensation. In fact, in some cases they are not covered at all. It is for these reasons that the Australian Labor Party believes that a system of compulsory third party personal insurance with limited liability attached to the aircraft should be introduced without delay. That is the purpose, of course, of the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Amendment Bill 1982. This Bill, in line with the provisions of the Civil Aviation ( Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill 1982 which I have just discussed, raises the limit of compensation for personal injury from $45,000 to $100,000. The principal Act applies to Commonwealth employees, to people travelling on Commonwealth business, and to certain situations where the Commonwealth may be operating an aircraft and non-Commonwealth personnel are injured, such as in cases where the Commonwealth has chartered a plane for Commonwealth purposes but the plane also is carrying people who are not engaged on Government business. </PARA>
<PARA> These pieces of legislation are very much related and I would have expected the Australian Democrats to have agreed to participate in the debate. I would have expected that the Government would have supplied a speaker to make a general contribution to the debate. The legislation is not being rushed through the Senate, nor was that the environment in which the Bills were debated in the House of Representatives. The same carefree attitude and lack of concern is being exhibited in the Senate. The Australian Labor Party Whip in the Senate has given me a list of speakers in this debate. I note that I am the only speaker on these Bills, apart from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner). One would have thought that a little more interest would have been shown by some of the 64 members of the Senate, the majority of whom sit opposite. That confirms the view expressed by the shadow Minister in the House of Representatives that the Government does not seem to be very interested in the whole question of liability, insurance and compensation so far as accidents are concerned. I now propose to move the amendment which I foreshadowed earlier. I move:</PARA>
<PARA>At end of motion add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that provision should be made for the introduction of third party personal injury insurance in respect of all aircraft operated in Australia and which are not covered by this Bill and the Principal Act.'</PARA>
<PARA>I think there is enough evidence to show that there are passengers, pilots and crew members who are not covered under the general terms of either piece of legislation being debated by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Opposition for its support of the legislation. I understand the points made by the Opposition in several respects. I suppose the first point that needs to be made following Senator Gietzelt's argument that the limit should be raised at least to $130,000 is that there is some degree or arbitrariness about his move for a figure such as that. The Government, of course, has arrived at the amount of $100,000, which it regards as a reasonable figure in the circumstances. Senator Gietzelt obviously has researched the matter quite thoroughly, and he does understand the effects of the Warsaw Convention of 1959. If one uses the average weekly earnings inflator, the figure of $15,000 that applied then would be $110,000 today. On the other hand, if we were to apply the consumer price index-Senator Gietzelt referred to this in his remarks-from the date of the commencement of the Warsaw Convention, the sum would be $60,000. On that basis it is somewhat a matter of judgment to decide upon any figure. I think that substantiates the point I seek to make that $100,000 is a reasonable sum in the circumstances. Neither of those tests appears to support Senator Gietzelt's claim that the figure should in fact be $130,000. Nevertheless, I believe that the essential point made by Senator Gietzelt is that adjustments to the limit should be made on a regular basis. I think it is quite clear that the Government is concerned about that point. The legislation provides that that sum can be adjusted by virtue of regulation in future rather than by going through the process of specific legislation, which of course is a lengthy and time-consuming process. By that means the Government hopes that in future any adjustment can be made rapidly after constant review by the departments concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt dealt with the third party personal insurance question at some length. I think it is true to say that the Government also is very concerned about the possibility of extending the legislation to embrace private and aerial work operators and with the broader question of compulsory insurance for domestic carriers' liability for passengers. All of those matters are presently under consideration by joint Commonwealth-State government bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of a broad third party compulsory insurance scheme to cover such occurrences as damage to people or property on the ground is, as was well and truly emphasised by Senator Gietzelt, one of very great concern. However, one has to acknowledge that it is a very complex issue. As the honourable member would well know, the treatment of this kind of liability varies considerably as between States and as between States and Territories. Some States enforce a no- limit, no-fault regime, while others leave to common law action the determination of liability. Extensive consideration by both the Commonwealth and State governments would be required to determine what options were available for a standardised approach, Australia-wide, to cover both interstate and intrastate operations. That is not to say that the Government has closed its mind or its eyes to the problem about which Senator Gietzelt is so concerned. Rather the point needs to be made that coming to terms with the policies of the various jurisdictions in the area of compensation for third party damages is essentially a practical problem. I believe that deals effectively with the Opposition's motion, which seeks to draw attention to the question of third party personal injury insurance. Indeed, it is the basic reason the Government opposes the proposed amendment at the second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the question that Senator Gietzelt raised with regard to Advance Airlines , one must recognise that these cases involve private airline operators being sued by individuals. The system administered by the Commonwealth does not automatically provide insurance in all cases. The legislation provides for the licensing of operators but, as I understand it, does not extend totally to insurance. However, a very close watch is kept by the Department in relation to the licensing of operators, to ensure that some means of insurance against these kinds of risks is provided. Nevertheless, the point that Senator Gietzelt raised is one of concern and one that no doubt the Government will continue to monitor very closely. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by repeating that the Government, contrary to what was implied by Senator Gietzelt in referring to the victims of the Advance Airlines crash, has shown no lack of concern for the victims of that or of any other crash. It is certainly of great concern to this Government to maintain the very high level of air safety which has been so fortunately established in this country since the commencement of aviation in Australia. That is its first concern. It will be monitoring the situation to ensure that people have an adequate right to seek damages against operators of all kinds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The object of this Bill is to enable the Australian Government to take reciprocal action against any country which unreasonably imposes countervailing duties against Australian exports, that is to say, in circumstances where duties are imposed against Australian goods on the basis of a claim that Australia is unfairly subsidising the production or export of those goods and that claim is not accompanied by any plausible assertion that the industry of the importing country has been injured or hindered in any way. The Bill has a long background and a rather more colourful history than its title would suggest or, for that matter, the second reading speech on 5 May of the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick), which was brief and boring to the point of incomprehensibility.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly Senator Messner did not write it because, under those circumstances, it would have glittered and sparkled. That history was amply set out in the speech of the Opposition shadow Minister, Mr Brown, in the House of Representatives on 4 May. It is unnecessary, Senator Chaney will be delighted to know, for me to repeat the material there set out. However, Mr Brown's speech shows an extraordinary record of hypocrisy on the part of the present Government which ought to be acknowledged-hypocrisy in its waxing and waning enthusiasm for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade anti-dumping codes and its indifference to whether domestic measures such as export grant expansion schemes have breached such codes. The history of this measure also amply justifies the Opposition shadow Minister's description of the relevant Ministers running our foreign and trade affairs, namely Messrs Fraser, Anthony, Nixon and Street as 'a coterie of agrarian Bolsheviks'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular fuss which prompted this legislation was a controversy with the United States involving the export of Australian lambs. That controversy has now been resolved but this measure stands as an indication of the response which Australia will mount in future if other such circumstances prove to justify it. As such, the Opposition does not oppose the measure. But given the kinds of retaliatory measures which have been proposed in the United States Congress in recent times-draft legislation which, again, has been described by Mr Brown in the other place-it may be that in future Australia will need to wield a considerable bigger reciprocity stick than that which is involved in this legislation. The only way that we can ultimately secure a sane and fair trading environment is by supporting the principle of multilateral trade negotiations, and the ideals of the Kennedy and Tokyo rounds of GATT. In order to do this effectively, the Australian Government must devise a coherent and responsible trade policy. It simply must stop the kind of deceitful double-talk which has so often characterised this Government's pronouncements on trading issues. In particular, the Prime Minister must stop his regular practice of talking free trade in international forums and unbridled protectionism to local industry audiences, a phenomenon which has again been apparent in the recent junketings of Mr Fraser around South East Asia and elsewhere. With those reservations, and our particular reservations about the hypocritical quality of the Government's behaviour in this whole area, I indicate that the Opposition does not oppose this Bill and will assist its speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping ) Amendment (Countervailing Duties) Bill is to provide a mechanism for Australia to introduce reciprocal countervailing duty measures. It is largely as a result of action which has been undertaken in the United states of america to provide some degree of reciprocity in relation to exports from Australia to America. I want to use the debate on this Bill mainly to foreshadow some problems in other anti-dumping areas. Honourable senators will eb aware that on 1 January next year we are to commence a closer economic relationship with New Zealand. The fact that produce comes in from New Zealand at discounted or assisted rates means that we have to have effective ant-dumping provisions. I think we are all aware of the desirability of closer economic relations with New Zealand. We have , basically, similar backgrounds, cultural and heritage, and we have a similar outlook. Of course, the Pacific has the potential to be a trouble spot in the next five or 10 years-we have seen difficulties in Noumea-so it is desirable that Australia and New Zealand speak in the one voice. Closer bonds were forged with the Australian and New Zealand Corps and relationships between families and friends in Australia and New Zealand are very close. So overall a closer economic relationship with New Zealand is desirable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The CER package, to operate from 1 January next year, is designated to replace the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. I think we are all aware of many of the limitations and dufficulties that have occurred. In fact, NAFTA has really run its course. There has been fairly restricted access to the New Zealand market; consequently, plans are being set affoot and it is anticipated that an agreement will be sugned in the next few months, so that on 1 January next year closer economic relations with New Zealand will be a fait accompli. Unfortunately, the phasing out is pretty much one-sided, which bars testimony to the skills of the New Zealand negotiators. It is regrettable that so much of this informed discussion has taken place not in Australia but in New Zealand. It is regrettable that the actions, as far as Australia is concerned, operate almost forthwith whereas the phasing down as far as New Zealand is concerned is over a very protracted period, extending in some cases to the middle and late 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Our people in Australia are trying to sell CER as an overall package. We are told the package will be beneficial to both countries; that it will be beneficial to Australia. No doubt the package will be beneficial, but certain parts of Australia will have the potential to be irreparably damaged. If we look at not so much the total value but the composition of the imports that have come from New Zealand to Australia over recent years we will see that by far the great majority of those items are also produced in Tasmania. Of all the States that have the potential to be damaged, Tasmania has the potential to suffer the greatest harm. We are all aware of Tasmania's high unemployment rate of 9 to 10 per cent. I believe that because of the way the figures are collected at the moment the true position is understated. The figures do not truly reflect what is happening out in the bush, in the timber mills and the mining towns. In some cases the closure of a timber mill can mean the loss of half the employment opportunities in a town. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the point. The growth potential in Tasmania lies in two areas- horticulture and tourism. Let us consider the industries at risk in Tasmania. Tourism has the potential to be damaged, but horticulture could be damaged irreparably by actions in New Zealand, assisted by government price support schemes, export incentives and so on. New Zealand is great at this but we are babes in the woods at it in Australia. With soft fruits Queensland and Victoria could be sufferers also because they produce something like 60 per cent of the total number of strawberries produced in Australia. But of the other soft fruit, such as loganberries and blackcurrants, 90 per cent is produced in Tasmania. Tasmania also produces a lot of dry grass seed. If the New Zealanders wanted to they could come in and take over that market. It has the potential to be irreparably damaged. Also coming under the heading of horticulture are peas, beans, corn and potatoes. The 20 per cent tariff on processed potatoes has been lifted, but what about the export incentives until 1985 and further on? We have to look at those. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a problem of conflict of interest as far as Tasmanian senators are concerned. I make no apology for the fact that at a recent delegation I was nominated to be a flag bearer of CER in New Zealand. I could see a conflict of interest as a Tasmanian senator so I declined. I believe that in this case a duty to the State comes above the overriding benefit of a so-called CER package that could be of some overall benefit to the whole of Australia. I believe that Tasmanian senators have a duty to look very closely at this whole CER package. I was so concerned about it that I discussed it at length with my colleagues Senator Rae and Max Burr. We believe it is irresponsible to introduce such a wide-ranging and potentially damaging agreement for particular areas of the Commonwealth without undertaking a major inquiry. What is the appropriate body to conduct this sort of inquiry? Should it be a Senate committee, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the Australian Agricultural Council or a department of a university? Despite my reservations about the Industries Assistance Commission, Senator Rae, Max Burr and I believe-we have written to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to this effect-that it is important to have an IAC inquiry to look not only at the economic implications but also at the social implications and the disruptions that could occur during this intermediate or phase-down period. There is some evidence that a major distributor in Australia has concluded an agreement for the purchase of New Zealand peas. If that is the case , what will happen to organisations such as the Edgell and IXL companies along the coast and up around Scottsdale? They will move to New Zealand because climatically conditions are somewhat similar and during this critical phase-down period there will be a big financial incentive to the producers in New Zealand. They will come in and grab those markets and it will be very difficult to get them back because price is a real determinant when one is buying frozen peas, beans, corn, potatoes and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I issue this warning: We have an area which has the potential for growth. We have already seen what has happened. Are we going to sit back, without conducting any major inquiry, and allow this agreement to go through? I believe that time is starting to run out here in Australia. There is not enough discussion. It is true that people have come across from New Zealand to issue platitudes, but the track record of the New Zealanders in the area of trade negotiations is not good. I would say that about 98 per cent of the anti-dumping cases that have come through my hands have involved companies in New Zealand. What have they done? They have bought garments from overseas, put buttons on them and re-exported them to Australia under an incentives scheme. A couple of textile mills are currently in trouble with particular items because of imports from New Zealand. New Zealand bought goods from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, did some minor alterations, then re-exported them. We have had the stupid situation of certain types of yarns coming in from New Zealand and underselling Australian yarns yet other types of yarn going to New Zealand. The whole situation is quite farcical. We have a problem in Tasmania which has to be aired somewhere. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>Tonight the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1982-83. It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the Budget proposals of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA> The past year has been an extremely difficult one for the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> The international recession is now hitting us hard. Our overseas markets have shrunk. Economic growth has faltered. Unemployment is rising. Inflation remains far too high. Interest rates are hurting many of us. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst much of this is due to the state of the world economy, the excessive growth of wages in Australia has made matters worse. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when Australian industries should be more competitive we have made ourselves less competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments have affected all Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> To some, the past year has meant either the loss of a job or job insecurity. </PARA>
<PARA> To those paying off a home, the past year has seen unwelcome increases in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> To those Australians who live in many parts of our rural areas, the added burden of a widespread drought has compounded other difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> In many parts of Australia major increases in electricity and other State charges have added to the burden of balancing the family budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Prospects for a rapid recovery in the world economy are at best very faint. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore unrealistic to expect a major recovery in the Australian economy to occur in the near future. There are no quick, easy solutions to our present problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a background has made the framing of this Budget by far the most difficult since the present Government took office. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand it was necessary to recognise that present economic conditions cause real hardship to many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, we must never lose sight of the need to maintain an economic strategy which is responsible and which effectively addresses those economic developments which have contributed to our present situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accordingly endeavoured to balance these two considerations in the fairest and most responsible way possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, we have done all we can to provide relief, assistance and incentive within the confines of a responsible economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This has necessarily meant some increase in the size of the overall Budget deficit compared with last year. </PARA>
<PARA> But the outcome-a deficit of $1,674m-is only one per cent of gross domestic product and produces a domestic surplus of $230m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident that this deficit can be financed in a non- inflationary manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal features of this Budget are:</PARA>
<PARA> some personal tax relief and other assistance specifically designed to give maximum help to Australian families especially those on lower and middle incomes ;</PARA>
<PARA> interest relief for people paying off their home;</PARA>
<PARA> a shift in emphasis towards capital works expenditure, including a special roads program, with beneficial employment consequences;</PARA>
<PARA> increased assistance for pensioners;</PARA>
<PARA> the introduction of a new Family Income Supplement to help certain low income families;</PARA>
<PARA> an increase in job training opportunities and other help for the unemployed; and</PARA>
<PARA> some increases in indirect taxation and a modest broadening of the indirect tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> These items should be looked at in conjunction with the major incentives provided to Australian industry by the measures announced by the Prime Minister a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> Few predicted the extent of the present world recession. </PARA>
<PARA> For a period we in Australia were fortunate not to feel its full effects. </PARA>
<PARA> Our economic policies and relative energy endowments created a more favourable investment climate in Australia than in most other countries. This sustained our economic growth beyond that of others. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the continued deterioration of economic activity around the world with all its implications for trade and commodity and energy prices ultimately affected our exports. </PARA>
<PARA> It also dampened enthusiasm for a number of mineral and energy related projects . </PARA>
<PARA> These adverse international influences were compounded by a significant worsening on the domestic wages front. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for maximum wage restraint has therefore been much in the Government's mind in framing this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Further progress on this front must be achieved if we are to become more competitive as a nation, thus reaping in full the benefits of a revival of the world economy when it comes. </PARA>
<PARA> The plain, inescapable fact is that Australia has priced herself out of many world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, last year wage levels in this country grew by some 3 or 4 per cent more than the rate of inflation. By comparison recent wage settlements in West Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom, countries that rank among our major trading partners, have been around or less than the rates of inflation in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless our relative performance is improved, our living standards will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> This problem can only be solved through a total community commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent tripartite discussions between the Government, employers and the unions have already made a valuable contribution in this context. </PARA>
<PARA> For its part the Government will continue to follow those policies which create the right general economic environment for wage restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> As a major employer the Government has recently sought a significant degree of wage restraint in respect of its own employees. </PARA>
<PARA> There have already been a number of private sector and State government responses to this lead which the Government welcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The unions too have a major role to play. All of us must become more conscious of the appalling consequences in terms of more unemployment which flow from excessive wage rises. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government welcomes recent statements by some trade union leaders acknowledging the importance of wage restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation relief and other assistance, particularly for families, contained in this Budget should be taken account of by wage and salary earners in making their wage claims. </PARA>
<PARA>THE OUTCOME FOR 1981-82</PARA>
<PARA> For the year as a whole both production and employment grew more slowly than in the previous year-and more slowly than expected at the time of last year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, private business fixed investment still grew very strongly in real terms. Real personal consumption expenditure rose by 3 1/2 per cent; however, private dwelling investment fell by 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Exports remained flat and imports rose strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> Gross domestic product rose by 3 per cent and non-farm product by 2 1/4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these figures, however, disguise the marked slowdown in activity which occurred during the course of 1981-82 as the effects of the international recession and adverse wage developments began to take their toll on the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, non-farm product grew at an annual rate of only one quarter of one per cent during the second half of 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> For 1981-82 as a whole, average weekly earnings appear to have risen by about 14 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That figure would have been serious enough. However, it conceals the jump in average weekly earnings at an estimated annual rate of around 20 per cent between the December and June quarters. </PARA>
<PARA> It also conceals the fact that, during the year, shorter working hours added further to labour costs. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this was occurring at a time when overseas wage and price inflation was coming down. </PARA>
<PARA> In consequence, Australia's rate of wage and price inflation moved sharply above those of our major trading partners and the competitiveness of much of our industry was severely eroded, despite considerable depreciation of our exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the year to June 1982 Australia's inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 10.7 per cent-almost 2 per cent above the rate over the previous twelve months and some 4 per cent above the average for our major OECD trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> The profit share fell in the first half of 1982 to the average level of 1974-75 . </PARA>
<PARA> Employers reacted quickly by pruning their labour forces, and unemployment, which had been gradually rising over the second half of 1981, has increased sharply so far in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates in Australia were extremely high during 1981-82 in both real and nominal terms, reflecting in a major way interest rates abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> Our high interest rates also reflected, however, domestic influences including the increased demand for funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth demands on financial markets were again lower but other levels of government continued to increase theirs. </PARA>
<PARA> Corporate sector borrowing also remained strong, even while the growth of private investment was slowing, since the squeeze on profits and cash flows increased the corporate sector's need to borrow for working capital purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>THE BUDGET OUTCOME FOR 1981-82</PARA>
<PARA> The overall Budget deficit in 1981-82 was $549m, the lowest since 1973-74. The deficit represented about 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product, the lowest such proportion since 1971-72. </PARA>
<PARA> The outcome, however, was $453m higher than the Budget estimate, due entirely to outlays being one per cent higher than estimated at Budget time. </PARA>
<PARA> Contributing to the overrun on outlays were greater than expected increases in public sector wages and salaries, unemployment benefits and public debt interest . </PARA>
<PARA> Total receipts were marginally above the Budget estimate although there were variations in some of the main components. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, net PAYE and other individuals' income tax collections were higher than predicted by $162m and $202m respectively, the latter reflecting our successful campaign against tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, 1981-82 and 1980-81 have been the only occasions in the past six years that provisional tax collections have exceeded Budget estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>OUTLAYS</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the main expenditure provisions of the Budget. Further details are provided in the accompanying Budget documents, particularly Statement No. 3. Relevant Ministers will also be issuing more detailed statements. </PARA>
<PARA> Total outlays for 1982-83 are estimated to be $47,067, an increase of 13.9 per cent on last year, or in real terms just over 2 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In putting together this Budget, the Government has placed considerable emphasis on capital expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA> This emphasis is evident not only in the funding provided for programs of assistance to the States and local authorities but also in the Commonwealth's own civil works program. </PARA>
<PARA> Major items in this field include increased funding for housing, particularly welfare housing, enhanced accommodation programs for the aged and disabled, a significantly increased roads program and expanded airport development. </PARA>
<PARA> The greater spending under these programs will enhance employment prospects in those sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>DEFENCE</PARA>
<PARA> The Government remains strongly committed to increasing defence preparedness and improving Australia's defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA> The $4,622m which we are providing in the Budget for defence represents an increase of 11.8 per cent on 1981-82 and implies some further real growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provision is expected to represent about 2.9 per cent of gross domestic product, in line with our target of 3 per cent by 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA> Further details will be provided to the Parliament by the Minister for Defence later in the year. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided on an extensive range of measures aimed at increased assistance to those most in need, particularly to pensioners and other social welfare beneficiaries, certain low income families and the handicapped. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to increase family allowances in order to further assist Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, total expenditure on social welfare is estimated to increase by $1 ,774 million or 15.4 per cent to $13,272m in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> I will outline the more significant items here. Details of these and other measures will be provided in separate statements by the Ministers for Social Security and Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Families</PARA>
<PARA>Family Allowances</PARA>
<PARA> The rates of family allowance for the first and second child will be increased by 50 per cent with effect from November 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> This follows the decision in last year's Budget to increase the rates of family allowance by 50 per cent for third and subsequent children. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate for the first child will be increased from $15.20 a month to $22.80 a month and the rate for the second child from $21.70 a month to $32.55 a month. A family with two or more children will therefore gain by $18.45 a month. </PARA>
<PARA> In all more than two million Australian families will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes are estimated to cost $250m in 1982-83 and $375m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Family Income Supplement</PARA>
<PARA> Special consideration has also been given to the needs of families on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end the Government has decided to introduce from May 1983 a tax free Family Income Supplement of $10 a week for each dependent child of a low income family not in receipt of social security type pensions or benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the same rate of assistance per child paid for the children of pensioners and beneficiaries, and will ensure that low income working families with children are not disadvantaged by comparison with those on unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The full rate of Supplement will be paid to families whose joint income does not exceed the income limit under the disadvantaged persons health care arrangements for a married couple without children. In November 1982, this limit will be $184 per week, and this amount is subject to further upward adjustment in May 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Payments of the Supplement will be reduced by $1 for every $2 of income beyond that level of joint parental income. </PARA>
<PARA> The necessary administrative arrangements required to put a new benefit of this kind into operation will mean payments cannot commence until May 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The Supplement is estimated to cost $3.5m in 1982-83 and $30m in a full year. The Minister for Social Security will announce further details. </PARA>
<PARA>Children's Services Program</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has undertaken a thorough review of the children's services program. As a result, total expenditure under that program will be increased by 28 per cent to $103m in 1982-83 and a number of innovations will be undertaken. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> an increase in the operational support grants to family day care schemes from $ 7 to $10 a week per child in full-time care;</PARA>
<PARA> the development of an income test to determine eligibility for a fee rebate for pre-school day care for families in need; and</PARA>
<PARA> the three year pilot Youth Services Scheme has been extended for one year to 30 June 1983 to enable final evaluation of the Scheme. Additional funds will be made available to increase assistance to existing projects for this period.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security will announce further details. </PARA>
<PARA>Indexation of Pensions and Benefits</PARA>
<PARA> Basic pension and benefit rates will continue to be adjusted each November and May in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. In November the standard or single rate of social security pension, for example, will rise by $3.10 to $ 77.25 a week, while the combined married rate will increase by $5.20 to $128.80 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Later in this Speech, I shall announce details of a special tax rebate for pensioners designed to improve the relative position of pensioners with small non-pension incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>Rental Assistance for Pensioners</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises the special problems faced by many pensioners in rented accommodation. Following an increase of $3 in the maximum rate of supplementary rental assistance in February of this year, from November 1982 it will be further increased by $2 a week to $10 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> This is estimated to cost an additional $16.7m in 1982-83 and about $24m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Pension Income and Fringe Benefit Limits</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to increase the levels of private income that pensioners and supporting parents can receive without any reduction in their pension. The levels were last increased in 1972. The new levels will increase by 50 per cent to $30 a week for single pensioners and by 45 per cent to $50 a week for pensioner couples from November 1982; higher levels apply where there are children. </PARA>
<PARA> This will mean, for example, that a married couple in receipt of an age pension will be able to receive a total gross income of $178.80 a week before their pension is diminished on the basis of 50 cents for each $1 of non-pension income in excess of $50 a week. The pension will not be totally withdrawn until their gross income reaches $307.60 a week. Comparable figures for a single pensioner are $107.25 and $184.50 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The income limits for fringe benefit entitlement including pensioner health benefits are also to be raised. From November 1982, these will be increased by 35 per cent to $54 a week for single pensioners and by 32 per cent to $90 a week for pensioner couples. Additions to the limit for dependent children will be raised to a uniform $20 a week for each child. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are estimated to cost $72.2m in 1982-83 and about $110m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment and Sickness Benefits</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided on further measures to assist the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The non-indexed rate of unemployment benefit for persons 18 years and over without dependants will be increased from $58.10 a week to $64.40 a week and the rate of unemployment and sickness benefit for persons under 18 years will be raised from $36 to $40 a week. Both increases will take effect from November 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The income tests for unemployment and sickness benefits are to be standardised with an increased uniform 'free area' of $10 a week and an increase to $60 a week in the upper limit to the range of non-benefit income over which the benefit is reduced on a 50 per cent basis. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are estimated to cost $68.1m in 1982-83 and about $103m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, eligibility for pensioner health benefits has been extended to all sickness beneficiaries irrespective of income. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance to the Handicapped</PARA>
<PARA> For 1982-83, we have decided on a range of measures that will meet many of the concerns expressed by groups of the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> The main initiatives are:</PARA>
<PARA> the introduction, from April 1983, of a non-taxable mobility allowance of $10 a week for severely handicapped people in employment or undertaking vocational training who are unable to use public transport;</PARA>
<PARA> a $12 a month increase in the rate of handicapped child's allowance, to $85 a month from November 1982; and</PARA>
<PARA> $750,000 to improve and extend regional services under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. </PARA>
<PARA>Accommodation for the Aged or Disabled</PARA>
<PARA> As already announced, additional capital funds will be made available for aged or disabled persons' accommodation. Over the next two years $170m will be provided for the program with $83m being allocated in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, $37m and $14m will be spent over the next two years on capital facilities under the Handicapped Persons' Assistance Program and on senior citizens' centres; $18.5m and $7m respectively are to be spent in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>Personal Care Subsidy</PARA>
<PARA> We have decided to increase the personal care subsidy from $20 to $30 a week for each eligible person in hostel-type accommodation, backdated to July 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of this measure is estimated to be $12m in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance to Veterans</PARA>
<PARA> New measures of particular importance to veterans include the following:</PARA>
<PARA> the disability pension will be totally disregarded in the income test for service pension and fringe benefits;</PARA>
<PARA> repatriation treatment benefits are to be extended to veterans of World War II who receive not less than 50 per cent disability pension plus a service pension;</PARA>
<PARA> service pension eligibility is to be extended, with effect from 3 February 1983 , to Commonwealth and Allied merchant mariners;</PARA>
<PARA> the disability pension at the 100 per cent general rate will be restored for pulmonary tuberculosis from 6 January 1983, for those veterans who were in receipt of the benefit prior to 2 November 1978;</PARA>
<PARA> the maximum rate of repatriation funeral benefit will be increased from $400 to $500 and the eligibility tests will be eased; and</PARA>
<PARA> there will be increases in many supplementary repatriation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> These initiatives are expected to cost $14.5 million in 1982-83 and about $24m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Aboriginals</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $164m-a 12.4 per cent increase-for Aboriginal advancement programs administered by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. $51.4m of this is for the Aboriginal Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, other expenditure programs directed specifically to assisting Aboriginals, including programs funded under other portfolios, total about $107m . </PARA>
<PARA>HEALTH</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $3379m for health services, an increase of 16 per cent on 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>Pharmaceutical Benefits</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to introduce a three-tier Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from 1 January 1983, to provide further benefits to pensioners and the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> These new arrangements will operate as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> those pensioners and beneficiaries who have been receiving their pharmaceutical benefits free of charge will continue to do so;</PARA>
<PARA> a new concessional contribution rate of $2.00 per benefit item will be introduced for Health Care card holders and their dependants and all pensioners not already entitled to free pharmaceuticals; and</PARA>
<PARA> the general patient contribution rate will rise from $3.20 to $4.00 per benefit item. </PARA>
<PARA> The expected net cost is $2.8m in 1982-83 and about $7m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Payments to pharmacists for dispensing pharmaceutical benefit items were increased from 1 July at an estimated cost of $8m for this year. In addition, the Government has agreed to an increase in drug prices-3 per cent on the price to chemists plus 9 cents per benefit item-from 1 November 1982 with an estimated cost of $12.4m for 1982-83 and $24.8m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA> In 1982-83, total direct outlays on education are estimated to increase by 13.5 per cent to $3,792 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of these funds-over $3,000m-are being spent on the programs administered by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education and Schools Commissions. Details of the funding for these programs in 1983 have already been announced. </PARA>
<PARA>Student Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> In making its decisions in this area, the Government has had in mind the high level of youth unemployment, lower participation rates in education and the difficulties faced by many very low income families in meeting the cost of their children remaining at school or attending a tertiary institution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has therefore decided on a number of changes in student assistance programs for the 1983 academic year. </PARA>
<PARA> Allowances under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and the Secondary Allowances Scheme will be increased by 20 per cent and allowances under other student assistance schemes by 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 the number of Commonwealth Post-graduate Awards will be increased by 100 to 900 and the basic allowance raised from $4,620 to $6,850 per annum, an increase of 48 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The income test requirements of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme will be eased with the limits being increased by 11 per cent for 1983. In addition, the limits for the Secondary Allowances Scheme will be adjusted to the same level, an increase of over 44 per cent in limits for this Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of these two Schemes is estimated to increase this financial year by $ 17m and the number of beneficiaries to increase by over 10,000 in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>Student Loans Scheme</PARA>
<PARA> The foreshadowed Tertiary Student Loans Scheme will commence from the beginning of 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to a means test, loans of up to $1,000 per year to a total of $8,000 over the period of full-time tertiary study will be available, with a generous interest rate subsidy and exemption from repayment for up to two years after completion of study. </PARA>
<PARA> Thereafter a repayment period of up to 10 years is provided for. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Education will announce further details. </PARA>
<PARA>HOUSING ASSISTANCE</PARA>
<PARA> Over recent months the Government has announced significant improvements in housing assistance measures. The total of $571m provided for housing expenditure in this Budget includes:</PARA>
<PARA> a significant increase in welfare housing assistance to at least $333m-an increase of 27 per cent on 1981-82 outlays-which can be supplemented by additional funds nominated by the States through their works and housing programs; and</PARA>
<PARA> $147m, an increase of about 28 per cent over 1981-82, as grants to first home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, $20m has been provided as the Commonwealth's contribution to a new Mortgage and Rent Relief Program to provide assistance to families facing severe financial hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to ask the Reserve Bank of Australia to consider making a release of one percentage point from the Statutory Reserve Deposits it holds from the major trading banks for the special purpose of lending for housing. Any such release would, of course, be additional to the amount of $400m the major banks agreed to increase their home lending by earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall be announcing further housing assistance measures later tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING PROGRAMS</PARA>
<PARA> Increased unemployment, particularly amongst young Australians, which the current economic difficulties have produced, requires further emphasis on employment and job training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Last financial year we spent $206m in this area. In 1982-83 this will be increased by 21 per cent to $250m. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall continue to give special weight to assistance programs for the young unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers will be encouraged to provide more opportunities for unemployed young people to obtain work experience and job skills and to become established in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure on assistance for work experience is to rise by $20m or 37 per cent to $74m in 1982-83. This will allow for over 74,000 new work experience placements in 1982-83 and increases of up to 36 per cent in the rate of subsidy to employers. </PARA>
<PARA> Support for the apprenticeship intake will also be maintained through significant increases in CRAFT rebates, with effect from the beginning of 1983. Total outlay on CRAFT in 1982-83 is estimated at $84m. This will enable employers to receive assistance in respect of some 111,000 apprentices in 1982- 83, compared to 99,000 last year. </PARA>
<PARA>CULTURE AND RECREATION</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $501m for culture and recreation activities in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Commission will receive $256m, which will permit some expansion of activity. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $12m has been provided for the installation of new transmitters and translators, including $1m to commence a three year program for the extension of multicultural television. </PARA>
<PARA> The Special Broadcasting Service has also been allocated $26.2m in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Other expenditures of note are:</PARA>
<PARA> $34m for the Australia Council including about $3.7m for the Australian Opera, more than $3m for the Elizabethan Theatre Trust orchestras and about $1.8m for the Australian Ballet Foundation;</PARA>
<PARA> $15m for the Australian National Gallery, which is planned to open in October this year;</PARA>
<PARA> $26m for sports programs, which includes $4m for operating expenses of the Australian Institute of Sport, over $8m for payments to State and Territory governments to develop international sporting facilities, and assistance for sport and recreation for disabled people; and</PARA>
<PARA> an increase of over 50 per cent in expenditure on the Australian War Memorial. This includes a significant provision for the Memorial's permanent exhibition and its collection and very necessary repairs and maintenance to Memorial buildings. </PARA>
<PARA>FOREIGN AID</PARA>
<PARA> A total of $713m is provided for foreign aid expenditure in the Budget, an increase of $72m on last year's expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Priority will continue to be given to bilateral assistance to Papua New Guinea and countries in South-East Asia and the South Pacific region in addition to continuing support for various multilateral and regional organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>ASSISTANCE TO INDUSTRY</PARA>
<PARA> In his Statement of 19 July last, the Prime Minister announced major new incentives for Australia's manufacturing, mining and rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, these included more generous depreciation provisions, a continuation of the Industrial Research and Development Scheme and a significant strengthening of the Export Market Development Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Depreciation allowances were also introduced for all new non-residential income producing buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures were introduced in recognition of the subdued level of economic activity at present and the special need to make all sections of Australian industry as competitive as possible, particularly those striving to win export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> A revival of the fortunes of those Australian industries now experiencing difficulties and an expansion of job opportunities within those industries will depend very largely upon an improvement in general economic conditions, particularly at the international level. However, the measures announced by the Prime Minister will greatly enhance the ability of Australian industry to take part in a revival when general economic conditions do begin to pick up. </PARA>
<PARA> This year total Budget outlays for industry assistance and development are estimated to exceed $1,000m for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA>Rural Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> The extended drought in many parts of Australia has already had an extremely serious effect on large sections of our rural industries which are so vital to our export earnings as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have made an interest free advance of $10m to the New South Wales Government for drought relief purposes in that State. The Government has the drought situation under constant surveillance and stands ready to provide appropriate further assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision in 1980 to allow immediate write off of the cost of water storage facilities as a drought relief measure has been of considerable help to primary producers. Tax savings as a result of this to primary producers to end 1981-82 are estimated at more than $30m. </PARA>
<PARA> Net payments from this year's Budget to rural industries are estimated to total $313m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will seek passage of the phosphate and nitrogenous fertilizer subsidy legislation in this Parliamentary session. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the depressed conditions being experienced in the cattle and meat industries, the Government has decided to write off the industry debt in respect of the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign, estimated to be $23.5m . </PARA>
<PARA> Charges under the Campaign of up to $4 per head will be levied from 1 October 1982 and reviewed annually to ensure contributions cover the industry's share of future costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Water Resources Programs</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $41.7m for the National Water Resources Program, an increase of 27.5 per cent on 1981-82 expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> A further $6.5m is expected to be provided in 1982-83 for the construction of the Burdekin Dam. </PARA>
<PARA>Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme</PARA>
<PARA> Total expenditure on this Scheme in 1981-82 amounted to some $148m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has in recent times become concerned that the Scheme could be the subject of some abuse and fraud which migh have caused some of the significant cost increases which have occurred in the operation of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> It has therefore been decided that the Scheme should be the subject of a thorough review. Pending the outcome of the review the Scheme will be amended to subsidise freight cost differentials in excess of 1 cent per litre instead of 0. 44 cents per litre as previously applied. </PARA>
<PARA> Further details will be announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA>TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION</PARA>
<PARA> Total Budget outlays on transport and communication are estimated to increase by 25 per cent to $1,475m. </PARA>
<PARA>Roads Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> Under the normal roads program the Commonwealth will provide $734 million to the States and the Northern Territory this financial year as part of our undertaking to provide a total of $3,650m for roads over the five years to 1984- 85. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition-and as a major initiative to bring about a lasting improvement in the road and transport system of the nation-the Government has decided to establish an Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. </PARA>
<PARA> Its goals are to be achieved by 1988, our Bicentennial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The special Bicentennial Road Development Program will include national, arterial and local roads in all parts of Australia and also provide for upgrading elements of our urban transport network. </PARA>
<PARA> The priorities and allocations under this Program will be finally determined by the Commonwealth Government. It will be a fundamental requirement of the Program that the States and local government at least maintain in real terms their expenditure on roads and in other areas touched by the Program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Program will be entirely funded by a special surcharge on motor spirit and distillate. This will initially be set at 1 cent per litre, with expenditure under the Program totalling $150m in 1982-83. The surcharge will be increased on 1 July 1983 to 2 cents per litre. </PARA>
<PARA> The proceeds of this surcharge will be paid into a special trust fund so that none of those proceeds can be used for purposes other than the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. </PARA>
<PARA> About $2,500 million is expected to be provided under this Program over the period to 1988-89. Further details will be announced tonight by the Minister for Transport and Construction. </PARA>
<PARA>Air Navigation Charges</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to increase air navigation charges for domestic trunk and regional airlines by 20 per cent and for the general aviation sector by 12 per cent, effective from 1 October 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional recoveries of $8.4 million in 1982-83 and $12.5m in a full year are expected from these higher charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Charges for the international sector, where there is already full cost recovery , will remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA>Rail</PARA>
<PARA> Budget outlays are estimated to be $94.5m for rail transport in 1982-83 of which $21.8m is allocated to mainline upgrading and $3m is provided for the continued planning of the proposed Alice Springs to Darwin railway. </PARA>
<PARA>Domestic Communications Satellite</PARA>
<PARA> A further equity contribution of $18m will be provided to AUSSAT Pty Ltd, which will own and operate the proposed domestic satellite communications system to be introduced in Australia in 1984. It is planned that, in due course, the private sector will be invited to take up a substantial equity interest in AUSSAT Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>The New Australia Telescope</PARA>
<PARA> The work of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization has won world respect, not least in radio physics through the work of the radio telescope at Parkes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now decided to fund the construction by CSIRO of a new radio telescope to cost a total of $25m to be known as the Australia Telescope and to be completed by our Bicentennial year 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>PAYMENTS TO THE STATES, NORTHERN TERRITORY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT</PARA>
<PARA> The major decisions affecting payments to the States have already been announced. </PARA>
<PARA> Total net payments to the States, the Northern Territory and local government, including all specific purpose payments, are estimated to increase by $1956m or 13.9 per cent in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Special assistance totalling $105m for various capital purposes is also being provided to a number of States. This assistance is expected to have beneficial employment consequences. The details are:</PARA>
<PARA> $20m to Western Australia for sewage works in the Cockburn Sound area with $12. 1m being made available this year;</PARA>
<PARA> $10m to Tasmania for tourist road development in 1982-83;</PARA>
<PARA> $10m to South Australia for upgrading water supply facilties in 1982-83; and</PARA>
<PARA> $35m to Victoria, $20m to Queensland and $10m to South Australia in 1982-83 for upgrading their transportation systems. </PARA>
<PARA> In this same general context it should be noted that removal of the $1 a tonne coal export levy, at a cost to revenue of $25m this year, will be of particular benefit to New South Wales, which is the source of the great bulk of export coal in this category. </PARA>
<PARA>CAPITAL WORKS</PARA>
<PARA> Taking direct capital expenditures together with capital grants and net advances, the total provided by the Budget for capital purposes in 1982-83 is over $4000m, an increase of more than 17 per cent on similar outlays in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> By far the major part of this amount will fund capital works. </PARA>
<PARA>Budget-Financed Civil Works</PARA>
<PARA> Some $336m in 1982-83 is for civil works financed directly from the Budget. This is an increase of $136m or 68 per cent on 1981-82 expenditures and will provide a boost to the building and construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Airports</PARA>
<PARA> Airport works approved for commencement in 1982-83 are estimated to cost a total of $355m over the next four years and $49m in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Included are major development works for Brisbane, Perth and Townsville airports and the upgrading of facilities at a number of other airports. </PARA>
<PARA> Also included is $12m under the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan for the upgrading of a number of country airports in New South Wales and Queensland to permit the introduction of medium jet aircraft to those centres and for new developments associated with the transfer of Government airports to local ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> Total expenditure in 1982-83 under the Plan is estimated at $38m. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Civil Works</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to proceed in 1982-83 with major redevelopment works at Repatriation General Hospitals at Daw Park and Hollywood, extensions to the National Library, and the construction of an indoor sports training facility for the Australian Institute of Sport. </PARA>
<PARA>RECEIPTS</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the revenue proposals. Total receipts are estimated at $45,393m, an increase of 11.3 per cent on last year or, in real terms, of only 0.3 per cent. This is the smallest real rise in recipts for ten years. </PARA>
<PARA> A major factor in producing such a small rise in revenue collections is the impact of the slowdown economic growth on collections of income and company taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Revenue collections have also been affected by the taxation reductions in certain areas which I am about to announce. </PARA>
<PARA> As will be apparent from recent decisions and from other announcements contained in this Speech, the Government remains committed to effective measures against both tax avoidance and evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> In a separate statement tonight the Treasurer will indicate steps he will take to recover unpaid Division 7 tax in 'bottom of the harbour' cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Our past legislation has proved effective. The most recent evidence of this is the fact that the Commissioner of Taxation has informed the Government that this financial year it will not be necessary to make an adjustment to projected revenue collections to allow for tax avoidance losses in the way that has been done in the last several years. </PARA>
<PARA> Our continuing success on this front played no small part in making it possible to provide some personal tax relief in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Personal Income Tax</PARA>
<PARA> We propose to make a substantial reduction in the personal income tax burden and, in so doing, give particular attention to those on low to average incomes and to the needs of families. </PARA>
<PARA> With these objectives in mind, three changes in the tax scales are proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the tax-free threshold is to be increased by $400 per annum, from $4,195 to $4,595. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that no tax will be payable until a taxpayer's annual income exceeds $4,595. As a result of this change alone about 300,000 pensioners and low income earners who would otherwise pay tax in 1982-83 will not now do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the standard rate of tax is to be reduced from 32 per cent to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the top of the standard rate step, namely the point above which a taxpayer commences to pay 46 per cent of each additional dollar he or she earns in tax, is to be increased from $17,894 to $19,500. </PARA>
<PARA> The most direct and highly beneficial consequence of this change is that many thousands of average wage and salary earners now have the incentive to earn additional income without fear of moving into a higher tax bracket. </PARA>
<PARA> This change will also mean that about 75 per cent of all Australian taxpayers will be on the new and lower standard rate after 1 November. </PARA>
<PARA> The combined effect of these three measures will be to provide the largest proportionate tax reductions to those receiving lower taxable incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Detailed tables illustrating these changes at various income levels are being provided. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a taxpayer on average weekly earnings of about $344.60 will receive a boost in his take home pay of $7.65 as a result of the changes I have just explained. </PARA>
<PARA>Single Income Families</PARA>
<PARA> To give additional help to single income families with dependent children it is proposed to increase the dependent spouse rebate by $200 per year, from $830 per annum to $1,030 per annum, where there are dependent (including student) children. </PARA>
<PARA> For a taxpayer on the average wage with a dependent wife and children, this particular measure will mean a further tax saving of $3.85 per week, additional to the saving of $7.65 arising from the general tax reductions outlined earlier.</PARA>
<PARA> These same levels of rebate will apply for a housekeeper or daughter- housekeeper where there are dependent children. The sole parent rebate will also be raised by $200, to $780 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>Commencement Date and Cost</PARA>
<PARA> All of these changes will take effect from 1 November 1982 and will be reflected in PAYE instalments, and hence paypackets, from that date. </PARA>
<PARA> For assessment purposes, the rate scale applied to 1982-83 taxable incomes will be an average of one-third of the present scale and two-thirds of the new scale.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the increase of $200 per annum in the rebates which I have mentioned will average $133 for the 1982-83 income year, reflecting the operation of the higher level for two-thirds of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of the various personal income tax measures I have mentioned is estimated at $1,570m in 1982-83 and $2,567m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Net PAYE income tax collections will be 2 per cent lower in real terms this year than last. </PARA>
<PARA>Pensioner Rebate</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past year there has been growing concern amongst pensioners in Australia that, in the absence of corrective action, their pensions would increase to the point where the pension alone would become taxable. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major reasons for our decision to increase the tax-free threshold to $4,595 per annum, or approximately $88 per week, was to stop this occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in addition, we have decided to introduce a special pensioner rebate for income tax purposes. This will ensure that people wholly or mainly dependent on a taxable pension do not bear tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum rebate will be $250 per annum. This means that a pensioner can have a total income including a pension of $5,429 per year without having to pay any tax. For every additional dollar of income that a pensioner has over and above $ 5,429 per year, the amount of that rebate will be reduced by 12 1/2 cents, so that by the time a pensioner's income reaches $7,429 the rebate will no longer be applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> The rebate will take effect from 1 November 1982 and, for assessment purposes, the level of 1982-83 maximum rebate will be $167, with corresponding shading-out provisions above $5,007. </PARA>
<PARA> Married pensioners will each be entitled to the same rebate as a single pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA> This rebate is estimated to cost $7m in 1982-83 and $36m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the increased income to pensioners as a result of the combination of cash benefits and reductions in tax from November this year, ranges from up to $12.79 per week for a single pensioner to $17.08 per week for a couple, along with the extension of fringe benefit entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA>Non-resident Taxpayers</PARA>
<PARA> At present the first $4,195 of taxable income of non-resident as well as resident individuals is free of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the reasons for freeing residents from tax on the lowest slice of income seldom have much relevance to non-residents, and there is already no tax free amount for withholding tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore proposed to withdraw the effect of the zero rate from non- residents, other than those in receipt of taxable social security and repatriation payments, and subject that slice of income to tax at the standard rate. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure will have some anti-tax avoidance benefits and is in line with overseas practice. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure which, subject to some matters mentioned in Statement No. 4, will take effect from tonight is estimated to yield $1m in 1982-83 and $15m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Home Loan Interest Rebate</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to provide some taxation relief to people who are paying off their home, irrespective of whether it is their first home, thus broadening in a significant way the housing interest relief which I announced on 18 March this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The new rebate will allow persons paying off their own home to claim (in 1982- 83) a rebate at the standard rate on the amount of interest they pay on their housing loan, from any source, over and above 10 per cent on up to $60,000 of mortgage or other loan arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a taxpayer paying interest at 13.5 per cent on a mortgage from a savings bank of $25,000 would obtain a rebate of $5.05 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, if a taxpayer had a building society mortgage of $30,000 at an interest rate of 15 per cent, the rebate would be $8.65 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligibility for this scheme will, of course, be restricted to the sole or principal residence of a taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the present scheme, the new rebate will not be limited to first home owners nor the first five years of home ownership, and the amount of rebate will not be subject to specified ceilings. </PARA>
<PARA> First home buyers will still be able to use the existing scheme, rather than the new scheme, where it confers the larger rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> PAYE instalments can be adjusted to allow for the rebate from 1 November 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The rebates scheme already in place would, on its own, have cost $100m in 1982- 83 and $230m in a full year. It is estimated that the effect of the new measure will be to add $55m in 1982-83 and $185m in a full year, to the overall revenue cost. </PARA>
<PARA>Rebate on Dividend Income</PARA>
<PARA> It is a fundamental part of the philosophy of the Government parties that maximum encouragement be given to small investors. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result we have had under study for some time submissions from many suggesting that there should be some relief given from so-called double taxation of dividend income. This issue was the subject of recommendations by the Campbell Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided-as from 1982-83-to allow a rebate at the standard rate of tax on up to $1,000 of dividends included in taxable income received by resident individual shareholders from resident companies. Certain exceptions are noted in Statement No. 4. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure is estimated to cost $36m in 1982-83 and $75m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Employee Share Acquisition Schemes</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also received many representations to provide a greater incentive for schemes whereby employees can purchase shares in the companies which employ them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sees merit in this idea. We have therefore decided to provide an incentive whereby employees will not be subject to tax on any benefits arising from the price at which shares are issued under an approved scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that this course of action will provide benefits to productivity and industrial harmony. There is much to commend the view that employees should feel an increasing stake in the fortunes of the companies employing them. </PARA>
<PARA> Guidelines for approved schemes will include the important requirements that the shares are offered to all employees on a non-discriminatory basis and that, at the time of allocation, the discount on market price does not exceed 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This is estimated to cost $5m in a full year, but will not affect revenue in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>Retention Allowance for Private Companies</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has previously indicated that it would examine further the distribution requirements on private companies under Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> We now propose to increase the retention allowance for trading or business income by 10 per cent, i.e. from 70 to 80 per cent, for distributions from taxable incomes of 1981-82 and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that in the time it has been in office this Government will have increased the retention allowance for private companies from 50 per cent to 80 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> No change is being made to the 10 per cent retention allowance for property income or to the rule that there is no retention allowance for dividends received by one private company from another. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure is estimated to cost $2m in 1982-83 and $30m in a full year and should be of considerable benefit to the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Gift Provisions</PARA>
<PARA> A number of conservation organisations will be given access to the gift provisions of the income tax law. Full details of eligible organisations are provided in a separate release. </PARA>
<PARA>Company Groups</PARA>
<PARA> Both the Asprey and Campbell Committees expressed support for provisions which would allow losses by one company in a group to be offset against profits of others in the group, where there is effectively 100 per cent common ownership of the companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government proposes to introduce measures to give effect to such a provision, supported by various safeguarding and other technical provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax Evasion through Cash Payments</PARA>
<PARA> In recent times, much of the debate on tax avoidance and evasion has tended to concentrate almost exclusively on sophisticated tax avoidance arrangements and has therefore largely ignored the enormous losses to revenue which occur through the so-called cash economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that as much if not more revenue is lost through outright evasion and non-declaration of income together than under artificial tax avoidance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore as part of its ongoing policy against both tax avoidance and evasion the Government has taken a firm decision to introduce from 1 July 1983 a system of deducting at source an amount on account of tax in respect of certain payments for labour and services. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be separate from the normal PAYE system although it will operate like that system in respect of payments to which it applies. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certain industries where evasion poses particular problems. </PARA>
<PARA> An information paper on the proposed new system is being released tonight. The new system will be the subject of extensive discussion and consultation with relevant industry groups and representatives of the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Government has taken a firm decision to launch the new system it wishes to fully consult affected groups regarding implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will take particular care when implementing this system to protect the separate status of sub-contractors. The thrust of the change is to ensure that the honest sub-contractor is not put at a competitive disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>Indirect Taxation</PARA>
<PARA> Although the overall taxation burden in Australia is relatively low amongst industrialised countries our reliance on direct personal taxation as a source of revenue is relatively high amongst those countries. The Government has always seen merit in gradually moving away from an over-reliance on personal income tax as a source of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget contains significant net reductions in personal income tax and the opportunity has been taken to achieve a modest broadening and deepening of the indirect tax base. </PARA>
<PARA>Sales Tax</PARA>
<PARA> Two measures are proposed in the sales tax area. </PARA>
<PARA> First, after tonight each of the three rates on goods at present taxable will be increased by 2 1/2 percentage points, raising an estimated $370m in 1982-83 and $490m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is proposed that a number of goods which are at present exempt be made taxable as from 1 January 1983 at a rate of 7 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This broadening of the sales tax base is to include goods such as hand tools, construction equipment and manchester. It does not include what some have regarded as the 'necessities of life'. </PARA>
<PARA> Further details are given in Statement No. 4 and in the legislation being introduced tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> This extension of the sales tax base is estimated to yield $44m in 1982-83 and $105m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Excises</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to excises. </PARA>
<PARA>Off-Road Use of Distillate</PARA>
<PARA> Exemption of excise duty on diesel fuel is allowed at present for all use off public roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption arrangements have proved difficult to administer so as to prevent abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also some evidence that because of price advantages excise-exempt distillate is being used for purposes such as heating and power generation for which other fuels would be more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The concession also ensures certain competitive advantages, for example, rail transport as against road transport. </PARA>
<PARA> As from tonight, all diesel fuel will bear the full rate of excise duty, irrespective of its end use. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall however introduce a system to allow users to claim rebates of this excise in respect of certain categories of off-road end use-broadly, domestic use, hospitals, nursing and convalescent homes and in the agricultural, mining, fishing and forestry industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will contain provisions allowing claims to be made in respect of diesel fuel purchased from tonight in the specified end uses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce will advise the Parliament of further details. </PARA>
<PARA> The changed arrangements are estimated to yield a net increase in revenue of $ 161m in 1982-83 at the previously existing excise rate of 5.155 cents per litre and $176m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Beer and Tobacco Excise</PARA>
<PARA> Excise rates on beer and tobacco products have not been increased since 1978; the real rates of such duties during this period have declined by about 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Beer and tobacco products excise rates will increase by approximately 15 per cent and 20 per cent respectively with effect from tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in excise on beer-only the fourth in twenty-four years-will be by 8 cents to 60 cents per litre. </PARA>
<PARA> While retail price effects will depend on mark-up practices in the industry, the increase in the price of a glass of beer as a result of the rate increase could be 3 or 4 cents. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure is estimated to yield an additional $113m in 1982-83 and $135m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Excise rates on tobacco products will rise by approximately 20 per cent to $29. 70 per kilogram for cigarettes, $15.10 for manufactured tobacco and $25.34 for cigars. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are estimated to raise about $98m in 1982-83 and $125m in a full year and could raise the retail price of a packet of 20 cigarettes by about 12- 14 cents. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no increases this year in the rates of excise on potable spirits.</PARA>
<PARA> However, some spirits are subject to sales tax and will therefore be affected by the general sales tax increases I announced earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> For each of the excise increases announced tonight, there will be commensurate increases in the corresponding customs duties on imports. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax on Bank Transactions</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the Government's desire to broaden the indirect tax base, it is proposed to introduce a tax on certain bank transactions, with effect from 1 January 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax will apply to all debits to bank accounts that are subject to operation by cheque or like payment instrument, whether or not the particular debit arises from a cheque (or like) transaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Four rates of tax will apply, ranging from 10 cents on debits of less than $100 , to $1 on debits of $5,000 or more. </PARA>
<PARA> Full details will be given in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure is estimated to raise $80m in 1982-83 and $200m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> All these measures are detailed in Statement No. 4. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Capital Territory Stamp Duty</PARA>
<PARA> Several amendments of a technical nature are proposed for stamp duties in the Australian Capital Territory, with the aim of removing anomalies and bringing the ACT duties more into line with those of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Their revenue effect is negligible. </PARA>
<PARA>THE BUDGET'S IMPACT ON FAMILIES</PARA>
<PARA> As I have already said, the Government is particularly concerned at the effect of current economic circumstances on average Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation and other assistance measures of a general character contained in the Budget have been designed to give maximum help to the generality of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, in a genuine sense, this Budget deserves the description of a family Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me illustrate by referring to the impact of this Budget on a family comprising a sole breadwinner with a dependent spouse and two dependent children , who in 1982-83 will have an income of $300 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us also assume that the person is paying off the family home and has a mortgage liability of $25 000 at an interest rate of 13 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This family will receive the following main benefits as a result of the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> The personal tax changes from 1 November will mean an extra $10.54 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> The home loan interest rebate will mean an extra $5.05 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in family allowances will mean an extra $4.25 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> The total benefit from these measures will therefore be some $19.84 per week to this family. </PARA>
<PARA> If we assume that this famiily has a consumption pattern similar to the weightings for the CPI and spends all of its disposable income, the direct effect on it of indirect taxes in this Budget could be about $3 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the net weekly benefits for this family of this Budget would be about $16.84 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me stress again that the above is an average example only and subject to qualification on that account. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it does illustrate the substantial family benefits contained in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Detailed tables illustrating some of the Budget's effects on families in different situations will be made available. </PARA>
<PARA>BUDGET OVERVIEW</PARA>
<PARA> Total outlays in 1982-83 are estimated to increase by 13.9 per cent to $47 067m ; this is an increase of 2.6 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Total receipts are estimated to increase by 11.3 per cent in 1982-83 to $45 393m; this is an increase of 0.3 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall Budget deficit is therefore estimated at $1674m, an increase of $ 1125m on the outcome for 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> After allowance for transactions abroad, there will be an estimated domestic Budget surplus of $230m. </PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</PARA>
<PARA> In framing the Budget the Government has tried to give relief and assistance to those in the community who most need it within the confines of a Budget which is economically responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget does not represent a change in our economic objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be seen as lessening our commitment to achieve a substantial and sustained reduction in inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this year's deficit is bigger than last year's outcome, it remains at only 1 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> For only the third time in the last eight years a domestic surplus is being budgeted for. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is intent that the deficit will be financed in a non- inflationary manner. </PARA>
<PARA> Our armoury of monetary policy instruments has recently been greatly improved. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of recent Loan Council decisions regarding the setting of the interest rate on Australian Savings Bonds and the move to a tender system for selling Treasury Bonds, we now have much greater freedom than in the past to use those instruments in the achievement of our monetary objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates on each of the three types of Commonwealth security can now vary with the requirements of the market so as to ensure adequate sales to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with those requirements, we have already increased the rate of interest on Australian Savings Bonds and conducted the first, quite successful, Treasury Bond tender. </PARA>
<PARA> In last year's Budget, the Treasurer announced an M3 projection of 10 to 11 per cent over the course of 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> The outcome, at 11.3 per cent, was very close to that projection. </PARA>
<PARA> On a number of occasions, the Treasurer has expressed reservations concerning the June on June basis of measurement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is prone to erratic and unpredictable short-term factors, particularly in the closing months of the year, which can give a misleading indication of underlying monetary developments. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's projection will therefore be expressed as an annual average growth rate; that is, in terms of the movement in the average level of M3 between one financial year and the next. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government in fact gave serious thought this year to formally abandoning the announcement of a monetary projection. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from anything else, there are many who would argue that M3 is a less than representative measure of overall credit and monetary conditions and that a complete assessment of the monetary situation necessitates a review of a range of aggregates. </PARA>
<PARA> But because a projection is generally seen by the market as important to expectations and as a useful indication of the Government's intentions, we decided to retain it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would want to make it clear that the projected range is in fact a projection only and should not be taken as a firm target. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not, as some would wish to make it, become a formal measure of the success or failure of monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, the Government will be seeking to restrain the growth of financial aggregates to a degree consistent with growth in M3 within the range of 9-11 per cent for 1982-83 as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Monetary policy will be directed at enhancing the recent signs of slowing in the growth in wages and encouraging settlements in the major wage agreements in the months ahead that will provide a basis for improving business sector profitability and thus arresting the recent sharp deterioration in the employment situation. </PARA>
<PARA> A more market responsive system of wage determination could also help produce wage outcomes closer to the capacity of individual firms, and hence the economy, to bear. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the initial steps that have been taken, we remain well short of such a system and the Government will be seeking to achieve further progress in this direction during 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is, present indications are that average weekly earnings in 1982-83 as a whole could rise by 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard it should be noted that when allowance is made for increases affecting 1982-83 already determined, further increases of only about 6 per cent during the remainder of this financial year are consistent with the 12 per cent assumption. </PARA>
<PARA> Such an outcome would be below the increase in 1981-82 and would entail some slowing from now on but it would still be well above what is required for resumption of sustained employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Consumer Price Index in 1982-83 as a whole could increase at a rate of about 10 3/4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The direct price effects of the revenue measures announced this evening amount to about one per cent-so that, those aside, the underlying rate of 9 1/2 to 10 per cent is much the same as in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> With continuing uncertainty abroad and at home, it is more than usually difficult to forecast the Australian economic outlook with any confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> That said, I have to add that barring an unexpectedly rapid improvement in the world economy, or a sharp drop in business costs, it is difficult to envisage any real growth in domestic non-farm product in 1982-83 as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Business fixed investment, which has grown at record real rates in recent years , and which during that time has been the single most important feature distinguishing the Australian economy from its overseas counterparts, could well decline a little in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, and notwithstanding the personal tax reductions announced tonight, personal consumption expenditure in 1982-83 is likely to grow considerably more slowly than the 3 1/2 per cent rate recorded in 1981-82, at about 1 1/2 per cent . </PARA>
<PARA> Even with the measures announced both last March and this evening, real private dwelling investment is still forecast to decline faster in 1982-83 than in the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other factors, an adequate supply of private housing finance will be critically influenced by the extent to which specialist housing financing institutions are able to offer competitive interest rates on their deposits. </PARA>
<PARA> Farm production is, as always, subject to considerable uncertainties but, given the severe nature of the present drought, will decline in 1982-83 from the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of this outlook, there is unlikely to be any growth in employment in 1982-83 so that, with the labour force continuing to grow, unemployment therefore seems likely to increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The outlook for the balance of payments will reflect the developing outlooks both at home and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The prospect of some growth in world trade should result in a modest increase in export volumes in 1982-83, while import volumes may remain broadly unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA> After taking account of some increase in the invisibles deficit, the current account deficit may be broadly similar to that in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> As always, that deficit will need to be financed by capital inflow, principally on private account; monetary policy settings will need to be tailored accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances a surplus on private sector foreign exchange transactions of around $1,500m is expected. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA> This Budget represents the endeavour of the Government to provide a fair and workable response to the very difficult economic problems which Australia faces at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not been insensitive to the fact that many Australian families need help. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also not been insensitive to the fact that many young people, especially those out of work, might need special help at a time when job opportunities are declining. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that help to these groups and others is being provided in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we have not ignored the compelling necessity to maintain an anti- inflationary economic strategy. To abandon that strategy would be to condemn the Australian economy to much greater travail than it presently experiences. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not put this Budget together in isolation from the views expressed to us by different sections of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> We have endeavoured to structure personal taxation relief in a way which meets the reasonable aspirations of the average Australian wage earner. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been aware that the level of taxation, particularly for the PAYE taxpayer, influences wage and salary claims. </PARA>
<PARA> In a very real sense we believe the taxation and other family assistance provided by this Budget provides a basis for the exercise of wage restraint across the broad spectrum of the Australian workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> If this restraint can be achieved, a major blow will have been struck for the cause of economic recovery in Australia and many jobs will be saved in the process. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Budget to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In his Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Howard) made reference to a number of initiatives in the social security area. I should like to expand upon some of the points he covered and give the Senate a more detailed account of what this Budget has achieved in terms of the Government's social welfare objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this year's Budget the Government has allocated $11,983m for social security pensions and benefits, other welfare programs and services and housing programs administered by the Department of Social Security. During the year the Department has acquired important new functions relating to housing, and the allocation for these programs in 1982-83 is $512m, an increase of 31.6 per cent over last year's expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of more traditional social security and welfare programs, spending has increased from $9,997m to an estimated $11,471m, an increase of 14.7 per cent. However, just as the apparent increase in expenditure that I announced last year was slightly reduced effectively by an extra pension pay-day that had to be accounted for, so this year's figure is increased. This means that the effective rate of increase in social welfare spending is some 18 per cent. I have a table illustrating this, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. While this is a larger increase than we have seen in the welfare areas in recent years, in terms of the assistance that it will provide I believe it is an increase that represents particularly good value for money. This is because many of the initiatives included in this year's welfare Budget are designed as incentives to welfare recipients to improve their own position and so become less dependent on government for direct assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Budget provides valuable benefits to many groups who are clients of my Department. We have taken significant steps to improve our total package of assistance for Australian families. We have moved to improve the financial position of many age penioners. We have provided additional help for many unemployed people and have provided greater opportunities for them to supplement their benefits through part-time work. We have developed new schemes of assistance for the disabled. We have also introduced measures in the field of housing that will be of benefit both to individual home-buyers and, through increased activity, to the housing industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go into detail in each of these areas I should like to say something about the overall strategy that the Government has adopted in framing this year' s Budget. Decisions we have taken in this Budget complement the important measure adopted by the Fraser Government in 1976, to automatically protect most pensioners and beneficiaries who receive the basic rate of pension against inflation, by twice-yearly adjustments in pension rates linked to consumer price index increases. </PARA>
<PARA> These automatic increases are the best indication that Australian pensioners could have of the Government's continuing concern for those people in Australia who have nothing to live on except the pension or benefit they receive from the social welfare system. Because those changes have been made automatic it is easy to overlook the fact that they are an important and costly commitment. The November 1982 and the May 1983 increases will cost about $771m in a full year. Indeed, the provision we have had to make for indexation accounts for some 40 per cent of this year's increase. That is a substantial basic commitment when one is beginning to shape a Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other areas of increase too, that could not be avoided; such as expected increases in the number of welfare beneficiaries. These, and other increases already built into the system, account for over 30 per cent more of the overall increase. So, in total we were committed to an extra expenditure of more than $1.3 billion before we began to look at any new policy initiatives-and that $1.3 billion accounts for some 75 per cent of our expenditure increase. Given this, our aim has been to spend the funds we felt able to allocate for new initiatives in a way that would alleviate the particularly pressing problems in the welfare system and would also give taxpayers good value for the extra dollars we proposed to spend. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware that there are some areas falling within the scope of the welfare system in which inflation has caused special problems for particular groups of people. Many of the initiatives we have adopted this year are aimed at alleviating these problems. They will also, as I have already mentioned, provide greater incentives for people to improve their own positions and become less dependent on government. </PARA>
<PARA>Help for Families</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In developing our package of assistance for families we have had in mind the additional costs that all parents undertake in bringing up children, and the particularly harsh impact of inflation on families with low incomes. To help in meeting these extra costs we have decided to increase the rate of family allowance by 50 per cent for the first and second children in a family from October 1982. This will bring family allowance for the first child to $22.80 a month and for the second child to $32.55 a month. This increase, which is part of the Government's tax relief measures in this Budget, will cost some $250m in 1982-83 and will consolidate the increases for third and subsequent children we introduced in last year's Budget. While it will be of particular benefit to the 1.6 million families in Australia who have one or two children, all 2.1 million families with children will gain. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this general assistance for families, we will introduce, from May 1983, a tax-free family income supplement for low income families, apart from pensioners and beneficiaries, of up to $10 a week for each dependent child. This not only reflects our recognition of the particular cost burden borne by low income families who are bringing up children but also helps to avoid the unfair and clearly undesirable situation in which an unemployment beneficiary can be better off financially than a person in similar family circumstances who is in employment, but earning low wages. The income limit for this supplement will be closely linked to the income test for health care cards. However, full details of the new arrangements will be announced well before the implementation date, which has been set in May 1983. The Government is anxious to get this new scheme of assistance operating as soon as possible and has settled on May as the earliest date by which the necessary administrative action to introduce a completely new benefit can be completed. Because the family income supplement is a completely new benefit aimed at assisting low income families who are mainly in employment, the Government will monitor it closely to ensure that it meets its objective of relieving hardship among those families who are not pensioners or beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Low income families will also be assisted by a rise in the qualifying limits for health care cards, which as a result of CPI-linked increases and adjustments to the income test for unemployment benefit, to which they are linked, will go up from November to $184 a week for a married couple without children plus $20 for each child in the family. Holders of health care cards will be able to get certain pharmaceutical items at concessional rates from 1 January 1983 under the new scheme announced by the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton). There will also be changes in the rates and income tests for certain education and living allowances, details of which will be announced by the appropriate Ministers, but parents who receive allowances for children under the Secondary Allowances Scheme and related schemes will not also be able to get family income supplement for the same child. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been widespread concern recently about the growth in the number of sole parent families in Australia. There has also been particular concern about the growth in the number of such families receiving income support from the Commonwealth. On the other hand, there is no doubt that some sole parent families are among the most needy of all families in the Australian community. In shaping its policy of assistance to families the Government has kept these concerns in mind and has sought to strike a balance which recognises the particular problems faced by sole parents but, as far as possible, avoids creating further financial incentives for separation and reduces disincentives for forming new and lasting relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> The increases in family allowance, the introduction of the family income supplement and the adjustments in personal income tax announced by the Treasurer will have a significant impact on the disposable income of many Australian families. I have a number of tables detailing the gains for families in various circumstances, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. Tables 1 to 12 show, in particular, the impact of our proposals on single income families, two income families and sole parent pensioners. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Government has also taken the opportunity to remove two unintended anomalies in the treatment of sole parent pensioners and beneficiaries. If supporting parent beneficiaries get maintenance of more than $6 a week for a child that money will, from February 1983, be treated as the parent's own income for income test purposes. This will bring the treatment of maintenance for the children of supporting parent beneficiaries into line with that applying to widow pensioners. From November 1982 it will be no longer possible for a supporting parent beneficiary to be regarded as a dependant of another person for the purpose of any payment of pension, benefit or allowance, although existing beneficiaries will be exempted from the effect of the change. In addition, existing provisions in the Social Security Act concerning the requirement to take reasonable steps to pursue maintenance action will be reactivated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Children's Services</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government also proposes to develop a rationalised and extended program of children's services. To this end there will be an increase of almost 50 per cent in funding for child care services under the Children's Services Program for 1982-83 from an expenditure of $47.56m in 1981-82 to $70.04m. Under the program the States and the Northern Territory will also receive $33.09m as a contribution to pre-school education. In future not less than 75 per cent of funds under the Childrens Services Program, apart from the pre-school grants, will be spent on 'mainstream' services-that is, day care services for young children. The Budget allocation for the 1982-83 year will, broadly speaking, enable the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> Continue to support existing services and, where necessary, increase grants to maintain their viability;</PARA>
<PARA> Direct additional assistance to those people in the community who need it most, through revised funding arrangements for day care services-$6.86m has been specifically earmarked for this purpose;</PARA>
<PARA> Carry out a pilot testing of the feasibility of providing a subsidy to enable the children of parents with modest incomes to attend commercial child care centres-$200,000 has been allocated for this in 1982-83;</PARA>
<PARA> Fund new projects to meet high priority needs for children's services-$5m has been specially set aside for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The revised funding arrangements for day care will ensure that economically needy families are not denied access to care because they cannot afford to pay the fees. The major aspects of the new funding package are:</PARA>
<PARA> There will be an increase in the operational support grant for family day care schemes to $10 per week per equivalent full time child. This new rate will represent an approximate overall increase of 33.3 per cent over the amounts payable under the existing formula and will be paid from 1 July 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> A new fee rebating arrangement for economically needy users will be introduced. This will replace existing special need arrangements where appropriate, and will provide each service with funds according to the need for fee rebates among its economically needy users. This will be known as the Special Economic Need Subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> New grants will be introduced to assist children with particular development and cultural needs. These will be known as supplementary services grants. </PARA>
<PARA>Housing Assistance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Another area where we have recognised the adverse impact of inflation is in housing. To tackle some of the problems here, we have increased our commitment to direct assistance to home buyers and improved funding arrangements for welfare housing. Our housing initiatives not only will provide significant additional assistance for families in need but also will serve to boost activity and employment in the housing industry. The new arrangements the Treasurer has announced for taxation relief in respect of mortgage interest payments will be a significant measure to assist Australian home buyers and will extend the assistance already provided through the housing package announced in March this year. Funding for the various components of that package in the 1982-83 Budget is as follows: A total of $147m has been allocated to meet commitments under the Homes Savings Grant Scheme and under the new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme which has replaced it. This compares with expenditure of $114.6m in 1981-82. $ 20m has been allocated for distribution to the States to fund the new mortgage and rent relief scheme which will help low income families who face severe financial difficulty with their mortgage or rent payments. The tax rebate for first home buyers announced in March is expected to cost some $100m in 1982-83, although in a full year of operation it will cost some $230m. There has also been an increase of 27 per cent in direct funding to the States and Northern Territory for welfare housing, with specific allocations earmarked for the high priority areas of housing for pensioners and Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these increases in funding, the money available for the family crisis accommodation program, which provides short term emergency accommodation for families, has been doubled to $4m for 1982-83. A total of $6.7m has also been allocated in 1982-83 to subsidise new and existing services for homeless people under the Homeless Persons Assistance Program. Of this total, $3m has been earmarked for new capital projects. In addition, from 1 October 1982, the subsidy paid to funded organisations for food and accommodation costs will increase to $1.35 a person a day and the subsidy for a meal provided to a homeless person who does not stay overnight will rise to 45c. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Pensioners</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Adjustments to the pension system in conjunction with the adjustments to the income tax system announced by the Treasurer will benefit invalid pensioners, widow pensioners and supporting parent beneficiaries, as well as age pensioners. Tables 11 to 16 of the tables I referred to earlier show the impact of these adjustments on the disposable incomes of pensioners in different circumstances. Retired people on fixed incomes have been among the groups hardest hit by inflation in recent years, and many have suffered a significant erosion of their living standards. We have made a number of adjustments to the pension and benefits system designed to improve the position of such people, and also to act as an incentive for people who want to improve their position by savings or by casual employment. We have therefore liberalised the income test, both for the basic pension and for fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> From November 1982 single pensioners will be able to have $30 of private income a week without affecting their entitlement to a full pension. Couples may have $ 50 a week. This compares with current rates of $20 a week for single people and $34.50 for couples. The Government has also decided to increase the income limit for pensioner health benefits to $54 a week for a single pensioner and $90 a week for married couples to take effect from November 1982. A new uniform increased limit of $20 for each dependent child in a family, on top of the base limits, is also to apply. The additional income limits for children currently vary between $11 and $17 a week. Pensioners who qualify for a pensioner health benefit card are entitled to a range of Commonwealth concessions, the most important being free medical and hospital treatment, free pharmaceuticals and telephone rental concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was concerned that a number of pensioners had lost entitlement to fringe benefits, perhaps through no action of their own, because their incomes had risen above the limits set in 1979. It was also concerned that others might have placed themselves at a disadvantage by arranging their financial affairs so as to keep their incomes below the current limits and qualify for a card. The increase in the income limits should help people in both these categories. The higher limits will also apply to eligibility for pensioner funeral benefits. In addition, all pensioners, including all supporting parent beneficiaries and people over 70 who get an income-test-free pension who are not eligible for fringe benefits, will be able to get pharmaceuticals at a new concessional rate of $2 under the proposed new three-tiered pharmaceutical benefits scheme announced by the Minister for Health. A further small but important change is that from November 1982 wife pensioners resident overseas may qualify for a widow's pension without having to return to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Supplementary Assistance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to increase the maximum rate of supplementary assistance by a further $2. It will go up to $10 a week from 4 November 1982. Pensioners and long term sickness beneficiaries paying private rents above $26 a week and with private income below $16 a week will gain from this change. At the same time, to ensure that pensioners do not suffer any loss of entitlement to a pension of supplementary assistance, rent subsidies paid to private tenants by State public housing authorities will be excluded from the definition of income for pension and benefit income tests purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>Increased Subsidies for Services for the Aged</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> We have also extended our assistance for aged people by increasing the money available for subsidies for accommodation for elderly people and services for old people living at home. Funds available in 1982-83 for capital grants under the aged or disabled persons accommodation program have been increased by more than 46 per cent. In 1982-83 $83m will be available compared with expenditure of $56.7m in 1981-82. This includes an additional allocation of $18m to expand the program in 1982-83, the last year of the current three year funding period. The additional allocation will effectively allow the approval of approximately 100 new projects. Funding of $87m for 1983-84 under this program has also been approved. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act the maximum building grant has been increased to $14,000 for each single unit or person housed and $16,240 for double units. Under the Aged or Disabled Persons Hostels Act the maximum grant is now $21,000 per person housed. Both changes apply to contracts entered into on or after 1 July 1982. Subsidies for land components, furniture and so on remain unchanged. The subsidy paid to organisations caring for frail aged people in approved hostels will be increased to $30 a week for each eligible person from 6 July 1982. This is an increase of 50 per cent on the present level, or 100 per cent since October 1980 when the rate was last increased from $15 to $20 . It will help to ensure that a high standard of care continues to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA>Help for the Unemployed</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In its overall Budget strategy, the Government has been concerned to introduce measures that will improve the employment prospects for many Australians. However, we are aware that unemployed people, and particularly those who are unemployed for long periods, have special difficulties. We have taken steps to help them by a series of initiatives that will raise the level of payments for many unemployment beneficiaries and increase the scope for them to obtain additional income and valuable work experience through casual employment. From November 1982, single unemployed people aged 18 years and over who have no dependants will get a rise of $6.30 per week in their benefit, bringing their weekly rate to $64.40. Single unemployed people and sickness beneficiaries aged 16 and 17 years will also get a rise. They will get an extra $4, giving them a total of $40 a week. At the same time, the regular automatic adjustments for CPI increases will mean a rise in the maximum single and married rates of benefits by $3.10 for a single person and $5.20 for a married couple. The new rates will be $77.25 a week for single people over 18 with dependants and $128.80 for a couple. </PARA>
<PARA> To encourage unemployed people to take advantage of opportunities to earn extra income and gain job experience by casual work, they will also be allowed to earn more without losing their benefit. This will apply to people receiving sickness benefit as well as to the unemployed. The more generous income test will mean that everyone who receives unemployment or sickness benefit will be able to have $10 a week of private income without affecting their rate of benefit. The amount allowed currently is $3 a week for single people under 18 and $6 for everyone else. People who have more than $10 a week private income will lose 50c benefit for every $1 of extra income up to an income limit of $60. This represents a substantial increase in the amount of extra income that can be earned before the benefit is reduced by $1 for every $1 of income. At present the upper limit is only $40 for single people under 18 years and $50 for others. </PARA>
<PARA> Tables 17 to 22 of the tables I referred to earlier show the impact of welfare initiatives in this Budget on the assistance received by unemployment and sickness beneficiaries in different circumstances with different levels of income. The Government is also specially concerned about young Australians who are homeless because of family breakdown or violent family relationships or for other reasons. Many of these young people are also unemployed and have particular difficulties in finding suitable accommodation. Long term measures to help in this area will be considered in the light of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare's recent report on the problems of homeless youth, and in the light of the final evaluation of the Youth Services Scheme. However, as an interim measure, $300,000 has been allocated in 1982-83 to help non-profit organisations provide accommodation or other assistance for homeless single people under 18 years of age who receive unemployment, sickness or special benefit. The Government hopes that an additional effort in this area will help to prevent many young people from falling into a pattern of homelessness and chronic poverty. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Disabled People</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government's wish to encourage people to help themselves by finding employment is also reflected in its proposals for assistance to disabled people. Our initiatives in this area have a basic orientation towards helping people to get into employment; that is both sound in economic terms and reflects the wishes of disabled people themselves-particularly as they were conveyed to the Government during the International Year of Disabled Persons in 1981. At the same time there are initiatives in this Budget that will be of assistance to all disabled people, whether in terms of improving their financial position or increasing the services available to them. Invalid pensioners, for example, will benefit directly from the package of adjustments to the pensions system which I outlined when speaking of our initiatives to help aged people. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we have introduced a series of measures that will be of particular assistance to disabled people who are in the work force or who want to work. From April 1983 a mobility allowance of $10 a week will be introduced for severely handicapped people who are in employment or undertaking vocational training, and who are unable to use public transport to travel to their work or training because of their disability. This benefit, which will cost some $18.2m in a full year, will be free of any income test or income tax. It will not, however, be available to those receiving the benefit of sales tax exemptions on new vehicles-in other words, it is an alternative to that benefit. The new allowance recognises the additional travel costs incurred by disabled people who undertake employment or vocational training. The Government has decided to move as quickly as possible in this area to meet pressing needs, but it will keep the scheme under review to make sure it is effective in its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> On a related front, we have also decided to carry out a pilot study to test alternative modes of attendant care assistance. Additional funds have been earmarked for this purpose, and $100,000 will be available in 1982-83. From March 1983, a new form of income maintenance payment will be introduced for people who undertake a Commonwealth rehabilitation program and who otherwise would be eligible for another social security pension or benefit. The new ' rehabilitation allowance' will be at the same rates and under the same conditions as invalid pension-that is, income-tested, but income tax free and attracting the same fringe benefits. It may be paid during the rehabilitation program and for up to six months afterwards. The plans I announced in June for the extension and development of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service are also to be set in train during 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> During the International Year of the Disabled Persons the Government also had put forward its views of numerous invalid pensioners who feel that existing invalid pension arrangements prevent them attempting to take up employment. The Government wishes to give as much help as possible to invalid pensioners who feel able to make the transfer to open employment. A major concern is the loss of pensioner health benefits. To meet this concern we have decided to grant health care cards to people who give up an invalid pension or sheltered employment allowance to take up open employment. The card will last for 12 months and will not be subject to an income test. The Health Insurance Act will be amended to enable this provision to be introduced from 1 January 1983. This decision should improve incentives for invalid pensioners and people in sheltered employment to attempt to enter, or to re-enter, the open work force. It will also protect them against any above average health costs during the period of adjusting to employment. As health care card holders they will be eligible for free medical and hospital treatment. They will also qualify for concessional charges for pharmaceuticals, because the Government has decided to introduce a concessional $2 rate of contribution for health care card holders under its proposed three-tiered pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Their other major concern is that, should their efforts to retain employment be unsuccessful because of their disability, the very fact of having made the effort might disqualify them from regaining their pension. Therefore as a further means of encouraging invalid pensioners to take up employment where possible, the Director-General of Social Security will be arranging for them to be reconsidered for a pension immediately if they have to give up work within 12 months. In some cases the pension will be granted again without the need for a medical review, and in others they will be given priority in arranging such a review. From November 1982 the incentive allowance paid to people in sheltered employment will be increased to $10 a week. In addition, from February 1983, eligibility for incentive allowance will be extended to invalid pensioners undertaking activity therapy and adult training centre programs under the Handicapped Persons Welfare Program. In all the above cases the incentive allowance-unlike the supplementary assistance which it replaces- will be paid regardless of the income a person receives or rent paid. These measures remove the anomalies that previously existed in the treatment of handicapped people attending these different categories of special services. Another change will affect people who get a sheltered employment allowance. Currently they enjoy a more liberal income test for fringe benefits, particularly if they are single. It is not proposed to increase the current income limit for single people, which at $68 a week will still be $14 higher than the general limit proposed. However, for married people the income limit will increase from $73 to $90, the same as for other married pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> To improve incentives for invalid pensioners to participate in activity therapy and adult training centres, the higher income limit of $68 a week for fringe benefits will also apply, from November 1982, to single invalid pensioners participating in the program of such centres. Families with a severely handicapped child who is cared for at home will be assisted by an increase in handicapped child's allowance by $12 a month to $85 a month from November 1982. Increased funds are to be provided to subsidise building projects under the handicapped persons welfare program, which makes grants to non-profit organisations providing prescribed services for disabled people such as training , activity therapy, sheltered employment and associated residential accommodation. Details are provided in my news release of 11 August 1982. The increases mean that, during the financial years 1982-83 and 1983-84, some $37m will be available to subsidise capital projects, of which about $21m will be earmarked for entirely new projects. In addition there will be a new provision for new services not requiring building subsidies. An amount of $500,000 will be available for this in 1982-83. The money available for funding recurrent expenditure such as salaries, rent, equipment, minor works and the payment of handicapped children's benefit and for upgrading services provided under the program has also been increased. </PARA>
<PARA> To come to a conclusion, in summary our welfare budget for 1982-83 has addressed many areas of need within the welfare system, particularly those that have been exacerbated in recent years by the effects of inflation. Addressing these problems has meant that the total expenditure in the welfare area for 1982 -83-and by that I refer to the welfare area administered by my Department, and not to the very large additional programs in the veterans' affairs area-will be close to $12 billion. Some will inevitably see this as inadequate; others will see it as extravagant. At the beginning of this statement I provided figures showing how the increase in total estimated expenditure for 1982-83 is made up. However, in looking at the total size of the welfare budget it should be borne in mind that $1,360m for family allowances, which shows up as a welfare expense, could more correctly be presented as a reduction in taxation for families with children. Like the dependent spouse rebate and the former dependent child tax rebates, family allowances provide an offset to tax in recognition of the lower capacity to pay tax of taxpayers with dependants. For this reason, the Government decided to increase the rates of family allowances for the first and second child this year as part of its review of the personal income tax system. The cost of this initiative-$250m in 1982-83-is a substantial component of the overall increase in expenditure in the welfare area this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we have spent the additional funds allocated to welfare wisely- on initiatives that, as well as being on a sound welfare basis, have many spin- off benefits in encouraging people to do more to help themselves, providing incentives for pensioners and beneficiaries to make better use of their savings, and providing a significant boost to the housing industry. I hope this Budget will be welcomed as a constructive attempt to come to grips with the problems our community faces in 1982. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a long and detailed statement in an extra long and detailed Budget. Of course, the Opposition has had little opportunity to examine the fine details of either the statement or Budget. However, I believe that some comments are worth making about the welfare budget which Senator Chaney has just spoken about, if only to put some things into perspective and to take off some of the gloss that Senator Chaney vigorously rubbed on to it. I must say, as I always do, I believe, that there are some things in welfare expenditure in this Budget which we shall welcome. There are some things which we might perhaps welcome. There are some increases which we believe are inadequate, and certainly many of them are very much delayed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth while saying that the total spending, taking into account, as Senator Chaney said, the additional pay day in 1981-82, is to increase by some 18 per cent. A large part of this increase-some 30 per cent-can be attributed to the parlous unemployment situation, and the figures and estimates in the Budget for future anticipated payment on unemployment are, to say the least, rubbery-to use an expression which has been used in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Lynch said it. I have said it every year, and perhaps I shall demonstrate to you, Senator Teague-a very slow learner, I know-why I suggest that they are rubbery. I am not blaming Senator Chaney for them. I am aware that they come from the Treasury and the Department of Finance. The Budget Papers estimate that next year there will be an average of 395,000 people on unemployment benefit. The average this year was 332,000. These figures were obviously drawn up some months ago, because already at the moment-this month- there are 405,000 people on unemployment benefit. The Budget itself anticipates, and predicts in a very gloomy way, an increase this year in the number of unemployed. In fact, we estimate that there has been an under estimation of $ 200m in this Budget for unemployment benefits. That is not a new occurrence. It has occurred frequently since 1975. If Senator Teague bothers to go back and look at the predictions we made in the past, he will see that we were right about it then and we are even more right about it this time. The figures are rubbery, and I think that even the honourable senator will believe they are rubbery when he sees them.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Never, and I suggest that the honourable senator go back and have a look. The longest part of the increase-some 40 per cent-is for automatic pension rises, which only compensates for inflation and only compensates with a lag. In this context it is worth while noting that this year the single pension as proportion of average weekly earnings will fall to about 22 per cent or below . In 1975 the figure was 24.5 per cent, and considerable increases would have been necessary to make up for that. Many other payments still remain behind wages, behind inflation, or behind both, because they have been excluded from the indexation provisions as they have been before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The increases in family allowances for first and second children are welcomed. The increases will bring these payments into line with those for other children, and they are increases which have been advocated by people on this side of the House-indeed from both sides of the House-for many years. I think it is worth pointing out that these increases fail to restore the real values that applied at June 1976. A shortfall of some 18 per cent remains, at a significant cost of something like $10 a month for the two-child family. The increases fail by an even greater margin to restore the real assistance for children that prevailed in 1975-76, when we had a tax rebate system combined with a child endowment system. </PARA>

The total expenditure shortfall in 1982-83, compared with a full indexation regime, will be some $396m . I point out that the higher benefits will accrue only for nine months of this year and will be introduced later this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was interested in the final paragraphs of Senator Chaney's statement where he referred to family allowances. He said that they should be more correctly presented as a reduction in taxation for families with children and should be considered in the taxation side of the Budget. It is interesting that over the years the Government, when trying to demonstrate itself as generous in the welfare area, always emphasised increased family allowance payments as a part of the welfare budget. They were emphasised as being a great increase in welfare expenditure in this community. Now, when Senator Chaney apparently feels under some pressure because of the size of his welfare budget-he should not-he tries to placate those critics by saying that such payments should be in the taxation section and considered as part of the tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes the family income supplement. Indeed, we have advocated such a measure for some years. I am sure that some people will remember, particularly Senator Walters, attacking a similar proposal put forward by the Opposition in the 1980 election campaign. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, if Senator Martyr attacked that proposal he had better attack this one. We will be interested to hear whether he does. Of course, he might have more reason to attack this one; it is far less generous than anything that has been suggested in the past. The payment of $3.5m in 1982-83, starting in May, will not do a great deal for those low income families in the community who are now below the poverty line. Those people are in considerable difficulty now, as has been admitted by Senator Chaney. May is a long way off. It is probably far enough away-if the Government has the opportunity to implement the proposal in May-for the Government to forget about it and promise it for next November or the November after that, as has been the case with so many other initiatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that the Government's conversion to the concept of a family income supplement for those low income families with children is in fact extended. I think it is unfortunate that the limits of this payment do not rise with increases in family size. As the family size increases for these groups in the community they become relatively worse off compared with the poverty line, and those with very large families will benefit partially from this. The cut-off points for payments under the proposed scheme are, for those people with one child, $204; with two children, $224; three children, $244; four children, $264; and five children, $285. I recommend that some members of the Government compare that with the poverty lines-whether Henderson's poverty line or the other poverty lines which have recently been suggested-and see what that does. The combination of the income test and taxation on these families will result in massive effective marginal tax rates at the cut-off points. A figure of something like 80 per cent will generally apply for some groups. Some may suggest that this will be a particular disincentive for wives in low income families to seek work. Some, such as Senator Martyr, will welcome that; others may not. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that the Government continues to fail to recognise the very real difficulties facing the unemployed, particularly the single young employed, in the community, in view of the fact that the Budget itself and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) paint such a gloomy picture for employment in the next 12 months. One can say only that the increase in the unemployment benefit for the under 18-year -olds from $36 a week to $40 a week is pitiful and derisory. There is no recognition of the increased costs and problems faced by the unemployed in this area who have to leave home to seek work, particularly those from rural areas who have to go to the cities to seek work. There is no recognition of increased costs in recent years, particularly in rent, but in the general cost of living, and I think it is really very disappointing that this increase is so small. The same goes for the failure to index the unemployment benefit for single people, not only the young unemployed but also the increasing number of unemployed who are 40 years of age or more and who have been displaced from the work force because of changing technology or because their skills are no longer appropriate . </PARA>
<PARA> I express my further disappointment at the language and the attitude demonstrated in the Budget concerning what Senator Chaney and his colleagues obviously see as the problem of the single parent. The remarks in the statement indicate that the Government was very careful to make sure it did not give financial incentives for women to leave home. The Government does not recognise the realities of the situation. With the predicted harshness of the application of the maintenance provisions, there is no suggestion that these women will receive any further assistance to get maintenance than they do now. I accept that they should receive maintenance where it is due to them. I believe this obsession with the idea that single parents, particularly deserted wives, are leaving home because of the financial incentives available to them does not reflect the realities of the situation. I do not believe any honourable senator on either side of this House can look at that situation and not be concerned. Not even Senator Walters, although from some of her statements I dare say not many single parents come to see her, can really look at those words and not be concerned that the Government intends to take that attitude to this group in the community which has consistently remained far below the poverty line. This group is amongst the most harshly treated in our community and their children must suffer the long term social consequences of the situation in which they find themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has announced the Government has decided to review the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme. This review will commence immediately and will enable the Government to examine the objectives of the scheme and options for ensuring that it is not subject to abuse. The Government's objective in introducing the scheme was to assist in achieving equality in the price of petroleum products between city and country locations. Under present arrangements the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority determines maximum justified wholesale prices for each of the major oil companies. These comprise a base wholesale price, the capital city price, plus a maximum justified freight differential for various country locations. The operation of the freight subsidy scheme ensures that maximum wholesale prices in country areas are not more than 0.44c per litre above the maximum capital city prices. Despite the freight subsidy scheme variations exist between retail prices for petroleum products in various localities. While the scheme has ensured that freight is not a significant cause of these variations, there are other factors at work including differences in state fuel taxes, discounting and differences in re-seller margins between capital city and country areas, reflecting differences in throughput volumes and the degree of competition. These factors will of course be taken into consideration in the review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the scheme was introduced the Government has become concerned that it is being abused by certain parties. Investigations have led to some successful prosecutions for fraudulent claims, while there have been allegations that the scheme is being manipulated in other ways by certain distributors for gain. The Government has also become concerned at the escalating costs of the scheme, which rose to $147m in 1981-82 compared with a Budget estimate of $129m for that year. As the Treasurer has also announced, pending the outcome of the review, the scheme will be amended to subsidise freight costs in excess of 1c per litre, instead of the 0.44c per litre which previously applied. Although this will mean a slight rise in the freight component paid by consumers, the scheme will continue to make a significant contribution to reducing freight differentials. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> Mr President, as a result of Government decisions announced tonight and as a result, too, of the guidelines decisions that I announced last June, there will be considerable benefits to students both at the secondary and tertiary level. These benefits are generous and wide-ranging. For example: All tertiary and secondary student allowances are to increase; all means tests are to be eased; there are increased allowances for Aboriginals and children from isolated areas; there is strong financial support for the school to work programs; funds are to be provided for new government and non-government schools for students in the Australian Capital Territory; importantly, a loan scheme is to be introduced for tertiary students-with subsidised interest rates and generous loan repayment terms. In all, Commonwealth spending on education in 1982-83 will reach a new high of $3,792m. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the innovative measures in this year's Budget is the proposed Student Loans Scheme. Eligible students will be able to borrow up to $1,000 per annum to a maximum of $8,000. In addition to guaranteeing each loan, the Government will subsidise by 5 per cent the interest rate charged by the banks. Currently, a student would be required to pay interest at 9.5 per cent-that is the subsidised rate. The loan repayment terms are generous. Students will not be required to make repayments while studying or for two years after completing or discontinuing their full time studies. Up to 10 years will be allowed for complete repayments. This scheme is to be administered in co-operation with the banks and necessary legislation will be introduced during this session. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Government has also announced substantial increases in tertiary allowances. Under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, the maximum allowances are to be increased by 20 per cent to $2,010 per annum, at the home rate, and $3,100 per annum, at the independent and away from home rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Living allowances for students holding Commonwealth post-graduate awards are raised by nearly 50 per cent to $6,850 per annum. The number of new post- graduate awards will be increased from 800 to 900 per annum. At the secondary level, many more parents of students in the last two years of school, years 11 and 12, will be able to qualify for secondary allowances which have been increased by 20 per cent to a maximum of $871 per annum. The means test has been relaxed by 44 per cent. It is estimated that approximately 33,500 students and their parents should now benefit from the Secondary Allowance Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Aboriginal Secondary Grants Scheme and under the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme, living and boarding allowances will rise by 11 per cent. Similarly, for parents of children isolated from normal school facilities, the means-test-free boarding and second-home allowances will be increased by 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The range of increased benefits are estimated to cost an additional $60m, thus raising overall expenditure to $303m in the first full year of operation. We are looking to bring new emphasis to post-arrival programs and services for migrants . This follows a review by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. There will be some earmarking of particular purpose technical and further education funds and a supplementary provision of $1.2m for advanced English language instruction for migrants; culture awareness and language courses in tertiary institutions are allocated $200,000. Similarly, programs at school level in English as a second language will be supplemented by $1.6m in 1983 to meet the increased requirements for services. Within existing allocations the Special Education Program of the Commonwealth Schools Commission is to be extended to include handicapped children below school age.</PARA>
<PARA> The measures that I have described tonight are but a few of the positive steps that the Government has taken to ensure that young people have the opportunity to receive a sound education. The Government has endeavoured to address seriously those areas of disadvantage and to provide programs that are both appropriate and relevant. The comprehensive upgrading of student grants backed by a subsidised loans scheme is evidence of our wish to encourage more students to take advantage of the wide range of educational opportunities of Australia. I commend the attention of honourable senators to the more detailed statements I have available. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the two detailed statements which I have here. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>THE BUDGET AND EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA>Budget Statement by Senator the Hon. Peter Baume, Minister for Education, 17 August 1982</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this statement is to give particulars of further important new measures and major changes to be introduced in the Government's education programs: they include a very significant upgrading of student assistance programs at an additional cost of nearly $60m, and the proposed introduction in 1983 of a tertiary student loans scheme. I have already announced in the guidelines to the Education Commissions for 1983 programs (21 June 1982), the provision of $2,986m for schools and tertiary education institutions, an increase in real terms of $45m over calendar year 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The combined effect of decisions taken in the immediate Budget context, together with increases in Commission programs announced in June, are expected in this financial year to result in total direct outlays on education of $3,792m , a rise of 13.5 per cent over 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest part of the expenditures just mentioned is in the form of grants to the States for the full support of universities and CAEs, to top up State Government programs for their schools and TAFE programs, and to provide substantial support to non-government schools on a needs basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Later decisions require some revision to the June guidelines including several increases in the financial allocations announced at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The revised guidelines now provide for total Commonwealth expenditure on schools and tertiary education of $2,991m (in 1982 outturn prices) an increase in real terms of nearly $50m or 1.7 per cent over 1982, as follows:</PARA>

The cost of equipment will be met from allocations already determined. </PARA>
<PARA> Following consideration of the Evaluation of Post-Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants conducted by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs, the Government has decided that funds will be transferred to the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission's programs from other Commonwealth authorities to support language instruction. A further $1.1m will be available for advanced English language instruction for migrants under the particular purpose funds for the TAFE sector. In total, the Commission is asked to allocate 15 per cent of all particular purpose TAFE funds for these courses. An amount of $0.2m will be made available during 1982-83 for the provision of cultural awareness and language courses within tertiary institutions under the Commission's programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Schools</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, as a consequence of decisions on the Evaluation of Post-Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants, the Government will be providing an additional $1.6m in 1983 to the Commonwealth Schools Commission for the New Arrivals element of the English as a Second Language Program: the supplement responds to an increased requirement for services. The Government has also asked the Commission to undertake a comprehensive research and data collection program concerning the English language competence of students from non-English-speaking backgrounds. When the results of a current Commission survey are received, the Government will re-examine the needs of ethnic schools which, under a pilot scheme, are being assisted with annual grants of up to $30 per student. </PARA>
<PARA> The eligibility criteria of the Special Education Program are to be extended to include handicapped children below school age who require early education intervention services. Funds will be provided for this purpose from within existing guidelines allocations. </PARA>
<PARA> There follows a broad range of Budget initiatives amongst which stand out extensive adjustments to existing schemes of student assistance grants, as well as an attractive loans scheme for full-time tertiary students. </PARA>
<PARA>STUDENT ASSISTANCE SCHEMES</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to make increases in allowances under all student assistance schemes for 1983, and to liberalise means tests. The increases will achieve a marked improvement in benefits under Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards, Secondary Allowances and Tertiary Education Assistance and other schemes. As a result of these decisions, overall expenditure on student assistance programs will rise in the first full year of operation by an estimated 24 per cent from $ 245m to $303m. </PARA>
<PARA> The main features of the Government's expanded program of assistance for 1983 are:</PARA>
<PARA> Postgraduate Awards-living allowance to be increased by 48 per cent and 100 additional new awards provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondary Allowances-benefits to be increased by 20 per cent and the means test substantially liberalised. </PARA>
<PARA> Tertiary Education Assistance-living allowances to be increased by 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> All means-tested schemes-means tests to be liberalised by 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of increases and changes in conditions of the various schemes for 1983 are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Tertiary Education Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> Living allowances at the at-home, away-from-home and independent rates will be increased by 20 per cent. The maximum rates will rise to $2,010 p.a. ($1,675 p.a . in 1982) and $3,100 p.a. ($2,583 p.a. in 1982). The marginal adjusted family income (MAFI) which attracts the maximum allowances will be increased by 11 per cent from $11,034 to $12,248. </PARA>
<PARA>Postgraduate Awards</PARA>
<PARA> Two special measures have been applied to Postgraduate Awards as a means of encouraging postgraduate research in universities and colleges of advanced education. The living allowance will rise by 48 per cent from $4,620 to $6,850 per annum and the number of new awards to be offered will be increased from 800 to 900 per annum. A further change is that from 1983, Award holders may receive up to $1,000 a year from an award provided by a tertiary institution and up to $ 5,000 a year from an award provided by the private sector without affecting the allowances under their Commonwealth award (at present the limit is $500). </PARA>
<PARA>Adult Secondary Education Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> Living allowances and the MAFI level will be increased by 11 per cent. The new MAFI level will be $12,248, in line with the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondary Allowances</PARA>
<PARA> Secondary allowances will be increased by 20 per cent and the MAFI level by 44 per cent from $8,482 to $12,248-the same level as for Tertiary Education Assistance. Parents whose adjusted family income does not exceed $12,248 will receive assistance of $871 per annum. These substantial increases will considerably extend the number of families who will be given greater support to maintain their children at school during the final two secondary years (Years 11 and 12). </PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal Secondary Grants</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Aboriginal Secondary Grants Scheme, living and boarding allowances as well as allowances for books and clothing will rise by 11 per cent. In addition, the school and hostel boarding allowances will be amalgamated with the new allowance to be paid at the school rate, the higher of the two existing rates. The maximum benefit will rise from $1,760 p.a. to $1,954 p.a. free of means test . </PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal Study Grants</PARA>
<PARA> Living allowances for Aboriginal Study grants will be increased by 11 per cent. The rate for single students over 18 will be $78 per week free of means test. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Isolated Children</PARA>
<PARA> For parents of children isolated from normal school facilities, the means-test- free boarding and second-home allowances will be increased by 11 per cent. There will also be some rationalisation of the existing Additional Boarding and Special Supplementary Allowances: the two allowances will be amalgamated into one with the maximum allowance being 11 per cent higher (16 per cent in the case of senior secondary students) than the total of the two separate allowances in 1982. The new allowance will be subject to boarding costs and a means test. Parents with incomes not exceeding the new level of $10,200 will be able to qualify for the maximum benefit of $1,537 p.a. in the case of senior secondary students. Substantial concessions in the means test will now be applied to families with more than one student supported under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Table 1 (Attachment A) indicates for both 1982 and 1983 the estimated numbers of students to be assisted and estimated expenditure. Table 2 (Attachment B) lists the new scales of benefits to apply for 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the changes outlined will be to increase estimated expenditure for 1983 on student assistance schemes by $58.5 million. Some 12,000 additional students (7 per cent over 1982) are expected to receive assistance. The changes in benefits and means-test levels will do much to alleviate the burden of costs met by parents and students for full-time education, and will also extend assistance to others who do not at present qualify. A specific aim is that the broadening of support will encourage more students to complete secondary education and by further education and training, equip themselves better for the world of work. The increases are indicative of the Government's continuing commitment to the provision of grants for the support of students. </PARA>
<PARA>LOANS SCHEME FOR TERTIARY STUDENTS</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in co-operation with banks, will sponsor a loans scheme to begin in 1983 as an additional source of support to students in meeting their educational expenses. Legislation which is necessary for the operation of the scheme will be introduced in this Session. </PARA>
<PARA> Students enrolled full time in courses at tertiary institutions will be able to borrow between $500 and $1,000 per year subject to total borrowing of $8,000. To be eligible for a bank loan a student needs to be an Australian citizen or have permanent resident status. All students entitled to assistance under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS), the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme (ASEAS) and the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme (Abstudy) and holders of Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards (CPA) will be eligible to apply for a loan. Other full-time students will be eligible if they meet an income test ( details in supplementary papers). Overall lending limits will be decided by the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to guaranteeing each loan, the Government will subsidise by 5 per cent the interest rate charged by the banks. Currently a student would be required to pay interest at 9.5 per cent. Students will not be required to make repayments while studying and for up to two years after completing or discontinuing their full-time studies to enable them to become established in a job. Up to ten years will be allowed to complete repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has demonstrated its continuing commitment to TEAS and other student assistance schemes. The loans scheme should be welcomed by many students . More details of the scheme will be announced after further discussions with banks, State authorities and institutions. Application forms are expected to be available towards the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA>TRANSITION FROM SCHOOL TO WORK</PARA>
<PARA> The 1982-83 Budget provides $43.3m ($34.4m in 1981-82) for transition programs including education programs for unemployed youth (EPUY). Of this amount $42.0m will be for the States and the Northern Territory, $0.9m for the Australian Capital Territory and $0.4m for national projects and evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Transition from School to Work Program itself, the Commonwealth is providing funds over the five-year period 1980-84 to improve education and training opportunities for young people in the age group 15-19 years who may be experiencing difficulties in making the transition to working life. The Commonwealth's contribution was $16m in 1980, $27.4m in 1981 and is $30m in 1982 . EPUY programs in 1982 cost a further $4.6m. </PARA>
<PARA> We expect the States to continue to maintain their own efforts in transition education. </PARA>
<PARA> In the two and a half years since its introduction the Transition Program has made a substantial contribution to the development of alternative courses and curricula in schools and transition courses in TAFE colleges. It has extended and improved careers guidance and education, and work experience programs and contributed to teacher development relevant to the transition needs of young people. The level of awareness among teachers, parents, employers and local communities about transition objectives and difficulties faced by young people has been heightened. The Program is strengthening the understanding and co- operation between Education and Labour Departments at both Commonwealth and State level. </PARA>
<PARA>CURRICULUM ACTIVITIES</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Curriculum Development Centre itself has been wound down, significant provision is made in the appropriations of the Department of Education for a number of important activities. </PARA>
<PARA> A major continuing commitment is the production of instructional materials for schools in English as a second language for which the budget has been increased to $800,000 in 1982-83. An additional amount of $300,000 is provided to support curriculum projects in areas of national importance especially Aboriginal and multicultural education. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the States have indicated their interest in participating in joint curriculum projects. </PARA>
<PARA>EDUCATIONAL USE OF COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will provide $0.1m in the current financial year towards research into the use of communications technology in education. A program of trials will be commenced which will assist education authorities and institutions in making decisions on educational use of the domestic communications satellite. The satellite will commence operating in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The funds are to match, on a dollar for dollar basis, contributions by the States and the Northern Territory. The joint funding will meet the cost of the trials and administration and evaluation of the program. An advisory committee, including Commonwealth, State and Territory representatives will be established to recommend projects for funding. The aim is to develop a balanced program of trials relevant to all levels of education. </PARA>
<PARA>EDUCATION IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</PARA>
<PARA> Funds being provided for the ACT Schools Authority for government schools and pre-schools will total $107.0m, an increase of 12.5 per cent compared with 1981- 82. An additional $4.2m is being allocated for schools capital works. The funds being provided will allow school services to be extended in the Tuggeranong Valley. In a context where government school enrolments in the ACT have, broadly speaking, stabilised, the level of funds will enable school services to be maintained at the current levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Recurrent funds for ACT non-government schools will total $22.5m in 1982-83 compared with $15.1m in 1981-82. Most of this increase is accounted for by a change in the timing of the payment of grants which has transferred the payment of some funds from 1981-82 into the present financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the meeting of existing commitments under the previous capital aid program, the sum of $1.216m will be provided for capital funding of new non- government schools projects. This compares with $1.13m in 1981-82, and will support the construction of two new schools and expanded facilities in several existing schools. One of the two new schools to be constructed will be a co- educatinal Anglican secondary school. </PARA>
<PARA> Recurrent funds being provided for further education in the ACT will rise by 13 .3 per cent to $24.2m. Expenditure on plant and equipment will be $869,000, an increase of 21.9 per cent. Funding will allow the continued development of the Woden TAFE College, which is now in its second year of operation, and for furnishing a new Central Services building at the Canberra TAFE College. It is expected that enrolments in ACT further education institutions will be approximately 23,300 in 1983 compared with 22,000 in 1982. </PARA>

<PARA>(Including Budget Decisions)</PARA>
<PARA> For 1983, grants totalling $1,876.35m will be provided for tertiary education representing an increase of 0.4 per cent on 1982. All amounts in this statement are expressed in constant 1982 outturn prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The total allocation for tertiary education provision for the Australian National University, the Canberra College of Advanced Education, the Australian Maritime College and non-government teachers colleges. </PARA>
<PARA> Total funds include recurrent grants for universities and colleges of advanced education for 1983 of $1,561.4m previously determined by the Government as part of the triennial arrangements for the 1982-84 triennial as well as $0.25m for other recurrent initiatives indicated below. The capital and equipment funds for all three sectors and recurrent grants for TAFE are provided on an annual basis and these allocations, totalling $314.3m are included in the accompanying table.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to provide $0.2m in the 1982-83 financial year for cultural awareness and ethnic language familiarisation courses within the normal education programs of tertiary institutions for Australian professionals and para-professionals. These funds will be transferred from the Department of Education to the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also has decided that the Commission should pursue with tertiary institutions steps to ensure that multicultural perspectives and components are introduced into tertiary courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission is asked to prepare recommendations on the distribution of these funds in accordance with these guidelines. To enable consideration of these recommendations and passage of the necessary legislation during the Budget Sittings, the Commission is asked to report by 31 August 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The total allocation for higher education for 1983 is $1,699.25m. This represents an increase of 0.4 per cent in real terms over the 1982 allocation.</PARA>
<PARA> Allocations for recurrent programs have been increased to provide additional funds in 1983 and 1984 to meet rising costs of staff superannuation schemes and to reflect the Government's recent decision to provide an extra $150,000 in 1983 for the support of ratings training at the Australian Maritime College. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds for capital programs have been increased by $5.8m representing an increase of 16.7 per cent over the capital funds provided in 1982. These increased funds will enable all commitments arising from on-going capital projects to be met, and will allow $1.6m for the construction of additional student accommodation associated with the provision of ratings training at the Australian Maritime College. The allocation for new capital projects and minor works will be maintained at the same level as for 1982. Grants for equipment programs will also be maintained in 1983 at the 1982 level. The cost of equipment programs for ratings training at the Australian Maritime College will need to be met from this grant. </PARA>
<PARA>Technical and Further Education</PARA>

<PARA> The 1982 capital program for TAFE includes the last instalment of the special ' $50m' program which commenced in 1979. For 1983, the Commonwealth will continue the base program of TAFE capital expenditure at its existing level of $90.7m. In addition, it will fund the first year of a new three-year National Priority Projects Program under which an additional $60m in money terms will be provided to meet specialised industry needs, and to give training opportunities to young people where facilities are lacking. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is asked to put forward recommendations on the expenditure of up to $20m on this special program in 1983. The Commission should take into account , in particular, the provision of facilities to meet needs of industry which are emerging as a result of economic and technological changes, some of which might be met by projects which serve several States. It should also take into account provision for the expansion of vocational education opportunities, particularly for young people, in population centres where appropriate facilities are lacking . </PARA>
<PARA> Recurrent funds for TAFE have been increased by 4.4 per cent in 1983 to $88.3m. In addition to the funds provided to compensate the States for fees foregone, this amount includes $26.4m to assist with the qualitative improvement of TAFE. An amount of $10.1m, the same as for 1982, will be provided for the supplementary equipment program which the Commonwealth introduced last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Following its consideration of the Evaluation of Post-Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs, the Government has decided that priority for the use of particular purpose TAFE funds should be given to advanced English language instruction for specific purposes for migrants, with support provided at the level of 15 per cent of particular purpose TAFE funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The CTEC is asked to discuss the implementation of this decision with the States and report by the end of October on the most appropriate method of giving full effect to this decision within 12 months. To facilitate the implementation of these arrangements, the Government has decided to transfer to the Commission $1.1m in a full year from the Adult Migrant Education Program of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. In preparing its Volume 1 Report for the 1985 -87 triennium, the Commission should note the Government's acceptance of the AIMA proposal in paragraph 5.127 of its Report that, for the next triennium, funds for the above purpose should come from the TAFE general purpose recurrent grants program. </PARA>

<PARA>GUIDELINES FOR THE COMMONWEALTH SCHOOLS COMMISSION-1983</PARA>
<PARA>(Including Budget Decisions)</PARA>
<PARA> The value of programs administered by the Commonwealth Schools Commission is continuing to increase in real terms. In 1983 the increase will be 3.9 per cent. Grants totalling $1,240.8m will be provided, compared with $1,194.3m in 1982. All 1983 program amounts in this statement are on an outturn basis and for the purposes of comparison those for 1982 are expressed in the same price terms. As in the past, recurrent grants for non-government schools and for part-time ethnic schools will be made on a per capita basis with the total allocations being determined by actual enrolments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is asked to prepare recommendations on the detailed allocation of the funds consistent with these guidelines and as set out in the accompanying tables. To enable consideration of these recommendations and passage of the necessary legislation during the Budget Sittings, the Commission is asked to report by 31 August 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>GENERAL RESOURCES PROGRAM</PARA>
<PARA>Government Schools General Recurrent Grants-The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation to increase in real terms general recurrent grants for government schools by 2 per cent or $6.3m. These additional resources, which will be available to each State for general educational purposes in government schools, further underline the Government's commitment to all Australian schools . Although there have been overall decreases in government school enrolments, these additional general recurrent grants will assist States to overcome the financial difficulties which the Commission reported were facing government school systems. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital Grants-As recommended by the Commission, the Government will maintain in real terms the present level of funding for government school buildings. In order to ensure that the Commonwealth's effort is specifically directed to identified areas of need in government schools, the Government has also accepted the Commission's proposal that a new places element be introduced into the Capital Grants Program. The Government asks the Commission to recommend on the size of this new element and appropriate weightings in its recommendations on capital allocations among States. It also asks the Commission to consider and report on the effects of the new element on existing elements within the program . The Government is unable to accept the recommendation that States be given forward commitment arrangements for government schools capital programs. The Commission is asked to follow up the Government's approach to the States and report on the following arrangements in relation to the Commonwealth's capital program for government schools:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the adoption of measures to obtain greater identification of Commonwealth capital funds for government schools, including States advising in advance of proposals for expenditure of Commonwealth funds for the approval of the Commonwealth Minister;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) measures which might be taken to encourage the States to maintain their effort from their own financial resources for government school building programs; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) a joint review, with State and non-government school authorities, of the rationalisation of school building provision, taking into account the implications of changing enrolment patterns within and between government and non-government schools and between schools and TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA>Non-Government Schools General Recurrent Grants-The Government will continue to provide all non-government schools in Australia with a basic grant equal to 20 per cent of the standard cost of educating a student in a government school and additional grants on the basis of need. In accordance with its 1980 election commitments, the additional grants for Group 3 non-government schools, those with greatest need, will be raised in 1983 from 18 to 20 per cent of standard costs. That is, in 1983, the Government will provide per capita grants for non- government schools on the following basis:</PARA>
<PARA> Group 1 Schools: 20 per cent of standard costs</PARA>
<PARA> Group 2 Schools: 30 per cent of standard costs</PARA>
<PARA> Group 3 Schools: 40 per cent of standard costs</PARA>
<PARA> As recommended by the Commission, the Short-Term Emergency Assistance Program for non-government schools is reduced to $0.6 million in 1983 because of significantly reduced demand. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital Grants-The Government will provide the third portion of the $25 million in money terms it promised over three years in the 1980 election to help meet the demand for new student places in non-government schools; $9 million is allocated for this purpose in 1983. However, the Government has not adopted the Commission's recommendation that it authorise the forward commitment of up to 90 per cent of the 1983 level of funds for new places for non-government capital funds for 1984 and 1985. Forward commitment arrangements will continue to apply to the basic level of capital funding for non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA>Special Purpose Programs for Government and Non-Government Schools English as a Second Language Program-The Government has agreed to the Commission's proposal that the provision for transferring any surplus funds from the New Arrivals element to the General Support element of the English as a Second Language Program be discontinued. Following its review of the Evaluation of Post-Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants conducted by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs (AIMA), the Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation for additional funds for the New Arrivals element of the English as a Second Language Program; an additional $1.8 million has therefore been provided to meet the demand for services as a result of the projected increase in newly arrived students. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the Government's decision on the Evaluation of Post-Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants, the Commission is asked to initiate a research program to provide information on the English language competence of students from non-English-speaking backgrounds, to identify factors affecting that competence and to develop methods of assessing the English language proficiency of migrant children. Funds for this research are to be provided from within existing programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is asked to ensure that the funds for the Multicultural Education Program are allocated between community language and other multicultural education activities on an approximately equal basis. The present funding of multicultural projects of national significance should be transferred to the Special Projects Program and should support both a multicultural education and a community languages element. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission should broaden its review of the operations of the Multicultural Education Program to include an evaluation of the impact of the Program on school curricula and programs including:</PARA>
<PARA> an assessment of the development undertaken in multicultural education through Multicultural Education Program funding;</PARA>
<PARA> an evaluation of the impact of these developments;</PARA>
<PARA> an assessment of future community language teaching needs;</PARA>
<PARA> a phased program for multicultural education and community language teaching to be met by recurrent funding to schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not accepted the Commission's recommendation that additional funds be provided for non-dislocation grants to schools systems affected by the new formula for the distribution of funds under the English as a Second Language Program. The per capita grants of up to $30 for ethnic schools will be continued in 1983 and will be considered further following the current survey of needs by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Special Education Program-The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that eligibility criteria for the Special Education Program be altered to enable participation by handicapped children of below school age who require early educational intervention services; appropriate provision will be made in the States Grants (Schools Assistance) legislation. The Commission is asked to recommend on ways of achieving this purpose within the Special Education Program for government and non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> Disadvantaged Schools Program-The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that funds for the Disadvantaged Schools Program be maintained at the present level in real terms. The Government has also agreed to the Commission's recommendation for a further minor transfer in 1983 of funds under the Disadvantaged Schools Program between sectors, consistent with the Commission's revised funding formula. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not agreed to the Commission's recommendation that it introduce a new School Improvement Program in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>Joint Programs Shared between Government and Non-Government Schools The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that the Severely Handicapped Children's Program be increased by 25 per cent or $0.7 million. The Government will provide the same real level of funds for the Professional Development Program for 1983 (including funds for Education Centres) as recommended by the Commission. In addition, to meet the need for more efficient and longer term budgeting in this program, the Government has accepted the Commission's request that it be permitted to enter into forward commitment arrangements with individual Education Centres for 1984 and 1985, up to 70 per cent per annum of the 1983 level. The Commission is asked to report on the operation of the Professional Development Program with a view to ensuring that the full range of schools in the government and non-government sectors have access to the program and, if necessary, negotiate with the States to achieve this end. The Government will not be providing the proposed additional funds for the Country Areas Program in 1983 but it will be maintained in real terms at the 1982 level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will provide some additional funds in 1982, and again in 1983, to enable extended participation by schools in the Australian Capital Territory in the Special Education, Professional Development and Disadvantaged Schools Programs. The Government will not be extending further the range of these programs in 1983 as proposed by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Additional Allowances for Cost Increases in 1982 The Government has reviewed the existing cost adjustment provision for the Commission's 1982 programs. It has decided that some additional funds should be made available beyond present prospective arrangements to cover unanticipated cost increases arising from recent teacher salary determinations. For government school general recurrent grants it has decided to provide an additional $10.4 million. This will meet approximately two-thirds of the estimated salary increases over and above those already provided for in the existing prospective allowance. Having regard to the fact that Commonwealth general recurrent grants constitute only 7 per cent of government school recurrent costs, the Government believes that this additional allocation to the States for 1982 should assist them to maintain resource standards in government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> For non-government schools the additional funds for general recurrent grants will be provided to preserve the Government's 1980 election commitment to pay general recurrent grants to non-government schools at the rates of 20, 30 and 38 per cent of average government school standard costs in 1982. This will significantly assist these schools to cope with the financial problems they are currently experiencing as a result of unexpectedly high salary increases this year. The cost of this additional provision for non-government schools will be $ 25.7 million. The Government will also provide additional funds to supplement fully increases in salary costs in all of the special purpose and joint programs of the Commission for both government and non-government schools. This will require an additional $8.8 million in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> For 1983 the prospective allowance has been determined on the same basis as announced in last year's Guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The following tables set out the funds provided for individual programs in 1983 compared with 1982 in both constant 1983 outturn prices and estimated December 1981 prices, the latter being the price basis of the Commission's recommendations published earlier this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many honourable senators will be aware of the deaths during the recess of Bernie Scanlon and Reg Frost. Bernie died unexpectedly and peacefully at his home in Queanbeyan on 6 August. He joined the Senate staff on 17 August 1970 as an attendant and in October 1974 he was transferred to the Senate Transport Office where he served with distinction until his retirement in August 1980. I, as well as many honourable senators, had the good fortune to know Bernie for a number of years and to greatly appreciate his friendship as well as his willingness to assist in every possible way. Bernie was highly regarded and well liked by all who were associated with him or worked with him in Parliament House and he will be fondly remembered by all who knew him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with you, Mr President, and indeed with all members of the Senate in conveying our sympathy to the relatives and friends of both Bernie Scanlon and Reg Frost. One of the remarkable happenings inside this Parliament is one which I had cause to remark upon before, and that is that it is not only the parliamentarians and their immediate staff who form strong bonds and strong friendships but it is also those who in the wider sphere of attendants and servants of this organisation become closely linked both with us as senators and members and with our families. Those kinds of bonds go well beyond the ordinary service of work and the ordinary dedication. They are, in fact, quite remarkable , almost unique.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bernie Scanlon was in an extraordinary position in this place. It seems that those who become transport officers in the Senate are people who have a total dedication to serve, a cheerfulness and a kind of spirit of friendship that creates not only a service in itself but also a warmth that endears them to the senators and their families. No one could more justify those remarks than Bernie Scanlon. I think we all called him 'friend'. We would have been proud if he returned that compliment, as I think he did. I think we all shared Bernie's grief when he lost his wife in the latter part of his service here. We also shared his joys in his family and in his confiding in us on his son's service to the church in the Marist Order. We learnt later, day by day, of his involvement in local organisations, particularly St Vincent de Paul, and in his bowling club . He was a man who was greatly loved by us. We are all the sadder and the lesser for his passing. I join with you, Mr President, to say to those who were very near and dear to him just how much we miss him and how proud we were to have known him. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us here knew Reg Frost as a very cheerful attendant along the corridors, who carried newspapers to us, who undertook various duties and attended to us. He was very well liked and a very well known identity in this building and elsewhere. Of course, we are also privileged to know his wife Joan who works in the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms. We share your sadness, Mr President, and join with you in expressing our great sympathy to Joan and to his children-Alan, Dennis, Lyn-and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only add again that this parliamentary system works as it does and the two cambers work as they do not so much because of people like you, Mr President , and I but because of the people behind the scenes who do their work so well and so cheerfully as our friends. I sadly acknowledge the loss of these two fine people. </PARA>

I cannot, on a personal basis, say a great deal about Reg Frost. I remember his cheery demeanour and that will be missed. We express our condolences to his family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to say one or two personal things about Bernie Scanlon. It is not an expression I normally use, but I certainly regarded Bernie Scanlon as a mate of mine and I think he was a mate of everybody in the Senate. I will always remember Bernie for his Irish sense of humour-I guess he was pretty Irish in his background-and tolerance. It seemed to me that he was a man totally without malice. I have seen him get very angry with people on occasions and a few minutes later laugh and joke about the whole incident which caused the anger. He was a rare breed of man in the sense that I always had the feeling that he had been around a bit and really knew in a variety of ways what life was all about. That gives a person a great maturity and tolerance of the foibles of other human beings. That was very present in his attitude to and tolerance of everybody else . At a personal level I will miss him very much. Not that I saw so much of him recently, but on the occasions I did see him he always invited my kids to stay with the family. It was an invitation they never accepted, for other reasons. But the invitation was always there and it was a very sincere one. It was a measure of the sort of chap he was that even after he left the Senate he was still making that sort of offer in a quite genuine way. I join with you, Mr President, and the Leader of the Government (Senator Sir John Carrick) in expressing my personal sadness at the passing of a very fine man. I say the same in respect of Reg Frost and express my regrets to their respective families and friends. </PARA>

I can only endorse all the sentiments that have been expressed by the previous speakers.

He was one of the many who make life inside these walls in some measure tolerable. To his relatives and friends I extend sincere sympathy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats join in paying a tribute to Reg Frost and Bernie Scanlon. The friendliness, cheeriness and graciousness of both these men will be missed. I considered it very fortunate that I happened to be in Canberra on the day Bernie 's funeral was conducted at Queanbeyan. I attended the funeral with my wife and was very pleased to be able to do so. I extended, I hope without impertinence, to all his friends and relatives the condolences of yourself, Mr President, and every member of the Senate of whatever party. They seemed to be particularly pleased to receive those condolences. As would be expected, the funeral was attended by an extraordinarily large number of people. There was great sadness at the funeral, particularly among the Catholic sisters who were there because apparently Bernie made it almost his life's devotion after he retired from here to do odd jobs and assist the sisters in their work among the poor and their charitable work, as one would expect from such a man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have always admired people who work in the service of the Senate and indeed the House of Representatives. Having been a member of the House of Representatives for 16 years or so, I thought that Gordon Pike and his cronies were impossible to beat. But when I moved to the Senate I found the same excellence of service among Bernie Scanlon and his mates. I sometimes wonder why these people stay in these jobs. I am sure that people with the competence, efficiency and dedication of Bernie Scanlon could double their salaries in private enterprise. But they stay here and they serve, and we are eternally grateful. Bernie Scanlon leaves behind him a great number of relatives and loved ones who grieve. On behalf of the Democrats, and my wife and I personally, I extend sympathies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with all of those who have spoken in expressing sadness at the death of Bernie Scanlon and Reg Frost. Four years ago today I came to Canberra as a new senator. Bernie Scanlon was one of the first to welcome me. He did so with a cheerful smile and in a helpful way. In my first 18 months in the Senate my wife and children frequently came here for two weeks of each three week session. So as a family we had a great deal to do with Bernie Scanlon. I could not believe the excellence of personal attention that he and his assistants gave to our family, as they did to all senators. I think his cheerfulness, sense of service, generous giving of time and special initiatives to help the members of this chamber were unexcellable. He lived up to the very highest tradition of Senate staff. Senator Sir John Carrick said that Bernie Scanlon is greatly loved by us. Senator Button said he is a mate of ours. I think that those words aptly describe my own remembrances of Bernie Scanlon. I express my own sincere sympathy to his family and special friends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also remember very dearly Reg Frost, who seemed to sit every day and every evening on the corner of my corridor. I think he did so for the four years that I have been here. He was a permanent cheerful institution on the corner of the corridor outside my room in the Parliament. He always smiled and showed good humour. Towards the end of a three-week session when things were rather strained it was a point of cheer to senators in that corridor to know that Reg was able to act in the way in which Senate stewards assist us. It was only a matter of a month ago that I said my usual hellos to him on arriving at Parliament House. So it was a real shock when I heard of his recent death. I extend my sincere sympathy to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was saddened to hear of the passing of Reg Frost. I too was an occupant of the far corridor for some time. I got to know Reg very well because he was always in the corner as one went up to one's room. Reg used to get a great deal of mirth after I moved from that corridor. Perhaps because of my rigid behaviour pattern, I used to forget that I was in a new office and I used to head off to my old corridor. Every time I did so Reg would be there with his cheerful face saying: 'You have done it again'. But he did this in such a way that it was pleasurable. That part of Parliament House will not be the same with Reg's passing. I certainly pass on to his family my condolences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not only I but also my family were saddened when we heard of the passing of Bernie Scanlon. Bernie has been described in numerous ways here tonight. But my family felt we had lost a close friend, someone for whom we felt deeply. I think we were shocked and saddened because he passed on so soon after he retired. He did not have a chance to enjoy the retirement that he really deserved. Bernie, of course, was one of the army of workers who keep this Parliament House going. They are unsung workers. They do not receive any publicity, but without their help this place would grind to a halt. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that perhaps the transport officers are among the most hardworking of the army of workers we have behind us. They have to work extremely long hours when we are in session and they have to put up with a great deal. They have to keep track of where 64 senators are, where they are going and where they have been. They seem to do this with an ease which belies the difficulty which must go with their work. I remember a transport officer once saying that the best way to get a politician-I do not particularly like that word-to change his mind is to give him an airline ticket. I think this indicates some of the difficulties that Bernie and his fellow transport officers would have. Not only did he look after us but also he looked after our spouses and, as Senator Teague has mentioned, sometimes he looked after our family members as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention at this stage that with Bernie's passing we should perhaps ponder whether we expect our transport officers to do too much-whether we are asking them to work too many hours. Most of us remember Wally Lee. Wally did not live for very long after he retired to enjoy what was really a well- earned retirement. Now this has happened to Bernie. Perhaps we should ponder the position at some stage and think about those people who are working for us, the hours that they are working and what it might be doing to their health. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of us here are indebted to Bernie for a number of things that he has done. Senator Button mentioned the generosity that Bernie offered with regard to people staying at his home and I would mention that it was a generosity that was extended quite a great deal. We have a great debt to Bernie. It is a debt that we will not forget with the passing of time. To Bernie's family, I extend my condolences and those of my family. </PARA>

The condolences measured their activities over the very many years of service to Australia. Tonight I think in no less a way we are remembering and thinking of these two men. Their efforts are not sung as was the case with these other famous parliamentarians. But in no less a way they have served the Parliament, particularly the Senate. Indeed, like other honourable senators one can only be impressed with these people who worked so quietly to assist us without really expecting any words of thanks or recognition. As I have said, their efforts are really unsung to quite a degree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Only this evening I was looking at a document relating to the retirement of Bernie Scanlon on 6 August 1980. On that day we wished him all the best for a very happy retirement because we all felt that in the work he had done so cheerfully and over very long hours surely there could be some compensation for his years of effort so that he could relax and spend some time with his friends and his family. Indeed, I had an arrangement with Bernie to see him in the Northern Territory. We were going to do certain things, but that did not eventuate. After so many years of effort Bernie has gone. While we remember those very famous people, I am sure that all of us will remember Bernie too. At times I look at the staff of the Parliament, the very dedicated people who work in this area to keep the parliament working and to support parliamentarians, and I think about the long hours that they work. When I used to come into this building each morning at about 8 o'clock, Bernie would have been here for quite a long time before my arrival. When we left the building at 11 o'clock, 12 o' clock or 1 o'clock, Bernie would still be here. When we left to go to our home States, Bernie would still be here. When we returned, he would be here again. People like Bernie work incredible hours. Really, as other senators have said, are we asking too much of our staff? Indeed, these dedicated people really give their lives to what I would say is the well-being of the nation through the work they do here. </PARA>
<PARA> Reg Frost was a most pleasant fellow. Whenever you seemed to need somebody to assist you, you were under pressure, things were happening in a hurry and you needed an extra pair of hands, Reg was there-quiet, unassuming, very friendly and of tremendous assistance. In fact, you got the feeling that whenever you turned around Reg would be there. It was most remarkable that tonight all of us feel that those two men, Bernie and Reg, were our personal close friends. It is quite astounding that all of us have that feeling. I think it is indicative of the strength of character of these two men. We will miss them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to join the other speakers this evening in paying a tribute to the late Bernie Scanlon. On behalf of the ex- Parliamentary Labor Party members and the present ones, I want to express our very great sadness at his sudden death. Bernie was a great personal friend to a great many of us. He commenced work here, as you, Mr President, have said as a parliamentary attendant in about 1970. He retired on 6 August 1980 and passed away just two years to the day after his retirement. As I have said, Bernie commenced his duties here as an attendant, then became Assistant Senate Transport Officer to the late Wally Lee. On Wally's retirement he became Senate Transport Officer and it was in that position that he endeared himself to us all . Like his predecessor Wally Lee, he was always courteous and helpful despite the strains that are so often placed upon our transport officers by the unpredictable happenings in this place. Bernie was always willing to assist people in need. He had a very soft heart and a real understanding of the problems of those in need. My understanding is that he was engaged in this type of work right up until the eve of his death.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I first came here in 1971 Bernie expressed concern to me about the conditions of work for parliamentary attendants and the fact that they were then being issued with hand-me-down uniforms. That was of great concern to Bernie and there were other conditions of work with which he was concerned too. I was only a senator elect at that time but I took the opportunity of speaking to a person whom I came to know very quickly in this Parliament, Vince Martin, then the honourable member for Banks in the other place. I drew to his attention the problems Bernie had acquainted me with. Vince Martin took the opportunity that very day in the grievance debate in the other place to raise these matters on behalf of the attendants and these problems, I am happy to say, were quickly solved. It was mainly due to the vigilance, understanding and concern of the late Bernie Scanlon that the attendants in this place, from that day onwards, got a much better deal in their conditions of work. They no longer had to wear second hand uniforms or buy their own shirts. They were very grateful to Bernie for that. There was a time when they thought that the politicians were responsible, but it was not politicians at all. It was the very great work of Bernie Scanlon in his understanding of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> To his son, Michael, I would like to extend our deepest sympathy on behalf of us all. I had the pleasure of knowing Michael and I join the other honourable senators who have expressed the statement here this evening that he was a very fine young boy. Michael, of course, has had to go through the trauma of losing first his mother, then his grandmother and so soon afterwards his father. So there is a young man who has got off to a pretty rough start in life. We hope that he has got the outlook in life that his late father had, that he can overcome these problems and that he can go on and enjoy life as a young man of his years should be able to. </PARA>
<PARA> I got to know Reg Frost very well because he used to do many jobs for me at my request. He was in the Senate attendants office just around the corner from my office, and I got to know Reg very well. I received a great shock when I came back here during the recess to learn that just a few days earlier Reg had passed away. I pass on to his family our very deepest sympathy. I pay tribute to the work that both of those gentlemen did in their service to this Parliament. </PARA>

As an occupant of the far corridor, as Senator Colston mentioned, I too came to know Reg Frost very well. He was one of the first people I greeted every morning when I came here. He was always helpful , always smiling, always ready to please, always prepared to have a chat about any problems, or the weather, or anything else that you wanted to talk about. He seemed to me to be a very good friend, and we will certainly miss him in that corridor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also join with other senators who have said that it is quite fascinating how both of these people became personal friends to honourable senators. I feel the same way about Bernie Scanlon. I believe, like Senator Button, that he was a mate of mine. He was also a close friend of my wife. Like others, he was a friend to our family. He was a kind and gentle man and a very loving husband and father. He used to talk a lot about his son, and he talked to my wife about his wife. It was clear that he was grieving over the loss of his wife. I have spoken to my wife about it and she believes that he never got over the death of his wife. It was certainly a shock to me, as it was to others to come back into this place and to discover that we had lost both of these fine friends. </PARA>

As a one-time resident of the corridor mentioned by Senator Lewis , I am well aware of the friendly disposition of Reg Frost. In relation to Bernie Scanlon, I think honourable senators will be well aware of the reputation the Scanlon family has in the Northern Miners Federation of New South Wales. His brother Henry was a very prominent trade union leader. He was a very courageous man who could also be gracious in defeat. Henry had the same sense of humour and merry twinkle in his eyes that Bernie had. I think all honourable senators know that the name of Scanlon rates very highly on the northern coalfields.

He looked after honourable senators whose rooms are in that corridor very well. I must admit that I was always rather late with my box of paper to be tied up. Reg always accepted that late request very happily and tied up my terrible box of paper for me to take back to Hobart. He always did it very graciously. He was very keen on his garden. I saw photographs of his magnificent tomato plants. He was a very keen gardener. He loved growing fruit and brought it in to display it on many occasions. He told me how I should be looking after my own garden at home, but I was never quite as clever as he was with his plants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bernie Scanlon was a wonderful friend to all of us, as honourable senators have said tonight. He took particular care of the ladies, and always made sure that we got home safely in the wee small hours of the morning. If we had a rather dark area to go into, he always made sure that the driver went with us. He made sure that we were looked after well. Bernie was indeed a very dear friend to all of us. I agree with the remarks made by Senator Lewis. I believe that Bernie grieved for his wife and did not ever recover from her passing. Obviously they were a very close couple and he took her death very hard. I join with other senators in giving my condolences to both families. I hope that their sadness will be easier to bear after reading the condolences that have been expressed here tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What needed to be said about Bernie Scanlon and Reg Frost has been said. I rise merely to add a few words about Bernie Scanlon who during the period I have been here-I am sorry to have to use the past tense-was a close friend of mine. I should like to give an example of his tremendous generosity, a generosity that was extended where it was not expected, in my case to my two children who came to Canberra at a time when I was not here and were unable to find accommodation. Their need was met by Bernie Scanlon, who in some way improvised accommodation for them until they found accommodation. He then took a personal interest in those people for the rest of the time they were in Canberra. They are deeply indebted to him and grieve at his loss. Special encouragement should be given to his son Michael because, as Senator McLaren has said, he has had to face the loss of three people. In a short period a household of four suddenly became a household of one. The lad is very much in need of courage and encouragement, and I am certain that what has been said tonight will be of great support to him.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to seek the indulgence of the Senate for a short time to talk about the export of live sheep . I consider this matter to be of significant importance not only to the rural producers of Australia but also, at a more fundamental level, to the direction in which Australia is heading as an exporting nation. The arguments and the debates in respect of live sheep exports have been going on since the mid-1970s. At one level it relates to the relative balance between live animal sales and carcass sales. At another level it becomes a question of Australia's role and its ability to dictate tastes, quantities and purchasing preferences for the world markets. At that level it is a question of whether the trade union movement can determine and decide unilaterally what Australian products the market wants, in what quantities, and how they shall be delivered. The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, with the backing of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, has adopted a dangerous and, in my view, a long term possibly destructive position which, in the final analysis, may well fall very heavily upon the rural producers of this country. Its view is simply that, in terms of live sheep exports, there ought to be correspondingly an equal export of processed carcasses. In my view, that stand has been based upon a false premise, a false assumption, and has been perpetuated by the following submission that the union made to the Australian Council of Trade Unions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That countries predominately importing live sheep will accept a balance of carcase mutton to complement live sheep. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of statements made by Middle East officials that belief is, to say the least, certainly questionable, but more importantly the underlying reasons for the union's policy on live sheep exports are also, to say the least, highly suspect. The AMIEU has stated that in the last decade some 10,000 jobs have been lost as a result of the export of live sheep. In fact, that is hardly the case at all. While, superficially, it is an attractive argument, which diverts attention from rising labour and associated costs in the meat industry which have made Australia's competitive position weaker relative to such other major suppliers as Argentina, East Africa and Europe, in my view it is no more than an exercise in locating for the benefit of the AMIEU a convenient scapegoat. </PARA>
<PARA> An examination of the markets in the Middle East which, by and large, takes all of our live sheep, makes this point very clear. Taking 1975 as the point at which live sheep exports took off-the first year more than one million animals were shipped to the Middle East-there has been a 291 per cent increase in live sheep sales to 1981. That, in itself, represents major growth in the industry for primary producers who, in recent years, have had to face enormous difficulties posed by droughts, rising costs and other factors of which everybody in the Senate would be aware. This has been true not only of Western Australia but also of New South Wales and Queensland. Their situation has also been influenced by fluctuating commodity prices. In that period of difficulty a major new export industry has developed-one which, for the most spurious of reasons, the trade unions would seek to destroy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the unions argue that live sheep sales in the Middle East have been achieved at the expense of processed meat sales but, in fact, those two distinct markets have developed very effectively, competently and capably in tandem. If we consider first Iran, we find that carcass sales to that country have increased in volume by 148 per cent in the period 1975 to 1981, but that over the same period live sales have increased by only 48 per cent. I begin with Iran for two reasons. The first is that it is not an Arab country. The second is that it was the country cited in a recent television report which claimed that New Zealand had banned live sales to Iran but had experienced a significant expansion in carcass sales to that country. Of course, the point is very clear. Australia did not ban live sheep sales. Nevertheless its carcass sales to Iran have expanded out of proportion to its sales to the live sheep market. In fact, carcass markets throughout the Middle East, with the exception of Bahrain, have expanded strongly throughout the period 1975 to 1981. The increases ranged from 59 per cent in Kuwait, the smallest increase, to 570 per cent in Oman. Overall, the volume of carcass sheep meat sales to Iran, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Bahrain combined has increased from 20,262 tonnes in 1975 to 60,481 tonnes last year-a three-fold increase. Live sheep sales over the same period have increased very significantly from 1.33 million tonnes in 1975 to 4.7 million tonnes in 1981. That increase is about three and a half fold or, in other words, not so much out of proportion with carcass sales as the AMIEU would have us believe. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that the sheep sales, either live or in carcass form, have developed extremely well and side by side in the Middle East and not, as the Opposition would claim, one at the exclusion of the other. On a country by country basis it is true that increases in live sheep sales have exceeded those of sheep meat in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar but the reverse has been true in Iran, Oman and Dubai. Only in Bahrain have sheep meat carcass sales fallen between 1975 and 1981 but by comparison Oman has never become a significant live sheep consumer. It is a matter of market preference and, try though they may, the AMIEU, the Opposition, or Australia as a whole cannot tell a market what, why and how it should buy. That point has been made time and again by those purchasers in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> A group of Australians drawn from the Government, industry bodies and the trade union movement generally has recently studied the question of sheep meat sales to the Middle East countries. The union delegates, whilst agreeing in basic principle, perhaps differed in emphasis from the other members of the group in terms of interpreting the findings. But even they had to admit:</PARA>
<PARA> All countries visited continue to tolerate the belief that the only way to ensure that sheep meat from Australia is Halal, is to slaughter it locally. </PARA>
<PARA>The union conceded also:</PARA>
<PARA> The local populations in all countries visited have a strong preference for fresh meat, particularly sheep meat. </PARA>
<PARA>That is really the point in this debate. Halal, the traditional Moslem way of killing sheep, must be observed. The Government has said that it will promote the fact that Australia's abattoirs will follow the Moslem killing procedures in an effort to ensure that we are able to provide overseas buyers with carcasses in the manner, form and style which they want and satisfy the unions as best we are capable. But as long as the demand for live animals in the Middle East countries persists and it is people's desire to do their own slaughtering in their own countries all that the Government of this country can do is ensure that we can promote carcass sales in the best way. It would be quite irresponsible in the extreme for us to jeopardize our live sheep sales. Australia cannot force upon those countries a style other than that which they would want for themselves. We should be very clear at this point: If Australia were to force the issue the result would be a disaster for rural producers of this country. I quote from a television report which I mentioned earlier. The Kuwaiti Minister in charge of meat imports was asked what Kuwait would do for live sheep if Australia banned exports. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Of course,' he replied. 'It is natural that we would look for other alternatives.'</PARA>
<PARA>Quoting the Saudi Arabian Minister of Commerce the Arab information bureau in Australia added:</PARA>
<PARA> If you (that is, Australia) don't sell us live sheep, we will look just across the Red Sea to Somalia, Sudan and Kenya. We will buy from there. </PARA>
<PARA>The bureau made the point as strongly as it could be made at that time when it said:</PARA>
<PARA> If we do not get live sheep (from Australia), we will buy it somewhere else. You cannot force people to buy things they don't want. </PARA>
<PARA>The potentially destructive attitude of the trade union movement means that it has the prospect of ensuring that our live sheep export market will be denied to us. At best this is naive loyalty to Australia's abattoir workers but at worst, and closer to the truth, it is a deliberate ploy to focus the meat industry's problems on external factors rather than to look to the behaviour of the unions themselves to explain Australia's trading decline. The live sheep trade in fact is a part of that ploy. The unions look to the external factors but ignore the effects of rising wages and shorter hours, which are crippling Australia's industry. They have maintained this position in the face of all of the evidence that all forms of sheep meat sales to the Middle East have grown markedly and in the face of an often repeated preference for live sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> If this position is ever translated into the sorts of conditions advocated by the ACTU is will mean disaster for the primary producers for whom this is a developing industry. It could well lead to reduced carcass sales, as well, in the Middle East, thereby affecting the very people in the work force for whom the union is professing concern. I leave honourable senators with the view that I would be horrified, distressed and concerned if I thought that the Government were at any point in time prepared to walk away, back away or compromise when pressure was applied by the trade union movement or by other people to ensure that we are not able any longer to export live sheep from this country to the Middle East. I trust that the Government will continue to pursue its aggressive policy to ensure that we are able to export that type of sheep, particularly wethers, to those countries to the benefit of our rural producers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The previous question asked what offer the Qantas Board, on behalf of the Wentworth Hotel Management, had made to the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union during an industrial dispute involving union members and Sydney hotels; whether such an offer was made before the dispute began; and what were the final wages scale settlement terms.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the Qantas Board made no offer in this dispute, which was settled by negotiations on 10 December 1981 between the Australian Hotels Association and the union members employed in Sydney hotels. The reply to that question was intended to convey that fact.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the present question, I am advised that on that date the Sydney members accepted an offer made by the Australian Hotels Association to the Union on 30 October 1981. That offer consisted of an additional $15 per week from the first pay period on or after 28 October 1981, $5 per week from the first pay period on or after 1 December 1981, and a further $5 per week from the first pay period on or after 1 February 1982. The latter two $5 payments were to be applied as a credit against any CPI increase granted in the future, for the September and December 1981 quarters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Aircraft operations within Australia are liable, unless exempted by the Minister for Aviation or his delegate or by the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952' to pay air navigation charges as provided for under the Act. The charges take account of the cost of providing, operating and maintaining aerodromes, air route and airway facilities, meteorological services and search and rescue services. The charge is a composite one and cannot be itemised for the use of specific items or facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Current aerial agriculture operators are entitled to receive a 15 per cent remission on air navigation charges for aircraft solely constructed and used for aerial agricultural operations or aircraft fitted for and exclusively used for aerial agricultural operations. This remission is additional to the 50 per cent remission which applies in respect of aircraft operating from non government owned or financed aerodromes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The General Aviation Study's estimate of the level of cost recovery from the agricultural aviation sub-sector was based on a method of apportioning costs developed specifically for use in the context of the Study.</PARA>
<PARA> The General Aviation Study's estimate of the level of cost recovery from the agricultural aviation sub-sector related to the year 1977/78. In order to establish whether the level of cost recovery for the agricultural aviation sub- sector has changed since 1977/78, it would be necessary to examine annual changes in both the level of attributable costs and revenues for this sub-sector in each subsequent year.</PARA>
<PARA> The current arrangements for levying charges on the general aviation sector, which were endorsed by the Government following the General Aviation Study, do not distinguish between sub-sectors. As a consequence, Departmental accounting records do not provide for aviation costs and revenue data to be identified by sub-sector. The General Aviation Study's calculations have therefore not been updated.</PARA>
<PARA> The 20 per cent increase in air navigation charges announced in the 1981/82 Budget was the first such increase for two years and was in line with movements in the consumer price index during that time. In addition, since the increase did not become effective until 1 October 1981, it only applies to part of the revenue collected in the 1981/82 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> It does not follow that the increase in air navigation charges announced in 1981 has necessarily resulted in full cost recovery from the agricultural aviation sub-sector.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The current details of air navigation charges payable by owners on their aircraft's operations are contained in the schedules to the Air Navigation ( Charges) Act 1952 as amended.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) Tables 1 and 2 below have been provided by the Statistician.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Statistics on this matter are not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Tables 3 and 4 below, provided by the Statistician relate to the methods directly responsible for ending the stoppages of work as recorded by the Statistician in the period (not necessarily those for settling all matters in disputes). State- Territory dissections are not available prior to 1978. The Statistician has advised that it is not possible from the figures available to identify the number of disputes which actually 'went to arbitration' during settlement. In the vast majority of stoppages, work was resumed without negotiation of third party intervention; these are included under 'other' methods of settlement.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Statistics on this matter are not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Statistician has advised that from 1970 until 30 September 1981 seven industrial disputes were settled by intervention, assistance or advice from Commonwealth Government Officials (ie 5 in 1974 and 2 in 1976). It should be noted that these disputes are those where the Statistician has adjudged that intervention by Commonwealth officials was the method directly responsible for ending the stoppage of work. The Statistician allocates each dispute which ends in a quarter and year to a particular method of settlement category, and cases can arise where Commonwealth intervention may have played a significant role in bringing about a cessation of the stoppage but the Statistician considered that it was not the method directly responsible for ending the stoppage of work.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) At the suggestion of the Northern Territory Government discussions are being held regarding the alternative means by which the Commonwealth Government' s policies for Stage 2 of Kakadu can be given effect to.</PARA>
<PARA> In announcing the Government's decisions about the establishment of Kakadu National Park on 25 August 1977 it was made clear the Stage 2 area would later be declared part of the Park.</PARA>
<PARA> The fee simple interest in the Stage 2 area land was acquired by the Commonwealth on 29 June 1978 and the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 amended to enable Commonwealth control of the area as a Conservation Zone prior to incorporation in the Park.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As far as land claims are concerned the entire Stage 2 area was the subject of a land claim under the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Land Commissioner made his recommendation in relation to the claim to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 2 July 1981. On 8 March 1982 the Minister announced his acceptance of the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that there is no action being taken by the Northern Territory Government which would affect the claim.</PARA>
<PARA> In so far as uranium mining is concerned the Government announced in August 1977 that in line with the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry (RUEI) recommendations the Jabiluka project would be excluded from the Park to accommodate mining activities.

<PARA> There are no further uranium mining projects for Stage 2 currently in prospect although it is intended that the area should be subject to exploration following its establishment as a Conservation Zone under the NPWC Act. Any exploration or development of land which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs announced on 8 March 1982 will become Aboriginal land, would be subject also to the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Commonwealth Government nominated Kakadu National Park for inclusion on the World Heritage List on 25 August 1980.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, except that the only plant breakdown was in the mechanical ventilation equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Persia was built in 1953 and originally operated as the passenger/general cargo carrier Asia. It was converted as a livestock carrier, thoroughly overhauled in 1976-77 and entered the Australian livestock export trade in 1977. The definition of seaworthiness is contained in section 207 of the Navigation Act, sub-section (2) of which provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Where- (a) it is proposed to take a Safety Convention ship to sea on a voyage from a port in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) there is in force in respect of the ship the certificate or certificates that may be required to be produced under sub-section 206W (2) in respect of the voyage,</PARA>
<PARA>the ship shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be seaworthy in relation to that voyage with respect to the condition of the ship and its equipment unless the condition of the ship or of its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of that certificate or of any of those certificates.</PARA>
<PARA> Persia is a Safety Convention ship for the purposes of that provision and carried the required certificates issued by the flag state. At the time of the voyage in question there was no reason for departmental surveyors to suppose that the condition of the ship or of its equipment did not correspond substantially with the particulars of its certificates.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the seaworthiness requirements the arrangements for the carriage of livestock, including ventilation, are inspected by departmental surveyors for compliance with Requirements for the Carriage of Livestock by Sea (June 1978). These inspections have taken place on the 6 or 7 occasions each year since 1978 when the ship has loaded livestock in Australia and there has been no previous problem with the ventilation machinery.</PARA>
<PARA> The above requirements also require the issue of a certificate of fitness by an authorised veterinary officer certifying that the livestock are capable of withstanding the conditions which they are likely to experience on the proposed voyage. The breakdown of the ventilation equipment gave rise to conditions which could not reasonably have been expected.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Unlike Ansett and TAA, Air New South Wales (ANSW) and East West Airlines ( EW) do not compete on routes within NSW due to the rationalisation of intrastate air services which occurs under the provisions of the NSW Air Transport Act. Competition does occur however on the interstate Sydney/Maroochydore route, on which ANSW and EW both provide services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Holcroft Inquiry considered only the operations of TAA and Ansett Airlines of Australia and did not cover regional operators such as ANSW and EW. No variations were made to the fares of either operator on 1 April 1981 as a result of the Holcroft recommendations. Moreover, as ANSW and EW do not generally compete, fare variations do not occur simultaneously as they do for Ansett and TAA.</PARA>
<PARA> ANSW's first fare increase after 1 April 1981 took effect on 3 July 1981 when a rise of 7.3 per cent was approved, while for EW, an increase of 5.3 per cent was approved on 15 July 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons it is not possible to compare passenger figures for ANSW and EW over their individual routes. Nevertheless, the following information was obtained from statistics prepared by the former Department of Transport which gives comparative passenger figures on the Sydney/Maroochydore route over which ANSW and EW compete, and passenger performance figures on a network basis for ANSW and EW.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1979 and 1980 enquiries concerning the safety of steel radial tyres were conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety, the New South Wales Traffic Accident Research Unit, and my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the main cause of tread separation in tyres is rubber compound fatigue cracking. Fatigue occurs in all tyres, but a correctly manufactured and operated steel-belted radial tyre is not more likely to suffer a premature failure than other types of tyre.</PARA>

<PARA> steel-belted tyres appear to require more care in their operation and maintenance than do other types of tyres</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not clear what is meant by the reference to essential items to be purchased free of sales tax. Government measures to introduce a sales tax on, amongst other things, clothing and footwear which have been defeated in the Senate did not include proposals to tax foodstuffs, drugs or medicines. If essential items are clothing, foodstuffs, drugs and medicines there is simply no sales tax payable.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth government departments are specifically exempt from sales tax on goods purchased for their use. Clearly it is unnecessary for them to pay sales tax on goods purchased out of consolidated revenue. Furthermore the Constitution guarantees freedom from sales tax to State government departments.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not correct to say that businessmen can obtain essential items free of sales tax. What the sales tax law does is to provide exemption for manufacturers to obtain their raw materials, aids to manufacture and similar goods free of sales tax so as to prevent double taxation or indirect taxing of exempt goods.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the indexation provisions of the Social Security Act, pensioners are automatically compensated for all price increases that are reflected in the consumer price index.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) The IPTAAS program has been widely publicised throughout Australia. The Department wrote individually to all doctors in rural areas at the time the program was introduced in October 1978, and explanatory pamphlets and posters were widely distributed. Advertisements announcing the introduction of the program appeared in all rural and provincial newspapers in 1978, as well as the AMA Gazette and the Medical Journal. Subsequently, follow-up publicity campaigns were undertaken in 1979 and 1980. The IPTAAS explanatory pamphlet is currently being revised to incorporate amendments made to the program. The program was amended in 1980-81 to include registered cleft lip and palate patients under 22 years of age who, together with the relevant organisations, were advised of the program's extension. Information regarding IPTAAS is also available on request from Commonwealth Department of Health offices in all States and Territories. Public awareness of IPTAAS can be gauged from the increase in the number of submitted applications for benefits since its introduction viz; 7241 in 1978-79 to some 50,000 in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) While it is obviously desirable that details of the IPTAAS program be displayed in the areas where IPTAAS is available, the Government has no direct control over such matters.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A control under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations has been in force since 1973 under which the importation of PCBs is prohibited except with the approval of the Minister responsible for administration of the Customs Act. Approval would usually be given only where PCBs are to be used in enclosed electrical transformers and large power factor correction capacitors, heat transfer fluids, and hydraulic fluids in mining equipment. Importation of PCBs for dissipative uses where recovery of waste material could not be guaranteed has not been allowed. Since the introduction of the customs regulation, statistics show that the importation of PCBs for electrical uses has fallen from a peak of 300 tonnes in 1975 to zero in each of the last two years. A survey commissioned by the Australian Environment Council in 1975 found that heat transfer fluids and hydraulic fluids containing PCBs were no longer being marketed in Australia. Where it is known that PCBs are in use in electrical transformers and capacitors, this use can be monitored.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) PCBs can be stored safely for an indefinite period provided certain standards are observed. Almost all used PCBs in Australia are stored in areas of State jurisdiction and State authorities have the responsibility for setting appropriate standards and monitoring their observance.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Environmental contamination by PCBs in Australia and overseas seems largely to have been the consequence of dissipative uses of these chemicals and of improper disposal practices for waste PCBs. The Customs control referred to in ( 1) above, effectively precludes dissipative uses of PCBs in Australia. State and Commonwealth authorities are well aware of the need for strict control of storage and disposal of waste PCBs.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I understand that recent research by Professor Waid at La Trobe University in Melbourne has identified the existence of PCBs at low levels (less than 0.9 parts per million) in samples of sediment and biota from Port Phillip Bay. There are no data available on the effect these low levels of PCBs might have on birds or fish species. Earlier investigations have been conducted by other research workers at different locations.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the presence of PCBs in humans, food and packaging, I am advised that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a survey was conducted by the Division of Occupational Health and Radiation Control of the New South Wales Health Commission to determine the health effects of PCBs on exposed workers employed in the electrical industry. Thirty-four PCBs workers were examined; in general they complained of burning sensation on the face and neck during exposure to PCB 'fume'. Five suffered from eczematous rash on the hands and legs. PCB blood levels ranged from 300-600 parts per billion ( ppb) compared to zero level among 30 non-exposed workers. Since PCBs are hepatoxic, liver function tests were done on these workers. The results were normal.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Since 1976, the published results of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Market Basket Surveys indicate that no PCBs were detected in processed food samples for the years 1976-79. These results would also imply that packaging is free from PCBs.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am advised that PCBs are irritant to the eyes and cause an acne-form dermatitis (chloracne). In the absence of epidemiological data, long term effects of exposure to PCBs, apart from an incidence of liver toxicity and skin complaints, are largely unknown. This is confirmed in a recent study carried out on PCB workers in Milan where liver damage was correlated to PCB levels in the blood. The authors of that study have indicated their intention to begin epidemiological studies to determine whether there is any suggestion of a positive association between PCB exposure and cancer.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Incineration in special high-temperature incinerators is the only environmentally acceptable means of disposing of polychlorinated biphenyls. No such specific-purpose incinerator exists in Australia at the present time. Although I understand that the New South Wales Metropolitan Waste Disposal Authority has plans to construct such a facility. An incinerator presently operating in Perth is capable of burning small quantities of PCBs at high temperatures. PCBs have also been destroyed in cement kilns in Canada and Sweden .</PARA>
<PARA> PCBs can be shipped from Australia for destruction in other countries. In 1978, an Australian company did use this means of disposing of stocks of PCB wastes.</PARA>
<PARA> Research into other methods of degrading PCBs is being carried out in the United States. Recently a chemical process which can be used to degrade wastes containing PCBs was announced.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL) are the only source in Australia providing free hearing aids, service and batteries to eligible pensioners. Pensioners, if they so wish can obtain hearing aids from private sector hearing services. They would however have to pay the full price of the aids and the services provided.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The waiting times for the expanding population of eligible pensioners are the results of catering for the increased demand with the available staff. In addition, priority for initial appointments is given to children and young people under 21 years of age with hearing difficulties to ensure that their education and possibilities of entering the workforce will suffer to the minimum extent possible. Eligible pensioners are assessed after an average waiting time for all hearing centres of 4.4 months for initial appointments. Depending on the type of aid required to be manufactured and/or supplied, fitting of the hearing aid will be completed after an average of a further two weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Delays in waiting times have been minimised by improving arrangements for the training of staff, reviewing work methods, reviewing appointment schedules and by including new features in hearing aids.

<PARA> (1) Twenty export registered abattoirs have closed since January 1978. In addition, the export works at Derby, which normally operates on a seasonal basis , has not operated for the past two seasons. My Department has no statistics on the number of export registered premises which have reduced their workforce. Statistics relating to abattoirs operating for the domestic market and for slaughterhouses are available from State authorities with responsibilities in this area.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) (a) As a result of the closure of the export works listed, in excess of 8, 000 abattoir workers were unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (b) see (1).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Estimates of cattle numbers at March 1983 indicate that the cattle herd will be around 24.7m head, a slight reduction on March 1982 levels. This reduced availability of stock coupled with already very low rates of utilisation in many export works due to weak demand in our major export markets would suggest that further rationalisation is inevitable in the next 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Government has considered requests from the industry but decided not to offer assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> Government assistance to the meat processing industry will not alleviate the shortage of stock for slaughter. To assist both producers and processors, the Government has, however, directed its efforts to negotiating minimum levels of access for Australian beef exports in overseas markets in the belief that this will add greater stability to the industry in the future. For example, the Government in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations, was able to negotiate guaranteed global levels of access to the United States and Canada and to obtain an assurance of growth in the Japanese market. In addition, the European Economic Community gave an assurance on levels of imports of manufacturing beef and agreed to increase its quota for imports of beef free of import levy. The Community also established a levy free quota of 21,000 tonnes of high quality beef of which 5,000 tonnes is specifically reserved for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these measures, meat producers and exporters have received significant benefits through Export Market Development Grants ($2.7m in 1979-80) and through promotional efforts internationally by both the AMLC and the Department of Trade and Resources and domestically by the AMLC.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The fundamental problem of the abattoir industry at the present time is that there is overcapacity in many works in relation to the number of stock available for slaughter and this is likely to be the case for the next few years . Fluctuations in the national cattle herd are largely responsible for the present situation. Abattoir expansion was widespread during the boom years for the cattle industry in the early 1970s but numbers have decreased since the mid 1970s due to poor export demand and drought over much of Australia, leaving abattoirs with excess capacity.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's belief that the rationalisation process should proceed without Government direction or assistance and that commercial considerations should determine the size and location of works.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) I have no information on the estimated loss of income to country centres where abattoirs have either closed or reduced operations.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) I have no information on the estimated number of jobs lost in non-abattoir employment as a result of retrenchment of an abattoir worker.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) 'The Commonwealth and State Government Collaborative Soil Conservation Study 1975-77,' released in April 1978, estimated the cost of treating and controlling land degradation at $675m in 1975 prices.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The 1975-77 Collaborative Study found that about half of the agricultural and pastoral land in Australia required some form of treatment. No comparative and comprehensive study has since been made.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Soil conservation is a responsibility of the States and the allocation of priorities is a matter for the States.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) While farm management and soil conservation practices may minimise land degradation, it needs to be recognised that agricutural development can involve an acceleration of natural land degradation. Land degradation would, of itself, lead to reduced production in most circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> Rural development in Australia has resulted in a steady significant growth in total production and, with due attention to soil protection, this production can be maintained. However, the Collaborative Study indicates that, across the rural production areas of Australia, degradation ranges from minimal, where soil protection measures are highly effective, to the point where production is impossible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Part IV of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 sets domestic and non-convention air traffic carrier liability limits of $300 for loss or damage to registered baggage and $30 for loss or damage to other than registered baggage. These sums were fixed in 1970 by the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1970.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) On 24 March 1982 the then Minister for Transport introduced the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill 1982 aimed, in part, at increasing the domestic and non-convention liability limits prescribed under Part IV of the Act. With regard to baggage, this involves increasing the existing limits to $ 900 for loss or damage to registered baggage and $90 for other than registered baggage. This increase broadly reflects the increases in factors such as the consumer price index and average weekly earnings since the limits were last reviewed in 1970.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The proceedings pending between David Joseph Noel Bluett (as trustee of the estate of Sylvia Margaret Faulkner, a bankrupt) as plaintiff and the Commonwealth and Charles Francis Flint as defendants are based on allegations that the Commonwealth, by its agent Brigadier Flint, represented to Mrs Faulkner , as the beneficial owner of the issued share capital in a company, Trisal Engineering Pty Limited, and as its governing director, that the Commonwealth would lodge orders in large quantities for the purchase, for use by the Australian Armed Forces, of articles known as Trisal clips produced by the company and that, relying on those representations, Mrs Faulkner suffered damage . These allegations are all in issue in the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A writ was issued out of the High Court of Australia on behalf of Mrs Faulkner on 8 May 1974 but was not served on the Commonwealth until 7 May 1975. The writ did not specify the amount of damages claimed. Particulars have been furnished showing the total amount claimed as $1,246,852.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The proceedings have not yet come on for hearing but the Commonwealth has not been guilty of any undue delay in relation to the matter. In particular, it is not correct that the Commonwealth's defence was not filed until 32 months after particulars were supplied. On 8 July 1977 the plaintiff's solicitors furnished further and better particulars requested by the Deputy Crown Solicitor in a letter dated 28 October 1976. In furnishing the further and better particulars the plaintiff's solicitors also indicated that at the hearing of the action leave would be sought to amend the statement of claim. In a letter dated 29 July 1977 the Deputy Crown Solicitor indicated to the plaintiff's solicitors that the amended statement of claim should be filed before the Commonwealth was required to deliver a defence. The amended statement of claim was not delivered to the Deputy Crown Solicitor until 9 August 1978. The Commonwealth's defence was delivered to the plaintiff's solicitors on 22 August 1978 by which time Mrs Faulkner had become a bankrupt and the cause of action had vested in the Official Receiver.</PARA>
<PARA> The allegation of delay in approving legal aid to Mrs Faulkner by the Australian Legal Aid Office was considered by my predecessor in May 1976 and he concluded that there had been no undue delay in that Office in considering the application.</PARA>
<PARA> Complaints of undue delay on the part of the Commonwealth in dealing with this matter have been made to the Ombudsman on more than one occasion. In relation to the question of legal aid, the Ombudsman appears to have been satisfied with the explanations furnished to him by the Australian Legal Aid Office. In relation to the proceedings generally the Ombudsman, in a letter to Mr R. Faulkner dated 28 September 1981, stated that he had seen no evidence of any attempt to frustrate the litigation of the matter and that he did not regard the actions of the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor in defending the action as coming within that category. He further stated that, given that the legal advisers of the Crown have not accepted that the Commonwealth is legally liable, they have acted properly in defending the Commonwealth against the claim and in declining to made a settlement.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am unable to indicate when the proceedings are likely to be concluded. At this stage the future course of the proceedings is largely in the hands of the Official Receiver, who has been substituted as plaintiff. The Commonwealth has indicated that it will support any application for an expedited hearing that the plaintiff wishes to make.</PARA>

<PARA> (1 to 3) My answer to the honourable senator's earlier question No. 1945 ( Hansard 17 March 1982, page 918) sets out in general terms arrangements made for former Governors-General or their widows.</PARA>
<PARA> Except where pension eligibility is conferred by the Governor-General Act 1974, payments in the nature of pensions are made on an ex gratia basis. Two persons are currently eligible for payments under the Governor-General Act 1974. One is resident in Australia and one in Britain. The other three recipients of payments , referred to in my answer to Question No. 1945, receive ex gratia payments as they (in the case of widows, their husbands) ceased to hold office as Governor- General prior to the Governor-General Act coming into force. One of these recipients resides in Australia and the other two in Britain. Payments to the five recipients in 1980-81 amounted to $203,784.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Under the General Recurrent Grants Program administered by the Commonwealth Schools Commission, St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill, St Patrick's College, Strathfield and St Aloysius College, Milsons Point have been approved for Group 3 funding in 1982. The per capita grants for this subsidy group represent 38 per cent of the Commission's standard cost of educating a student in a government school, which is calculated on an Australian-wide basis. The subsidy rate for Group 3 schools will increase to 40 per cent in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commonwealth has a policy of funding all schools on the basis of need. General recurrent subsidies to non-government schools are based on a three-tier system of per capita grants which provides a variable level of assistance according to need. The basic minimum per capita grant, available to all non- government schools, represents 20 per cent of the average per pupil cost of education in government school systems. Schools in funding Groups 2 and 3 receive per capita grants in 1982 which represent 30 per cent and 38 per cent respectively of standard government school per pupil costs.</PARA>
<PARA> The placement of a school in one of the three funding groups is determined primarily by the school's level of recurrent expenditure per pupil from private sources. This measure of need was first defined by the Karmel Committee in 1973 and has been used since then. However, the Government accepted a Commonwealth Schools Commission recommendation to the effect that, in the case of those schools moving to a higher subsidy group, from 1982 onwards school income as well as expenditure will be considered before determining the need of each school for additional subsidies beyond the basic grant of 20 per cent.</PARA>

Wage and salary earners pay tax, via instalment deductions, as their income is received. Provisional payments, like pay-as-you-earn deductions, are intended to collect the main part of the tax on a year's income during that same year, although in the case of provisional tax it is not collected until nine months of the year have elapsed.</PARA>

The Statistician concluded that it would be a more effective disposition of the resources involved, from the point of view of the overall reliability of the index, to use these resources to increase the frequency with which some non-food prices are collected and to decrease the frequency with which some food prices have been collected in the past.</PARA>

<PARA> My colleague the Attorney-General provided a response to the first part of that question and advised that he was referring the second part concerning law enforcement agencies to the Minister for Administrative Services for a more detailed answer. The Minister for Administrative Services has now provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police provides training for its investigators and those of the State Police Forces in the form of an annual course of four weeks' duration conducted at the Australian Police College, Manly, New South Wales, aimed at providing a practical approach to the use and manipulation of computers.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of specialist training overseas is being examined following the recent return of a senior officer from a course at the Federal Bureau of Investigation Academy at Quantico, Virginia, United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA> A pilot training course for investigators of computer-related crime was held at Rokeby in Tasmania between 19 and 23 April 1982. The course was developed in conjunction with the National Companies and Securities Commission and was conducted under the auspices of the Australian Police College. Representatives from all Corporate Affairs Commissions and Police Forces in Australia attended for the purpose of evaluating the course content and determining the direction further training will take. If this pilot course proves to be acceptable, it is proposed to include it as a basic training unit in the normal training programs of all Police Forces.</PARA>

<PARA> Is it normal practice for Telecom Australia subscribers on Great Barrier Reef Island resorts to have to pay in advance for the installation of radio/ telephone facilities to those islands from the mainland? It is a fact that the Minister for Communications chaired a meeting between Telecom and a Mr Keith Williams, the developer of a new resort at Hamilton Island, off Proserpine, at which a decision was made that Telecom would install a 60-channel radio telephone initially, followed by a 350-channel radio/telephone with no advance payment being made by Mr Williams?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Under By-law 51 the Commission is empowered to determine the charges which will apply for the provision of telephone services to a subscriber in a place remote from developed areas where significant capital expenditure is required. In the case of Mr Williams' development at Hamilton Island a radio system with an ultimate capacity of 60 channels is at present being installed. This will cater for Mr Williams' initial requirement for six circuits and provide spare capacity for his future needs and for other applicants expected on the island in the future. The commercial condition determined for the services for Mr Williams was a capital contribution of $56,000 of which he has already paid a deposit of $20,000 with the remainder due before connection.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 March 1982 (Hansard, page 577) Senator Mulvihill asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning free hospital treatment for United Kingdom visitors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that foreign visitors to the United Kingdom will no longer be provided with free hospital treatment under the UK National Health Scheme from October 1982, unless their home government has entered into a reciprocal health agreement with the UK Government. It is also true that Australia has no such reciprocal agreement. However, this is for reasons other than those mentioned by the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> Under existing health financing arrangements State Governments have sole responsibility for the administration of their respective public hospital systems, including policy on charges. The role of the States was reinforced with the changes to the health care arrangements introduced on 1 September 1981 . The Federal Government is, therefore, not in the same position to guarantee ' free' recognised hospital care to UK visitors as the governments of the countries referred to by the honourable senator. I understand that in those countries the national government is generally responsible for the provision of public hospital care and thus able to implement undertakings given under a reciprocal agreement. Australian States may provide such care if they so wish.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the Federal Government's responsibilities are concerned, all persons from the date they take out at least basic medical cover with registered medical benefits organisations are eligible for Commonwealth Medical Benefits. This includes visitors to Australia. Other Federal health benefits (domiciliary nursing care benefit, nursing home benefits and pharmaceutical benefits) are also available to all persons in Australia, irrespective of country of origin or residential address.</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the new arrangements in the UK from October 1982, I am advised that accident and emergency outpatient treatment will remain free to visitors from other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the impact of this UK action should be judged in the knowledge that most Australians visiting the UK usually travel to other countries and therefore need insurance coverage against possible health care costs in those countries. This need for insurance would remain, regardless of any entitlement in the UK.</PARA>

<PARA> Has the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources noted an item in the Daily Commercial News of 8 March stating that the Australian sheet steel industry is being swamped by a tidal wave of low cost imports? Can the Minister confirm whether that statement is correct? If it is correct, can the Minister advise the Senate of what action the Government has taken or intends to take to prevent dumping of steel on the Australian market?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The article of 8 March 1982 has been drawn to my attention.</PARA>
<PARA> In January 1982, the Department of Industry and Commerce notified interested parties that it had received a request for temporary assistance against imports of certain types of hot rolled, cold rolled and coated sheet steel</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently the Department received a request for temporary assistance on certain other forms of hot rolled flat steel products and on steel pipes and tubes, and this request was notified to interested parties at the end of March.</PARA>
<PARA> Following analysis of the information necessary to the consideration of these two requests, I announced on 21 May 1982 that a reference would be sent to the Temporary Assistance Authority on the question of urgent assistance to the industry producing these goods. I also announced that the Industries Assistance Commission would be asked to report on the question of longer term assistance to the production of a wider range of steel products. The references were sent on 25 May 1982, and the Temporary Assistance Authority is to report within 45 days and the Industries Assistance Commission within 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian steel industry has been concerned at both the overall increase in imports and at the alleged dumping of imported steel on the Australian market. Following investigations into complaints lodged by the industry, an undertaking was given by steel exporters of the Republic of Korea to export at a price which excluded any dumping margin. Investigation of alleged dumping from several European sources is nearing completion.</PARA>

In addition an amount of $140 ,000 was provided in the 1980-81 Budget, for detailed site investigations. Following an approach to the Prime Minister by the Chief Minister, Northern Territory, the Commonwealth Government in 1981 accepted in principle that the Northern Territory should take responsibility for conducting the work, subject to Northern Territory advice on standards, costs and time frame for a program. This financial year the Commonwealth is providing the Northern Territory with $ 200,000 to carry out investigative work to establish the standards to which rehabilitation is to be undertaken, the measures which are to be adopted, firm estimated costs and the time frame for undertaking the program.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be aware of the Prime Minister's recent statement that Soviet military occupation of Afghanistan was violating the most elementary laws of international behaviour. Does the Minister agree that the Soviet Union has done exactly the same for nearly all the years of its existence? Is the Minister aware that sporting teams and other delegations from Australia and elsewhere continue to visit the Soviet Union and maintain all manner of other links with the Soviet Union? Is it the intention of the Government to sever all these connections with the Soviet Union? If not, will the Government allow the same sort of contracts-I understand that it is called even-handedness-to be made with South Africa? Is the Minister aware that our trade with South Africa is actually increasing, that South African minerals are vital to the free world's economy and that South Africa is vital to Indian Ocean security? Does the Minister therefore agree that we should work at a better relationship with South Africa?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union's continuing occupation of Afghanistan and its disregard of the views of many countries have not given the international community any cause to discontinue its strong condemnation of what has occurred in Afghanistan. In these circumstances, and in view of recent events in Poland, the Government is not prepared to conduct normal bilateral relations with the Soviet Union and has made its position clear to the Soviet authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that, because of its invasion of Afghanistan, the Government has imposed a number of limitations on Australia's bilateral relations with the Soviet Union. These measures include the suspension of cultural, scientific, academic, trade union and sporting exchanges, a ban on the use of Australian ports by Soviet cruise vessels, the cessation of cooperation in fisheries and civil aviation matters, the cancellation of scheduled official talks and the suspension of official visits.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also true that notwithstanding this curtailment of bilateral relations, some Australian individuals, groups and teams have visited the Soviet Union in the period since Afghanistan. In some cases they have done so to represent Australia in multilateral activities. It is to be noted that the Government's measures against the Soviet Union are directed to bilateral exchanges: generally it is not the Government's intention that current policy towards the Soviet Union be allowed to detract from Australia's reputation and standing as a participant in important multilateral cooperation. In other cases some Australians may have visited the Soviet Union privately and in spite of the Government's policy. Their actions, where they contravened bilateral policy, are to be regretted, but the choice was theirs and the Government was not prepared to stand in their way, for example, by denying passports.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also imposes a number of limitations on Australia's relations with South Africa. It is not prepared to conduct a normal bilateral relationship with South Africa as long as that country continues to apply the policies of apartheid, which Australia rejects on moral, intellectual, political and strategic grounds. The limitations include the active discouragement of sporting contacts with South Africa, the strict upholding of an arms embargo against South Africa and the observance of UN resolutions which prohibit military and nuclear collaboration with South Africa. The Government does allow economic relations with South Africa to continue, but withholds avoidable official assistance to the conduct of those relations. The Government is aware that the value of Australian trade with South Africa has increased recently. The Government is also aware that South Africa has been endowed with great mineral wealth and that Western countries purchase large amounts of those minerals. The Government does not consider, however, that the extension to the non-white population of South Africa of political and social rights to which they are entitled would in any way prejudice the continuation of sales of South African minerals to Western countries. The Government also believes that South Africa has a role to play in the security of the southern African/Indian Ocean region. Its best contribution to this security would be to abandon the policy of apartheid which promotes political instability and uncertainty in the region , and provides opportunities for involvement in the region by the Soviet Union and its surrogates.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to oppose oppression and abuses of human rights wherever they occur, and is not prepared to seek an improvement in its relations with South Africa until that country moves to abandon the policy of apartheid.</PARA>

<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications. I preface it by reminding the Minister that on 18 November 1981 I raised with him the poor telephone communications between Palm Island and the mainland and Burketown and southern areas. The Minister promised to investigate the matter. Can the Minister now inform the Parliament what improvements to the telephone system have been made to these two centres?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Regarding Palm Island, Telecom has advised that although twenty-four hour access for the general community is restricted to the two public telephones, most public services (for example police, hospital, doctors) have full time access through after hours connections to Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has explained that intitial studies indicate that the cost of providing an automatic service to Palm Island would be between $300,000 and $ 500,000 depending on the extent of new cable reticulation required and the conditions under which it would be provided. Due to the many competing demands for funds it is unlikely that a higher priority can be placed on the provision of automatic service to Palm Island so that the current target is still the 1984-85 year. However, Telecom has arranged for a survey to be carried out whereby the communications needs of the island can be re-assessed. The results of this survey will be taken into account when future programmes are finalised.</PARA>
<PARA> The Burketown area is currently served by a manual exchange connected to the rest of the network by a single trunk circuit to Normanton.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the years Telecom has investigated a number of proposals to improve trunk access to Burketown and all are very costly. Upgrading the present physical route for example to provide for 3 or 12 channel working would cost about $200, 000 but would perpetuate the present maintenance problem.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom also considered a proposal to provide a five stage six channel radio system between Normanton and Burketown at a cost of about $1m. This would not have been completed before 1983-84 and would only have interconnected with the circuits on the single pair of open wires between Normanton and Cloncurry.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has made firm plans to install a major microwave radio route between Cloncurry and Normanton in 1983-84-85 at a cost of $3.25m. Telecom considers that the best solution to bring improved communications to Burketown subscribers is to provide a radio system for Burketown to connect with this microwave route at a point between Normanton and Cloncurry. This will require the prior completion of the microwave system and therefore could not be completed prior to 1985-86.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1275) Senator Lajovic asked the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Minister for Education noted an item appearing in the Saturday 17 April edition of the Sydney Morning Herald under the title of 'Strings wanted on State aid' in which it is alleged that a New South Wales Australian Labor Party platform committee has recommended that all private schools receiving State aid should be made to account publicly for the way they spend the funds received from State and private sources? Can the Minister inform the Senate what provisions exist, if any, for the public schools funded by Federal funds to account for the way in which they spend their funds and whether the public is in any way informed of the way this is being done?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Direct Commonwealth grants for primary and secondary schools are conditional on education authorities' agreement to pre-determine conditions. These conditions vary according to the type of grant and between the government and non-government sectors. They are set out annually in legislation governing the grants, that is the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Acts. In summary there are restrictions on the application of funds provided for capital works in the government sector to exclude the provisions of housing for teachers or other staff in capital cities. The use of other funds is restricted to meeting recurrent expenditure at or in connection with the operation of government schools, including recurrent expenditure for specific purposes, such as the teaching of English as a Second Language, the special education of handicapped students and disadvantaged schools.</PARA>
<PARA> In the non-government sector, capital grants may not have the sole or principal object of providing housing for teachers or other staff nor may they provide facilities for use in relation to religious worship. General recurrent grants are paid having regard to the needs of non-systemic schools or schools within an approved system of non-government schools. Other grants to non- government schools are paid for recurrent purposes, including recurrent expenditure for specific purposes, such as the teaching of English as a Second Language, the special education of handicapped students and disadvantaged schools or for minor capital expenditure which has been approved by the Commonwealth Minister for Education.</PARA>
<PARA> Where grants are provided for joint programs, that is, programs in which both the government and non-government sectors participate, recipients are required to expend funds in ways which accord with the objectives of the programs.</PARA>
<PARA> Once grants have been accepted and applied, education authorities are required to provide the Commonwealth with evidence that the predetermined conditions have been met. For government schools and for joint programs, each State is required to provide a certificate by an authorised person that the specified conditions applying to the grants have been fulfilled, together with a list of building and equipment projects and a summary of the application of recurrent grants. The accountability requirements applying to Commonwealth grants to non- government schools are more stringent and detailed than those applying to government schools. The approved authority for each non-government school must provide a certificate by a qualified accountant to the effect that the accountant is satisfied that the agreed conditions for each grant have been fulfilled. The Minister may also require the approved authority for each non- government school to furnish additional information in respect of the school should he wish to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> As soon as practical after the 30 June following the year in respect of which grants were paid, the Minister for Education is required to table in each house of Parliament a report on the application of funds by both government and non- government schools. This requirement has been met in respect of each Act administered by the Commonwealth Schools Commission since its inception. Thus the application of Commonwealth funds for school level education in both the government and non-government sectors is a matter of public record.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1345) Senator MacGibbon asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications. Have the severe backlogs reported last year in the connection of telephones in Queensland country areas and provincial cities been overcome? Is the Minister aware that the number of unsatisfied installations in Gladstone alone was estimated to be 500? Are adequate resources being devoted to this matter so that these fast growing, highly taxed areas, such as Gladstone are not disadvantaged?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom Australia has advised that the backlog in connection of telephones in Queensland country areas and provincial cities has not yet been overcome. During April the total country unsatisfied demand for service reached 15,100 of which 4,466 were deferred for 3 months or longer and 6,188 were in the process of being connected. The comparable figures for the same month in 1981 were 14, 649, 3,853 and 5,564 respectively. This increase in backlog has occurred despite the fact that 45,421 new services have been connected in the financial year to April compared with 44,649 over the same period of 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the city of Gladstone itself, Telecom has advised that during April the unsatisfied demand for service reached 515 of which 253 were deferred for longer than 3 months and 162 were in the process of being connected. This is an improvement in the position at June 1981 when the comparable figures were 609, 252 and 175.</PARA>
<PARA> During 1980-81, 1,365 new services were connected in the Gladstone district, 61 per cent of these being connected within 15 days of payment of fees. The latter figure has improved to 66 per cent in April 1982. It is estimated that 1 ,650 new services will be connected in the Gladstone district in the current financial year, an increase of 21 per cent over the figure for 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA> This improvement has been achieved by the injection of additional resources into the Gladstone area. Lines staff particularly have been transferred from Brisbane and interstate to assist with the abnormally high workload. Advertisements have been placed in all the major Australian newspapers seeking technical staff for Gladstone, and these have resulted in an encouraging response.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has given assurance that it is conscious of the need for special action to provide adequate communications facilities for high growth places such as Gladstone. The initiatives taken and effort expended in this direction will be continued until the backlog is reduced to a more acceptable level.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The hen levy forms an integral part of the present marketing arrangements for the egg industry. I would stress that these arrangements were implemented in 1965 at the request of the industry and the States to assist in stabilising egg production.</PARA>
<PARA> Under Commonwealth/State agreements the egg marketing boards in each State collect hen levy on behalf of the Commonwealth. The Australian Egg Board is not involved. The money collected is paid into a Trust Fund administered by the Department of Primary Industry and the bulk of it is returned to the States for use in providing assistance to the industry in that particular State.</PARA>
<PARA> Current arrangements involve two major elements, namely, State hen quotas, which are agreed upon by the Australian Agricultural Council, and the Commonwealth hen levy. The application of the hen levy, which, as stated above, was enacted at the specific request of the States, ensured that all producers contributed equally to the losses incurred in the disposal of surplus eggs, especially on the export market. This has helped to stabilise returns to producers, while the quotas, which are applied under State legislation, have assisted in restricting surpluses.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr A. Galea was arrested and jailed for several offences in relation to the arrest of Mrs Cassar by New South Wales police for unpaid fines and court costs . Dr Galea was fined $950 on 25 May 1982 in the Campbelltown, New South Wales, Court of Petty Sessions. It is understood that he has lodged an appeal in the District Court.</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Cassar was convicted in a New South Wales Court in 1978 for failure to submit returns of hen numbers as required in accordance with the Regulations under the Poultry Industry Levy Collection Act 1965 and fines and court costs totalling $220 were imposed on her. The returns referred to are required to be made each fortnight to the State Egg Board in connection with payment of the hen levy.</PARA>
<PARA> After an appeal against her conviction was disallowed the Deputy Commonwealth Crown Solicitor's Office in Sydney wrote to Mrs Cassar on several occasions seeking payment of the fines and costs involved but received no reply. A Warrant of Committal was sought from and issued by a New South Wales Court in February 1982. It was then a matter for the New South Wales police to carry out the Warrant.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1657), Senator Townley asked me, as Acting Treasurer, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Acting Treasurer. It follows an article in today's Australian about Sir Roderick Carnegie's speech at the annual conference of the National Farmers' Federation. Does the Minister agree with Sir Roderick Carnegie's assessment that Australia is going into debt as a nation to maintain an unearned current living standard and that its international credit rating is at risk, as he intimated?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The address by Sir Roderick Carnegie to which the honourable senator referred contained, inter alia, the following arguments:</PARA>
<PARA> that Australia has had a deficit on the current account of its balance of payments for the last 25 years and has thus been going into debt over that period to maintain an unearned living standard;</PARA>
<PARA> that there would be comparatively little need to be concerned about our growing overseas debt if our borrowings were adding to productive assets. Unfortunately, this is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA> The following responses may be made to these arguments:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) It is natural for a country like Australia, with the limited domestic savings, but substantial real resources awaiting development, to have borrowed overseas to help finance that development. If such overseas borrowings had not occurred the rate of growth in Australia would have been lower and/or standards of living of Australians would have been lower. In these circumstances the continuing current account deficit has simply reflected the fact that we are drawing on overseas resources (financial and real) to supplement our own savings in developing the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) It is important that, over time, these overseas borrowings are able to be serviced out of increased productivity, including exports of goods and services made possible by the economic development of Australia. This can occur in a direct fashion as, in the past, in the case of iron ore and, more recently in cases like coal and aluminium. But even where the investment is not immediately export oriented, increased capital inflow means more capital available in Australia for all kinds of investment, including export oriented or import competing industries. The connection does not have to be a direct one. Provided the Government's macro-economic policies-fiscal, monetary and external-are soundly based, the economy will generate sufficient production and foreign exchange to service the overseas debt.</PARA>
<PARA> The following ratios of property income payable overseas to exports of goods and services suggests that, in fact, capital inflow has not run ahead of our ability to meet servicing obligations.</PARA>
<PARA> RATIO OF PROPERTY INCOME PAYABLE OVERSEAS (EXCLUDING UNDISTRIBUTED INCOME) TO EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES</PARA>
<PARA>%</PARA>
<PARA>1956-7 to 1960-1  9.0</PARA>
<PARA>1961-2 to 1965-6  9.4</PARA>
<PARA>1966-7 to 1970-1  10.6</PARA>
<PARA>1971-2 to 1975-6  9.6</PARA>
<PARA>1976-7 to 1980-1  9.3</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Of course there will be variations in these ratios from year to year. For instance, the ratios will tend to be relatively high in years when capital inflow and related servicing costs are relatively high because the subsequent increase in exports of goods and services to time lags. Then again the ratios will tend to be relatively high in years when world trade is sluggish because these tend to be years of relatively low exports.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) For both these reasons the ratio was high in 1980-1 (the last year for which complete data are available); it was around 10 per cent. It should be noted however that the ratio exceeded 10 per cent in nine of the last 25 years. The 1981-2 figure, when available, is again likely to be relatively high for the same reasons as in 1980-1.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to Sir Roderick Carnegie's apparent view that Australia's credit rating is at risk.</PARA>
<PARA> The international financial journal Institutional Investor produces a list of countries ranked in order of its assessment of credit ratings. The March 1982 list ranks Australia as number six in a list of 103 countries. Indeed, Australia has gone up two places from eighth to sixth since these ratings were published in March 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps a more decisive argument is that foreign investment (excluding undistributed income) in enterprises in Australia reached $A4.8 billion in 1980 -1, and significantly more than that in 1981-2. These are record figures and would seem to suggest that there is, in fact, great confidence in Australia among overseas investors at this time.</PARA>

<PARA> Does Telecom Australia pursue a deliberate practice of restricting the provision of public telephones in new locations? Is it a practice of Telecom to suggest that organisations should lease a red coin-operated telephone when representations are made for the provision of a public telephone in an area where a demand for such public telephones obviously exists? Has Telecom's pursuit of profits made it neglect its obligation to provide acceptable services to the community?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's policy is to provide public telephones in locations where they best serve the community and receive sufficient use to offset, to a reasonable degree, the high cost of their provision and maintenance. Telecom points out that substantial losses are incurred with the public telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not Telecom's practice to suggest that leased coin telephones be provided in lieu of public telephones in areas where there is a specific community need which can only be met by a public telephone installation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 May 1982 (Hansard, page 1911) Senator MacGibbon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry inform the Senate of the latest stage in the negotiations with the United States of America in relation to Australia's sugar exports to that country? Is there any truth in the rumour that last year's exports, which totalled 811,000 tonnes and thereby made the United States Australia's most important sugar export market, are likely to be reduced to under one half that level? If reductions are introduced, when will they apply and will they take into account any tonnage shipped this calendar year? Finally, can the Minister assure the Senate that the Government will do everything it can to protect the interests of the Australian sugar industry?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer the honourable senator to my reply to a recent question without notice from Senator Button (Senate Hansard, page 2370 of 25 May 1982) and make the following additional comments. Sugar import quotas were proclaimed by President Reagan on 6 May 1982. Whilst I do not welcome the introduction by the United States of import restrictions on sugar, I recognise that individual country allocations are being based on each exporter's average share of the United States market in recent years. They thus will reflect actual performamce in the United States sugar market. The initial and subsequent allocations which had been announced by 15 June were as follows:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2021) Senator Walters asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning the tar content of cigarettes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The cigarette filters referred to in the honourable senator's question are by- pass filters. The first and only brand on sale so far in Australia with this type of filter is 'Barclay', which has been trial-marketed from selected outlets in Brisbane from January 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> At a meeting with officers of the Departments of Health and Science and Technology (Australian Government Analytical Laboratories-AGAL) on 21 April 1982, representatives of a tobacco comany informally expressed their concern that by-pass filter cigarettes yield lower tar levels under machine testing conditions than those developed in human smoking conditions, because human lips occlude the air filter outlets, thereby reducing the dilution of the smoke that is drawn through the cigarette.</PARA>
<PARA> It may be true that the present collaborative AGAL/industry cigarette testing method and machines-which conform to the International Standards Organisation standard-will not provide valid, comparable test results for by-pass filter cigarettes. My Department and AGAL therefore have technical aspects of the matter under review and relevant information is being obtained from the United Kingdom. The implications for tar and nicotine yield labelling of cigarette packets-to be introduced no later than August 1982 under the requirements of the Voluntary Code in Respect of CPM ('Tar') and Nicotine Labelling on Cigarette Packaging-are also under investigation.</PARA>
<PARA> A change to the testing method prescribed by the Code-to which all cigarette manufacturers and importers of cigarettes in Australia are signatories-would be considered on the basis of a 'universal' request from industry. I should emphasise here however, that industry has responsibility to ensure no breaches of the Voluntary Code, the operation of which will be monitored by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department and AGAL will continue to collaborate to ensure that labelling requirements are fulfilled on the basis of scientifically valid and comparable test results.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services to an article in today's Australian concerning the construction of a new national police college in Perth. Is it a fact that by choosing to build the college in Perth construction costs will be 10 times higher than they would have been for the Canberra alternative? Why has Perth been chosen as the site for such a national college, especially in view of its distance from Australia's major population centres? In view of the rather more central position of Adelaide and the depressed state of the building and construction industry in South Australia, will the Government give consideration to building the college in Adelaide?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The variation in costs referred to in the Australian of 18 May 1982 relates to two of the options for the location of the Australian Police College which have been under consideration by the Australian Police Ministers' Council. The comparison is not the difference in construction costs between the two locations but rather the difference in relocation costs on the basis of the Canberra option only involving alterations to an existing building, against the Perth option involving a new building designed specifically as a police college .</PARA>
<PARA> The location of common national police facilities is influenced by the Commonwealth Government's federalism policy. To date the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence has been located in Canberra and it has been agreed to locate the National Exchange of Police Information in Sydney and the National Police Research Unit in Adelaide.</PARA>

<PARA> Recently I drew to the attention of the Minister for Administrative Services the matter of stolen trucks in Australia. My information, which came from a constituent who has spent many years working in the road transport industry, is that some 160 heavy road trucks were stolen and not recovered in Australia during the last three years. Some trucks that have been recovered indicated that the trucks are changed in such a professional way as to make them virtually unrecognisable to the original owner and that they are invariably resold in a different State from that in which they were stolen. My suggestion was that this could be the subject of discussions between State and Federal Ministers responsible for police. Can the Minister tell me the outcome of those discussions?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> During March the subject of stolen trucks was brought to the attention of the Honourable R. J. Hinze, MLA, Queensland Minister for Police and then Chairman of the Australian Police Ministers' Council. Because of the number of items already on the agenda for the Council meeting on 21 May, however, Mr Hinze decided to refer the matter directly to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI). One of the functions of the ABCI is to identify persons and practices which warrant investigation and to refer them to the relevant police commissioners for appropriate action.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is Government policy to introduce as much flexibility as is practicable into any system of Government regulation. This is the case with the transfer provisions of import quotas. Allowing quotas to be transferable provides an avenue for new-importers to enter the market and enables individual quota holders to expand or contract their quota holdings on the basis of their commercial judgements made in the light of market trends.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) While some importers hold considerably more quota than others this often reflects past import patterns or company takeovers. There is no evidence to suggest that the methods used in quota allocation lead to monopolies of quota holders. It also needs to be remembered that imports entering under quota must compete with the products of the local industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Prices paid for quota reflect the purchaser's assessment of market conditions and prospects, including competitiveness against local production, rather than an ability to increase prices per se. Moreover, where quotas are sold at tender, the premiums paid and the tariff duty applied have the effect of transferring to the Government, and hence the community at large, some of the benefits which might otherwise accrue to quota holders.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government's policy is to encourage quotas to be fully utilised and this was one of the main reasons why quota transfer provisions were introduced. Where a quota is purchased at tender, as in the case of certain textile, clothing and footwear items, securities lodged by quota holders are forfeited if quotas are not utilised. In the case of passenger motor vehicles, penalties apply if quotas are under-utilised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) 'The Commonwealth and State Government Collaborative Soil Conservation Study 1975-77', released in April 1978, estimated the cost of treating and controlling land degradation at $675m in 1975 prices.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The 1975-77 Collaborative Study found that about half of the agricultural and pastoral land in Australia required some form of treatment. No comparative and comprehensive study has since been made.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Soil conservation is a responsibility of the States and the allocation of priorities is a matter for the States.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) While farm management and soil conservation practices may minimise land degradation, it needs to be recognised that agricultural development can involve an acceleration of natural land degradation. Land degradation would, of itself, lead to reduced production in most circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> Rural development in Australia has resulted in a steady significant growth in total production and, with due attention to soil protection, this production can be maintained. However, the Collaborative Study indicates that, across the rural production areas of Australia, degradation ranges from minimal, where soil protection measures are highly effective, to the point where production is impossible.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) I am advised that it has never been Mr Katter's intention to imply that the Federal Government should legislate to introduce random breath testing throughout Australia.

The Commonwealth is, however, concerned with road safety because of the national economic and social issues involved and because of its role in relation to the roads infrastructure.

<PARA> Difficulties have been experienced on occasions in meeting these standards largely due to the diversion of staff to training for the recently introduced new technology exchanges and peak loads related to occasions such as Mother's Day and the visits of United States Navy Personnel to Perth.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The International Manual Service is provided by new technology facilities at the Wellington Exchange in Perth, enabling operators to set up calls in less time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most consignments of surgical dressings imported into Australia, since interim controls were introduced late last year, have been required to be tested for microbiological contamination. The exception is goods which are supplied unsterilized to some hospitals, since these hospitals sterilize the dressings prior to their medical use-a long-accepted practice in the trade.</PARA>
<PARA> The testing of imported dressings which are required to be sterile must comply with 'Guidelines on tests for sterility' laid down in an Appendix to the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Therapeutic Goods. If a satisfactory outcome is not achieved, goods must be resterilized then retested.</PARA>
<PARA> Imported dressings which are not required to be sterile must be tested in three different media to detect Clostridia species, gram negative organisms and staphylococci respectively. Dressings failing tests must be decontaminated and retested.</PARA>
<PARA> Discussions are in progress with industry to develop permanent control mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA> Although goods manufactured in Australia are not subject to import controls, it is understood that local manufacturers are voluntarily carrying out such testing before release of their goods for sale.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is difficult to determine the history of arsenic dipping in Australia with great accuracy. It is known that dips based on sodium arsenite have been used in Queensland for control of cattle tick from about the turn of the century . Initially these were prepared by the cattlemen themselves, at first it seems on their own initiative, but later guided by recipes published by the State Department of Primary Industries. Proprietary dips began to apppear during the 30s and records show that 43 concentrates were registered for use on cattle in 1938. Forty of these were liquid arsenic dipping concentrates. Records prior to 1938 are no longer available .</PARA>
<PARA> Report No. 1 of the Joint Blowfly Committee was published in 1933 and gave a recipe for home-made arsenical jetting fluid. It suggested that one of the proprietary arsenical sheep dips could be used as an alternative. This shows that proprietary arsenical sheep dips were marketed prior to the creation of registration authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Agricultural Gazette contained recipes for home-made calcium arsenite and sodium arsenite jetting mixtures as recently as 1947. Home- made jetting fluids were recommended by the Department of Agriculture on the grounds of economy.</PARA>
<PARA> When the New South Wales Stock Medicines Board was created in 1940 arsenic sheep dips were by far the most popular products for control of lice on sheep. Unfortunately, the early records of the Board are not readily available.</PARA>
<PARA> It is safe to assume that existing arsenical sheep dips were registered as the various stock medicines boards were established. That was 1933 in Queensland, 1938 in Victoria and Tasmania, 1940 in New South Wales and South Australia, and 1953 in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Sheep dips and all other stock medicines have to be registered under the relevant legislation in each State where they are offered for sale. Registration is a complex process in which the efficacy and safety are evaluated, the claims and directions are judged and appropriate labelling is laid down. Registrations have to be renewed either annually or every three years, depending on the State.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There are no official statistics from which to determine the quantities of liquid arsenic sheep dips used in Australia. Australian Bureau of Statistics have published information which shows that factory door value of arsenical sheep and cattle dips (which include liquid arsenic dips) produced in Australia ranged from $1,391,000 in 1963 to $2,045,000 in 1978 (the latest figures available). Unofficial estimates indicate that much less than 10 per cent of the sheep population would be treated in liquid arsenical dip.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Registration of agricultural chemicals and veterinary drugs is a legislative responsibility of State governments. The Department of Primary Industry has no statutory authority in this area. However, since 1967 the Department has been contributing in a co-ordinating capacity by virtue of its participation in the Technical Committee on Veterinary Drugs, a subsidiary of the Australian Agricultural Council. This has not called for any great input into the regulatory control of arsenical dips or other products registered and in use prior to 1967.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Primary Industry does not advise primary producers about potential toxic hazards from dipping nor does it monitor dips. Contact with individual farmers and provision of extension and other services at farm level is a State function.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Liquid arsenical sheep dips are formulated in Australia from ingredients which are largely imported.</PARA>
<PARA> A variety of companies have marketed liquid arsenical sheep dips over the past 15-20 years but currently only Merck Sharpe and Dohme, Robert Young and Company and Western Stock Development Company market liquid arsenic dips.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Apart from liquid and powder arsenic sheep dips and one or two liquid arsenic cattle dips there are a number of other arsenic products registered as agricultural chemicals:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Lead arsenate is registered as an insecticide. Sodium arsenite, arsenic pentoxide, arsenic trioxide and DSMA (organic) are registered as herbicides. Copper, chrome, arsenic mixtures are registered as fungicides for timber preservation. Sodium arsenite is registered as a skin and hide preservative.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) All such products for use in agriculture must comply with the requirements of State Poisons Acts, which specify the labelling and packaging appropriate to the hazard involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Roche Maag Limited, Ramsay and Treganowan Ltd, Kendon Chemical and Mfg Co. Pty Ltd, and Koppers Australia Pty are some of the companies producing arsenical products other than sheep and cattle dips.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) R&amp;T Arsenate of Lead Power Insecticide, Kendon Arsenate of Lead Insecticide , Lane Arzeen Herbicide, Lane Camellia Weed Killer (Arsenical), Lane Hide and Skin Preservative, Tanalith CP Wood Preservative Paste and Tanalith AG Wood Preservative Paste</PARA>
<PARA>are some of the trade names of arsenical products other than sheep and cattle dips.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The ultimate responsibility for monitoring safe use of agricultural chemicals rests with State health and agricultural authorities. Through the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian Agricultural Council and a number of their subsidiary committees however, the Commonwealth is enabled to co-ordinate the State activities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The concept that plutonium separated from spent fuel from civilian nuclear reactors might be used for nuclear weapons has been identified within the United States Administration as only one of a number of possibilities for overcoming a potential shortfall later this decade of plutonium for the United States nuclear weapons program.</PARA>
<PARA> On 8 April 1982, in response to an Australian approach on this matter, the United States advised that it is the United States Department of Energy's policy to meet the military authorities' special nuclear materials requirements through the use of dedicated government production facilities-not by extracting fissile products from the civil fuel cycle.</PARA>
<PARA> The United States reply continued that, for the future, the United States Government has no plans to employ material generated in the civil nuclear sector in the United States military program. Given the importance of maintaining a clear distinction between the peaceful and the military uses of nuclear energy, as well as the serious domestic and non-proliferation implications of such a step, the United States Government would consider such an action only if absolutely essential for national security. Moreover, such a measure would have to be approached at the highest levels of the government, and the views of Congress would be sought and carefully weighted in the decision-making process. The United States response also confirmed that the agreement between Australia and the United States concerning peaceful uses of nuclear energy clearly and specifically limits the use of Australia-origin material to peaceful, non- explosive uses.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) See the text of the extract from the press briefing given on 8 October 1981 by the United States Secretary of Energy, Dr James Edwards, quoted in the paper incorporated in Hansard by the Minister for National Development and Energy on 28 April 1982 (Senate Hansard, pp. 1580-2).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No United States Administration official has given Congressional testimony in favour of the idea of using civil spent fuel for nuclear weapons purposes. Some officials have, however, testified against specific Congressional proposals to outlaw the use of civil spent fuel for weapons purposes, but such testimony was based on the general argument against limiting the future freedom of action of the United States.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer the Minister to the statement made on Friday last by the Minister for Communications in which he directed that Telecom Australia was not to proceed with the development of a viewdata system. Can the Minister inform the Senate whether it is correct that of all the countries which have now introduced viewdata systems, Australia is the first in which the system will be provided by private enterprise and not by the common telecommunications carrier of the nation concerned? Is it not a fact that Australia will be the first country in which the technical equipment will be provided by one or two sources and the information to be displayed on the system will be provided by the same sources? In other words, is it not a fact that in all other countries there is separation of the equipment itself from the sources of information? As the Minister has said in his statement that the decision was made to help Telecom with its cash flow problems, can he give the Senate the total projected cost to Telecom of viewdata and at the same time the annual capital investment figure by Telecom?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Videotex systems are provided by both private enterprise, and Government telecommunications carriers in overseas countries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1811) Senator Thomas asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been brought to my notice that procedures to react to the dumping of manufactured goods in Australia are so complicated that nine months or even twelve months can elapse between when a complaint is received and when action can be taken. This must be of considerable concern to some local manufacturers. Will the Government investigate ways of streamlining procedures even to the extent, which I believe to be possible, of establishing a system which can stop goods entering this country even if there is a chance at all of their contravening anti-dumping laws?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's anti-dumping legislation accords with the principles and practices for anti-dumping action that have been agreed in the GATT. Australia is currently a member of the GATT Anti-Dumping Code and has announced its intention to accede to the revised GATT Code which arose from the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. The codes are designed to prevent anti-dumping practices forming an unjustifiable barrier to trade and ensure the effective and equitable resolution of dumping disputes.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department maintains offices in London, New York, Tokyo, Auckland and Hong Kong. Their major role is to assist in anti-dumping investigations by carrying out the essential task of ascertaining normal values in the country of export, whether by suitably adjusted open market price or by cost of production. Their location in the major centres of trade to Australia is designed to speed up enquiries by carrying out investigations of overseas exporters in relation to the price in the country of export. The location of the offices in the major centres of trade to Australia is of considerable benefit in obtaining such information quickly.</PARA>
<PARA> The general downturn in the world economy has contributed to an increase in dumping complaints over recent months. Such downturns are usually characterised by very competitive international marketing, including the practice of dumping, as overseas producers find it difficult to maintain traditional market shares and consequently redirect their activities to newer markets.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department has recently allocated 5 extra staff to the dumping area, imposed target date discipline on all new cases and extended the time taken for the holding of cash securities to 120 days. These actions should ensure that Australian industry will obtain speedy coverage under the anti-dumping legislation. In addition information seminars on dumping legislation and procedures are being held so that the commercial community is made fully aware of what protective measures are available against dumped imports.</PARA>
<PARA> In the past there have been occasions when dumping investigations were delayed due to workload peaks or when technical difficulties emerged in borderline cases. In general however they took much less than the nine to twelve months suggested.</PARA>
<PARA> However, where sufficient justification in the way of dumping and injury is evident, local industry receives immediate relief by the imposition of cash securities on imports of the suspected dumped goods until the investigation is completed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 March 1982 (Hansard, page 700) Senator Button asked the then Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has his attention been drawn to reports of long delays in Customs clearance at Sydney Airport and minimal checks for prohibited imports due to Government imposed staff ceilings? Is it true that some Customs officers are working up to 16 hours a day for six days a week and are earning $1000 a week including overtime payments? Is it also a fact that the present staff ceiling of 123 officers was established eight years ago and that it is estimated that at least twice as many people would be needed to handle traffic at the airport? I might say that I have seen examples of this with women accompanied by up to three young children waiting for three and a half hours to get through Customs. Is this another example of inefficiency because of the imposition of arbitrary staff ceilings without examining the particular functions to be performed?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that delays do occur during Immigration and Customs clearance. Within the restraints upon manpower resources, staff rosters must be designed with a view to minimising waste during periods of minimal activity but also applying maximum effort in times of peak traffic. The situation is exacerbated when workload peaks are further extended by factors such as the arrival of aircraft off-schedule which are outside the control of the Customs.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is true that some officers have worked 16 hour days on occasions when they have voluntarily changed shifts with other officers and thereby performed a double shift, no recorded instance has been found of any officer working 16 hours a day for 6 days. Also, there is no recorded instance of an officer consistently earning in excess of $1000 per week.</PARA>
<PARA> There were, however, four cases of significant earnings by Preventive Officers at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport during the last Christmas period when other officers were on leave and when the officers involved were paid double time for extensive overtime worked on public holidays and rostered days off.</PARA>
<PARA> Eight years ago, there were 117 Customs Preventive staff at Sydney (Kingsford- Smith) Airport. Since May 1981 there have been 120. Some minor variations at different ranks have occurred within that total. However, selective examination techniques have been developed to cater for increased passenger traffic.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not accepted that only minimal checks are carried out. Every effort is made to utilise available Customs staff resources to the best advantage whilst ensuring that essential controls are maintained. Further, the Department is in the process of restructuring the Australian Customs Service with a view to increasing the skills of its officers and obtaining more flexible use of staff resources to respond to changing priorities based on risk assessment.</PARA>
<PARA> The need to maintain these Customs controls is balanced by the desire to facilitate the movement of passengers through airport terminals. There exists within the present processing procedures a system to assist the early clearance of the elderly, the infirm and passengers with young children. These procedures rely on airline personnel, however, to identify and bring such instances to the notice of the Customs supervisor.</PARA>
<PARA> The passenger processing system is currently the subject of a comprehensive joint review by the Department of Industry and Commerce and other affected Departments. As an example of this review a trial has already been undertaken at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) and Brisbane airports to stream Australian and New Zealand passport holders away from other passengers arriving at the Primary Immigration and Customs clearance barrier.</PARA>
<PARA> Other methods of speeding up passenger clearance procedures are continually being explored.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 March 1982 (Hansard, page 861) Senator Mason asked me a question without notice seeking information on conditional approval for the development of the Jabiluka uranium deposit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Mason stated that the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, had said in regard to Jabiluka that although the minimum requirement of 75 per cent of Australian equity and control had not yet been met, that condition would be satisfied before commercial production began, and he sought further information on how this could be achieved and on current equity arrangements. He also sought an assurance that production at Jabiluka would not begin until satisfactory arrangements had been agreed to by the Northern Land Council.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer Senator Mason to the Minister for Trade and Resources' statement of 16 March on the Jabiluka uranium project. He will note that the Minister in fact said that the Treasurer had approved the foreign investment arrangements for the Jabiluka project subject to a number of conditions accepted by the project partners which will ensure that the Government's policy of a minimum of 75 per cent Australian equity and Australian control in new uranium projects will be met by the time commercial production commences.</PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements for the development of the Jabiluka uranium project were examined by the Foreign Investment Review Board in August last year. As a result of this examination the Government decided to give foreign investment approval for the project on the basis of undertakings by the participants that the project will be 75 per cent Australian owned and Australian controlled by the time production commences.</PARA>
<PARA> At present, Jabiluka is 65 per cent owned by Pancontinental Mining Limited, an Australian controlled public company, and 35 per cent owned by Getty Oil Development Company Limited of the United States. Pancontinental operates and controls the project. Accordingly, the project already satisfied the Government 's policy requirement that new uranium projects be Australian controlled.</PARA>
<PARA> However, in order to satisfy the Government's Australian equity guidelines, Getty Oil is required to divest 10 per cent of its equity in the project to Australians. It has given an unequivocal undertaking to the Government that it will do so as soon as possible and, at the latest, before production from the mine begins. Regular discussions are being held with the Foreign Investment Review Board to ensure that satisfactory progress is made in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to arrangements with the Northern Land Council, the Minister for Trade and Resources' statement of 16 March 1982 indicated that approval of the project was conditional upon the project partners concluding an agreement with the Northern Land Council on the terms and conditions under which development might proceed. Agreement between the parties was reached on 29 June, and a formal agreement is being prepared for consideration by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in accordance with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1442) Senator Jessop asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to a recent article in the Adelaide Advertiser which indicated that Adelaide could run out of vacant top quality office space in major city buildings by the end of the year. Is the Minister aware that it was also suggested that the shortage of accommodation will result in rapidly increased rentals? In light of this, can the Minister inform the Senate, firstly, of the amount of floor space occupied by Federal Government departments and instrumentalities in Adelaide? Secondly, can he inform the Senate of the annual rental bill for this accommodation? I would also appreciate it if he could tell me when the rental for such accommodation is due for review. In light of the acute shortage of office space in Adelaide, will the Government re-examine the decision with respect to the construction of a Commonwealth office block in Adelaide, thereby enabling accommodation to be more readily available and also providing a much needed boost to the construction industry in South Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that in 1981 there was a record supply of new office space in Adelaide Central Business District and although absorption of this space was in excess of previous years there was a carryover of office space in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> I am also advised that although the amount of new top quality office space is considered to be limited at the present time, this does not reflect the overall office accommodation situation in Adelaide. There is currently a significant surplus of office space in Adelaide and major refurbishments of several buildings are scheduled for completion later this year.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth departments and authorities, excluding those exempt from the Lands Acquisition Act, occupy a combination of Commonwealth-owned and leased accommodation in Adelaide and its suburbs. The breakup between owned and leased accommodation and the gross annual rental of the leased accommodation is set out below:</PARA>
<PARA> Area in square metres</PARA>
<PARA>Owned Leased Total Rental</PARA>

<PARA> TOTAL  34,435 120,066 154,501 10,535,941</PARA>
<PARA> With reference to rental reviews, these vary between leases. In general the rentals for the various leases included in the foregoing table will fall due for review between now and the end of 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision by the Government to defer the construction of a Commonwealth Office Block in Adelaide was taken as a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions and with regard to the total capital works commitment throughout Australia. The aim of the Government to establish a Commonwealth Centre in Adelaide remains. However, it should be noted that not all of the Commonwealth employees occupying the accommodation included in the above table would be moved to the proposed Commonwealth Centre.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1660) Senator Button asked me, as the Minister representing the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the Senate, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question refers to a statement made by the Minister in the Senate last night that on 22 April the former Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar, paid duty on a television set which he brought into Australia in October last year. I ask the Minister: Is it not a fact that duty and penalty under the Customs Act and Regulations are payable within 24 hours of the transhipment through the point of entry of the goods in question? Is it not the normal procedure that if such duty and penalty are not paid within 24 hours the person is proceeded against by way of summons? Would the Minister advise the Senate whether there are any exceptions to that procedure provided by the Act and Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> No. It is not a fact that duty and penalty under the Customs Act and Regulations are payable within 24 hours of delivery of the goods for home consumption.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not a fact that normal procedures are that, if such duty and penalty are not paid within 24 hours, the person is proceeded against by way of summons.</PARA>
<PARA> The only provisions relating to payment of duty and penalty in combination with one another are those contained in section 209 of the Customs Act. Where pursuant to those provisions goods have been impounded and the requisite notice given, the person has 21 days within which to pay the duty and penalty.</PARA>
<PARA> If in those circumstances, duty and penalty are not paid within the prescribed time, the impounded goods are deemed to have been seized and forfeited to the Crown. Where goods are so deemed to have been seized, it would not be usual to institute prosecution proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 209 has no application where goods on which duty is payable have been delivered without duty having been paid.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr MacKellar tendered to the Department an amount calculated on the basis of the provisions in Section 209. This money has been accepted by the Department, and the payment has been treated as resolving the matter finally, on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department that this course of action was appropriate .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 4 May 1982 (Hansard, page 1768) Senator Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact that the Minister for Communications asked for a VIP aircraft to fly him from Tamworth to Canberra yesterday morning and that the aircraft developed a malfunction at Tamworth? Did a second VIP aircraft that was sent to Tamworth with a maintenance crew then fly the Minister back to Canberra? It is also a fact that two commercial flights were available from Tamworth at the time of the VIP incidents?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> On 3 May 1982, a RAAF Mystere 20 aircraft, en route to Canberra, with the Minister for Communications on board, developed a hydraulic malfunction during take-off at Tamworth. The take-off was aborted safely, without incident, and the aircraft returned to the airport terminal.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the normal procedures for unserviceable RAAF aircraft, the captain of the Mystere requested technical personnel assistance from 34 Squadron, Canberra. As the most expeditious means of providing the assistance, a second RAAF Mystere was asked to fly the maintenance personnel to Tamworth. This aircraft arrived at Tamworth two hours after the initial incident.</PARA>
<PARA> The maintenance personnel remained at Tamworth to repair the unserviceable aircraft, while the second Mystere returned to Canberra with the Minister for Communications on board.</PARA>
<PARA> The first available flight out of Tamworth that day was scheduled to leave at 2.30 p.m. to arrive in Canberra at 4.45 p.m. the next one was at 5.15 p.m. due to arrive in Canberra at 8.15 p.m. Neither of these was a direct flight.</PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements as pursued by 34 Squadron enabled the Minister to leave Tamworth in the replacement aircraft at 1.50 p.m., arriving in Canberra at 2.40 p.m.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2323) Senator Evans asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister in the Senate, a question without notice concerning the Prime Minister's discussions in the Republic of Korea on the question of human rights. The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot accept the honourable senator's assertion that I failed to press the issue of human rights during my visit to South Korea. As the Age article to which he refers reports, I raised the issue on more than one occasion. I discussed the question in formal talks with both the President and the Prime Minister, and in my address at the dinner hosted by Prime Minister Yoo on 24 May, I made the point that there is strength in tolerance and diversity and that the wider the opportunity for minorities to give free expression to their views, the greater the security for any nation.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree with the senator that the record of the Government in the South is almost indistinguishable from that of its Northern neighbour. The closed and totalitarian political system in North Korea permits no degree of personal freedom and indeed, its belligerence towards the Government in Seoul has been a major factor in influencing that Government's attitude towards domestic dissent . In spite of the pressures that the hostility of North Korea has placed on Seoul to maintain massive defence expenditure, South Korea has enjoyed remarkable economic progress and its Government has done much to improve the standard of life of its people.</PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that a lessening of tensions between the two Koreas would have a beneficial impact on both the economy and the human rights situation in South Korea. For this to occur, however, there would need to be a marked change in the attitude of the Government in Pyongyang which has consistently rejected proposals for improving relations put to it by the Republic of Korea.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2494) Senator Sibraa asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning relics at the North Head quarantine station.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA> Following the allegations in the Manly Daily of theft of items from the station, the Department of Health asked the Australian Federal Police to investigate the matter. A report from the Officer-in-Charge of the Federal Police, Eastern Division, states that an investigation was undertaken and revealed that there was no substance to the allegations. A complete stocktake of items revealed no discrepancy between those currently at the station and those that have been in stock for the last 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar, was very interested in the future of the relics held at the station and was concerned to see that they are safeguarded after the station land is handed over to New South Wales. I share this concern. To this end, both my Department and I are willing to co-operate in appropriate arrangements to ensure the future safety of the collection. However, an aspect of this matter that has not received much publicity is the fact that the station is a fully operational human quarantine station. About eighty persons each year are quarantined at the station and must be isolated from any visitors. Care must therefore be taken to ensure that visits to the station are kept to a minimum and that numbers of visitors are restricted. Within this essential constraint, I will continue to co-operate fully with the New South Wales authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that restricted access to the station has already been granted on a number of occasions and properly authorised persons will continue to be admitted to the station while on official business. A most co-operative attitude has already been adopted towards the future managers of the station and the honourable senator may be assured that this spirit of co-operation will continue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2501) Senator Watson asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate. His question concerned leaving the ban on steroid-type hormones until their long term effects on human or animal health is examined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied me with the following additional information:</PARA>
<PARA> While both Australian Agricultural Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council have had policies recommending against the use of hormonal growth promotants, it is not entirely accurate to describe them as a ban.</PARA>
<PARA> These policies were introduced to prevent the growth promotant use of stilbene compounds such as diethylstilboestrol and hexoestrol in the interests of overseas trade in meat and dairy products and this objective has been achieved during the past two decades. Curently, the State authorities refuse to register any stilbenes for growth promotion of food producing animals.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate may be assured that no hormonal growth promotants, steroidal or otherwise, will be approved for use on Australian livestock until all regulatory authorities are completely satisfied regarding their safety for consumers of meat from treated animals and for the safety of the animals themselves.</PARA>
<PARA> The only hormonal-type chemical so far approved for limited growth promotant use on cattle in Australia is the non-steroidal compound zeranol.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) As the Prime Minister said in his statement in the House on 30 April 1981 concerning the Review of Commonwealth Functions, that Review was much more than an expenditure review exercise. He pointed out that many of the decisions, such as those involving contracting out to the private sector, do not have immediate expenditure savings as their principal objective.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister went on to say, however, that the Government had regarded the Review as making an important contribution to the objective of further reining in government spending.</PARA>
<PARA> The stated immediate aims of the Review were to streamline and fine down Commonwealth operations, including by withdrawing from functions more appropriately handled by private enterprise. Activities of a commercial kind were seen as generally best performed in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government took the view that we would all be better off in a material sense by establishing a more limited, a more realistic, role for government, giving room for private sector growth.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister also indicated that the decisions flowing from the Review would contribute to the further pursuit by the Government of a number of economic objectives including lower inflation. He emphasised that the Government had given high priority to reducing the Commonwealth deficit.</PARA>
<PARA> Attention of the honourable senator is also drawn to the answers already given to Questions 723, 1258, 1714 and 1741.</PARA>
<PARA> Against this background I would add only the following comments. Cost/benefit analyses are, on appropriate occasions, a useful part of the decision-making processes of government, which must necessarily take account of a wide range of considerations. Secondly, it is of course a continuing responsibility of governments to review departmental operations in the light of on-going expenditures and other relevant factors. And thirdly, the use of competitive processes inherent in contracting-out to the private sector should contribute to locating the best value contractor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a), (b) and (c) The review conducted by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations in 1977, to which the honourable senator refers, confirmed the existence of penal provisions in certain pieces of legislation in the States and Territories of Australia. New South Wales provided written information on 2 August 1977 and verbal confirmation of the existence of penal provisions in its legislation on 12 September 1977, Queensland provided written confirmation on 20 June 1977 and the Department of the Northern Territory provided written confirmation on 21 October 1977. However, the existence of obligations which might be applicable to Australia under the Convention depends on there being a ' dependent indigenous population' in Australia within the meaning of that term as used in the Convention. A more recent review by the then Department of Industrial Relations has shown that there is agreement in both State and Commonwealth jurisdictions that while Aboriginals are 'indigenous' they do not as a group constitute a 'dependent indigenous population' within the meaning of the Convention as opined by the appropriate supervisory body within the International Labour Organisation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. As at 28 July 1982 the Department of Social Security has lodged appeals to the Federal Court of Australia in six such cases. The first involved the issue of whether a person was unemployed (and therefore qualified to receive unemployment benefit) while attending a course at a college of advanced education. Four further appeals relate to the recovery of overpayments of pension or benefit. Of these, one has been heard by the Court and decision has been reserved; another was abandoned when the respondent agreed to repay the amount calculated by the Department as properly overpaid and recoverable; a third is to be heard in Brisbane on 4 August 1982; the fourth has not yet been listed for hearing. The remaining appeal concerns the date from which a pension is payable and also awaits listing by the Court.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Only in the first of the six cases referred to in (1) has the Federal Court decided the matter. In that case, the Court dismissed the appeal.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As a result of AAT decisions, changes have been made to existing departmental instructions in a number of areas such as the pensions income test for certain married couples; eligibility for special benefit; the payment of arrears in certain sickness benefit cases.</PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, existing manuals of instruction have been amended to reflect changes of a less substantial nature and current practices which have been confirmed by decisions of the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA> Further changes to guidelines may be required depending upon the outcome of appeals referred to in answer (1) above. As AAT decisions are handed down, the Department will continue to have regard to their implications for its practices and will change its guidelines and instructions as necessary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question from advice furnished by the Australian Telecommunications Commission:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Telecom has two operations units in Korumburra, a technician district based on the communication centre and a lines sub-area based on the line depot. No change is contemplated to the staffing of the communications centre and it is assumed the question relates to the line depot.</PARA>
<PARA> The amount of line work required to be done in and around Korumburra has reduced to a level where retention of a separate sub-area cannot be justified. Telecom has therefore initiated the normal process followed in such circumstances by considering the abolition of the sub-area as a discrete management unit and the closing of the line depot on which it is based. The steps in this process are:</PARA>
<PARA> No further staff will be recruited at the Korumburra depot.</PARA>
<PARA> When the lines officer-in-charge position becomes vacant because of promotion, transfer or separation the situation will be reviewed. If at that time the amount of line work available or in prospect is still inadequate, the sub-area will be abolished and merged with Leongatha sub-area based on Leongatha line depot. In the unlikely event of a strong increase in demand the Korumburra sub- area will be retained.</PARA>
<PARA> Lines staff currently at the Korumburra line depot will continue to be based there until they are promoted, transferred or separated. When the line depot is no longer required it will be closed.</PARA>
<PARA> This procedure is designed to minimise any adverse social and economic effects on the community in the affected area.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that the application was in general terms. The organisation did not seek recognition in terms of a specific provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act nor was an amendment to the existing provisions sought.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The question of income tax deductibility for gifts is governed by the specific provisions of section 78(1)(a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act which authorises the allowance of deductions for donations of the value of $2 and upwards to various funds, authorities or institutions in Australia which are specified by class or by name in the section.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner informed me that the only provision relevant to the application lodged on behalf of the organisation Parents and Teachers Against Violence in Education is that which authorises the allowance of deductions for gifts to a public benevolent institution.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At 1 June 1982 the number of invalid pension appeals before the Tribunal in each State and internal Territory was: Victoria  276  Queensland  136  New South Wales  84  South Australia  14  Tasmania  6  Western Australia  2 Australian Capital Territory  2  Northern Territory  1</PARA>
<PARA> 521</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Information is not readily available to enable a full answer to be given covering the several hundreds of applications that have been made.</PARA>
<PARA> When an application for review of an invalid pension decision is lodged with the Tribunal, the first step is for the Tribunal's staff to serve notice of the application on the Department of Social Security. That Department is then required, pursuant to section 37 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, to furnish the Tribunal with a statement and documents relating to its decision. In my answer to Senate Question No. 1326 (Hansard, 27 May 1982, page 2607) I provided information concerning the time taken to comply with these requirements .</PARA>
<PARA> The next step is for the Tribunal to convene a preliminary conference of the parties, pursuant to section 34 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. The Tribunal is at present able to set down a preliminary conference within one month of the receipt by the Tribunal of the documents provided pursuant to section 37. Many cases are finalised as a result of the preliminary conference, either because the applicant withdraws his application or because the Department agrees to confer the benefit that is being sought.</PARA>
<PARA> After the preliminary conference, the Tribunal is usually in a position to set a case down for hearing within one month, provided the parties are ready to proceed. (In the case of a country applicant, it may take a little longer to set a case down for hearing where a hearing in a country locality is thought appropriate). The Tribunal is able to arrange a hearing at very short notice where there are special circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> However, delays in setting matters down for hearing are often experienced because the parties are not ready to go ahead. For example, an applicant may become aware, as a result of the preliminary conference, that he will need further medical evidence if his case is to have any prospect of success. Delays are also occasioned by the unavailability of witnesses, particularly medical witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The earliest date in each State and internal Territory of an invalid pension appeal which was still waiting to be heard on 1 May 1982 is:</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria   19 March 1981</PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales   13 May 1981</PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia   16 November 1981</PARA>

<PARA> Australian Capital</PARA>
<PARA> Territory</PARA>
<PARA>no invalid pension appeals were unheard at 1 May 1982</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania   14 August 1981</PARA>
<PARA> In all these cases except that in Tasmania the applicants did not yet wish any hearing to be held, because of illness, absence from Australia, the need for further medical evidence or other reasons. The Tasmanian applicant resided in a country locality and a hearing date was contemplated by the Tribunal when a member could next visit the locality.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Australian Taxation Office is in the process of transferring over a five-year period a total of 43 positions from regional centres to capital cities .</PARA>
<PARA> (2) All affected staff and relevant staff associations were advised of the decision in June 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> The 43 positions involved are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Wagga Wagga-3 positions to Sydney. Newcastle-3 positions to Sydney. Wollongong- 3 positions to Sydney. Tamworth-3 positions to Sydney. Lismore-3 positions to Sydney.

<PARA> (3) Eleven positions have been transferred to date. It is anticipated that the process will be completed by 30 June 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The positions in question comprise three categories with functions as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Investigation Officer Grade 2 (8 positions) which carry out sales tax investigations;</PARA>
<PARA> Investigation Officer Grade 3 (22 positions) which carry out income tax investigations; and</PARA>
<PARA> Indoor Examiner (13 positions) which examine, for income tax purposes, the financial affairs of all classes of taxpayers other than companies.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The decision to transfer the positions was made by the Commissioner of Taxation following a thorough review of staffing arrangements in regional offices to determine whether the most effective use was being made of manpower resources. This review established that more effective enforcement activity can be achieved by using the investigation staff located in regional offices as part of a flexible team operating from capital city offices. The Commissioner is therefore confident that an increase in revenue will flow from the transfers.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Under the Torres Strait Treaty, Australia and Papua New Guinea will jointly share and manage the fisheries resources of the Torres Strait Protected Zone. Scientific research programs will be undertaken by both Governments in order to develop management regimes which will have as their objectives the conservation of the resources as well as the promotion of commercial development of fisheries in Torres Strait, while providing due protection to the continuation of traditional fishing activities.</PARA>
<PARA> Traditional fishing by traditional inhabitants will be a right preserved by legislation and will be subject only to those restrictions that are necessary to conserve living resources. The Torres Strait Treaty requires traditional inhabitants to be consulted from time to time regarding licensing arrangements for commercial fishing in the Protected Zone.</PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that commercial fishermen will be licensed to operate in Torres Strait in accordance with management regimes developed in consultation with industry, the Queensland government and, where appropriate, with Papua New Guinea. It will be necessary to regulate commercial fishing activities to give effect to obligations under the Torres Strait Treaty to protect traditional fishing and to implement catch sharing arrangements with PNG.</PARA>
<PARA> During the first five years after the Treaty enters into force, the Australian commercial catch in waters under Australian jurisdiction shall not be reduced below the level of catch taken prior to the Treaty entering into force provided the catch remains within the agreed total allowable catch for the fishery. Australian fishermen may seek access to surplus catch not exploited by PNG fishermen in waters under PNG jurisdiction during this peiod. Similarly, PNG fishermen may seek access to resources not fully exploited by Australian fishermen in waters under our jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA> During the second five year period, catch levels by Australia and PNG will be altered progressively if necessary in order to implement the catch sharing arrangements specified under the Treaty. The catch sharing arrangements are relatively complex and involve sharing of the resources on the basis of each country having the right to 75 per cent of the resources in waters under its own jurisdiction with at least 25 per cent to be allocated to the other country. Opportunities also will exist for Australia to enter into joint ventures with PNG fishing interests.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) This year, for the first time, a seasonal closure of waters in the western Gulf of Carpentaria from 1 January-15 March was implemented at the request of, and in consultation with, industry. The scientific evidence upon which the closure was based is the result of extensive sampling and biological examination of the commercial catch which showed that significant quantities of small tiger prawns were being taken during that period in the area that was subsequently closed. The ban was implemented in order to allow small prawns to grow to a preferred commercial size.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) This matter does not fall within the responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Women in most Third World countries play a crucial role in their countries' development. In many developing countries women comprise more than half the rural labour force, working in agriculture, animal husbandry and other income raising activities. In addition they are responsible for caring for the upbringing and welfare of their families, particularly for the health and nutrition and early education of their children.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The importance of women's contribution to development is now generally recognised by both developing countries and donors. Development assistance programs must ensure that women receive appropriate assistance to increase their capacity to contribute more effectively to development, and seek to ensure that they share equally in the benefits of that development. Indeed if the role of women is not considered in the planning and implementation of assistance proposals, projects may be less effective. The consideration of these issues requires careful appraisal of the role of women in each major project area and monitoring of the effects of the project as it is implemented.</PARA>

<PARA> Will the practice of parallel scheduling, whereby the departure times of Ansett Airlines and Trans Australia Airlines from locations throughout Australia are virtually identical, be halted so that the interest of passengers becomes paramount over the interests of the airlines.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The scheduling of services by Ansett and TAA has developed similar characteristics primarily because the airlines have traditionally operated identical equipment over a similar network with equal capacity. In addition, airline schedules are designed around definite daily peaks which occur in terms of passengers' preferred departure times. As a consequence, there is a compromise on all routes between passengers' preferences in departure times, levels of demand, aircraft and aircrew availability and optimum utilisation by the airlines of their equipment throughout their networks.</PARA>
<PARA> The actual scheduling of flights is determined by the airlines on this basis and is a matter for their respective commercial judgments.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the airlines are required to submit their time- tables for approval by the Secretary to the Department of Aviation under Air Navigation Regulation 106C , those schedules can only be disallowed on operational or safety grounds. The Commonwealth is therefore not able to consider airline schedules on the basis of public interest.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Government is aware of the inconvenience which this feature of trunk route operations can cause travellers and has actively encouraged the airlines to reduce the extent of parallel scheduling. In this regard, the decisions by TAA and Ansett to re-equip with aircraft with different seating capacities are expected to result in moves towards a reduction of parallel scheduling which will be to the public's benefit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 February 1982 (Hansard, page 480) Senator Bonner asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Prime Minister aware that, between April 1976 and June 1981, 27,000 square kilometres of Queensland rural land was involved in approval proposals for foreign investors and that this area represents 1.6 per cent of Queensland, which is more than 1.2 per cent presently being sought by my fellow Aborigines in that State? Is the Minister aware also of the grave concern that is being expressed by the rural population and other interested organisations such as the Returned Services League? Has the Commonwealth any powers to prevent this foreign takeover and in particular prevent certain foreign nationals from acquiring this land under the Queensland Government's patronage?</PARA>
<PARA> Following the provision of a preliminary answer by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the question was referred to the Treasurer who has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator is correct in stating that foreign investors were given approval to acquire a total of 27,000 square kilometres of rural land in Queensland between April 1976 and June 1981. Over one-third of purchases were by intending migrants and other purchases involved Australians in partnership with foreign investors.</PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the increase in foreign investment in rural land the Government undertook a review of policy late in 1981. In conducting this review the Government had regard both to the attention directed to such investment by rural communities and other groups and to the benefits that can be derived in terms of additional income and employment from such investment. After consultation with the States and Northern Territory, on 20 January 1982 the Government announced a more restrictive approach towards foreign investment in rural properties. As before, a property to be acquired by a foreign interest must have been advertised or otherwise offered for sale in a way normal for the industry to ensure that Australians have been given adequate opportunity to bid for it. In addition, the Government decided that foreign investment approval would normally be restricted to proposals where the purchasers have firm plans to establish residence in Australia or which offer significant economic benefits. Where the economic benefits are small, approval would normally be forthcoming only where there is an effective partnership (normally at 50/50 partnership) between Australian investors and the foreign investors in the ownership and control of the property.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government pays particular attention to the advice of the State or Territory concerned in determinig whether or not a proposed acquisition would lead to significant economic benefits. Moreover, the assessment of economic benefits is made relative to the size of the proposed investment. Case by case examination enables conformity with the above criteria to be assessed in the light of individual circumstances and attention to be given to the opportunities and willingness of Australians to purchase on commercial terms.</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has power under the Foreign Takeovers Act 1975 to prevent the purchase of a rural property (where that property constitutes a business for the purpose of the Act) when control passes to a foreign person and the Treasurer is satisfied that the takeover would be contrary to the national interest. In establishing whether a proposal is contrary to the national interest, the proposal is considered against the above criteria.</PARA>

He also asked how much heating oil is used and how much waste lubricating oil is dumped each year in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I undertook to provided further detailed information for the honourable senator and now provide the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The process to which Senator Collard referred is the 'Flowen' process, developed by Robert Owen International Ltd of Poole, Dorset. The Flowen process treats a selected waste oil product within the broad fuel oil specification with an ash content higher than average fuel oil. Therefore if the product is used as a boiler fuel, the boiler must be capable of handling efficiently the ash produced. Flowen fuel oil does not approach in quality the product known in Australia as 'heating oil' and could not be used as a substitute for it.</PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in my response on 20 April 1982 the waste oil that is being re- used in Australia is in the main being blended with fuel oil for subsequent burning as a fuel.

<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The advocacy of left-turn-on-red in Australia began after a similar rule was introduced in the United States as a fuel-conservation measure, most traffic signals there operating on a fixed-time basis with very long cycle times. By contrast, a good number of Australian traffic signals are vehicle-actuated with inductive loops below the road surface detecting the passage of vehicles and adjusting the signals accordingly. In off-peak times a driver may receive a green signal almost as soon as he reaches the stop line even if the signal is red as he approaches it. Moreover, some intersections with traffic signals have left-turn slip lanes through which left turns may be made at any time with care .</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the Traffic Authority of New South Wales has undertaken a trial of left-turn-on-red at some 30 selected sites and decided to proceed with a cautious extension of it.

I undertook to look into the whole matter and give a more detailed reply. The following information is now provided:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Program provides funding for energy research, development and demonstration projects. Support through the program for solar energy projects totals $7m. This includes the funding of 31 projects totalling $2m in the field of solar collector technology . Demonstration and testing in practical applications of the vacuum insulated solar absorber tube developed by Sydney University is being supported under three of these NERDDP projects at a cost of $272,340.</PARA>
<PARA> These are:</PARA>
<PARA> A recent grant of $185,000 to Bitupave Ltd for a period of two years. The aim of the project is the conversion of the heating system for a 318,200 litre bitumen tank from oil heating to solar heating. It is proposed to insulate the tank and maintain the working temperature by supplying solar heat from an array of approximately 200 m2 of concentrating collectors developed by the University of New South Wales, which utilises the University of Sydney designed vacuum insulated tube.</PARA>
<PARA> A grant of $59,687 to the Solar Energy Research Centre, University of Queensland, in 1981 for a period of three years. The objective of the project is to produce a solar powered air conditioning system and demonstrate its technical viability. The project includes evaluation of the Sydney University designed vacuum insulated absorber tube to drive an absorption chiller air- conditioning system.</PARA>
<PARA> A grant of $27,653 to the University of New South Wales in 1980 to test various prototype, non-tracking solar concentrators. Some included the vacuum insulated absorber tube supplied by the University of Sydney, while others were fitted with tubes either selectively coated or coated with matt black paint. Results indicated that vacuum insulated tubes of the University of Sydney design outperformed the other prototypes.</PARA>
<PARA> Further funding by the Commonwealth Government to industry for solar research is provided through the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme which is administered by the Department of Science and Technology. Research and development of solar energy is also being undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> It is Government policy that the commercialisation of new energy technologies is primarily the responsibility of the private sector. Consistent with this policy, the Government has, through a variety of measures, created an economic climate designed to assist the development of solar energy technologies. Exemption from sales tax applies to solar appliances for all uses and to certain classes of goods connected with the use of solar energy. These exemptions have provided added financial incentive to people wishing to instal solar water heaters in their homes.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has also provided taxation concessions which encourage commercial and industrial users of oil-fired and liquefied petroleum- fired equipment to convert or replace their equipment with plant utilising other energy sources including solar energy.</PARA>
<PARA> Assistance is also currently available to aid local manufacture by way of a tariff of 35 per cent applicable to the importation of photovoltaics, flat plate collectors and solar arrays and panels. Solar generator systems, consisting of panels with storage batteries are dutiable at the rate of 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> These measures, together with the support of research through the NERDD program and other Commonwealth funding schemes, have given a substantial stimulus to the expansion of the solar industry in Australia. The cost of further Commonwealth Government assistance would need to be considered in the context of the overall level of assistance already being received by the solar energy industry which has a turnover of approximately $25m per annum.</PARA>

<PARA> In the light of the retrenchments that are currently occurring in the industry , particularly in may State of Tasmania, does not the Minister consider that these time intervals are far too long?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following supplementary information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Company Pty Ltd (TEMCO) produces a range of ferro alloys which are used in steelmaking. The parent company, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited accounts for the bulk of local sales, whilst up to 50 per cent of production has in the past been sold on export markets.</PARA>
<PARA> The management of TEMCO has recently conducted an extensive review of its operations and its market potential. As a result of that review, the company has found it necessary to shut down one furnace and to carry out substantial rationalisation elsewhere in its operations.</PARA>
<PARA> TEMCO's difficulties have arisen due to reduced domestic demand and to unremunerative export markets. These problems are directly attributable to the depressed state of the world steel industry, which was also a major element in the situation which led to the reference of certain steel products to the Temporary Assistance Authority and the Industries Assistance Commission. TEMCO' s products are not covered by these references but there is an indirect relationship through ferro alloy production being largely determined by the level of steel output.</PARA>
<PARA> The 45 days allowed for the Temporary Assistance Authority inquiry is the period prescribed by legislation. Prior to the existing provision the specified period was 30 days but experience proved this to be insufficient. For the Industries Assistance Commission inquiry, 12 months was seen as being about the minimum period for an adequate review of the long term assistance appropriate to an industry as extensive as that under reference. There is, however, always scope for the Government to request the Commission to submit an interim report should this be warranted by changed circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 May 1982 (Hansard, Page 2378) Senator Gietzelt asked me as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the announcement by the Minister for Administrative Services that the Government has set a target of 40 per cent to 45 per cent of survey work to be contracted out to the private sector signify a running down of the work of the Australian Survey Office? Is this particularly so given that currently some 10 per cent to 15 per cent of government survey work already goes to the private sector? Further, can the Minister give an assurance that the Australian Survey Office will remain a strong viable unit with career opportunities within the Office, and that staff surveyors will not face the prospect of redeployment or redundancy as a result of the razor gang decisions to transfer survey services to the private sector?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Following, the Review of Commonwealth Functions, a target of 40 to 45 per cent of Commonwealth survey work has been set as the amount to be contracted out. The decision was taken because the Government believes it should not be doing work which can be done as well by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision was not intended to reduce the viability of the Australian Survey Office. Accordingly, the organisation will continue to provide career opportunities for its staff.</PARA>
<PARA> The staffing levels agreed to by my Department in consultation with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance and the Public Service Board are to be reached by June 1986. These should be attained through normal wastage and surveyors are not expected to face the prospect of redeployment or redundancy. Any significant organisational changes resulting from the decision will be discussed with the unions concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2380) Senator Thomas asked the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Will the Minister ask the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs to consider clarifying the position of sales tax exemption for four-wheel drive vehicles used for primary production? I have received several submissions from Western Australian pastoralists which make the point that two almost identical vehicles are treated totally differently with regard to the application of this tax.</PARA>
<PARA> As the matter raised by the honourable senator falls within the Treasurer's portfolio I have obtained the following advice from the Treasurer in response to the question:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a provision in the sales tax law that exempts machinery, implements and apparatus for use in agricultural industry if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, they are goods of a kind used exclusively, or primarily and principally, in that industry. The Commissioner of Taxation advises that certain types of four-wheel drive vehicles can qualify for exemption under this provision when purchased for use in agricultural industry. The Commissioner added that without full details of the particular circumstances involved and the types of vehicles he is unable to offer any comment on the matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Expenditure under the Children's Services Program for 1980-81 for pre- school services, long day care centres, and family day care centres was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Services for children not attending school-</PARA>
<PARA>$m</PARA>
<PARA> pre-school  31.183  child care centres  18.717  family day care schemes 9.458</PARA>
<PARA> Services for children attending school-</PARA>
<PARA>$m  outside school hours care  1.467  vacation care  0.915</PARA>
<PARA> No estimates of 1980-81 expenditure on pre-school and child care services for other Commonwealth authorities or for State and Territory Governments are currently available to my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> I am, however, able to provide a table which lists Commonwealth, State and Territory Government estimated expenditure on pre-school and child care services for 1981-82. These figures do not include any estimates of the administrative and supervisory costs incurred by Governments in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> No breakup of child care expenditure is available for State and Territory Governments, although New South Wales and South Australia are the only States known to support family day care schemes; one in the case of New South Wales and four in the case of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Information on parental contributions to services is not available in the detail requested. However, it can be estimated, using the 1980 Australian Bureau of Statistics Child Care Arrangements Survey as a base, that in 1981 parental contributions for pre-school services would be in the order of $41m and $44m for centre and family-based day care.</PARA>
<PARA> Thus although estimated parental contributions are of a similar magnitude in both the pre-school and child care sectors, in 1981-82 the ratio of government payments to parental contributions in the pre-school sector was more than 3 to 1 . In the child care sector government payments are slightly less than parental contributions.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The data from the 1980 and 1981 census of pre-school and child care services is not yet available. However, the 1980 Australian Bureau of Statistics Child Care Survey estimates that there were 168,700 children not attending school who used child care centres or family day care schemes. The survey further estimates that there were 26,100 school children, under 12 years of age, who used child care centres.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The data from 1980 and 1981 census of pre-school and child care services, when available will provide the answer to this question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (i) The Government asked the Public Service Board to undertake a review of the staffing levels of a number of Australia's diplomatic missions including Washington, London and Paris. As part of this review, two officers of the Public Service Board proceeded overseas in February/March 1982 to visit those missions and the Brussels mission.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the particular interests of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is the administering department at each of these missions, the Department sent two of it's Canberra-based officers to assist the Board's officers in their review. Similarly, in the light of the significant representation of defence and armed services personnel, an officer of the Department of Defence (a Rear Admiral) assisted in the review of defence staffing.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time two defence staff carried out an inspection of defence activities and establishments in Washington, London and Paris as part of the normal defence establishment review process.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The cost of fares and allowances for the two officers of the Public Service Board was $20,432.33.</PARA>
<PARA> The costs of fares and allowances for those officers assisting in the review were $32,205. (This does not include the travel costs for the two Defence staff) .</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Australia's missions in Washington, London, Paris and Brussels contain several hundred staff, consisting of both Australian officials and locally engaged personnel. Many Commonwealth departments are represented. It is difficult to examine functions and staffing levels without an appreciation of the way in which missions are organised and the implications which changes in one aspect of a mission's operations will have on others. Such an appreciation is best gained through an on-the-spot examination in close consultation with the Head of Mission and other senior officers. It should be noted that staff reductions which will result from the review are expected to provide annual savings much greater than the costs detailed above.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 24 March 1982:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Do many single mothers in the 40-50 year age group face severe financial and emotional anguish after losing their supporting parent's benefit or widows' pensions when their youngest child reaches 16, or leaves school.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Do women in this age group have difficulty in finding employment after years outside the workforce raising their children, even though most would prefer to be working again.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Do many of these women eventually qualify for sickness benefits due to the seeming hopelessness of their financial situation.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Would this increasing problem be checked by: (a) re-defining the Class B widows' pension to include women who are between 40 and 50 years of age; and (b) developing re-training schemes for unskilled, mature women who wish to re-enter the workforce.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (3) I am aware from personal representations to me that some women who lose entitlement to a Class A widows pension or supporting parent's benefit in these circumstances state that they experience difficulties such as those outlined. However, a widow pensioner aged between 45 and 49 years may be eligible for a Class B widow's pension once she ceases to have a qualifying child.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The question of whether entitlement for a Class B widow's pension should be widened to provide pensions to younger women without dependants is a complex one . I appreciate that Class A widows who lose their pension before age 45 may see their exclusion as anomalous; on the other hand, many such women may have had work force experience and might be expected to maintain themselves without taxpayer support. Unemployment benefit is available to a person meeting the relevant qualifications while seeking employment.</PARA>
<PARA> Assistance is provided for unskilled women who seek to re-enter the work force under the General Training Assistance Program, administered by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations (DEIR). Under this program they may be assisted:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) through on-the-job training with the Government subsidising part of the trainee's wages for the training period.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) through formal training in an occupation which DEIR assesses will be in demand at completion of training. In this case, eligible trainees receive weekly allowances for the period of training, in addition to compulsory fees and a books allowance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In 1980-81 Hospital Affiliates Australia Pty Ltd was given foreign investment policy approval to acquire the Bundoora and District Private Hospital in Victoria. Details concerning the amount of investment involved are regarded as confidential by both the Government and the parties.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A proposal by National Medical Enterprises Inc. of the United States of America to acquire the private hospitals owned by Hospitals Affiliates was approved by the Government in the second half of 1981. I am informed that the proposal did not proceed for commercial reasons.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Proposals by foreign interests to acquire Australian businesses, irrespective of their ownership, are subject to the provisions of the Foreign Takeovers Act. In takeovers of the type referred to by the honourable senator, the Foreign Investment Review Board, after consultation with the Commonwealth Department of Health and the relevant State health authorities, recommends to the Government whether the takeovers of the businness should be approved or not and also whether conditions whould be attached to approvals.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Three US-owned companies operating private hospitals have received approval to acquire private hospitals in Australia, subject to their admitting not less than 35 per cent local equity. The three companies are Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd and Hospital Affiliates Australia Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA> Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd, which traded at a loss for the first three years of its operations, made unsuccessful attempts to introduce local equity and was granted an extension until September 1982 to fulfil its obligations in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA> American Medical International (Australia) Pty Ltd has yet to introduce the required level of local equity and has not sought any variation to the terms of the equity condition. The company is, however, pursuing a number of options in relation to its local equity obligations and is keeping the Foreign Investment Review Board advised in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA> INA Corporation, which received approval to invest in Australia through Hospital Affiliates, has now sold its five Australian hospitals to local interests. The equity condition applied to this company's Australian operations is therefore no longer applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) INA Corporation has advised that it owns three companies in Australia engaged in insurance and related activities. These are Insurance Company of North America (Australia) Limited, which is a general insurance company, International Rehabilitation Associates Pty Limited, which provides consultancy services concerned with rehabilitation of injured workers, and Esis International Inc. which provides services to the insurance industry as claims adjusters, marine technical specialists, loss control experts and claims subrogation services. The two United States owned hospital companies operating in Australia have advised that they do not have any other businesses activities in Australia.</PARA>

These included the principle that Housing assistance will provide adequate rental housing for those of the community who are deemed to be in need of government assistance at a price that is within their capacity to pay.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Government has agreed to provide $10m for an extension of the Family Support Services Scheme for a three-year period from 1 January 1982 to 31 December 1984. This is the same amount as for the pilot scheme during the previous three years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 March 1982 (Hansard, page 569) Senator Robertson asked Senator Sir John Carrick a question without notice concerning students in the Northern Territory who are undertaking university study externally:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted a recommendation of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission for the establishment of an External Studies Centre at the Darwin Community College. The purpose of the Centre is to provide tutorial and other assistance for residents of the Northern Territory who are enrolled as external students in Australian universities and colleges of advanced education . Grants up to $90,000 in 1982, $140,000 in 1983, and $180,000 in 1984, will be available in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also significant that following consultations with the Northern Territory Minister for Education, the Hon. J. M. Robertson, MLA, the Darwin Community College will introduce its own Bachelor of Arts course during the 1982-84 triennium. I am satisfied that the introduction of this course will widen opportunities for residents of the Territory to undertake tertiary studies.</PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of the Commonwealth Government providing assistance towards travel and accommodation cost for students in the Territory who are undertaking university study externally and who are required to attend on-campus lectures, tutorials and seminars at the university where they are enrolled involves a question of direct financial aid to students. Commonwealth financial assistance for tertiary students is provided by the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme ( TEAS). The Student Assistance Act 1973, which provides the legislative basis for the scheme, requires that TEAS allowances will be available only to students who are studying on a full-time basis. Consequently, if the student is enrolled externally on a full-time basis, assistance under TEAS would be available and the allowance, though not designed specifically to cover costs of travel and accommodation as outlined, could be used for such. Should the student be studying externally on a part-time basis, assistance under TEAS would not be applicable.</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Minister for Communications or possibly the Minister for Health aware that during the last year flashing lights, numbers and letters have been used and are still being used in many television advertisements and programs? Is it an established fact that flashing lights are harmful to people suffering from epilepsy and can induce seizures? Has any research been done in this area? In view of the number of hours that some children are reported to be watching television, what steps will the Minister take to prevent such health hazards?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided me with the following response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has information to the effect that photoepileptic fits can be triggered by television in a small number of epileptics. However, no action has been taken so far to restrict the use of such techniques in the absence of positive identification of the particular physical features of television presentations which are likely to trigger fits in susceptible individuals. At present the Tribunal is not aware of any specifications which provide guidelines as to the type of stimuli which need to be avoided and this would appear to be a matter about which expert medical/bio- physical advice should be sought as a prelude to the possible introduction of standards. Accordingly, advice is being sought on this matter from the Minister for Health.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subject of foreign investment in rural land, which has attracted a good deal of attention over the past 2 years or so, was discussed at the meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council last year. It was then agreed that there would be further consultations between Federal and State Governments on measures to obtain additional information on the overall level of foreign ownership of rural land and on policies that might apply in relation to new investment proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government then undertook a comprehensive review of its foreign investment policy, which included detailed consideration of the guidelines as they apply to foreign investment in rural properties. As a result of this review and as I announced on 20 January 1982, the Government decided that a more restrictive approach should be adopted towards foreign acquisitions of rural properties, primarily by way of strengthening the test of benefits from a proposal before approval is given.</PARA>
<PARA> In its review, the Government also considered what measures might be taken to obtain comprehensive information on foreign ownership of rural land, and in particular the possibility of establishing a register of foreign ownership of rural land. After giving very careful attention to this issue, the Government decided that, as responsibility for land titles and usage rests with States and Territories, it would be more appropriate that any establishment of land ownership registers be left to the States, should they wish to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Foreign Investment Review Board has compiled statistics on proposals submitted for approval under the Government's foreign investment policy. These statistics indicate that over the period 1 April 1976 to 30 June 1982, 90 proposals were allowed to proceed involving some 3,280,000 hectares of rural land (freehold and leasehold) in Queensland. Thirty-four of the 90 proposals involved persons intending to come and live in Australia. A further 18 proposals involved Australian participation and some of the properties were already foreign owned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Capital Territory has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am informed by my Department that on 21 November 1980 the Public Service Board issued a Memorandum (No. 77/1178) to all departments and statutory authorities on the subject of smoking in Commonwealth Government offices. This memorandum included a circular issued by the Department of Health on 20 November 1980 drawing attention to the Government's policy on the subject as expressed in the terms of the Government's response to the Report from the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare 'Drug Problems in Australia-An Intoxicated Society'. The circular prepared by the Department of Health sets out the guidelines for the application of Government policy and the action to be taken by departments and statutory authorities. The circular states, inter alia, 'it is recognised, that at this stage, there can be no general ban on smoking in Commonwealth Government offices either for the public or Government employees' but such steps should be taken as may be practical along the following lines:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) with the agreement of any staff amenity or other committees that may be concerned, to prohibit or limit smoking in recreational areas, staff restaurants , etc; to set aside separate smoking areas where desired and possible (this is meant to be interpreted as segregation rather than provision of separate facilities); and to limit or prohibit the sale of cigarettes on Commonwealth Government premises;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) to prohibit smoking in lifts or other enclosed confined spaces;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) where this can be achieved without significant additional cost, accommodation or manpower, and with no loss of efficiency, to consider sympathetically any proposal for segregating smokers and non-smokers;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) to discourage smoking by the public by displaying suitable request notices ;</PARA>
<PARA> (v) to discourage smoking at conferences, meetings, training courses or other gatherings at which non-smokers might be put to discomfort;</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) to make known in the organisation a policy attitude on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> The circular further states 'It is envisaged that problems which arise would be resolved by departmental management. The development of specific arrangements within individual workplaces is seen, however, as a matter primarily to be resolved at each workplace, having regard to the general policy and to practicability'.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department has distributed the Public Service Board memorandum and the Department of Health circular to staff with the request for smokers not to smoke in the workplace or in recreational facilities provided within the Department's premises. If this causes hardship to any smoker then the officer is invited to report that to the supervisor who is to refer the case to management.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been no complaints received by management from the staff or the public about smoking by officers and the observations by management indicate a general acceptance by the staff of the recognition of the objections of some people to others smoking in their presence. There may be isolated cases of officers smoking at public counters but these have not come under notice as a consequence of any complaint.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware that it has been established practice for many years for property and liability policies taken out with insurance companies in Australia to exclude cover for loss, damage or liability attributable to nuclear weapons material, nuclear fuel or nuclear waste from nuclear fuel.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Insurance Council of Australia Limited has stated that the nuclear exclusion clauses represent the insurance industry's assessment that, with regard to any nuclear accident to which the exclusions apply, liability remains the sole responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. However, whether the Commonwealth would be liable for any loss resulting from nuclear damage would depend on the facts of each particular case. Broadly, where the Commonwealth uses radioactive materials or is directly responsible for their use, any Commonwealth liability would depend on general principles of liability that would apply equally to private persons or corporations.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A small number of claims relating to the effects of radiation have been made against the Commonwealth under workers' compensation legislation on behalf of former employees of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission who worked at Lucas Heights. Also, a number of workers' compensation claims against the Commonwealth have been made recently by employees who worked at former nuclear weapons test sites in Australia in the 1950's. Most of these latter claims are still being considered but some have already been determined. At least two individuals have sought further damages against the Commonwealth under common law. Their cases have not yet been heard.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Apart from claims involving workers' compensation legislation, any claims of the kind addressed in the honourable Senator's question would presently have to be pursued under common law. In this connection, I refer the honourable senator to the information contained in part (3) of the Treasurer's answer to House of Representatives Question No. 3676.</PARA>
