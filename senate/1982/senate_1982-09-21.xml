<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia, concerned about the high and increasing rate of divorce and family breakdown, convinced that the Family Law Act has weakened marriage by making divorce a trivial matter, the present Act paying scant regard to its own definition of marriage as a life-long union, and believing that the legal bond of marriage should be strengthened,</PARA>
<PARA> humbly petition for the Family Law Act and the Marriage Act to be amended in order to:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Reject any moves towards divorce by post</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Restore the former prohibition of marriages between close relatives by blood or marriage</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Protect the rights and welfare of aggrieved partners of a marriage who are threatened with being divorced against their will</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the continuing high level of tax avoidance and evasion is cause for grave concern for honest Australian taxpayers, and demands stringent and immediate action by the Commonwealth, noting in particular:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The latest estimate by the Australian Taxpayers' Association is that $7,000m a year is being lost in taxation revenue;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. This figure can only continue to rise because of the timid approach by the Government in closing off tax loopholes; and</PARA>
<PARA> 3. No effective inroads can be made until a comprehensive policy is adopted of levying tax from the date on which a scheme of tax avoidance is first used.</PARA>

<TITLE>Great Barrier Reef Marine Park</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef is unique and is included on the World Heritage List.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was to create a marine park to provide for the proper protection and management of The Reef, only 14 per cent of the total area defined in this Act as the Great Barrier Reef Region has been declared marine park.</PARA>
<PARA> The only insurance against an oil drilling blowout in Reef waters is to prohibit oil drilling in the Region and its vicinity.</PARA>
<PARA> This can only be effected by declaring the whole area of the Region a marine park under the above legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Government to take action to hold a referendum together with the next Federal Elections on the question that:</PARA>
<PARA> The entire area of the Great Barrier Reef and its surrounding waters, defined as the Great Barrier Reef Region in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, as amended 1978, be immediately declared a marine park under the provisions of that Act.</PARA>

<TITLE>Private Enterprise Employees: Retirement Benefits</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth our concern that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Income Tax Assessment Act (the Act) and its administration is inadequate in providing retirement benefits for employees in private enterprise;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) denies deductions necessary to index retirement pensions;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Deductions for the self-employed and employed are inadequate;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Commissioner has exercised his discretion improperly by negating a choice the Act allows on investment in Government Securities;</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The Commissioner's constant alterations to guidelines and lack of communication has created great uncertainty;</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The Commissioner is acting arbitrarily, and without proper notice in restricting trustee's investments with employers;</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The Commissioner seeks to apply new actuarial guidelines retrospectively to July 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, take action to remedy these inadequacies and in particular we pray that action be taken:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) To ensure that the Commissioner exercises his discretion only with proper regard to legal principles;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) To ensure that the Commissioner does not delegate to auditors part of his function of administering the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) To enact legislation allowing proper levels of retirement benefit to be provided;</PARA>

<TITLE>Plant Variety Rights</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection , storage, and research has been publicly funded.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving ' property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Recognise that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programmes,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,</PARA>

Did the Attorney -General say, on 24 August, that a Minister should not resign unless there had been 'some personal failing'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. By way of preface I refer to the disturbing evidence received in relation to Christmas Island and the inability of the Phosphate Commission to meet its share of the bargain in relation to booby bird habitat conservation. In view of the evidence that was received by Estimates Committee B, will the Minister undertake that upon the return of Mr McVeigh from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands expedition he will convey to him our concern in relation to the worsening of the position in view of the clear-cut environment program that was presented to this House earlier in the form of a report?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall the work done by three professors in relation to the situation facing Abbott's booby bird on Christmas Island. This matter has come up in the Senate on a number of occasions. I believe that a report was discussed in this place at Question Time and at other times by Senator Mulvihill , my former colleague Senator Puplick and other interested senators. I am also aware that this matter was raised by Senator Mulvihill at an Estimates committee meeting last week at which I was present with departmental officers. At that stage some indication was given that the program had not been put into effect. I think it was also made clear at that Estimates examination that no clearing of the habitat was going ahead; that things were in a state of suspended animation, as I heard the evidence. But I will check the Hansard report when it is available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can advise Senator Mulvihill that Mr McVeigh is now back in Australia. He certainly was back yesterday and he is in the Parliament today. I imagine that his officers will be making him aware of the content of Hansard and of the concerns expressed by Senator Mulvihill. But, to be quite certain, I will undertake to pass on to him as well the concerns which have been expressed by the honourable senator. I agree that we would want to see no action take place that would endanger the booby bird or those parts of its habitat still remaining on the island.</PARA>

With a large number of new Australians and others phoning relatives, friends and business acquaintances overseas as a result of the facilitation of international subscriber dialling, can Telecom Australia give consideration to including in Australian telephone directories a world time zone map with time clocks in each zone to assist subscribers to determine time variants from Australia?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to the honourable senator for the question. As anyone who has had to call overseas will know, it is often quite difficult to determine what time of the day or night it is in another country. As a matter of courtesy, people want to time their telephone calls at some appropriate time for the person receiving the call. I think both of the suggestions which have been made by the honourable senator are well worthy of consideration. I do not imagine that either of them would be terribly difficult to put into place. I will certainly put them through to my colleague Mr Brown in the hope that the honourable senator's suggestions can be considered sympathetically and, hopefully, put into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Minister at that time suggested that the wife's allowance had not been increased because other allowances had. Is it not a fact that in 1964 the combined value of the disability special rate, wife's allowance, attendant's allowance and service pension was $10 more than average weekly earnings and that in 1982 it is $1 less ?

I will certainly have that examined and checked. As to the point that the honourable senator makes, which seeks to home in more particularly on the dependant's allowance rather than, as I understood his question, the domestic allowance for the most severely disabled, I would need to check and examine that a little further. But it seems to me that, following the line of his original question, he ought to have a good close look at the amounts by which pensions for those who are the most severely disabled have been increased and the way in which pensions have moved generally in that area rather than in respect of the dependant's allowance. Taking on board all the points that he made in his question, I will attempt to examine the facts that he has brought to our notice and give a fuller answer at a later time.</PARA></TALK.START>

Last week an honourable senator asked me a similar question about the expectations and the realities of arriving in a new country with regard to employment and other conditions. I think it is fair to say that the information that is given at our posts overseas is as up to date as is possible. Sometimes there may be some misunderstandings. As far as any general information is concerned, I will ask the Minister to have a look at Senator Reid's question to see whether any facts can be given to her.

Does the Minister recall that I and many sections of the Australian film industry warned then that if the Government permitted this scheme to operate concurrently with Division 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which is the Government's own film assistance scheme, the local industry would suffer a drastic decline in investment? Is the Minister aware that this has now happened and that the local industry is in crisis?

I am not aware whether the resolution carried last weekend by 700 people interested in the film industry has been conveyed to the Treasurer. If it has not, I will make inquiries and ask that he be so advised. If it is suggested that any further revision of taxation assistance needs to be undertaken to make sure that we are giving assistance and not acting to the detriment of the Australian film industry, I am sure the Treasurer would be interested in subjecting that to examination. It is fair to say that the generous tax concessions of a year or two ago were introduced with the objective of assisting and developing the Australian film industry, which was showing such promise. I am sure that I speak on behalf of my Government colleagues when I say that we would be happy to subject to examination any representations from the film industry or those who can give advice with regard to any detrimental effects that our legislation may have.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Social Security aware of an anomaly between social security provisions and income tax provisions as they relate to de facto marriages, namely, that if a woman is living in a de facto relationship with a man his income is taken into account when she applies for unemployment benefit but because they are not married they are disqualified from consideration for the dependent spouse rebate? Can he give a rationale for this? Will the Government give urgent attention to making the situation consistent?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1039" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the different treatment which is afforded to the de facto spouse under social security law and taxation law. Indeed, it is a matter which has been the subject of informal discussion between the Treasurer and me. In general it can be said that under the social security law a person is treated in the same way, whether married or living in a de facto relationship akin to marriage. That is sometimes to the advantage of the de facto spouse and sometimes to his or her disadvantage. For example, in the unemployment benefit situation, which was mentioned by Senator Martin, it is an advantage in the sense that, if a man or a woman seeks unemployment benefit and is able to demonstrate that he or she has a dependent spouse, an additional payment can be made for that dependent spouse as part of the unemployment benefit. It can, however, operate as a disqualifying factor. Mention was made of this recently in the Senate. A person in a de facto situation who is receiving or who has claimed a supporting parent's benefit may be disqualified from having the benefit because he or she is not a supporting parent living alone and having the care and maintenance of children. Under the taxation law the dependent spouse allowance, as I recall it, is available only to a person who is a de jure spouse -in other words, a person who is legally married to the person claiming the deduction. So there is a difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Martin asked whether that difference ought to be removed. I think it is important that there should be no change in the social security provision because clearly, in a system where the concern is the maintenance at some minimum income level of people who are without other income, it is important to take into account very carefully the actual situation of the people concerned. I do not think Senator Martin would support, and certainly I would not support, any removal of the benefits which flow to a de facto spouse. On the other hand, I think different considerations arise under tax law where one might say that the additional privileges which are afforded might properly be given to those who undertake the legal responsibilities of marriage. But basically I suppose that part of the question relates to the responsibilities of my colleague the Treasurer. I will refer Senator Martin's concern, as expressed by this question, to him. He may think it is necessary to expand on the reply which I have given.</PARA>

Is this not a direct challenge from the trade union movement to Western Mining Corporation and its partners that development at Yeelirrie will be sabotaged by industrial action?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important question. I have seen the advertisement in the West Australian in which, as Senator Crichton-Browne says, the Trades and Labour Council and affiliated unions have advised companies tendering for work in the Western Mining Corporation's Yeelirrie project that the ACTU uranium policy banning the mining and export of Australia's uranium ' will be enforced during construction'-they are their words. This raises a very serious question inside the kind of society that is Australia. Inside Australia, at both the Federal and State government levels, the mining, milling and export of uranium is a legal operation; it has been so and remains so. For any people to say that they will take action to prevent what is a totally legal situation is a lawless attempt and must be condemned very strongly indeed. It must be condemned for many reasons. We have had examples of lawlessness in trade unions in recent times. This is another attempt at lawlessness on their part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that the Western Mining Corporation is undertaking a legal operation. It is clear that that operation is in every way safe and appropriate within the laws and the health conditions of the land. It is clear-I repeat this -that the International Atomic Energy Agency has said and has repeated continuously that the living standards of the countries of the world will not be able to be sustained, no matter what other alternative energy sources there are, unless there is a very significant increase in the use of uranium for nuclear power generation. So those who are attempting to stop the flow of uranium from Australia for nuclear power purposes are in fact frustrating the maintenance of living standards, frustrating both the social and economic welfare of people overseas.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let the Labor Party protest as it may. I repeat that the body that has perhaps the most authoritative overview of the energy requirements of this world of ours has said that if the living conditions of the ordinary people of this world are to be maintained, more and more nuclear power stations must be established and more and more uranium must flow from countries such as Australia. If there are unions which, by lawless action, are seeking to deny this, they are not simply robbing Australia; they are robbing the people of the world of their living standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne is utterly right. Here in Australia the mining and milling of uranium has been established, under the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, to be a perfectly safe process and one that is absolutely normal. Throughout the world there are some 250 or more nuclear power stations which have functioned for over 20 years. The safety record of those stations is better than that of alternative power stations. There are more than 250 nuclear power stations under construction at this moment and another 250 on the drawing boards. Australia is one of the key sources for uranium in the world. It is against this background that this kind of lawlessness is being foreshadowed. It is a tragedy that it occurs at a time when Australia needs to create useful jobs for its people. Our record in job creation is better than that of the free world around us. Nevertheless, with the opposition of the unions and the Australian Labor Party, which party is opposed to uranium mining, we face a denial of jobs.</PARA>

I did hear a radio report with respect to the town water supply at Mount Morgan which indicated that water is being carted to that town at very considerable cost. I would have thought that that would come within the normal relief measures which are already the subject of agreement between the Commonwealth and the States and which involve some cost sharing. I need to check the precise application of those rules to the Mount Morgan situation. As I understand it, it is a matter directly concerning the viability of the town water supply during a period of extended drought. It is a little outside what is normally thought of as a drought relief measure, but clearly it is a very great problem for those people.

With the continual loss of jobs in Australia due largely to cheaper imports of steel, timber and manufactured goods, will the Minister tell the Senate which areas of employment the Government will preserve? Are Australian workers to be considered only in wartime and disregarded in peacetime? What immediate and long term plans does the Government have to save local industries before many are past recovery? Is it not time that this Federal Government showed some pro-Australian initiatives and listened to commonsense proposals of ordinary people instead of following the advice of the so-called economic and financial experts, many of whom could not organise a peanut stall at a school fete, let alone the affairs of a nation?</PARA></TALK.START>

The lowering of demand throughout the free world, of course, has had an effect upon Australia's trade. We, unlike the Labor Party, are determined to maintain protection. We have established protection policies for the automotive industry. We have agreed to freeze steel imports. The Labor Party has expressed through its spokesmen that it would lower the level of protection. I take it that that is Labor Party policy; it has not been refuted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we want to maintain and expand employment in Australia we have to look at the real world outside. There is now wage restraint in the countries with which we trade. Those countries are now getting their inflation rate down, primarily by wage restraint. If Australia wants to trade overseas we must be reliable traders and we must reduce our industrial disruption. We have maintained protection policies. We have made our determination to do that perfectly clear, as distinct from the policy of the Labor Party. We have indicated a policy of wage restraint and we are pursuing that. We are talking to the trade union movement and to employers about the need for industrial peace and co-operation. If we want jobs, if we want to compete, that is the road to it. In fact that is the road that the people overseas are taking now and they are the people with whom we have to compete.</PARA>

The answer to Senator Kilgariff's question, of course, will have to await that report from the TEC.

I might mention that to date no State Minister for Education has approached me about the Government's decision.

This is an interesting situation because when I have made, on my feet, a collective reference to the Labor Party members of that party have stood up one by one and said that they were being defamed. Let me simply say at the outset that I reject totally any such offensive words about the National Country Party. The National Country Party is a party elected by the people of Australia. To call the National Country Party a Mafia is a thorough insult to the electors. I hope that the electors who vote for the National Country Party know that the Labor Party considers that that is their judgment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been quite significant discoveries of natural gas in Australia in recent years. Indeed, I can say in modest terms there have been significant discoveries of oil. In order that honourable senators may understand the situation, I point out that a year or two ago in this place I reported that, although we were 67 per cent self-sufficient in indigenous oil and that figure was likely to fall to 50 per cent by 1985, 40 per cent by 1990 and perhaps 20 per cent by the end of the century, the fall was in fact levelling out. Whilst we are not in the position to be so optimistic at the moment let me simply say that it is possible, if the modest supplies of oil that we are now finding continue, that we will be able to maintain the plateau over this decade. That will be a very exciting thing because it will buy us lead time . But equally it is true that the increase in the use of natural gas-I think this is fundamental to Senator Watson's question-has enabled us to switch from oil to natural gas. This has been most valuable indeed and has led, as published figures show, to a decline in the use of oil.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Ian Wilson, today accused the Australian Labor Party of provoking unrest and tension in the period leading up to the Commonwealth Games . . . Mr Wilson said the sort of exaggerated and deliberately provocative political jibes that had been used by the Labor Party on this issue went right against the current attempt by all parties, including Aboriginals themselves, to approach the period of the Commonwealth Games in a spirit of commonsense and moderation.

The question concerned the percentage of the area of Tasmania which has been nominated for the World Heritage List. I am advised that the whole of the South West has been declared a conservation area under Tasmanian legislation and that that area amounts to 19.8 per cent of the total area of Tasmania. But only part of the area declared a conservation area has been nominated for the World Heritage List. The Australian nomination is entitled 'Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks' and it consists of the South West National Park, the Franklin Rivers-Lower Gordon Wild Rivers National Park and the Cradle Mountain and Lake St Clair national parks. It is emphasised that the nominated area consisted at the time of national parks already proclaimed under Tasmanian legislation. That area was already protected by State laws and it actually constitutes 11.3 per cent of the total area of Tasmania.

<ANSWER PAGE="1049" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week Senator Coleman raised a question about the Bunbury regional office of the Department of Social Security and social security payments to wives of construction workers currently on strike at the Worsley project. I reassured Senator Coleman and the Senate of the eligibility of the sorts of people she had mentioned in the question. I have since made inquiries and I am advised by the regional manager in Bunbury that 57 employees of Raymond Engineers Aust. Pty Ltd who are members of the Builders Labourers Federation went on strike on 17 August 1982. As a consequence of the strike 30 or 40 other tradesmen were stood down and on 30 August 1982 the company terminated the employment of the strikers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that the Bunbury office is currently paying a special benefit to about 10 wives of the people concerned and the unemployment benefit to one wife . The special benefit was paid because the 10 people concerned were described as not having satisfied the work test, which I assume means they were not seeking or were not available for work. The one who was on unemployment benefit was rejected for special benefit as hardship could not be proven. She had money in a bank account. I am advised that the advice alleged to have been given to wives of construction workers at the Worsley project did not come from this Department's Bunbury office. Until the question without notice was asked in Parliament the office had no reason to believe that all those affected were not fully aware of the benefits that may be available from the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that no misunderstanding or ignorance of the possible social security entitlements is occurring, the regional manager has now contacted the staff welfare officer at Raymond Engineers to acquaint him with the fact that assistance may be available to the wives of strikers. If the women are in any doubt they will be told to contact the Bunbury regional office direct. All staff at the office are aware of the availability of benefits to wives of strikers and of the current provisions relating to the payment of unemployment benefit to persons who have been stood down or dismissed because of their participation in a strike. I simply assure the Senate that, notwithstanding the Government's introduction of legislation to vary the law in this area, it would of course be my wish, the wish of the Government and, I am sure, the firm intention of my Department to administer these benefits in accordance with the law as it stands.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today Senator Watson asked a question concerning international subscriber dialling information in telephone directories. I have been provided with some information on this matter. Telecom Australia has advised that as ISD becomes a more commonly available service in Australia appropriate detailed information on using the service, additional to that contained in current telephone directories, will be provided. Telecom has advised that it can be difficult to make exact time comparisons by the use of international clocks simply because of the number of different time zones involved and the introduction of summer time within Australia and some other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the honourable senator may be aware that in 1982-83 all metropolitan directories, and some directories of larger provincial centres will contain first a colour information page which has detailed information on ISD calling, including charges in the rest of the world and, secondly, an inclusion on that page referring customers to a separate section of the directory which lists dialling codes for all countries. An indication will also be provided of the time differences between Australia and other countries, but in terms of summer time that may not be complete. This information is available now in brochure form from Telecom business offices.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, on 12 November 1981 my colleague Senator Carrick tabled documents concerning the audit inspection of the accounts and records of Asia Dairy Industries (H.K.) Limited (ADI) and the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations on the Australian Dairy Corporation (ADC) and its Asian subsidiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this statement is to report to the Senate on matters that the Minister for Primary Industry foreshadowed in a statement to the House of Representatives on 29 October 1981 would be the subject of further action or inquiry. These matters are:</PARA>
<PARA> Rebate arrangements which applied to Australian Dairy Produce Board and ADC sales of skim milk powder to Holland Milk Products Inc. (HOMPI) during the period 1974 to 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> The ownership, future use and control of the Dairying Industry Stabilisation Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> General issues of principle relating to statutory authorities raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations in its report on the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Asian subsidiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of whether any breach of the GATT skim milk powder minimum pricing arrangements had occurred apart from those made under the HOMPI arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>HOMPI Rebate Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA> On the first of these matters, a brief statement of the background may be of assistance to Honourable Senators. </PARA>
<PARA> HOMPI is a company incorporated in the Philippines and engaged there in the manufacture and sale of milk and milk products. The ADC holds 13 1/3% of the share capital. Other shareholders are Holland Canned Milk International, a Dutch dairy manufacturing co-operative, owning 26 2/3%, and G.F. Equity Incorporated, an investment and management company incorporated in the Philippines owning 60%. The principal shareholders in G.F. Equity Inc. are Messrs. W. Uytengsu and G. Young who are also President and Vice-President of HOMPI respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> During the period in question-December 1974 to December 1977-the Australian Dairy Produce Board and, from 1975, its successor the ADC, were major suppliers of skim milk powder to HOMPI. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report on the ADC and its Asian subsidiaries, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations drew attention to a $25 per tonne rebate on some ADC shipments of skim milk powder to HOMPI that was not paid to HOMPI but to a bank account in Singapore. Honourable Senators will recall that the Minister for Primary Industry said that he wanted to obtain further information on this matter and find out whether the ADC's involvement was appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end the Minister for Primary Industry requested the Auditor-General to undertake an examination of all aspects of the rebate arrangement, including the accounting procedures by which the money was transferred from Australia; the amount and nature of funds remitted overseas by the ADC to be paid into a Singapore account; the agreement by which the original equity in this account was disposed of; and the ultimate disbursement from and closure of the account. He submitted this request to the Auditor-General in a letter dated 10 November 1981 and I now table that letter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General reported on 27 April 1982, and subsequently on 11 August 1982 he advised of a typographical error in the report. I hereby table both his report and his letter of 11 August 1982. As the Auditor-General's Report was critical of some past actions by the ADC, the Corporation was given the opportunity to respond. Its reply is contained in a document dated 12 July 1982, and I now table this paper. The Auditor-General has been given the opportunity to comment on the ADC response, but his office has replied that it does not believe its role properly extends to any follow up action within the Executive Government that might flow from the Auditor-General's Report. I table this letter, dated 10 August 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's Report was also referred to the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor for advice and I will have more to say on this aspect later. In the meantime, I table the Crown Solicitor's letter, dated 22 June 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> In brief, Mr President, the audit examination indicates that:</PARA>
<PARA> In December 1974 the Australian Dairy Produce Board and Asia Dairy Industries contracted to supply HOMPI with not less than 12,000 tons annually of skim milk powder at competitive prices, this contract to remain in force from year to year unless terminated by mutual agreement of the parties. </PARA>
<PARA> the Australian Dairy Produce Board (and the ADC when it succeeded the Board) invoiced HOMPI at a rate per tonne that did not allow for various rebates, commissions and other adjustments to which HOMPI was entitled. Such adjustments were effected by the raising of credit notes. </PARA>
<PARA> on shipments of skim milk powder during the period to September 1976 credit notes were issued totalling $3,079,145. This total included credits of $1,840, 223 in respect of approved price reductions, $689,516 in respect of a $25 per tonne volume purchase rebate, and $183,148 in respect of a 2% commission. </PARA>
<PARA> HOMPI remitted invoiced amounts in full, and these remittances were credited to the skim milk powder reimbursement account at the Reserve Bank of Australia, Melbourne. Funds equivalent to the credit notes were thus accumulated in this account. </PARA>
<PARA> such funds were transferred, from time to time, on the instruction of ADC staff , to the Chartered Bank, Singapore, for the account of 'The Chartered Bank, Hong Kong Per instruction of Mr Wilfred Uytengsu or Mr George Young'. Mr Uytengsu, it will be recalled, is President of HOMPI, Mr Young is Vice-President. Interest totalling some $54,883 that had accrued in respect of credit note entitlements was paid to HOMPI, Manila, not to the Singapore account. </PARA>
<PARA> The original intention of Mr Uytengsu concerning equity in the funds transferred to the Singapore account is unclear. But given the arrangements among the parties, the Auditor-General considered that the funds belonged to HOMPI which, I repeat, is a Philippines company. There is no evidence, however, that they were at any time reflected in the financial statements of HOMPI. </PARA>
<PARA> On 15 November 1976 it was agreed between HOMPI and the ADC that the volume purchase rebate of $25 per tonne be continued on ADC sales of skim milk powder to HOMPI but 'made ex financial account in Singapore and not to exceed the total held in that account to the credit of the Australian Dairy Corporation'. The Auditor-General has reported that the ADC share of the funds in the Singapore Account would have been fully utilised under this arrangement with a shipment of skim milk powder on 3 December 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as actual disposition of the funds in the Singapore bank account is concerned, according to documentation produced by Mr Uytgengsu, the entitlement of Holland Canned Milk International arising from its shareholding in HOMPI was required to be paid to a bank account in Switzerland. The Auditor-General was not able to ascertain from Mr Uytengsu the name of the holder of the Swiss account. Apart from the amount stated to have been paid to the Swiss account for Holland Canned Milk International and an amount said by Mr Uytengsu to have been distributed as an incentive bonus to employees, the balance of the funds in the Singapore account appears to have been paid to, or retained by, G. F. Equity Inc . G. F. Equity, it will be recalled, is the third and major shareholder in HOMPI , and has as its principal shareholders Messrs Uytengsu and Young. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Auditor-General's report Mr Uytengsu had indicated that the Singapore bank account was closed on 16 March 1979 after payments were made to Holland Canned Milk International and G. F. Equity. It is also reported by the Auditor-General that he was unable to obtain evidence of payments made to either company or of the closure of the account. </PARA>
<PARA> This last aspect was one of those on which the Minister for Primary Industry had asked the Auditor-General to report. But, in light of the fact that the ADC equity in this account had been exhausted in 1977, the closure of the account is not now seen as a matter of direct concern to the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's Report provides further evidence to that given in his earlier report on the audit inspection on the accounts and records of Asia Dairy Industries (H.K.) Limited (ADI), of improper or inadequate management and accounting arrangements that existed within the ADC and ADI during the 1976 and 1977 period. In this regard Honourable Members will recall that, following receipt of the earlier report of the Auditor-General, the ADC established a special management committee to examine and report on managerial and accounting practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Following receipt of the ADC Management Committee Report the Minister for Primary Industry concluded that action was immediately required to overcome certain deficiencies in the management and financial control of ADC. In his statement of 29 October last year, the Minister for Primary Industry reported to the Parliament in the action that has been taken in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The information available from the latest Auditor-General's report also lends weight to the conclusion that in 1976 and 1977 the actions of the ADC led to a breach of the then applying GATT skim milk powder minimum pricing arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not tolerate such activity, and the ADC has been formally directed to ensure that, in the fulfilment of its statutory functions and responsibilities, there is strict compliance with Australia's current responsibilities under the GATT International Dairy Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Corporation has advised exporters that they are required to observe the GATT minimum prices when arranging the sale of dairy products. The Minister for Primary Industry has stated that he will have no hesitation in cancelling the export licences of any exporter reported to him by the ADC, who he finds to be in breach of these export conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already mentioned, the Auditor-General's report was referred to the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor. The reason for this was to seek the Crown Solicitor's opinion as to whether or not the Auditor-General's report disclosed a prima facie case on which any individual in Australia might be prosecuted. In his reply of 22 June 1982, the Crown Solicitor stated that on the material contained in the Auditor-General's report he did not think it was possible to conclude that there is prima facie evidence of the commission of any offence in Australia by any person. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crown Solicitor noted that there may, however, have been a breach of Singapore or Philippines law, but said that, as at present advised, he could see no useful purpose being served by pursuing this aspect of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> From the Government's point of view, the question of a possible breach of Singapore or Philippines law is a matter for authorities of those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as the Minister for Primary Industry stated to the Parliament on 29 October last year, the Government is most concerned that the agencies of statutory authorities abide by the letter and intent of the laws of the countries in which they operate, at all times. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in respect of this matter, honourable senators will note that there is a considerable difference of opinion between the Auditor-General and the ADC on certain aspects of the Auditor-General's report. I do not propose to canvass these differences of opinion. It is, however, worth pointing out that the ADC management group did find in its general overview that the summary of events prepared by the Auditor-General was, with some exceptions, a reasonable assessment of the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Dairying Industry Stabilization Fund</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the matter of the ownership, future use and control of the Dairying Industry Stabilization Fund (DISF). </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee made several observations in respect of the DISF, and these can be summarised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> No clear, undisputed evidence is available to show that any single group in the dairy industry is entitled to claim beneficial or legal 'ownership' of the funds . </PARA>
<PARA> So long as the DISF remains in existence, it should be expended in accordance with section 11 of the Dairying Industry Act. </PARA>
<PARA> If ADI is to be sold or ownership transferred in any way, the DISF should not be made available to any single group within the industry to purchase ADI. </PARA>
<PARA> As the co-operative and proprietary companies, which largely generated the funds which formed the basis for the DISF, have disappeared or merged with other proprietary or co-operative companies, the return of those funds would be administratively difficult and inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government, on behalf of the Australian taxpayers, is entitled to a claim to the ownership of the DISF which, at the very least, ranks equally with dairy industry groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the 'ownership' of the DISF should be the subject of a more explicit statement by the Government than was made in the Minister for Primary Industry's memorandum of 26 June 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the funds originally used to establish the DISF were derived from export sales of dairy produce and were, at that time, clearly the property of the industry, it would be difficult to justify a taxpayer claim on the present assets of the fund. </PARA>
<PARA> In his statement to the Parliament on 29 October 1981, the Minister for Primary Industry announced that he had asked his Department to meet with representatives of the ADC and the dairy industry to consider the Senate Committee's recommendations and to report to him on the matter. These discussions have now been completed, and agreement reached in May this year that the fund should continue to be used for the benefit of the industry generally, and in accordance with section 11 of the Dairying Industry Act. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist in clarifying the future use and control of the DISF, guidelines have been drawn up by the Department of Primary Industry in consultation with representatives of the Australian Dairy Industry Conference and the ADC. The Minister for Primary Industry has approved the guidelines and I hereby table a copy. Honourable Senators will note that expenditure from the Fund will continue to be on the recommendation of the ADC, after consultation with the Conference, and will require ministerial approval. </PARA>
<PARA>General Guidelines for Statutory Authorities</PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators know, the Senate committee's report raises many general issues of principle such as ministerial control of statutory authorities, including powers of direction; the development of suitable guidelines for the establishment, operation and accountability of statutory authorities and subsidiary companies; the duties and responsibilities of members of such authorities and companies; and reporting requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> These general issues of principle have been under examination by an inter- departmental committee, but the Government has not yet completed its consideration on all aspects. When the task is completed, a statement will be made by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Breaches of the GATT Minimum Pricing Arrangements other than those under the HOMPI Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA> Documents tabled last November included a report by the ADC on the question of whether any breach of the GATT skim milk powder minimum pricing arrangements had occurred apart from those made under the HOMPI arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> This ADC report drew attention, in respect of Corporation sales, to sales made to Mexico between June and November 1976 for which the lack of documentation on some aspects may have been a cover for a possible breach of the GATT minimum pricing arrangements. In respect of trader-to-trader sales the ADC reported that an exhaustive search has been made of the Corporation records but no trace could be found of the Certificates of Authority to Export skim milk powder for the period in question. Without this information the ADC could not establish that all exports were approved at or above the GATT minimum price. On the basis of this the Minister for Primary Industry asked his Department to investigate these matters further. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Primary Industry has now examined the records held by the ADC , including records of concessional adjustments available to major recombiners. It has reported that while it is possible to infer that certain sales made by the ADC to Mexico may have been in breach of the GATT minimum price, on the basis of the available documentation this is not certain. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is evidence of ADC sales from April 1976 to July 1976 at the GATT agreement minimum price to Alaska Milk Industry Limited, in Thailand, accompanied by a rebate paid to Holland Canned Milk International, Alaska Milk's parent company. Whether or not this last arrangement involved a breach of the GATT agreement is open to question because the discount was paid to a third party. Nevertheless, from the ADC papers available, it appears that at the time the then senior management of the ADC believed that the GATT agreement was being breached by payment of this rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Primary Industry also confirmed that the records now available within the ADC are inadequate to identify any trader-to-trader sales that may have breached the GATT agreement. A questionnaire has been sent to all licenced exporters in order to determine what records they have retained in respect of the period concerned. Responses to date indicate that it will be impossible to show whether or not there was any widespread breach of the GATT arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Matters</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in the Minister for Primary Industry's statement of 29 October 1981 and in the related documents that were tabled, it was indicated that work had not been completed on some matters. These were:</PARA>
<PARA> Guidelines for future borrowing and investment by ADI. </PARA>
<PARA> definition and documentation of the respective duties and responsibilities of ADC and ADI accounting staff in relation to ADI transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> a review of the desirability of ADI maintaining its Hong Kong presence</PARA>
<PARA> a review of the ADI Hong Kong accounting arrangements</PARA>
<PARA> conclusion of a management agreement with Thai Dairy Industries</PARA>
<PARA> review of employment conditions for ADI expatriate staff. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been considerable progress on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The borrowing and investment guidelines for ADI will be finalised when the Government has decided on the guidelines to apply to Statutory Authorities generally. Meanwhile, the situation with regard to borrowings and investments by ADI remains that no borrowings are to be undertaken without the approval of the Treasurer and the Minister for Primary Industry and no investment is to be undertaken without specific approval from the Minister for Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The respective duties and responsibilities of ADC and ADI accounting staff in relation to ADI transactions have been clarified and are now being fully documented. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as maintaining a Hong Kong presence is concerned, ADI management has undertaken a study of the commercial benefits and costs, and the ADI Board has now to consider this study. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the review of the ADI Hong Kong accounting arrangements, a number of changes have been implemented. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> revised procedures for processing financial transactions</PARA>
<PARA> an upgraded system of internal financial control in the Hong Kong office, which was developed in conjunction with the ADI auditors</PARA>
<PARA> revised procedures dealing with the frequency and nature of reporting on the utilisation of financial facilities</PARA>
<PARA> new procedures, developed in consultation with ADI auditors, for verifying ADI expenses in Australia, which have overcome the need for ADI auditors to qualify ADI financial statements on this aspect as in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of computerising ADI accounts in the Hong Kong office was examined but computerisation was found to be uneconomic. </PARA>
<PARA> Negotiations are continuing with Thai Dairy Industries on the management agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The review of employment conditions for expatriate ADI staff has been completed , resulting in greater standardisation of conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in conclusion, let me say that I believe we are approaching the end of a prolonged period of searching examination of the operations of the ADC and ADI. The Government has been determined to ensure that everything possible be done to shed light on past happenings and to establish the ground for proper operations in the future. Let me reiterate the action that has been taken:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1979, the Minister for Primary Industry decided that a review of the role and functions of the ADI and the joint venture operations should be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister accordingly sought an inspection and audit of the accounts and records of ADI by the Commonwealth Auditor-General under Section 63P of the Audit Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's report disclosed deficiencies in the management and operations of ADI and its dealings with the ADC. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADC established a special management committee to examine all aspects of the Auditor-General's report dealing with managerial and accounting practices of ADI. When the ADC reported on 26 October 1979 the Minister for Primary Industry concluded that action was immediately required to overcome deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Detailed information was provided to the Parliament last year on the action that had been taken. On some matters, action was incomplete at that time and I have now indicated what further work has been done on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1981, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations reported on the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Asian subsidiaries. The information disclosed in this report concerning a special account set up for the purpose of receiving moneys associated with rebates paid on skim milk powder sales to HOMPI was of concern. The Government was determined that as much information as possible should be obtained about this account. I therefore requested the Auditor-General to undertake a special examination of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's latest report is now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to lay to rest once and for all claims that have been made by the Opposition that the Government has attempted to cover up aspects of this issue. This is completely untrue, and I want to emphasise that most forcibly. The Government has placed before the Parliament relevant documents relating to the entire issue. We have followed up on outstanding matters and have ensured the implementation of a whole range of administrative changes to improve the operations of the ADC and the ADI. It has, indeed, been a long and drawn out process, but this has largely been brought about by the need to ensure that all issues raised have been properly examined and fairly dealt with. Our emphasis now will be concentrated on ensuring that the reforms that have been implemented are doing the required job. If they are found to be deficient in this regard, then corrective action will be taken without delay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement and associated reports tabled by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and tabled in the House of Representatives last week comprise the latest instalment in the continuing scandal of maladministration of the Australian dairy industry, of personal impropriety, and of corporate, departmental and ministerial negligence. It is more than three years since Bill Hayden raised in the House of Representatives the question of malfeasance within a statutory authority under the control of the then Minister, Mr Sinclair. He was promptly denounced for raising the issue, as I was on numerous subsequent occasions for pressing it in the Senate. There were strenuous attempts to cover up or trivialise the matter by an agricultural media which was at best negligent and at worst corrupt. Certainly Ronald Andersen's role could be fairly described as corrupt. It included a clear instance of perjury before a Senate committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The chief substance of the Minister's statement, the Auditor-General's report dated 27 April and subsequent comments thereon is the rebate paid by the Australian Dairy Corporation over more than two years on skim milk sales to Holland Milk Products Inc. On page 15 the report notes, I believe rather disturbingly, that although that rebate was paid from 1 July 1974, no formal authorisation can be found of that rebate in the minutes of Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd or the Australian Dairy Corporation until 24 August 1976. The Auditor-General's report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Even though this approval was given some 18 months after commencement of shipments to HOMPI, to apply retrospectively, it remains the only formal approval for the payment of the $25 a tonne rebate. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same page the Auditor-General notes that the Skim Milk Powder Equalisation Advisory Committee minutes of 24 August 1976 included the following :</PARA>
<PARA> A draft letter from the Chairman to the Australian Dairy Corporation, outlining the past agreement with Holland Milk Inc., was read to the meeting, and it was agreed the Chairman be authorised to sign same. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter, the signing of which was authorised on 24 August 1976 was, oddly enough, the Auditor-General notes, dated 1 June 1976. So we have retrospective authorisation of both correspondence and rebates paid. On page 17 the Auditor- General details overpayments in the form of excessive discounts and rebates paid to HOMPI totalling almost a quarter of a million dollars. It notes in very many places the conflicting evidence given by various people associated with the industry at the time as to the nature of the rebate that was paid-whether it was additional to or in lieu of discounts which had previously been paid-and it dwells at some length on, to say the least, the very untidy administrative arrangements which had been followed by the Corporation over that long period. I stress that throughout this period the Department of Primary Industry had a member on the Board of the Corporation, ostensibly representing the Minister, the Government and the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The secondary issue arising-and, concerning the proper administration of government, the most important issue-from the payment of the rebate itself was the fact that as from April 1976 it was reported to the Board of the Corporation that the discount which was being provided to HOMPI had taken the price of the Australian product below the agreed GATT minimum price of $US350. There was a subsequent dispute, which was the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, as to the time at which the Minister was made aware of that breach. There is no official record of the Minister having been made aware of that breach until the end of August 1976. There was a further dispute as to whether, when an arrangement was entered into in November 1976 between Mr Uytengsu, the HOMPI representative, and representatives of the Australian Dairy Corporation to continue surreptitiously paying the rebate from the equity built up in the Singapore account standing to the credit of the Australian Dairy Corporation, the Minister, subsequent to the middle of November 1976, was aware of a continuing breach of the GATT. I simply note that the Auditor-General's report does not dispute the finding of the Senate committee which investigated this matter, and which unanimously found that Mr Webster was more likely to have been telling the truth about that than Mr Sinclair. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General was unable to state with certainty the beneficiaries of what was ultimately $4m, which included an interest payment, which had been deposited in the bank account in Singapore. One million dollars of that Singapore bank account balance was paid to a numbered Swiss bank account, the ultimate beneficiaries of which the Auditor-General was unable to trace. We know that at the time this was going on the Minister was desperately short of money. The Auditor-General was unable to say with certainty who the ultimate beneficiaries of that untraceable $1m-untraceable beyond the payment to a numbered Swiss bank account-were. I guess it is as a guy said to me over the weekend: 'No wonder the Minister refused to give evidence to the Senate committee'. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a matter raised on page 22 of the Auditor-General's report which is, or could be, quite crucial to the question whether Minister Sinclair was aware of the continuing breach of the GATT through the surreptitious payment of a rebate from the Corporation's equity in the Singapore bank account. I refer to the quotation from a memorandum dated 13 October 1976 from Mr Webster to Mr Kennedy, the Financial Controller of the Australian Dairy Corporation. The memo stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Shipments of skim milk powder consigned to HOMPI, Philippines, invoiced on and after 1 June through to 30 September 1976, on which the $25 per tonne commission is payable, should be debited against the ADI/ADC Corporation share of the account currently held in Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter was raised at the Estimates Committee H meeting last Thursday. The officers present were asked whether a copy of that memo was forwarded to the Department and whether a copy of the memo was subsequently forwarded to the Ministers. I think it would be fair to say that the officers fudged the question on the grounds that a similar and near-identical question had already been placed on notice regarding that matter. The officers said that a reply had been prepared to that question and that copies either had been sent to the Minister or were about to be sent to the Minister. Of course, they would not disclose the substance of that reply. I do not know whether the Minister will make that reply available to the Parliament, whether he will refer it back for a different sort of reply or whether he will let the question languish on the Notice Paper indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA> If it should be that a copy of that memo was sent to the Department and was not sent to the Minister the Department was yet again highly negligent. If it was sent to the Minister then the Minister clearly knew more than a month before the meeting between Australian Dairy Corporation representatives and Mr Uytengsu in the Philippines on 15 November 1976 of the surreptitious arrangements which had been made to continue paying the rebate in breach of GATT. If the Minister saw the memo there is irrefutable evidence that the Minister condoned that breach. The official Government defence of the Minister on this matter was that the Minister did not know of the continuing breach of GATT and, therefore, was not guilty. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told over the last couple of days that Minister Sinclair's successor knew and was told about corruption in the meat inspection service. But he is not guilty either. The Minister who does not know is not guilty and the Minister who does know is not guilty! The only constant in the Government line on this matter is that no National Country Party Minister is ever guilty. I heard the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) say on the radio that he was very angry about something that was contained in the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry. It is now clear that the incident which made him angry was not Mr Nixon's negligence but the fact that the Royal Commissioner pointed the finger at Mr Nixon. That is like excusing the bank robber and blaming the cop who blew the whistle on him. As a newspaper columnist observed a couple of weeks ago, no Minister can be found guilty of impropriety under this Prime Minister unless he is caught with both hands in the till under an arc lamp , and even then it has to be shown live on television. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Auditor-General produced a lengthy response from the Australian Dairy Corporation which consisted mostly of nit picking. Apart from the nit picking, which constituted most of the response, and the identification of quite trivial error, one could not do better in rebutting the Dairy Corporation's attempted white-wash than to quote from the Auditor-General, who in a subsequent letter said:</PARA>
<PARA> The report has generated a remarkable resurgence of memory on the part of officers of the Corporation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They were amazingly able to recall incidents that they could not recall when officers of the Auditor-General's office had questioned them before. The Solicitor-General, an office which is known to share broadly the judgment of the newspaper columnist who said that nobody in this Government is guilty unless he is caught under an arc lamp with both fists in the till, in a letter to the Minister of 22 June this year stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it would not be possible, on the material contained in the report, to conclude that there is prima facie evidence on the commission of any offence in Australia by any person. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words 'by any person'. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If under Singapore or Philippines law there exist offences of the kind referred to in paragraph 6 above-</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 6 lists the offences as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> a defrauding of the company by the shareholders; and</PARA>
<PARA> a failure by the Directors of the company to act honestly and to use reasonable diligence in the affairs of the company. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there may well have been a breach of that law. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the law of Singapore or the Philippines. The Solicitor-General continued:</PARA>
<PARA> But, as at present advised, I cannot see any useful purpose that would be served by pursuing this aspect of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>That view was endorsed by the Minister in the statement which has just been tabled. If the laws of Singapore and the Philippines have been broken that is a matter for the governments of those countries to take up. I suppose that is a truism. We cannot prosecute people for breaches of the laws of Singapore or the Philippines, but it ought to be a matter of concern to this Government that there is a prima facie case against its agents-the members of the Dairy Corporation and the directors of Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd are agents of the Government of Australia-of breaches of the law of Singapore and the Philippines. With one minor exception to which I will refer later-a person who was not directly associated with any of these matters-nobody involved in politics, the bureaucracy or the industry has been in any way disciplined by the Government for those offences. </PARA>
<PARA> Maladministration of the Department of Primary Industry or of the dairy industry did not cease with the departure of the previous Minister in September 1979. It was subsequently revealed that in December 1981 Mr Nixon had intervened to waive a penalty against Murray-Goulburn Co-operative Ltd, in which he was a shareholder. There was, among other things, a prima facie breach of the Bowen guidelines to which Ministers in this Government are supposed to adhere. On 4 and 5 May of this year it was reported to a meeting of the Corporation board that one dairy company-and, it was subsequently discovered, about five other dairy companies-had failed to repay Reserve Bank of Australia advances when the product against which the money was advanced had been sold. Again, Murray- Goulburn was an offender. According to the Minister, he was told of that breach of the Reserve Bank loan conditions on 17 May. The officer present at the meeting of the Corporation board on 4 and 5 May-Mr Thorn, if I remember correctly-in a manner reminiscent of Al Wallace before the Senate Standing Commitee on Finance and Government Operations, offered less than unequivocal endorsement of the Minister's claim that he had not been told of the matter until 17 May. That occurred before Estimates Committee H last Thursday. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the regime of the present Minister more than a year ago the Australian Dairy Corporation received a firm offer of $US10m for its equity in PT Indomilk. The contract for the sale which had been signed was, not surprisingly, conditional upon no objections being raised by the Indonesian Government or the Australian Minister. The Australian Minister intervened to prevent that sale from proceeding. It is claimed that the Indonesian Government would not have permitted the sale to proceed. That may or may not be true. However, the point is that the Indonesian Government was never given the opportunity to pass judgment on the matter because the Australian Minister intervened first. As a result of that intervention, the Australian Dairy Corporation has forgone $US10m for its equity in the company. I know that quite recently the General Manager of the Australian Dairy Corporation warned that the company-that is PT Indomilk- could go into bankruptcy and there would be little if any equity left for the Australian partner, the Australian Dairy Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is likely that as a direct result of further meddling by the present Minister for Primary Industry, for reasons which he has deigned not even to explain, the Dairy Industry Stabilisation Fund will have lost $US10m. The affairs of the dairy industry and the Ministers responsible in recent years are a veritable encyclopaedia of chicanery. The only person punished in any way as a result of all this was Mr Pyle who falsified his travel claims to the Corporation or, if one prefers his version, disconnected the speedo on the Corporation's car. If one looks objectively at that case in isolation, of course Mr Pyle deserves more punishment than he got. He should not have been left on the Corporation board. But he may well ask the question: 'Why have I alone been singled out for any discipline or punishment?' Of course, Mr Nixon's permissive view of Pyle's behaviour, or of Pyle's misconduct, is totally consistent with his later response to disclosures by Mr Kelly of bribery and corruption in the meat inspection service. Having set a new standard of permissiveness in the Pyle case, and in the Australian Dairy Corporation in general-or having had new standards of permissiveness set for him by his predecessor-Mr Nixon then followed those standards in his judgment on the allegations made by Mr Kelly. The final cost of that piece of ministerial negligence, when subsequently the Americans find out about it, is likely to be a great deal more than the $US10m lost to the dairy industry because of Mr Nixon's intervention in the sale of the Dairy Corporation's equity in PT Indomilk. </PARA>
<PARA> There are matters raised in the Auditor-General's report which I believe merit further investigation. In particular, to cite just one, I refer to what is euphemistically referred to as the management fee applied to the account in the Singapore bank into which the rebate and some other payments were directed. There is conflicting evidence, according to the Auditor-General, from the two parties principally concerned as to what happened to what is described as the management fee. This raises two questions: Firstly, whether the management fee is a payment that ought to have been made and, secondly, even if the management fee payment was legitimate, whether the people who finally received those funds were entitled to them. For that, among other reasons, I move the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'That', insert 'the matters raised in the Minister's statement and the papers tabled by him be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for further investigation and report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take part in this discussion of the statement of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) referring to the Australian Dairy Corporation and to Australia's dairy industry. I am afraid that this appears to be an area in which considerable investigation has been seen to be necessary as a result of various occurrences. In fairness, I believe also that it is an area in which there has been a great measure of investigation in an attempt to ensure that Australia's trading guidelines in the field of the dairy industry are in accordance with the trading guidelines that we as a signigicant trading nation seek to follow with our trading partners all around the world. But I am afraid that when we are discussing matters of trade in various parts of the world very often circumstances arise that may not appear to be totally in line with what we all seek to establish. When that becomes the circumstance, of course a real measure of emotion enters into the discussion and perhaps we may tend to lose a little of our perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that there can be any questioning of the purpose or determination of the Minister in this exercise. The Minister has a very deep- seated and long-existing knowledge of the very industry under discussion. Over and above that, of course, the industry that we are discussing is one of Australia's most basic industries. It is of very great significance not only in the internal Australian economy but also in our capacity to establish overseas credit. We would also be aware that over the years this industry has suffered significantly from fierce competition. I think we should remind ourselves from time to time, as we seek to follow the dicatates of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-that Agreement, of course, is basic to the final effective operation of international trade-that in many circumstances and in many places around the world those very guidelines, essential as they are, are under a significant measure of threat. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer, for example, to the trading relationships of entities such as the European Economic Community, although this may not directly involve the guidelines of GATT. One of the enormous problems that confront the rest of the trading world and certainly must tend to throw very great strain on the capacity of the trading world to maintain and develop the trading guidelines of GATT is the actions which occur when we see, for instance, very significant subsidised surpluses coming from the European Community, entering the field of international trade and competing totally unfairly in that area. I mention these things in order that we might seek to be aware of the sorts of strains and tensions that occur when responsible people, representing a great Australian industry, seek to maintain and develop markets in what in many cases can only be described as unfortunate and very difficult conditions. Perhaps in some parts of the trading world there is an acceptance of standards that are in some measure alien to the standards which we seek to establish and adopt. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement that the Senate has before it this afternoon-I have barely had time to read it in any detail-refers to many of the problems that have been highlighted, I believe, by the investigation of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations into these matters. It has identified various areas that have been referred to. I believe that if we take a fair and responsible view of the issue we will agree that it seems that as to the problems that have been highlighted over the past several years-back to 1976-77 at least-appropriate and strong action has been taken. Indeed, problems that have been identified have been overcome as a result of the Government's determinations following these various investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Holland Milk Products Inc. arrangements, of course, are quite central to the issue of this debate this afternoon. My information seems to show that the ADC holds only 13 1/3 per cent of the share capital in HOMPI, whilst 23 1/3 per cent of that capital is held by the Holland Canned International Milk Company, a Dutch dairy manufacturing organisation, and the balance-the significant majority of share capital-is held by an entity known as G.F. Equity Inc. In the period 1974 to 1977-that is when the Australian dairy industry seemed to be so involved in these investigations and discussions-the Australian Dairy Corporation was a major supplier of skim milk to the HOMPI organisation. It appears that at least in some of those negotiations there has been a rebate of some $25 a tonne. This rebate has applied to some-I am not sure whether it is a significant number but certainly to some-ADC shipments of skim milk powder to the HOMPI organisation. That rebate has been paid to a bank account in Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister involved has sought the widest and most responsible information he can get on this whole matter. The Auditor-General was requested to investigate the rebate situation on, I understand, 10 November 1981. He reported on 27 April this year. A typographical error occurred in the report and a correction was made on 11 August 1982. The audit examination of the Australian Dairy Produce Board, as it then was-it became the Australian Dairy Corporation-found that there were certain problems within that operative. ADC and Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd contracted to supply-this was a significant contract-some 12,000 tonnes a year of skim milk powder to HOMPI, a Philippine based organisation. To September 1976 there were credit notes to the value of approximately $3.07m, including $1.84m in approved price adjustments and $689,500 in rebates, together with a 2 per cent commission. </PARA>
<PARA> It does appear that these matters have been identified. The purpose of the Auditor-General's investigation was to seek an explanation of these problems which clearly appeared to the Minister to require some real and proper investigation and consideration. The Auditor-General commented on some improper management and accounting arrangements within the ADC and ADI in the 1976-77 period. The result, of course, was that, at the request of the Minister, the Australian Dairy Corporation established a special management committee to examine and report on the management and accounting practices of this particular organisation. Its report was acted upon on 29 October 1981. That was one of several occasions on which the Minister concerned acted promptly and appropriately in having matters that could well have been problem matters examined and reported and recommended upon. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the Swiss bank account to which Senator Walsh referred could well have some connection with the Dutch part in the HOMPI organisation. The Solicitor-General is concerned that perhaps Singapore and Philippines law may be involved and may indeed have been breached by the contractual or trading arrangements between HOMPI and the Australian Dairy Corporation. Indeed, the Philippines tax office at this moment has requested certain detail from Australia in that particular area and a significant investigation in that field is under way. The Government would naturally be extremely concerned at any possibility of breaching the laws of some other country with whom Australia may be a trading partner; indeed, with breaching the laws of any other country, regardless of any specific trading relationship. The Government has at all times expressed a very real concern that statutory authorities, important though they may be and important though the task they perform is, abide by all appropriate laws. Basically I believe that statutory authorities in this country in the marketing field have performed and are performing tasks of very great value, not only to the industries they represent but also to the total Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the concern of the Government that these authorities remain well and truly within the laws not only of their own country but also of the countries with which they trade is a matter of prime importance and quite clearly it is a matter of which the Minister himself is well aware. But as indeed happens in so many fields in which we find ourselves involved with a judgment, with a determination of the law, in this case there is a confusion and something of a difference of opinion between the Australian Dairy Corporation and the Auditor-General's views in certain areas. These matters will be discussed further and illuminated in the days and weeks ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dairy Industry Stabilization Fund was an area under some considerable comment. The Department, the ADC and the industry have consulted at length and in considerable detail on this matter and have decided that the Fund should continue to be used to the benefit of the industry generally and that it should operate within section 11 of the Dairying Industry Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to continue this debate this afternoon at great length. All I want to maintain is that, in what can only be described sometimes as significantly strained circumstances in international trade, it is not always certain that the absolute guidelines of the GATT will be observed, even though it is the instruction of this Government, the very determined and definite instruction of this Government and, in this case, of the Minister concerned, that we as a country must always operate within those guidelines. There are circumstances when there are strains, when there are measures of urgency to find a market, almost any market, for surpluses that may well be embarrassing, may well be crucial to the survival of significant industries. In these circumstances, emotion and problems have occurred and will no doubt continue to occur. But what is abundantly clear is that the Minister has on all occasions acted promptly and determinedly when some form of, perhaps, indiscretion or some unusual procedure has been brought to his attention. It is the purpose of the Government that that sort of investigation will continue, that Australia will remain a significant trader, as indeed it must always be, within the basic rules of international trade. The great tragedy of international trade is that some of the strains that are placed upon it are strains that are placed upon it by people who decide to trade right outside the very rules that are the basic concern of this particular Government and the industries of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like most really important scandals-those showing incompetence, corruption and negligence, eating right into the heart of the government-the facts involved in the dairy industry scandal are complex, difficult to follow and difficult to retain. It is easy to lose sight of the wood for the trees. But I do not believe that they are as complex as all that. I do not believe that the salient points cannot be summarised in about half a dozen propositions which reveal just how much difficulty the Government is in as a result of these reports. In coming to grips with the basic issues, I think it is necessary to look at the relevant findings of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations and weigh them against the findings of the Auditor-General and, to some extent, the Crown Solicitor, who participated in the Government investigation which is the subject of this statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first relevant finding of the Senate Committee is that during 1976-77, during the period Mr Ian Sinclair was Minister for Primary Industry, by virtue of a secret rebate arrangement with its Filipino trading partner, HOMPI-Holland Milk Products Inc.-and possibly also in relation to other overseas trading partners, Australia was in significant breach of its international trading obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. That finding of the Senate Committee is fully confirmed by the report now before us and acknowledged to be intolerable by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) who put down the statement. The second crucial finding of the Senate Committee was as to the extent of ministerial involvement in that particular breach of international trade law. As to the question of whether the Minister, Mr Sinclair knew of and approved of the illegal arrangement, there was a conflict between the Minister and the then Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation, Mr Webster, which the Committee resolved by concluding that 'on the balance of probabilities Mr Sinclair's recollection of the events was not as reliable as that of Mr Webster'; a damning conclusion, and one that was, of course, the subject of very considerable political controversy at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> As to that conclusion and as to the question of the Minister's involvement, there are, of course, no further findings in the Auditor-General's report or any of the other material before us today. But certainly it should be acknowledged and put on record that there is absolutely nothing in any of those findings to contradict or undermine the conclusion of the Senate Committee as to the Minister's culpability. The third finding of the Senate Committee--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chaney" NAMEID="EF4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am suggesting that, given the amount of digging about that the Auditor-General's staff quite properly did in the discharge of their duties to get to the bottom of the rebate arrangements and the circumstances that surrounded them, if there had been evidence of a character which could have got Mr Sinclair off the hook there is no doubt that it would have emerged during the course of this inquiry. The fact that it did not has a significance that honourable senators can judge for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third simple proposition to emerge from this saga is the clear finding of the Senate Committee that there were manifest inadequacies and improprieties in the general management and the general accounting practice of the Australian Dairy Corporation and Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Limited during the period in question-again, of course, during which period Mr Sinclair was the responsible Minister. That particular finding is fully and, indeed, explicitly confirmed in the language of the Minister in his tabling statement today. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth crucial proposition to emerge from the Senate Committee report was that one of the improprieties, or at least inadequately documented aspects, of the ADC's financial management related to its payment of rebates, commissions and price reduction commitments, amounting in all to some $3m, to its Filipino trading partner, HOMPI. The payments in question-most notoriously the $25 a tonne rebate, which was the amount immediately involved in Australia's breach of GATT-were made, as the Senate Committee found, not to HOMPI itself, which was the company immediately, contractually, if one likes, entitled to those rebates and commissions, but rather to a Singapore bank account operated by two individuals, both of them directors of HOMPI but more immediately playing the role of the principals of HOMPI's majority shareholder, a company called G.F. Equity Inc. That was the set of transactions-the payment of those moneys to this obscure Singapore bank account operated by individuals having no formal authority from the company to which the money should have been paid-which raised , of course, a whole series of questions as to who was benefiting from this highly unusual financial arrangement. What the Senate Committee could do was no more than raise questions of those kinds. </PARA>
<PARA> What the report before us today and the findings of the Auditor-General have established is that there was definitely $3m-in fact a little more than that when we take into account the interest payments which accumulated on the funds in question-paid in this way and that the accounts were treated in the way that the Senate Committee suggested had been the case. This in fact is confirmed by the Auditor-General's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth point associated with that that was made by the Senate Committee was that in the disbursement of those moneys that found their way into the Singapore bank account serious improprieties may have occurred. The Senate Committee was told that the arrangement was that the moneys in question were to be disbursed to the three companies which constituted HOMPI shareholders, and disbursed in proportions which represented the respective equity in HOMPI of the three companies involved. That is to say, G.F. Equity was to get 60 per cent of the moneys accumulated in this account, the Dutch company Holland Canned Milk International was to get 26 2/3 per cent and the Australian Dairy Corporation, which was a 13 1/3 per cent shareholder, was to get that proportion of the moneys in question. The Senate Committee found itself reasonably satisfied that the amount standing to the credit of the ADC was in fact fully credited to ADC, albeit only in the form of continuing illegal rebates on subsequent shipments of skim milk. The Committee was not satisfied, however, that the balance of the moneys in question was in fact fully and properly credited to the other shareholders, especially the Dutch company Holland Canned Milk, but found itself unable to take that matter any further. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the key matters dealt with in the Auditor-General's report is the disbursement of the moneys in the Singapore bank account. Some very interesting new things emerge from the Auditor-General's report in that respect. The Auditor -General's report, which is accompanied in this respect by a Crown Solicitor's opinion which I will come to in a moment, confirms that there may have been spectacular improprieties in the disbursement of that money from that bank account in Singapore. In the first place there is no evidence at all that the moneys were disbursed at any stage or in any proportion to Holland Canned Milk. The nearest thing that can be established is that sums totalling just over $1m were sent to a Swiss bank for and on behalf of an anonymous account holder in that bank. Who ended up getting what out of this little arrangement, out of that little sum, is a matter that remains one for fascinating speculation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that emerges from the Auditor-General's account of the way in which these moneys were disbursed is the new information that the pool from which the moneys were credited back from this account to the ADC and possibly to the other shareholders was in fact reduced by 10 per cent. Ten per cent of the gross funds in the Singapore bank account, put there by the Australian Dairy Corporation as part of its secret commissions and rebates to HOMPI, was extracted from the pool, totalling some $406,000-to be precise $405,971-before the moneys were credited to ADC, sent off to Swiss bank accounts or dealt with in other mysterious ways. The reduction of the moneys in that account by that percentage sum raises questions as to not only the implications of this for the ADC getting its hands on its ahare of the total sum which was credited to that account, but also more immediately as to who got the benefit of that little piece of largess. Who was the beneficiary of the $406,000 that was taken out of the moneys in the Singapore bank account before they were dealt with in the other ways in question? The Auditor-General was unable to find out. He asked Mr Uytengsu, the HOMPI principal and G. F. Equity principal, who is the man in the middle of all of this in the Philippines. Mr Uytengsu says that this sum of money, this 10 per cent, this $406,000, constituted something mysteriously described as an 'M bonus' and amounted in fact to an incentive bonus to management and key personnel of the Filipino company. It is an interesting question as to who constituted 'key personnel' for this purpose. Mr McCartney, the other key figure in this whole series of negotiations, who was at all relevant times a director of HOMPI, had a different view as to what this $406, 000 had been taken out of the pool in the Singapore bank account for. He said it was in the nature of a management fee paid to G. F. Equity, just one of the three shareholder companies. Both Mr McCartney and Mr Uytengsu apparently denied that any HOMPI director got his hands on any of that money. But it remains quite obscure, in the absence of any other positive information supplied to the Auditor-General or to anyone else by Mr Uytengsu or anyone else, as to who got what. It is a very large and very interesting question that remains to be resolved in this particular way. What is clear is that just over $400,000 of this particular slush fund stood available to anyone whom Mr Uytengsu and his friends wanted to pay off in Australia or elsewhere to facilitate their trading arrangements. Again, it can only for the moment be a matter for speculation as to who was paid off with that particular sum of money or proportions of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it was a matter of further concern to the Senate Committee, and evident concern to the Government, that not only improprieties may have occurred in the disposition of these funds from the Singapore account but also that actual illegalities may have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> It was in this respect that the Crown Solicitor was in fact asked to advise the Government. I do not know how long the Government had to wait for the advice in this respect but the document that has been tabled is dated 22 June 1982. The relevant part of that document states:</PARA>
<PARA> If funds belonging to a company operating in Australia were distributed in this country to shareholders of the company in circumstances corresponding to those in which the proceeds of $25 rebate were apparently distributed, either in Singapore or the Philippines, to the shareholders of Hompi, it is likely that offences in at least two areas would have been committed:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a defrauding of the company by the shareholders; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a failure by the Directors of the company to act honestly and to use reasonable diligence in the affairs of the company. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr O'Donovan, the Crown Solicitor, did not descend to any more detail in his opinion to enable us to formulate a more precise understanding as to exactly how the law in question, in his opinion, might have operated had this transaction occurred in Australia. But he did state clearly in a subsequent paragraph that he did not think any offence under Australian law was constituted by these events since they involved overseas companies acting outside Australia. However, he did raise the question as to whether or not there may be breaches of law in the Philippines or Singapore. He said it was impossible and inappropriate for him to follow up that question further. </PARA>
<PARA> We have at the very least behaviour which on the face of it, had it occurred in Australia, would have constituted a breach, presumably a clear breach, of Australian law and behaviour which may well have constituted not only impropriety but also a breach of the law of the countries with which Australia was trading. That, of course, is an intolerable situation. That was acknowledged , I am happy to make clear, by the Minister himself in his statement when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government is most concerned that the agencies of statutory authorities abide by the letter and intent of the laws of the countries in which they operate, at all times. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is a sentiment with which the Opposition fully agrees. Other matters are dealt with in the report and in the material tabled, and many other aspects of maladministration are revealed in the very detailed documentation now on the table. But it should also be said that in addition to the matters in this report there are in fact a number of other matters, including some of quite fundamental policy significance-for example, the provision of appropriate guidelines to govern the conduct of statutory authorities engaged in commercial trading activities-upon which the Minister has not reported in this statement or in any of the accompanying documentation. The Minister has not given us an indication of when we can expect to get reports on the many outstanding matters to which he referred and listed his statement. He simply took a rain-check on those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason alone, I suggest to the Senate that it is appropriate that the whole question raised by the dairy industry scandal go back to the Senate Standing Commitee on Finance and Government Operations, as Senator Walsh suggested, for further review. The main reason this whole matter needs further detailed consideration by the Committee is that it does clearly reveal a continuing sorry saga of maladministration in both the Department of Primary Industry and the relevant statutory authority. Some of the detail of that maladministration relates to the past and has not yet come to light. I refer here in this particular respect to the circumstances surrounding the disbursement of the funds in the Singapore bank account and as to who got what, in particular who in Australia might have got what, out of that slush fund and, in particular, the amount of $406,000 which remains utterly unaccountable for. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the scrutiny and further investigation of matters presumably past there is some question as to maladministration that continues in the Department and in the authority. The footnote to the letter to the Deputy Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet from the Auditor- General's Office dated 10 August 1982 is very revealing in this respect. This is the further letter from the Auditor-General's Office in which the Auditor- General's Office laid out its response to what, in turn, had been the Australian Dairy Corporation's response to the original report of the Auditor-General. The First Assistant Auditor-General, Mr Monaghan, who signed this letter, said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is only one other comment that we would make. Many of the observations by the Corporation relate to details of little, if any, consequence, but we note that the report has generated a remarkable resurgence of memory on the part of officers of the Corporation who, during the audit investigation, found themselves unable to offer more than the barest modicum of information to the audit team. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very revealing paragraph and a very important proposition for the Senate Committee to consider. It clearly suggests-it is rather politely stated but it could not be articulated more clearly-the view of the Auditor-General that information was being withheld deliberately from the Auditor-General's Office during its inquiry-information which the Auditor-General's Office found by other means, by travelling overseas and examining the papers and material for itself, and which then, and only then, was responded to by the officers of the statutory corporation in question. If that is what is going on, if information comes out of a statutory corporation only when it has to be squeezed out or pulled out an inch at a time in a way which so obviously has been the case here, then it seems to me and to the Opposition that that is evidence of continuing serious maladministration and continuing serious fault in the Australian Dairy Corporation-serious fault which ought to be, at the very least, the subject of further investigation by the Senate Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Dairy Corporation and the whole Australian dairy industry issue resume their place on the list. This matter is right up there with tax evasion; it is right up there with the meat industry scandal in demonstrating the incompetence and incapacity of this Government to be the government of this nation. Like Mr Howard and Senator Durack on the tax issue, like Mr Nixon in relation to the meat industry issue, here again we have Mr Sinclair revealed as presiding over a hopelessly incompetent department and statutory authority. We have a Minister turning a blind eye to manifest maladministration in his department. We have here, as in these other matters before the Parliament today and in recent weeks, a Minister not asking the right questions at the right times. We have a Minister certainly not acknowledging that he ever received the right answers to those questions at the relevant times. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that this Government's administration has become a scandal in every direction that one looks-as far as the eye can see. In department after department, in authority after authority and in ministerial office after ministerial office there is a stench of scandal in the air. Minister after Minister, department after department and authority after authority have revealed standards of incompetence, negligence and corruption that would have been beyond anyone's wildest imagination as taking place within the Australian Government and bureaucracy before the Fraser Government came to power. This is the kind of legacy that the Fraser Government has laid down for the future government of this country. This is the burden that the Fraser Government will bear when it finally accounts for its stewardship to the Australian people at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that I will not be able to treat the chamber to such a collection of extravagant hyperbole as that to which we have just listened. I wish briefly to speak to the statement presented by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in relation to Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd. I had intended to provide some information on the business details but I think they have been covered adequately already by earlier speakers in this debate. Accordingly, I think it is better that I concentrate my remarks on what one might call the generalities of the issue. The amount of information that is becoming available even now continues to grow. When I read the information available I found that there was no new material which I would regard as throwing any more light on the whole matter. It generally seems to be some sort of a rehash and a refinement. There is certainly very little that I would say adds anything to the position as we knew it 12 months or 2 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would help at a time like this to go back to when Asia Dairy Industries was in its prime, one might say. I think we need to consider what the dairy industry in Australia was like in 1976. I remember that when I entered Parliament in the beginning of 1976 the first people who came to my office said that they had received a notification from their dairy company that they would be paid 38c a lb for that season. As honourable senators would be well aware, that was an absolute disaster to the industry at that time. Due to the European Economic Community and to Great Britain's changed buying policy, due to falling prices and a world oversupply, the industry in Australia was absolutely crumbling. The Australian Dairy Corporation and the industry generally strove to achieve the best possible results they could for the Australian dairy farmer. I think we have to remember that it was in the interests of the industry that arrangements were made to achieve this. Of late I have not heard that mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations carried out an investigation some 12 or 18 months ago but again did not get to the background of what went on behind the operations of the Asia Dairy Industries business. I think it would help if I covered a little of that history. We have to take into account that whole milk powder at that stage had a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade value of $350 a tonne, and any milk that was not sold at that price, attained about $120 a tonne. It is all very well to look at whether $350 a tonne was a realistic price or whether it could have been obtained, but that was the position. I do not support, and neither does the Government, any breaches of GATT. I think we all agree that close attention to our obligations under this treaty is very important. I appreciate that at all times the Australian Dairy Corporation acted in a manner that would maximise the export returns to Australian dairy farmers. I have never heard that questioned and I believe that it needs to be taken into account. The Corporation, the industry generally and the departmental officers were certainly doing everything possible for the industry. Between them they engineered the transition of the industry from being a price taking, totally export oriented industry to the new streamlined, efficient and fairly profitable industry that it is today. This was all achieved during this period we are talking about. The industry is sound today. Our thanks must go to those who got us through the latter part of the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd was established to provide a product outlet in an area of the world that appeared to have a growing export potential. The arrangements that were made were certainly novel so far as the Australian primary industry trade was concerned. They were more than novel; they were probably unique at that stage. Knowing what we do now, with the benefit of hindsight, we may not have considered that it was desirable to operate the same type of business in the same way. When the enterprise was set up it was thought that it was very good and no objections were received from anybody in or around industry or government. But now almost everybody has become an expert. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we also need to consider that business in the East is different from that in Western countries. I think that is fully understood by some people but certainly not by all. When we introduced extra nationalities into trading with the East, as in this case, the differences become more marked and, in turn, even less understood. The fact that the Australian interest was a Commonwealth instrumentality provided extra complications that could have been eliminated had that not been the case and, say, it had been a private industry but it was not. We have to accept the fact that it had to fit in with what one might call the normal trading practices of the area and act in common with its trading partners . Whether or not we agree-in many cases we certainly would not-people who are accustomed to dealing in the East, and particularly those in the private business sector, know only too well of the extraordinary type of negotiating that is necessary if they want to do business there. I again remind honourable senators of the alternatives: We sold the powder in that area either at $350 a tonne or at $120 a tonne. I think we should not lose sight of the amounts involved, a point that was never made by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. </PARA>
<PARA> This chamber has, over a period, heard a lot on this matter. Those of us who have had an interest in the dairy industry I think know all the parties by name very well. I think that we are in a position to know what is happening in this matter. We have heard considerable repetition about various matters. Honourable senators opposite have repeated their same old speeches and comments on many occasions without really throwing much light on the subject. This statement demonstrates both the Government's and the Minister's attention to the matter and their desire to have it completely clarified. The Government has taken steps to see that the points that are raised are clarified, and it will continue to do so. The reference to the files of correspondence and to the rulings and determinations of the Auditor-General are there for everyone to see. The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations has certainly to date done its job very thoroughly. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no objection, nor does the Government, to Senator Walsh's amendment. I think it is appropriate that this report, as tabled, together with the supporting documents, now go back to the Finance and Government Operations Committee for its further attention. I accept the information from the Auditor- General. I certainly have no interest in conducting witch-hunts or ministerial assassinations, which some people seem to delight in, nor will I attack those officers upon whom the industry in that crisis period depended so totally. The fact is that a recovery has been made in the industry and those Far Eastern markets are no longer the feature to the dairy industry that they were and which it was necessary for them to be in the middle and late 1970s. There is no doubt that there is evidence of irregularities by our standards of business in quite a few areas. That is quite clear. In spite of the innuendoes made by Senator Evans there is no evidence at this stage that any Australian personally received remuneration to which he was not completely entitled. I look forward to having the matter finally resolved in the interests of the dairy industry and our relationship with our trading partners. These two points seem to be regularly overlooked by honourable senators opposite. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do not worry, I will read it. I hope it is read widely within the community, because Senator Archer adopted the most inappropriate caricatures of the noble Australian businessman, with high standards of propriety, having to cope with Asian people, with their low standards of business propriety-having to make deals in order to secure international markets. I believe that that caricature of Australian businessmen in statutory authorities, as models of business propreity, does not stand up. The Australian community will not swallow it for one instant, given the mere revelation in the last few weeks of the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars have been ripped off the community by the same businessmen who Senator Archer asks us to believe are paragons of virtue compared with those who trade in Asian countries. It may well be that those who trade in Asian countries secure trading opportunities by means which are not normally used in Australian trading and business circles. It may be that, in order to secure such trade, the temptation is there to undertake certain arrangements. But our question is whether that temptation ought to be resisted, when to succumb to it involves a breach of the GATT arrangments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are not talking about interstate trade; we are talking about international trade and Australia's obligation under GATT to abide by certain international trading law arrangements. That is the whole question at issue. I do not intend to undertake yet another rehash of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. That has already been well dealt with by Senator Walsh and Senator Evans. It needs to be said also that neither the Opposition nor any honourable senator in this chamber wishes Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd ill. No one was more delighted than I was to read in the Melbourne Age of 28 July this year that Asia Dairy Industries appeared to be making a big comeback. The article details the company's writing of new joint venture and consultancy business and the fact that it expects to buy all its butter, oil and skim milk powder needs from Australia. Indeed, this was its early objective. It is good to see it being achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several important developments that we should note. It is important to introduce a more positive air into the debate. Asia Dairy Industries has entered into talks with Australian suppliers to ensure that its 1982-83 needs of about 17,000 tonnes of skim milk powder and about 5,000 tonnes of butter oil are purchased from Australian sources. That has not always been clearly possible, given the trading history of this company. More importantly, I understand that in China it has set up a $4m joint venture project to produce about 2,000 tonnes of goats' milk cheese a year. This sort of arrangement, this sort of vitality on the part of Asia Dairy Industries, is good news for Australia's dairy farmers, particularly those in Victoria and Tasmania. Therefore, it is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Senate has before it-my remarks will take only a few minutes because, as I have said, much of the ground has already been covered-are those documents that have been tabled today for its consideration. When one looks at those documents one finds the report of the Auditor-General of 27 April 1982. It is true that that report was made, as the Auditor-General has said, in the absence of full documentation. Because of the lapse of time he was unable to be absolutely firm about the intentions of some parties or to come to firm conclusions about a number of aspects of the matter. As I have said, I do not want to give the details of his conclusions. The point is that as at 27 April, when the report was presented to the Government, the Auditor-General, who was appointed by this Parliament to conduct an absolutely impartial, independent investigation of the functions of government and the proper discharge of duties- particularly with regard to funds of the magnitude of which we are discussing- found an absence of full documentation and, because of the lapse of time, difficulty in ascertaining the intention of parties. </PARA>
<PARA> That report was put down on 27 April 1982. It was responded to, in a rather thick document dated 12 July 1982 by the Australian Dairy Corporation. I have had, in the hour or so available to me to look through all of these documents, only the briefest opportunity to examine that response. Its general conclusion, in commenting on the report of the Auditor-General, can be summarised by saying that the Auditor-General was suffering from certain misapprehensions because of certain errors of fact and because inferences which he drew would not have been drawn had he taken advantage of a fuller opportunity to understand the true nature of the trading situations obtaining at the time. It is claimed that he could have found that fuller understanding by proper consultation with officers or former officers of the Australian Dairy Corporation. The sequence of events was: the Auditor-General came to certain conclusions but admitted deficiencies due to inadequate documentation and the lapse of time affecting memory. He was then chastised in the Australian Dairy Corporation's response and reprimanded for not making fuller use of opportunities, said to be available to him, to acquaint himself with the full picture. We now have available a further response by the Auditor-General in which, amongst other things, he states:</PARA>
<PARA>Many of the observations by the Corporation relate to details of little, if any, consequence, but we note that the report has generated a remarkable resurgence of memory on the part of officers of the Corporation who, during the audit investigation, found themselves unable to offer more than the barest modicum of information to the audit team. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is an extremely damning indictment of the officers of the Corporation. It is restrained, but in the sharpest language I have yet come across in my time as a senator, in the course of intra-bureaucratic warfare. Clearly, there is an allegation of a most definite cover-up and of non-co- operation on the part of Australian Dairy Corporation officers in relation to the inquiry of the Auditor-General, who has been established by the Parliament as an independent, impartial officer to carry out the investigations assigned to him. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point-and here I agree with Senator Archer-that a lot of documentation is before us this afternoon. I believe that the Senate is not in a position to resolve this continuing dispute between the Corporation and the Auditor-General. Very properly, therefore, the dispute should be referred to the Senate Committee which is personed by honourable senators who are, by their experience in the course of a former investigation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot remember whether there is a lady on the Committee, which is personed by honourable senators who have, as a result of a former investigation, experience and understanding of the background which would enable them to pursue this matter further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another document which gives, I believe, cause for some concern is that from the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, Mr O'Donovan, dated 22 June 1982. Having reviewed the Auditor-General's report, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> If funds belonging to a company operating in Australia were distributed in this country to shareholders of the company in circumstances corresponding to those in which the proceeds of the $25 rebate were apparently distributed, either in Singapore or the Philippines, to the shareholders of Hompi, it is likely that offences in at least two areas would have been committed:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a defrauding of the company by the shareholders; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a failure by the Directors of the company to act honestly and to use reasonable diligence in the affairs of the company. </PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, the Crown Solicitor is not saying that nothing illegal was done; he is saying that there was a defrauding of the company by the shareholders and there was a failure by the directors of the company to act honestly and to use reasonable diligence in the affairs of the company. This needs to be clearly understood. That charge is being laid by the Crown Solicitor but I understand him to be saying that because the events relating to those fraudulent activities, to those dereliction of duty activities, took place outside Australia there is no jurisdiction within the Australian legal system to bring these matters to a legal conclusion in our courts. In other words, there is illegality but it is not justiciable. That is a very important point to make and it should not be thought for one moment that the Crown Solicitor has given a clean bill of conduct to the directors of the company concerned. As I say, it is merely that the matters are not justiciable in our courts. The fact that they are not justiciable in our courts should not prevent a Senate standing committee from pursuing the matter in its own way. We therefore have revealed a situation whereby there is no laying to rest of the matters which have already been the subject of report by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. The Senate is still entitled to be uneasy, the Parliament is entitled to be uneasy and certainly the general public is entitled to be uneasy.</PARA>
<PARA> There is yet another matter to be considered. It concerns the allegation that the Australian Government has intervened in a way which prevents the sale of an Australian interest in a dairy company in Indonesia for some $10m and, instead, in compliance with the wishes of the Indonesian Government, is trying to negotiate or will go along with a deal to sell to another person in Indonesia that same interest for $4.5m. The inquiry which the Senate Committee wants to undertake has been deferred because of legal action pending in Australian and Indonesian courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The general point I am making is that the subject matter of these papers is apt for further consideration and investigation by our Senate Committee. I believe it will help to maintain that surveillance which is so obviously necessary on the part of the Parliament, given the inadequacies of administration and surveillance revealed at both the departmental and ministerial levels. For that reason, I support the amendment moved by Senator Walsh. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to the statement made in the other place and presented here by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in relation to a number of papers, but I respond basically to the initial report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations on the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Asian subsidiaries. I pick up one point mentioned by Senator Tate, that the Parliament and probably the people of Australia will still feel uneasy even following the tabling of these documents. I believe that that is correct. Having read all of this documentation the final feeling is one of unease. However, I do not think it is permissible to leap from that to an indictment of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have operating here an extremely complex situation, part of which involves a commercial operation, part of which involves a corporation and only a small part of which involves the Department of Primary Industry. The documentation and the investigations carried out by a number of Government bodies, such as the Auditor -General's Office, would seem to have exhausted all possible leads in trying to track down whether or not there have been any illegal activities on the part of Australians in the employ of the Government, its corporations or its commercial operations. They do not seem to have been able to find that such was the case. It is beyond doubt that there were breaches of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Although all of the documentation seems to take a fairly soft line on that, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that there were breaches of GATT. To that extent the Government is involved because under its international treaties it has a responsibility to other governments to maintain surveillance over the operations of government or semi-government organisations to make sure that they do follow that agreement. However, I do not believe that we have evidence that once the Government was able to ascertain that there had been breaches it did not take the appropriate action.</PARA>
<PARA> One point I would like to take up-it is a point which the Corporation in its response to the Auditor-General's report did not see fit to query and therefore I presume that it accepts it in full-concerns items found on pages 15, 16 and 17 of the Auditor-General's report. They refer to the $25 rebate and the 2 per cent commissions. In the last paragraph on page 15 appears a statement that was not referred to in the Minister's statement, an extraordinary statement to appear in an Auditor-General's report. It is contrary to the report prepared by the ADC and the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd management dated 2 October 1981 and tabled in the House of Representatives on 29 October 1981, that the $25 per tonne rebate did not replace the 2 per cent commission. In other words, the management of the ADC was prepared to have tabled in the Parliament a document that presumably it knew at the time-certainly it was easily ascertainable by the Attorney-General and not disputed by the ADC-said that the $25 rebate did not replace the 2 per cent commission. The fact of the matter is that while this particular document-an incorrect document-was tabled in the Parliament, at that time the Government did take and had in train sufficient action to prevent any claim being made of a substantive kind against an activity by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I pursue a second point, on page 17, in relation to the number of errors discovered in the shipping records and the approvals for pricing and concessional adjustments made particularly in relation to skim milk. The fact that these operations could have occurred-a $25 per tonne rebate being paid twice and a 2 per cent commission being paid as well as the rebate; a 2 per cent commission being calculated incorrectly on the credit note; interest credit being given without apparent justification; approval for the free on board reduction credit not being located, an incorrect calculation of an interest rebate and insurance and shipping credits being made without justification, all of which total $246,000-suggests that though there may not have been and does not seem to have been, at least in the judgment of the Solicitor-General, prosecutable activity, there certainly does seem to have been gross negligence and maladministration within those various corporations. This is not new and had been suggested in the Senate Committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that there is still sufficient within this whole affair to suggest that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations should continue its investigations and not accede to the Minister's request at the end of his statement which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me say that I believe we are approaching an end of a prolonged period of searching examinations of the operations of ADC and ADI. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that searching examination of the operations should not come to an end, not only because in this matter there is still a range of unanswered questions but also because the Government, presumably, having found such gross administration occurring, would not want at any stage to give up a close scrutiny of the operations of such a corporation until it is satisfied, over a period, that the corporation has in train sufficient safeguards so as to prevent any further occurrence. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely, in view of the vast amount of time, energy and effort that the Government, the Senate, the Auditor-General and other government bodies have spent on this matter alone-for which I would imagine that the cost would probably exceed the original amount in question-the only justification for such an enormous expenditure of effort must be that this will not occur in future. The justification does not lie in scoring political points one way or another, but only in that future years the operation of the Corporation, in all its dealings, will accord with the treaties signed by the Government and its international obligations and will accord with all the practices of accounting procedures which are required by the Commonwealth. It is only then, after the passing of a number of years, that the Australian Democrats would believe that one could then say: 'We do not need now a continuing searching examination of the operations of the ADC and can allow it to revert to the normal surveillance that the Government has over any corporations established under Acts of this Parliament or any independent commercial operations'. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe at this stage that there would be sufficient bona fides on the part of the Corporation to allow it to escape a most rigorous and continuing searching examination of all of its reports, accounts and operations. The type of work done by the Asia Dairy Corporation, an incorporated body arising out of the Australian Dairy Corporation, would also need continual surveillance, and we would hope that the work to which Senator Tate alluded is being done in the way that we believe all government operations should be conducted. Whether or not they succeeded in breaking the law only in other countries is beside the point. No corporations of this Government, of this country, should in any way in their overseas dealings breach any of the laws of overseas countries. The standard of propriety that we require of all companies operating in Australia we should also require of all companies that have government connections, at least in their overseas dealings. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that continuing surveillance by the Senate Standing Committee is useful. It is an operation which it has already in train. It is at present only in suspension. I believe-seemingly the Government has also welcomed this-that that surveillance should continue. The work that the Government has done, certainly from my reading of all these documents, would not suggest that in this matter the Government has been tardy but that it has on every occasion acted as rapidly as one could expect. Because of that, there is no hint, in this matter at least, of ministerial impropriety or lack of ministerial responsibility. If, in relation to other issues, which I am sure we shall be discussing shortly in this chamber, the Minister concerned had not been as rapid in his movements and as conscientious in his undertakings, I believe that the types of reports which have come down in the other place today would not have been able to be written. We would therefore support the Labor Party amendment to allow continuing surveillance of the operations of the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Asian subsidiaries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the amendment moved by Senator Walsh is rather superfluous. Obviously Senator Walsh has been pretty busy and has not been attending the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for the last week or so. I have here a Press release that was issued by the Chairman of that Committee. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry, the Hon. P. J. Nixon, today made a comprehensive and most interesting response, on behalf of the Government, to the matters raised in the Committee's report on the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Asian subsidiaries. </PARA>
<PARA>The next sentence is most important:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee will consider the matters raised in the Minister's response and the other documents tabled and report to the Senate in due course. </PARA>
<PARA>The chamber should know that it was the Committee's intention in any case to look into all the relevant documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Like my colleague Senator Archer, I shall not go over all the ground that has been covered by previous speakers. I should like to bring out just three major points. I bring these out because I think that they help to set the stage for what has happened, and I mention them in no way excusing what has happened. There have been breaches. I do not think that the situation ever reached the stage of what has been indicated-corruption, scandal and the rest-but there have been breaches which should not have happened. However, looking at the stage at that time may help us to understand the situation better. </PARA>
<PARA> The dairy industry has never been a wealthy industry. I speak on that from personal experience. It has almost been the peasant farmer class of Australian rural industries, until recent times when the situation has not been too bad. I took out the figures very quickly. At that stage, in 1973-74, we had a stockpile of about 98,000 tonnes of dried skim milk powder. We were not able to get rid of it. We had too many dairy farmers in the industry. In Queensland alone, I think, from that time until just recent times, we literally reconstructed about 22,000 farmers out of the industry-in other words, we reduced it from about 25,000 farmers to about 2,000 to 3,000 farmers today. So as an industry, it was not in a very healthy state. It had a stockpile of skim milk powder that it could not get rid of. That must be pointed out as background to the situation in which the Australian Dairy Corporation found itself. </PARA>
<PARA> We then had a chance of markets in South East Asia, and therein lay the problems. We have our own standards of dealing in Australia, but we must find it well nigh impossible to impose those standards when dealing with other countries which have different standards-and no more so than when dealing with countries in South East Asia. They have different standards. There is no doubt about that. The Australian Dairy Corporation had the problem of a stockpile of dried milk to sell, it had possible markets, and it had conflicting methods of dealing. So it went into South East Asia and tried not only to meet the market but to meet the market requirements that exist in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been mentioned that money has been siphoned off. Talking with people, as I have in times past, I discovered that it is generally accepted that if one does not have an agent in South East Asia one does not have much chance of doing too many deals. Therefore, one has agents and agents' fees. Usually the agents have an overseas bank account, whether it be in Singapore, Switzerland or wherever. I am not condoning this practice. I am just saying that it is a way of life when dealing with those countries. If Australian industry wants to deal with them it has to meet those requirements. It is relatively easy for private enterprise to do that. Unfortunately, in this case we are dealing with a statutory corporation of this Government. Here is the dilemma: How are such statutory authorities to deal with and look after the people whom they represent and meet the market situation and at the same time meet all the requirements that are laid down by the Government and the requirements of the Auditor-General ? It is now history that they were not able to do that successfully. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that when the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations looks at these documents it will also address itself to this problem: How can bodies, such as the Dairy Corporation, make deals, trade successfully and market Australian products in South East Asian countries, or for that matter , any other country which has ethics different from those which exist in Australia, and at the same time meet the requirements as laid down by the Government and as supervised by the Auditor-General? I believe that is the dilemma of the situation. That is something which has to be addressed rather quickly so that we can meet these markets and look after our suppliers. I hope that the Senate Standing Committee addresses itself to that problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of my duties in the Senate as Deputy President and Chairman of Committees the opportunity does not present itself to me as often as I would like to take part in debates in the Senate. Because I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations which inquired into the Australian Dairy Corporation and Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd and because I was a signatory to the Committee's report I feel that I have an obligation to the members of the Committee and, more importantly, an obligation to my party to express one or two comments on the response of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) to that report. Incidentally, the report was tabled in the Senate as long ago as 17 September 1981, which is over 12 months ago. There can be no question from the Minister's response which was brought down in the House of Representatives last week and which was repeated in the Senate this afternoon that the Government regards the Senate Standing Committee's report as being a most excellent one. That is shown by the degree of attention that has had to be given to it by the Executive and the Department of Primary Industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having made that comment, let me say that the Parliament has to reassert its supremacy over the Executive and the bureaucracy. I believe the way in which the Senate and, with more particularity, the Senate Standing Committee have been treated by the Government and the bureaucracy has been rather tardy to say the least. I will give one or two instances of that from the documents which have been tabled. The Government seems to have waffled around believing in the old adage that time heals all wounds. The Government hopes that that adage will continue to apply in circumstances of this nature. It is important to remember the rule brought in by this Government itself, probably at the request or instigation of back benchers of the Government parties who were expressing concern at the lackadaisical way in which the Government responded to Senate committee reports. I think it was in 1976 or 1977-early in the life of this Government-that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in another place and the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Withers, brought down a report in response to general Senate committee reports saying that in future the Government would respond to a Senate committee report within six months of the report having been presented to the Parliament and that, if the six months period expired during a parliamentary recess, the Government would bring down a report on the very first day of the next sessional sitting. I remind the Senate that this report was tabled on 17 September 1981. Had the Government lived up to its word, it would have reported to the Senate on 17 March 1982. It is now 21 September 1982, some eight or nine months after the time that the Government should have acted according to the condition the Government imposed on itself. Nonetheless, the Government left many of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee up in the air. </PARA>
<PARA> This Parliament has to reassert its supremacy over the Executive and the bureaucracy. The Parliament has to insist that much more efficient and complete response comes from the government of the day to committee reports. I remind the Senate that when this report was first presented members of the Executive, members of the Government, bagged its contents. For instance, I remember the present Vice-President of the Executive Council (Sir James Killen) saying in another place that because all members of the Senate Standing Committee were not present at all sittings of the Committee no one could regard the Committee's report with all seriousness. I pointed out that as there is a quorum for the Senate and the House of Representatives so too there is a quorum for Senate standing committees. In response to that matter, when the debate on the report took place in this chamber on 23 September 1981, as recorded at page 915 of the Senate Hansard, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair)-the former Minister for Primary Industry-instead of accepting the report as a constructive criticism of what has become a sleeping system about which no one seems to care has, as it were, shot from the hip. Ministers have been tolerating the lack of accountability to the Australian public, through the Australian Parliament, by departments and statutory corporations for far too long. That, in short, is the gravamen of the Committee's report and the recommendations contained in it. I suggest that that situation has been occurring because some Ministers have been in office too long . They operate under the 'born to rule' syndrome. They have become far removed from their base, namely their constituencies and the parliamentary system. They act as though they are bricks which are mortared into the wall of bureaucracy. Departments seem to regard their Ministers as the Godfather. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now 12 months later, in all fairness to this Parliament and to the Senate, that I must repeat those words. We must remember that there is a representative of the Department of Primary Industry on the Board of the Australian Dairy Corporation. He is there for the purpose of representing the Australian Government. He has been on that Board for a long time. It was his responsibility to report to the the Australian Government. But it is now 12 months after the Committee's report was tabled in the Parliament and the Government is now saying that it is to give further consideration to certain aspects. I refer the Senate to page 189, paragraph 11.9 of the Committee's report, where it said:</PARA>
<PARA>When the ADC was created on 1 July 1975, a DPI officer was appointed to the ADC Board under Section 5 (1) (e) of the Dairy Produce Act 1924 to 'represent the Australian Government'. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat those words 'to represent the Australian Government'. The Committee continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The first appointment was Mr J. F. O'Bryan who was replaced in August 1979 by the current DPI member, Mr A. E. Wallace. </PARA>
<PARA>In reaching its conclusions in that section of the report, at page 211 the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of examining the role of the DPI in relation to the ADPB-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Australian Dairy Produce Board-</PARA>
<PARA>and, more particularly, the ADC, the Committee has come to two basic conclusions . </PARA>
<PARA> First, we consider that the DPI representatives on the ADC Board have not adequately fulfilled the functions which they themselves have said are required of them and which are quoted in paragraph 11.9. For example, the DPI representatives have not ensured that Government policies have been observed, particularly in relation to the GATT breach, and have not reported adequately on the Asian subsidiaries. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we believe that the performance of the functions outlined in paragraph 11.9 places DPI officers, as members of the Executive Government, in continual conflict with their role as members of the Board of a statutory authority, the ADC. The separate and distinct duties of a member of a Government department and an independent authority have been constantly blurred. We therefore consider that the following steps are necessary to redefine and clarify the relationship between the DPI and the ADC-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an examination of the practice of the selection of a DPI officer to be a full member of the ADC Board</PARA>
<PARA>Reference is then made to chapter 13 of the report for more detail-</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the improvement of the system of communicating Government policy to the ADC . </PARA>
<PARA>On those two matters which are of extreme importance to the effectiveness of the Government's consideration of the Committee's response, what did the Minister say on Thursday, 12 months after the report was tabled? He said, on the question of general guidelines for statutory authorities:</PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members know, the Senate Committee's report raises many general issues of principle such as ministerial control of statutory authorities, including powers of direction; the development of suitable guidelines for the establishment, operation and accountability of statutory authorities and subsidiary companies; the duties and responsibilities of members of such authorities and companies; and reporting requirements. I said in my earlier statement that these general issues of principle were under consideration by an interdepartmental committee and I thought that the Government should be in a position to comment on them by the time I again reported to the Parliament. This task, however, has not yet been completed. When it is a statement will be made by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister first made his comments on that matter in October of last year when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I thought that the Government should be in a position to comment on them by the time I again reported to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now 11 months since the Minister first made his response and on those two important matters, Government representation or no Government respresentation and departmental involvement with a statutory authority, we are still awaiting the Government's determination and a statement from the Government on that matter. At page 1581 of the House of Representatives Hansard of last Thursday, 16 September 1981, the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General's report disclosed deficiencies in the management and operations of ADI and its dealings with the ADC. The ADC established a special management committee to examine all aspects of the Auditor-General's report dealing with managerial and accounting practices of ADI. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention this to show how tardy the Government and the bureaucracy have been in the consideration of these matters. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA>When the ADC reported to me on 26 October 1979 I--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Minister, nearly three years ago--</PARA>
<PARA>concluded that action was immediately required to overcome deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA>That was three years ago and in the House of Representatives only last Thursday he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In my statement of 29 October 1981 I provided detailed information on the action that had been taken. </PARA>
<PARA>Even though he wanted immediate action in October 1979, he continued:</PARA>
<PARA>On some matters action was incomplete at that time and I have now indicated what further work has been done on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Frankly it is not good enough. The Government is not fair dinkum. The bureaucracy is too slow and incompetent, probably because of the staff ceilings imposed on the Public Service by the Government. The Public Service is far too slow and it has to be made able and competent to adjust itself to meet the requirements of the Parliament. Is it any wonder, when we are getting reports like the report on the Australian Dairy Corporation, the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry, the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, that the Prime Minister has to announce today that there has to be a serious review of the whole Public Service structure in this country?</PARA>
<PARA> Having cursorily read the Minister's reponse I say that there are still many questions left up in the air and many matters awaiting resolution by the Government and certainly determination by the Parliament. I have already mentioned the lack of guidelines being laid down by the Government for statutory authorities. I have already mentioned the concern about the general overall question of Government representation on these statutory authorities. There is also the general overall question of ministerial responsibility. The question of where the Department stands in relation not only to this statutory authority but also to others appears to remain unanswered. If one reads the general conclusions that the Government has reached, one must come to the conclusion that basically the Senate Committee's recommendations have been accepted, or should I say understood, but the Government of the day does not know how to respond effectively to or to implement the recommendations of the Committee without necessarily impaling a Minister on a stake. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great problem-it is highlighted by the Government's response-in the present committee system in that departmental officers come before a Senate committee; they give evidence to that committee; the committee presents its report to the Parliament; the report of the committee goes back to the Minister; the Minister sends it on to the Department and, generally speaking, the very departmental officers who have given evidence to that Senate committee consider and study the report of the committee and then are called upon to give advice to the Minister. I believe it is apt for the Senate Standing Committee to study closely the Minister's reply and the documents attached to the Minister's reply. I believe that, in the interests of parliamentary democracy and in the interests of the effectiveness of the Senate committee system, the amendment that has been moved by Senator Walsh should be supported. I therefore have pleasure in supporting the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Walsh. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the statement put down earlier this afternoon by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and the amendment moved by my colleague, Senator Walsh, I say at the outset that anything that is said from this side of the House is not intended to discredit the dairy industry, as has been implied by Government senators. What we are about is to highlight the lack of intelligence and integrity of the two Ministers involved-in fact, the whole Government. We were chided by Senator Collard. He said that he alone knew all of the problems of the dairy industry and that he had had some experience in it. Honourable senators on this side too have had personal experience with the dairy industry. My colleague, Senator Primmer, who is from Victoria, was a dairy farmer before he became a member of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have never criticised the industry as such. When we were in government between 1972 and 1975 we had a very capable Minister for Primary Industry, the then Senator Ken Wriedt. I am sure that everyone in the industry would agree that Senator Wriedt set about trying to repair all the damage that had been done to the dairy industry over 23 years of Liberal-Country Party government. It was under our jurisdiction that an attempt was made to rationalise the dairy industry and to do something to assist the people engaged in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition had a sorry record in government before 1972 and it has had an even sorrier record since it came to office in 1975. If that were not so we would not have had to go through the trauma of all the inquiries which have been conducted. We would not have had to read the very scathing remarks that have been made about the Ministers concerned by the Auditor-General in his reports and to some extent the scathing remarks that have been made in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations about the activities of Ministers. Whilst we hear honourable senators on the other side trying to sweep the whole issue under the carpet and not deal with the real issue which is before us today, I remind the Senate of a speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 12 March 1978 in his electoral talk. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> One of my Government's first promises when we were elected just over two years ago was to restore the integrity and honesty in government. </PARA>
<PARA>How hollow were those words in the light of what we have witnessed in the last few weeks. Where is the integrity and honesty of this Government now? Even last weekend the very Minister who is under challenge in this statement was getting all the protection he could get from the Prime Minister, just because he is a member of the National Country Party. I have yet to see the Prime Minister give the same sort of protection to Ministers of his own party. I recall what happened to Senator Withers, Mr Moore and Mr MacKellar. Were they given the protection that these 'Nats' are getting? Of course they were not. That is the question which exercises the minds of people in the electorate. Why does the Prime Minister kowtow to the Country Party? What pressure does it use on him to gain his support, in defiance of what members of his own party say, when he ought to take remedial steps? Is the Government so bereft of talent that it cannot do without these people, that these people have to be in government?</PARA>
<PARA> I will say something about the Country Party's association with people in the community, one of whom is now behind bars in Long Bay. He was a great friend of the Country Party and was appointed to the bicentennial celebration board to look after the 1988 celebrations. He is now languishing in Long Bay. However, the Prime Minister, in the second paragraph of his statement, went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Without integrity, without the appearance and reality of integrity no government can hope to have the confidence of the people, or the trust of the people. </PARA>
<PARA>What has happened in the last 12 or 18 months has come home to roost because the Government does not have the confidence or the trust of the people. The sooner we have an election the sooner the Government will realise that. The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We were determined to restore Australians' faith in their national government- and in the process of government. From the beginning, the government desired to reestablish the absolute propriety and unquestioned integrity that were a hallmark of the Menzies years in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has to go back to the Menzies years to find some integrity. When we think about our involvement in Vietnam and the papers tabled in the Parliament by an ex-Liberal Prime Minister, Mr McMahon, some of us would doubt even that statement. They blew the integrity of Menzies out through the roof. He misled the Parliament by saying that he had been invited by the United States of America to participate in Vietnam. Mr McMahon blew his cover when he proved that Menzies had written to the United States President asking that he write to him and request that Australia send troops to Vietnam. Where is the integrity of the Liberal Party? We can go back through history. It has always been able to shove things under the carpet when the pressure comes on. It is impossible for the Government to shove under the carpet and cover up what is before the Parliament and the people of Australia now because these reports cannot be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> We should look back to the Government's behaviour when it was in opposition and to what it accused the Whitlam Labor Government of. I have a whole sheaf of extracts from Hansard of statements made by the present Leader of the Government in this chamber (Senator Sir John Carrick) when he was in opposition. He castigated the Labor Government, accused it of not being honest and of not consisting of people who had integrity. I quote a few of those remarks. I refer to page 1315 of Senate Hansard of 13 May 1975, when the present Government was in opposition and moved a censure motion against Senator Willessee, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is a pity that the Government does not apply these principles today. Senator Carrick stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In any other parliament of the Westminster system a Minister who had knowingly misled the parliament would have taken the appropriate action without the need for censure by the parliament. He would have resigned because, quite clearly, knowingly to mislead a parliament and a people is the gravest possible breach of the Westminster principle, and this Minister stands convicted of that. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister who is under question in the statement today tendered his resignation over the weekend. What is the outcome? Today the Prime Minister refused to accept it. That is the complete opposite of what Senator Carrick said in Parliament on 13 May 1975. The Government changes its clothes to suit the purpose. It is not consistent. On 22 October 1975 Senator Carrick, speaking on the Appropriation Bills, said:</PARA>
<PARA>One thing that is absolutely clear is that the Prime Minister of Australia has consistently over the months misled the people of Australia and has been guilty of the most reprehensible behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote those words to him because that is the very thing that is happening at the present time with this Government, in particular the Prime Minister and the two Ministers involved in this inquiry. We could go further, as we will in debates later in this Parliament, and talk about the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). However, on 30 October 1975 Senator Carrick went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Day by day more and more information comes out, not only about the most massive economic chaos and mismanagement that anybody has seen in Australia since Federation but also about dishonesty, deception and even corruption in government. This Government admits to no principles at all. It admits to no precedents in the way that it governs. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Carrick said about the Whitlam Government. It is very appropriate to use that quote against the Fraser Government and the Ministers whom it consistently tries to protect. As my colleague Senator McClelland, mentioned a while ago, the wire service today states:</PARA>
<PARA> Prime Minister Mr Malcolm Fraser today foreshadowed a major review of the Public Service in the wake of the Woodward and Costigan Royal Commission reports . </PARA>
<PARA>No doubt those comments would also apply to the reports that have come before this Parliament on Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd. It is quite obvious that the Government is running scared, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) used to say about the Labor Party. Who is running scared today? It is the Fraser Liberal-National Country Party Government. It has quite a few of its Ministers under challenge. I dare say that, as has been reported in some newspapers, the Government will endeavour to tough it out and hope that the matter can be swept under the carpet. However, I assure honourable senators that that is not going to happen. I thought that my colleague the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Kerin, when speaking to the statement in the other place last Thursday, used a very appropriate quotation. He said: 'The GATT is out of the bag'. Of course what he meant was that the cat was out of the bag. It is out of the bag all right, due to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. It is out of the bag, due also to the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry, which was tabled today in another place and which will be tabled here later. In fact, the Government has many skeletons in the cupboard. Despite what the three Government speakers said when they were trying to distance themselves from the operations of their ministerial colleagues, they were unsuccessful. When people read Hansard and see the waffle they went on with, which was quite divorced from the problems with which we are now faced, they will realise that what they were attempting was a very weak excuse for Mr Nixon and his predecessor, Mr Sinclair.</PARA>
<PARA> Last Thursday my colleague in the other place also drew attention to several facts. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The previous Minister--</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about Mr Sinclair--</PARA>
<PARA>would not give evidence to the Senate Committee, he would not answer questions and he would not table his records. The Government at that time would not table the Auditor-General's report. It was duck-shoving, pigeon-holing and delaying a police report. That report still has not seen the light of day. We still do not know what was in that. That is why the allegations will continue about whether the situation was covered up by people responsible in this Government or by others. That has been the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>I join my colleague, Mr Kerin, in asking that that police report be made available. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has a long history of claiming that interdepartmental reports and consultants reports-and consultants reports are paid for by the taxpayer-are confidential. I complain continually about that in this chamber and at Estimates Committee hearings. We have the Marks report and another consultant's report which was carried out at Mr Marks's recommendation at the cost of about $50,000. Most of these consultants reports are carried out at a cost to the taxpayer and yet it is claimed that they are confidential and the Parliament cannot have a look at them. Last week, during the hearing of Estimates Committee C, I asked the Auditor-General what was the cost to the Auditor-General's Department of the Asia Dairy Industries inquiry. The answer I received is dated 14 September. it is signed by Mr K. F. Brigden, Auditor-General, and states:</PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry into Asia Dairy Industries has cost the Office $40,016 as at 9 September 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what this inquiry has cost the taxpayer, through the Auditor-General's Office. But what has it really cost the taxpayer? If we could get the figures that show the total amount it would be an enormous amount of money. That cost has been brought about purely because of the laxity of both the Ministers in question, Mr Sinclair and Mr Nixon, in not carrying out the job they are paid to do, in not being vigilant enough as Ministers. I join my colleagues in saying that they should not be Ministers. This Government, of course, has gone through so many people in the ministerial ranks that it has very few left to pick from. No wonder people outside are saying that it is time we had an election and got some new blood to run the country. What we are saying is not fictitious. The proof is there in the documents which are tabled in the Parliament relating to inquiries that have been held right along the line. We can go to the Costigan report, the report with which we are dealing, and many others. Every one of them , somewhere along the line, points to the mismanagement of the country's affairs by this Liberal-National Country Party Government. People will now ask--</PARA>

<PARA> Senator Scott, when he was speaking today, said that in the area which we are discussing a great deal of investigation has been necessary. Of course we know it has, and it has been at great cost. I say to Senator Scott that he would know that had his own party colleagues, namely, Mr Sinclair and Mr Nixon, as the responsible Ministers, acted in a more vigilant manner, this whole sorry saga may not have occurred. If these Ministers had been doing their job we might not be in the position we are in today, debating the statement made by the Minister, and the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations may not have had to waste a lot of its time. But as it turned out, the Committee was not wasting its time because a lot of useful information has come to light. Indeed, if it had not been for the persistence of Senator Walsh in raising this matter after certain documents came into his possession, many of the matters which have been examined by the Auditor-General, at the cost of $40,000 which I have mentioned, and by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, would not have seen the light of day. Senator Walsh came in for some very unkind criticism from the Government when he first raised this issue. It is to his credit that the criticism did not deter him but in fact made him more determined to ensure that the issue was not swept under the carpet as the Prime Minister and his two Ministers who were involved would have liked it to be, and no doubt as the three Government members who have spoken on this matter today would have liked it to be. But that is not to be. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Douglas McClelland quoted a couple of paragraphs of the statement put down by the Minister. I also will quote from the statement. Mr Nixon said:</PARA>
<PARA> I said in my earlier statement that these general issues of principle were under consideration by an inter-departmental Committee, and I thought that the Government should be in a position to comment on them by the time I again reported to the Parliament. This task, however, has not been completed. When it is, a statement will be made by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>My colleague Senator Douglas McClelland dealt at some length with the matter of these reports being tabled in the Parliament. I think it goes without saying that under the policy of this Government no one on this side of the House, anyway, will see the interdepartmental report. Some statement will be made about it and what arises out of it but we will not see it. At page 14 of the document, Mr Nixon said:</PARA>
<PARA> The borrowing and investment guidelines for ADI will be finalised when the Government has decided on the guidelines to apply to Statutory Authorities generally. </PARA>
<PARA>How long will we have to wait until those guidelines are made public? If it is like some of the other things we are waiting for, it will be for ever and a day. We will never see them. But of course it is not only the members of the Opposition who are making criticisims against this Government for its action. If we look at a letter signed by the First Assistant Auditor-General, Mr Monaghan, addressed to Mr Enfield, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and dated 10 August 1982, we see that in the fourth paragraph of that letter Mr Monaghan said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is only one other comment that we would make. Many of the observations by the Corporation relate to details of little, if any consequence, but we note that the report has generated a remarkable resurgence of memory on the part of officers of the Corporation who, during the audit investigation, found themselves unable to offer more than the barest modicum of information to the audit team. </PARA>
<PARA>As the inquiry proceeded, their memory came back, and they were able to say certain things. Had the Ministers been vigilant when this matter was first raised many years ago, they would have put a fine tooth comb through the Department and found out what was going on. But they did not see fit to do that. I guess they regret it today, and they will regret it even more as the months go by. But that is what they should have done because no matter what happens in a department, Ministers should not blame their departmental officers. That is what is happening with this Government now. It is under challenge. I think it was only this morning or perhaps last night that I saw on a television show that Mr Gee has come under some criticism because of the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry which has been brought down. No doubt many other departmental officers are being blamed and being made the scapegoats by this Government because of the lack of vigilance by Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers cannot, just the same as back bench members of parliament cannot-and back benchers are only small fish in the pond-blame their staff. If one of our staff gives misleading information to a constituent, quite innocently and not deliberately, it is the member of parliament who must bear the brunt of it. We are responsible for our staff and Ministers should be responsible for anything that goes on in their departments and not try to lay the blame on departmental officers. We all know that departmental officers are there to serve the government of the day. I would say that on most occasions none of those officers would set out deliberately to mislead a Minister. But if the Minister is lackadaisical and not attending to his work as he should be, he should not be in the ministry. But at no time should he be prepared, when he is in trouble, as these Ministers are, to blame his departmental officers. We have seen not only Mr Nixon but also the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), now that they are under severe questioning, trying to lay the blame on their departmental heads or people who work in the department. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not good enough. That will not happen when we get back into government and that will occur before very long. Our Ministers will see that departments are run the way they ought to be. If anything goes wrong our Ministers can expect to get the chop, as they did when we were in government between 1972 and 1975. That is what this Government ought to be doing. Instead of allowing Ministers to level all the criticism for their failings at their departmental officers, the Cabinet, under the Prime Minister, should be sacking them. Of course, this sort of behaviour cannot happen under Australian Labor Party rules because all members of our Ministry are elected by all members of the parliamentary Labor Party. That does not happen under this Government. Every Minister owes his position in the Ministry to the favouritism of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) because Ministers are chosen by him. Back bench members of the Government have no opportunity to make any input. Once they elect their leader the leader then selects the people who are going to offer him the least line of resistance. As I said, fortunately that does not happen in the Labor Party. Labor Ministers would be on their mettle at all times. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most damning indictments of a Minister is contained in an article written in Canberra by Michelle Grattan and Simon Balderstone which appears in today's Melbourne Age. I will not quote all of the article. However, I think some of the failings of the Minister who is under challenge ought to be pointed out. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Late in 1979, Mr Nixon was landed with another issue, the festering sore of the Asia Dairy Industries affair. The matter had been raised under the Ministership of Mr Nixon's predecessor, Mr Sinclair, but an Auditor-General's report outlining malpractice and financial misconduct within ADI-a wholly owned subsidiary of the Australian Dairy Corporation-was submitted to him shortly after he took over the Primary Industry portfolio in September 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Nixon has had over three years to look at this and straighten out problems which have occurred. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Nixon continually refused to table the report in Parliament, claiming such action was not appropriate at the time, but constant leaking of parts of the report kept the issue bubbling. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, I think we again can give credit to Senator Walsh who had certain information in his possession and was prepared to use it. As I said in my opening remarks, if he had not been so vigilant and persistent this matter would never have seen the light of day. We give great credit to Senator Walsh for that . The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It boiled over in September last year, when the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations brought down a report on the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Asian subsidiaries. </PARA>
<PARA>The article gives details. I will not take up any more time of the Senate because the article is contained in today's Melbourne Age. My colleagues have detailed the whole sorry mess in which this Government has found itself. I think the only way left open to us is to support the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Walsh and to let the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations have another look at the whole matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to give a final illustration of how this Government tries to cover up what it does. I mentioned earlier in my remarks that Mr Harry M. Miller has many friends in the Government, particularly in the National Country Party. We have debated many times in this Parliament the many things Mr Harry M. Miller has done at the taxpayers' expense. He now finds himself behind the heavy doors of Long Bay gaol. But that is not sufficient for this Government. Three daily papers-I think the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian, and the Melbourne Age of 6 July this year-reported that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) paid a visit to Long Bay to see Mr Harry M. Miller. According to reports, when the Deputy Prime Minister was asked about the meeting he said that the visit was arranged by Miller's wife, Wendy. Mr Anthony was quoted in the Age as saying: 'I was hoping no one would know about it'. So that is the way in which this Government acts. The Government was hoping that no one would know about the problems in respect of Asia Dairy Industries and it was hoping that no one would know about the meat scandal-and we have to give another Labor member, Senator Primmer, full credit for revealing that. Senator Primmer too was ridiculed in this Parliament when he first raised this matter in 1978. I say to the Government that we on this side of the Senate are vigilant in Opposition. We will pursue these matters to see that justice is done and when we are in government we will ensure that our Ministers oversee their departments in the way that Ministers should as servants of the electors. I support the amendment moved by Senator Walsh. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is properly exercising a review of the various reports that have been available to us in recent times about the activities of the Department of Primary Industry and one of its statutory authorities, the Australian Dairy Corporation. I think I should remind the Senate that this is the fifth scandal to hit the Government in a Budget session that is now in its sixth week. I refer, of course, to the difficulties the Government is in in respect of deficiencies in the Attorney-General's Department and the statement made by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) about the deficiencies that exist in the Australian Taxation Office, both of which relate to massive tax evasion and tax avoidance costing the Government hundreds of millions of dollars in forgone tax revenue. We also see unfolding the fraud by doctors in respect of Medibank fraud which is substantiated by the Australian Medical Association itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The House of Representatives today is debating the deficiencies in the administration of the meat industry-the meat substitution scandal. We in the Senate are talking about problems associated with the dairy industry and surplus supplies of skim milk that in some way or other were sold illegally on foreign markets. So the Parliament should be concerned about the great drop in public morality and ministerial propriety. I understand that the Government has reluctantly decided to support Senator Walsh's amendment to send this matter back to the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for another analysis and examination of the activities of the Department of Primary Industry and the Australian Dairy Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are discussing activities on a massive scale, involving illegalities and irregularities and breaches of proper business practice, which have affected, and will continue to affect, the trading reputation of Australia. We have been shown conclusively that there have been breaches of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, commonly known as GATT, in respect of our surplus products. Also, in the debate that currently is taking place in the other House, it has been shown that we have been breaching trading proprieties in respect of our meat. </PARA>
<PARA> We are aware that there was a substantial surplus of skim milk powder in 1975- 76. It is not satisfactory for the Government to say in 1982, some six or seven years later, that it did not concern itself as to the means and the processes by which those surplus products were disposed of. This matter was drawn to the attention of the Government and to the Opposition. Senator McLaren will recall that in 1976, when I was the Labor Party spokesman on agricultural matters, Mr Webster came before our party committee with the permission of the then Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair, to talk to us about surplus supplies of skim milk powder. I would have to be a fool not to recognise that if that information was available to the Opposition it was available to the Government. Are honourable senators opposite seriously contesting the view that Mr Sinclair did not seek, in any way, shape or form, to find out how those surplus stocks were being sold? He must have known, and did know, that steps were taken to dispose of them in years past in a way which can only be described as very unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Australian Government and the Australian nation. I remind the Senate of what the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations said. I refer to paragraph 9.38 of its report. The Committee unanimously stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We have weighed up all relevant considerations, having regard to the evidence set out above, the evidence relating to Mr Sinclair's known interest in the GATT breach issue and to the Committee's own assessment of the likely course of events in all the circumstances. The Committee concludes that on the balance of probabilities, Mr Sinclair's recollection of the events was not as reliable as that of Mr Webster. In other words, it appears to the Committee that on the balance of probabilities, Mr Sinclair was told of the terms of the compromise which necessarily involved a continuing breach of GATT. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of that conclusion of the Committee-it was an all-party committee and the Government's representatives on it were in the majority-does the Government still say that Mr Sinclair is not culpable, that Mr Sinclair did not know and that Mr Sinclair is fulfilling his responsibilities as a Minister? It is all right for the Government and for the Prime Minister of the day in the House of Representatives to suggest that some sort of an inquiry will be held into the Public Service because of alleged deficiencies in the Taxation Office which comes within the responsibility of the Treasurer; deficiencies in the Attorney-General's Department as suggested by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union; deficiencies which exist in the Department of Health with respect to taxpayers' money that has been ripped off by avaricious doctors; deficiencies which the Government suggests exist in the Department of Primary Industry so far as the meat issue is concerned; and deficiencies which obviously exist in the Australian Dairy Corporation. Is the Government really saying that all these problems flow solely from maladministration in the Public Service and, therefore, an inquiry should be held into the activities of the Public Service? In other words, the Government is attempting to shift the blame from the Minister to his Department, to the permanent head of his Department and to his immediate advisers. Senator Douglas McClelland and other honourable senators from this side of the House have suggested that. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject the suggestion by Senator Macklin-I was surprised to hear him make this suggestion-that in some way or other the Minister was not responsible. I believe the Minister was responsible. I remind the Senate that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations first took up the brief with respect to the Australian Dairy Corporation in 1977. As its first report indicates, it was frustrated by its inability to get information about what was happening with respect to the sales of our skim milk powder surpluses. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977 the Australian Financial Review referred to a rebate system that was operated by the statutory authority and said that it was in fact a breach of our international obligations. In September 1977 the Committee was told, however, that the potential breach had been rectified. Having received that information, the Committee stopped its investigations. It was not until 28 March 1979 that the Auditor-General was called upon to investigate allegations concerning the Australian Dairy Corporation. It was not until August 1980 that the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) took the important step of referring the matter to the Australian Federal Police because of his concern. He called for an investigation into that organisation. What does all the evidence show? All the evidence shows that all the documents relating to that period have disappeared. They are missing. What did the Auditor-General say in respect to this matter? At page 5 of the Auditor-General's report it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The problem was compounded by there being no current ADC or ADI staff member who had a detailed knowledge of the accounting system operating at the time in question. </PARA>
<PARA>In a more recent statement dated 10 August 1982 a letter from the Auditor- General's Office stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the observations by the Corporation relate to details of little, if any , consequence, but we note that the report has generated a remarkable resurgence of memory on the part of officers of the Corporation who, during the audit investigation, found themselves unable to offer more than the barest modicum of information to the audit team. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition believes that the public administration leaves a great deal to be desired. In the statement of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) to the Parliament today it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Primary Industry also confirmed that the records now available within the ADC are inadequate to identify any trader-to-trader sales that may have breached the GATT agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement was made in 1982; yet the breaches took place in 1975-76. The statement continued:</PARA>
<PARA> A questionnaire has been sent to all licensed exporters in order to determine what records they have retained in respect of the period concerned. Responses to date indicate that it will be impossible to show whether or not there was any widestread breach of the GATT arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government concedes that there are irregularities but it attempts to say that it is not responsible as a government; the responsibility lies with somebody in the Public Service. We in the Opposition find that a complete abdication of ministerial responsibility. We find that completely unacceptable. The Opposition believes that at best it was slackness and at worst it was incompetence and negligence. A government that has been operating in this sort of fashion surely has lost the confidence of the Parliament and the Australian people. After all, the Parliament has the responsibility in this matter. The Parliament has been attempting to establish what has been going on in this area. It is five years since the Senate's own committee looked at this matter. It is more than a year, as Senator Douglas McClelland pointed out, since the Minister had the report placed in his jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it rather unusual, to say the least, that we should be discussing the Australian Dairy Corporation in the Senate on Tuesday, 21 September, a couple of days after the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee in Finance and Government Operations-a Government supporter-has left the country on an overseas trip. His diligence and activity in this area have the support of the Opposition . On all occasions on that Committee we sought to establish the veracity or otherwise of what it is alleged has been going on. Australia's reputation as a major trading nation in this area surely has been damaged seriously by this issue, as it has by the meat substitution issue. The latter is the subject of a report that has been presented to the Parliament today. Our reputation as a major world trading nation has been seriously jeopardised. That report represents an indictment of this Government. After all these years of Senator Peter Rae, as Chairman of this Committee, talking about the problems of our statutory authorities and the irregularities that operate because of the failure of the Government to set clear and concise guidelines, we still have a situation where we do not have a satisfactory response from the Government about the way in which our statutory authorities should be operated. I remind the Senate of what the Standing Committee's report-presented last year as parliamentary paper No. 153 of 1981-said at page 94 of its conclusion on a statutory authority and its subsidiaries:</PARA>
<PARA> A statutory authority and its subsidiaries, whose actions have the potential to reflect adversely upon the Australian government, the Parliament and the nation, should not engage in individual arrangements to secure business which necessitate bribery, corruption, tax evasion, artificial schemes whose purposes are tax avoidance and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to deal with that in slightly more detail. We are discussing an issue of corruption, bribery and theft because $3m to $4m has disappeared somewhere in the process of this whole arrangement in Singapore. Who has the money? Nobody can say. What has happened to it? Nobody can say. There are no records. There has been such a change in staff and in ministerial arrangements that nobody can give us a satisfactory explanation. One can say only that in looking at that order of corruption, bribery and theft we also have evidence of tax evasion and tax avoidance which is being pursued. I think it is probably being too generous to say that all of this is due to incompetence and negligence . </PARA>
<PARA> There has clearly been a conspiracy of some sort involving the statutory authority which is under the control and management of the Department of Primary Industry. At what point does somebody accept responsibility for these matters? Australia will finish up having no reputation whatsoever. Are we going to rely upon pure incompetence in the Department? Are we going to say that the Minister was not negligent in carrying out his responsibility? At what point do we draw that fine line? At what point do we say that the Minister is culpable? At what point do we say that he is negligent or incompetent? This Government has a declining standard of ministerial responsibility. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Auditor-General has made the comments that he has but which we have not time to detail completely. We can say that we have a government that has been besieged with more scandals than any government in Australia's history. We can say that we have a government that defends the failures of Ministers to fulfil their proper responsibilities. We can say that we have a government that now has a litany of incompetent Ministers, all of whom seek to shelter under an umbrella of either ministerial non-knowledge or some failure in the department itself. We are entitled to say, therefore, that the report is not a very satisfactory one at all and that the Government's approach to this matter is not satisfactory. We are entitled to say that we are not impressed with the views of the Crown Solicitor who gave the Government certain advice on these matters. We are also entitled to say that the constant changing of Ministers does have the effect of providing the means by which those Ministers can escape their ministerial responsibilities. The constant changing of Health Ministers and Ministers for Primary Industry contributes to an atmosphere and a pattern of behaviour which is unsatisfactory. That can be sheeted home to no other person than the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who, after all, in hand picking his own team has to pick lackeys and people who are prepared to do his bidding. </PARA>
<PARA> We reject entirely the concept that is now being used by the Prime Minister to suggest that all of this flows from some failure of administration in the Public Service. We reject that because it rejects the concept of ministerial responsibility. I again remind the Senate that the Government is receiving body blow after body blow for its failure properly to account for its activities to the Parliament and to the Australian people in such a wide variety of issues. If it were a decent government based on decent principles it would do nothing less than resign and face the Australian people. I believe the Government is being forced, per force of the debate that has taken place here today, to support the amendment moved by Senator Walsh. It has no alternative. That is clearly shown in the debate. In addition to the Minister for Social Security who presented the report, we have had two 5-minute contributions by two Government senators who set out to try to defend the indefensible in respect of the Australian Dairy Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment agreed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry dated September 1982 as well as an extract from the transcript of evidence dated 13 July and 14 July 1982 and a file note dated 19 September 1982 recording a conversation between the Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry and Mr Buettel, a member of the Committee of Inquiry into the Meat Inspection Systems. I seek leave to make a statement in connection with the report, to have the statement incorporated in Hansard, and to move that the Senate take note of the statement and the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I present the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian meat industry. I seek leave to make a statement. In mid-August 1981, discoveries were made in the United States of horse meat having been substituted for beef by an Australian meat export establishment. Immediate steps were taken both in the USA and Australia to retain meat from the establishment concerned. As a result of these discoveries the Minister for Primary Industry took a number of immediate steps to which I shall later refer in more detail. When this substitution became public knowledge in both countries there was a public outcry, particularly in Australia. Allegations of widespread malpractice were made in this Parliament and in Victoria. Despite the immediate effectiveness of the measures taken at that time the Australian meat industry had been severely tarnished. </PARA>
<PARA> It was imperative that Australia's international reputation be cleared. The Government believed that the only means by which this could be achieved to the satisfaction of everyone in the community was through the establishment of a Royal Commission of high standing and repute to examine the matter. Letters patent appointing the Honourable Mr Justice Woodward to conduct the Royal Commission were issued by His Excellency the Governor-General on 12 September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission was charged with inquiring into:</PARA>
<PARA> ''(a) Whether administrative arrangements and procedures for the supervision of the handling of meat for export are adequate to ensure that all meat exported from Australia meets the requirements prescribed by law;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Whether malpractices are occurring, or have occurred, in the handling of meat for export or the exportation of meat;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Allegations made, whether in public or to a Minister, Department or Authority of the Commonwealth, of malpractices alleged to have occurred during the past ten years, in the handling of meat for export or in the exportation of meat;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Whether such allegations were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and effective;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Whether in response to such allegations, any illegality or corruption occurred.''</PARA>
<PARA> As allegations had also been made in relation to malpractices in the Victoria Meat Inspection Service, His Excellency the Governor of Victoria issued, on 15 September 1981, a Royal Commission which complemented the Commonwealth Commission but which related to meat for human consumption in Victoria. In November 1981, the Governor-General issued a further Commission in relation to meat for human consumption in the Northern Territory. Because of the considerable degree of overlap between the three commissions, enquiries in relation to all three were conducted jointly and concurrently. The Commissioner has discharged his three separate obligations by presenting a single Report. However, his concluding recommendations relating to the three separate governmental jurisdictions are set out separately. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's Report was presented to the Governor-General and the Governor of Victoria and forwarded to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory on 17 September. The Commissioner recommended that Appendix H, which is a separate volume to the Report, not be released until after criminal proceedings against those named or referred to in it have been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset I should say that on a dispassionate reading the findings of the Royal Commission are overwhelmingly positive. The Commission has commended the Department and the Minister in relation to their actions in the wake of the substitution incident. While there was a great deal wrong with the meat inspection system prior to the substitution incident, the Royal Commissioner has found that actions taken since then have been the appropriate ones. He has also endorsed most of the proposals advanced by the Department of Primary Industry for further improving the system. The positive suggestions the Commissioner has made are being and will be followed up vigorously. </PARA>
<PARA> Before going into the Royal Commission Report in detail it would be useful for honourable senators if I recalled the total background against which the Royal Commission enquiry was held. The meat industry is one of Australia's vital rural industries. The estimated value of production last year was $3.2 billion-more than a quarter of the gross value of rural production. It is a substantial export earner with exports of $1.3 billion to some 60 overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of wasteful dual meat inspection services in the four larger states has bedevilled the industry for many years. Following overseas complaints many years ago, the original Commonwealth Veterinary Service was expanded to an export inspection service in all states. New United States laws in 1963 and 1967 required greater Commonwealth controls. In 1964 some states, concerned at the increased Commonwealth role in meat inspection, sought and obtained agreement that state and Commonwealth inspectors work side by side in export establishments. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years this situation has led to costly duplication and some fragmentation of administrative controls. Between 1972 and 1978 there were no fewer than six major state or Commonwealth enquiries into meat inspection. At all these times the objective of the Commonwealth was to participate in any reasonable arrangements to achieve a single inspection service. However because of the attitude of some states no progress was made in this direction. In November 1978 the then Minister for Primary Industry, in yet another attempt to resolve the issue, established a Committee of Enquiry with terms of reference specifically directed to the solution of problems of meat inspection administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to address this particular Enquiry in some detail because it was material in relation to an adverse finding by the Royal Commission against the Minister for Primary Industry. The importance of this matter will become clear later in my statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of this Enquiry, the Hon C. R. Kelly and the other Committee member, Mr W. B. Buettel presented their Report to the Minister for Primary Industry on 11 February 1980. The whole thrust of their Report tabled in Parliament on 27 February 1980 was directed to the establishment of a new type of single meat inspection system, and Australian Meat Inspection Service or '' AMIS''. In the presentation of the Report to the Minister on 11 February 1980 evidence shows that the discussion was centred around the principles and proposed structure of a new AMIS. Mr Kelly also, at this brief meeting, raised the general issue of malpractice in meat inspection as reflected on pages 12, 13 and 66 of his Report. </PARA>
<PARA> However, at the time and as indeed evidenced in his Report, these allegations were of a most general nature, and have remained so. Neither in his Report, nor in his meeting with the Minister did Mr Kelly put forward any positive or specific evidence of names of people engaged in serious malpractice. Even at the Royal Commission Mr Kelly was not able to present any specific information and he has not done so since. If he had they would have been passed on to the police for investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Some matters of immediate administrative concern that arose in the Kelly Enquiry were passed on to the Department by Mr Landos, the Departmental executive officer to the Kelly Committee. I have been advised that the Bureau of Animal Health followed up with their field staff, but as later events showed not vigorously enough. The notes taken by Mr Landos during the Enquiry were never referred to Mr Nixon by Mr Landos, or Mr Kelly. Mr Kelly's key recommendation for the establishment of an AMIS was studied but rejected by the states. The Commonwealth was prepared at all times to support AMIS. In further pursuit of an improved system, a Commonwealth/state Committee of the Australian Agricultural Council, set up in 1980 following the Kelly Report, still failed to resolve the issue of a single service. </PARA>
<PARA> At a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council in Hobart in February 1981 the Minister for Primary Industry took yet another initiative to resolve the issue. A high level working group was established to consider further options. Yet again, however, no satisfactory consensus emerged. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the central pre-occupation and the priorities attached to both the Kelly Report and the Commonwealth consideration of it was the achievement of a single meat inspection service. </PARA>
<PARA> This is clear in Mr Kelly's evidence to the Royal Commission and I quote from page 10264 of the transcript:</PARA>
<PARA> 'We were much more interested in the problems of administration and having inspectors available at the right time and at the right place than we were at that time about the bribery and corruption. That was a secondary matter to us. Getting the machinery to construct it to work well was our first requirement'.</PARA>
<PARA> It is even more explicit on page 10267 of the transcript where Mr Kelly says,</PARA>
<PARA> 'I was much more interested in the welfare of AMIS than I was of the comparatively minor skullduggery that I knew about'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also explicitly clear on page 66 of the Kelly Report itself:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Starting a new system would give us the opportunity to turn over a new page'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelly goes on to say on page 66 that when the new page is turned, some specific problems in relation to inspectors and industry behaviour should be tackled with firm resolution. The priorities of the Kelly Committee were explicitly clear. Their major concern and the thrust of their deliberations was on a single inspection service. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Commonwealth Government has vigorously pursued the central recommendation of the Kelly Report. That is the issue of a single inspection service. Unfortunately, however, because of jurisdictional problems with some States these efforts met with little success. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the so-called issues of malpractice. As I will demonstrate in more detail not one specific allegation was put to the Minister by Mr Kelly. I will further demonstrate that the inherent problem on these matters has all along been the fact that specific allegations which could be pursued in an appropriate way were never given to the Minister. In the Royal Commission Report itself to which I shall shortly turn the Commissioner confirms in Paragraphs 2. 34 and 2.35 that much of the information supplied initially on malpractices was 'little better than rumour'. And that it finally took a major joint police task force, including 37 detectives from the Australian Federal Police and the Victorian Police to produce satisfactory evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me again emphasise that the Kelly Report was not a confidential document. It was tabled in Parliament shortly after it was received and sent to the States and industry for public discussion. It is easy now to be wise after the event but I think it significant that to the best of my knowledge no question was asked of the Minister in this House on the malpractice allegations in the Kelly Report until the publication of an article by Allan Reid in the Bulletin on 22 September. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also point out to the House that the Commissioner himself reports in Paragraph 2.75 that if he had had to report in April of this year, after seven months of investigations with the full powers of the Royal Commission that:</PARA>
<PARA> 'On the basis of the evidence then available I would have reported that malpractice in the industry was rare and felt compelled to recommend that, in the light of that finding many of the present security measures were unnecessary and that no fundamental change in administrative arrangements was required to prevent or detect malpractices'. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, in April 1982, some 26 months after Mr Kelly presented his Report to the Minister for Primary Industry, the Royal Commission after seven months investigation still did not have any substantive evidence of malpractices . It took three more months of the investigations by the Royal Commission, with the full powers that such a Commission has, to satisfactorily uncover the malpractices of sections of the meat industry and of corrupt activities of some members of the Meat Inspection Service and of some members of the police. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to malpractices, I would particularly like to draw attention to what the Commissioner said in Paragraph 7.4 of his Report:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The malpractice which led directly to the setting up of the Royal Commission, namely species substitution, proved to be the most serious malpractice which the Commission uncovered'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner goes on to say in Paragraph 7.6 that:</PARA>
<PARA> 'So far as the most serious cases of species substitution are concerned there is no evidence that this occurred in the export trade before late 1979'. </PARA>
<PARA> Significantly therefore, according to the Commission, in relation to the most serious malpractice ever to come to light, species substitution in the export trade, there was little or no evidence to show that it occurred before Mr Kelly brought his Enquiry to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that there is no reference to meat substitution in the Kelly Report and there is absolutely no suggestion whatsoever that Mr Kelly raised this most serious malpractice with the Minister. Let me now turn to the events of August 1981 which led to the establishment of the Royal Commission. Following the first ever confirmed finding on 13 August 1981 of horsemeat in a shipment of Australian boneless beef to the United States the Australian meat industry found itself in a crisis situation with the potential of immense damage to it. The Minister for Primary Industry took immediate action. Establishments were de- registered, spot checks were introduced in all States, security and surveillance were immediately increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Further measures were introduced within days. A new system was devised for security seals, a special task force was set up to co-ordinate a nationwide sampling and species testing program, and police investigations were intensified . </PARA>
<PARA> Shortly afterwards the Minister for Primary Industry introduced legislation to substantially increase penalties for illegal export of up to $100,000 fine or five years imprisonment or both; stringent new security control measures were introduced in cold stores with the sealing of meat transport vehicles and containers; and an outside consultant was appointed to review these measures. The Minister for Primary Industry convened a special meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council on 4 September to review the measures taken and to examine policies and practices for controlling knackeries, denaturing pet meat and identifying game meat for human consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry is to be commended for his prompt and decisive actions on this matter. As early as 17 August the US Special Trade Representative Ambassador Brock expressed to him satisfaction with the way in which the Australian Government was dealing with this issue. This confidence of the United States administration was reflected in the release to the United States market on 4 September of 24,000 tonnes of Australian beef valued at $40m.</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament now has before it the Report of the Royal Commission presided over by the Honourable Mr Justice A. E. Woodward. I propose to take the terms of reference of the Royal Commission in the form the Royal Commission dealt with them and address myself to the Commissioner's findings in each. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly 'the adequacy of administrative arrangements and procedures for the supervision of the handling of meat for export'. The Commissioner's findings are that, whilst once seriously deficient, administrative procedures are now adequate for their purposes although still with room for improvement. The Government generally endorses the Commissioner's recommendations and will be pursuing them vigorously. In doing so I point out that many of the recommendations have been or are in the process of implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to point out that on the central issue of a single inspection service, the Royal Commissioner has not made recommendations that went beyond what the Government is already doing. He has recognised the inherent nature of the problem arising from the need for the Commonwealth to be involved to protect export markets, and the traditional position which the states take in relation to what they regard as their sovereign responsibilities. Nevertheless, that matter will also be pursued with full vigour. </PARA>
<PARA> I might point out that in respect of the matters I have already referred to, the Commissioner acknowledges in paragraph 1.19 that:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Returning to the Department of Primary Industry itself, it is only fair to say that, under instructions from its Minister, it acted promptly and effectively when the meat substitution scandal erupted.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner goes on in paragraph 1.21 to state that:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Since then, and during the Commission's hearings, the Department has, for the most part, reacted promptly and appropriately to problems that might have been brought to light. It has not, as it might have done, sat back to await the Commission's recommendations. Instead it has, while keeping the Commission appropriately informed, continued to carry out its proper functions of administering the service and forward planning. This has culminated in the proposals set out in the Department's final submissions, which reflect the determination of the Minister and the Department to resolve the problems which now stand revealed.''</PARA>
<PARA> What the Commissioner has said is clearly reflected by the establishment in March 1982 in the Department of Primary Industry of the Export Inspection Service which has been structured under a new legislative framework, the Export Control Act. The new Export Inspection Service was created with characteristics designed to overcome problems and inadequacies disclosed in the Commissioner's investigations. Features of the new inspection service are a strong decentralised management system, a strong compliance program, and an investigations unit capable of pursuing allegations of malpractice in co- operation with Federal Police and the Meat and Livestock Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Further measures are being pursued to raise the calibre of inspection staff such as new inspection procedures and standards; new award and employment conditions, better aligned to industry requirements, and new training programs. Innovations proposed to increase the general efficiency of the industry include the introduction of Australia wide objective measurement and product descriptions for carcasses and meat, and the electronic transmission of all documentation and monitoring of product. In order that the industry itself should become more involved in the inspection process, and be more conscious of the costs of providing inspection services, the Department of Primary Industry has proposed arrangements to provide services as a tailor made package to each establishment, under contract, on a fee for service basis, and progressively transfer responsibility for the preparation of hygiene, quality control and product description to the companies themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The full implementation of many of the above arrangements still requires the agreement of unions, state governments and the meat industry. The Department of Primary Industry is currently engaging several consultants on key aspects of the revised system. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to turn to the next of the terms of reference relevant to the Commonwealth ''Malpractices in the Australian Meat Industry''. In reference to this I would first like to quote paragraph 7.2 of the Commissioner's findings:</PARA>
<PARA> ''I should say at the outset that I have no doubt that the industry has never been more free of malpractices than it is today. All references, unless otherwise stated, are to the past-most of them applying particularly to the last two or three years.''</PARA>
<PARA> Further, I quote paragraph 1.22 of the findings:</PARA>
<PARA> ''I believe that, in consequence of the strong reaction of the Minister and the Department, and the establishment of this Royal Commission, the current level of malpractice in the industry is lower than it has ever been. This desirable situation should be vigorously maintained.''</PARA>
<PARA> There is not much doubt as evidenced in the Royal Commission hearings that there have been malpractices in this industry. By the very nature of the industry and its widespread geographical locations it may well be difficult to totally eradicate all instances of malpractice. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is to the full credit of the Minister for Primary Industry that the Commissioner considers the measures he has taken to have reduced the incidence of malpractice to an all-time historical low. Moreover, as the Commissioner points out in paragraph 8.15 the matter should be kept in some perspective, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> ''In order to help keep the whole question of export quality in perspective it is worth noting that, against an overall rejection rate in USA of 0.5% in recent years, Australia's rate has been 0.2%. This compares with Canada's experience of 0.8% and New Zealand's 0.3%.''</PARA>
<PARA> I point out that the measurement in question is over a period of recent years. As the Commissioner says in paragraph 8.17 ''the record seems quite reasonable'' . Nevertheless, the Commissioner does refer to certain areas of malpractice where greater attention needs to be given and recommendations relevant to them will be processed as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner dealt with the next three terms of reference in one section of his Report and I will follow the same practice. These are ''the handling of allegations of malpractices and whether they were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and effective, or, on the other hand, whether any illegality or corruption occurred.'' Taking the last point first, in paragraph 1.66 the Commissioner concludes that apart from the possibility-and he puts it no higher than that-of corruption relating to certain police officers and of a senior meat inspector and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> ''There is no evidence to suggest that there was any illegality or corruption on the part of any Minister of the Crown, or any official, in response to any allegation of malpractice in the meat industry.''</PARA>
<PARA> On the point of allegations made to departments, the Commissioner has certain criticisms in relation to the Department of Primary Industry and the Federal Police. The deficiencies he points to will, I believe, be overcome by the new organisational procedures that I have referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the question of ministerial responsibility. At the outset I want to define precisely what the Commissioner has actually said. The Commissioner in paragraph 1.61 says that:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Generally, such matters as were referred to Commonwealth Ministers were dealt with adequately and effectively.''</PARA>
<PARA> In paragraph 8.39 the Commissioner says:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Insofar as allegations were reported by the Department to Mr Nixon, I do not consider any criticism can be levelled at his handling of them.''</PARA>
<PARA> In paragraph 1.19 the Commissioner says:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Returning to the Department of Primary Industry itself, it is only fair to say that, under instructions from its Minister, it acted promptly and effectively when the meat substitution scandal erupted.''</PARA>
<PARA> And in paragraph 1.22:</PARA>
<PARA> ''I believe that, in consequence of the strong reaction of the Minister and the Department, and the establishment of this Royal Commission, the current level of malpractice in the industry is lower than it has ever been.''</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Kelly Report is concerned, although he does so in the context of a passage which is critical of action taken in relation to malpractices, the Commissioner makes the point in paragraph 8.48 that:</PARA>
<PARA> ''They (the Minister and his senior advisers) seem to have given all their attention to the central issue dealt with by the (Kelly) Committee.''</PARA>
<PARA> That is, the question of a single meat inspection system. Evidence before the Commission clearly showed the strong and determined efforts made by the Minister to deal with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that in respect of all of these matters, the Royal Commissioner has found that Mr Nixon behaved responsibly and effectively. There is only one point which the Commissioner is critical of the Minister and that is his handling of the Kelly Report in relation to malpractices. As the Commissioner says in paragraph 8.39:</PARA>
<PARA> ''The only possible criticism of his handling of his responsibilities in this area relate to his reaction to the Report of the Kelly Committee of Enquiry in 1980.''</PARA>
<PARA> I will now examine in detail those areas where the Royal Commissioner has been critical of Mr Nixon. In paragraphs 1.62 to 1.64 the Royal Commission says, first, that Mr Nixon paid insufficient attention to the findings of Mr Kelly and Mr Buettel. According to the Royal Commissioner, the Minister, having heard from a responsible source that there had been cases of bribery and abuse of power in his Department, should have taken more adequate and effective steps to deal with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me again state unequivocally that the matters covered in these paragraphs had nothing whatsoever to do with meat substitution. If Mr Kelly had unearthed significant information about meat substitution, I am quite sure that he-himself a farmer-would have jumped up and down more than we ever saw him do in this House in relation to tariffs. He most certainly would have made very strong representations to the Minister, or if not to him then to me. He did not. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, he would not have sat on such information until his Report was completed. He would have known the immense significance of such information, and he would have acted on it immediately. The fact is that Mr Kelly did not draw any such evidence to our attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusions drawn by the Royal Commission relate to different matters and the Commission's argument supporting its conclusions is to be found in paragraphs 8.39 to 8.45. This evidence boils down to two points:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. In relation to certain statements in the Kelly Report itself (pages 12, 13, 66) the Minister did not act adequately and effectively; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That certain statements were made to the Minister in a meeting with Mr Kelly on 11 February 1980 and that these were not adequately followed up. </PARA>
<PARA> To examine the Royal Commissioner's conclusions we must turn back to the specific evidence on the statements that were alleged to have been made to the Minister on 11 February 1980 and to the specific information contained in the Kelly Report. I shall deal with the 11 February meeting first. Let us be clear in dealing with this matter, that we are dealing with the issues which the Kelly Committee itself regarded as secondary to the major conclusions of the Report. This is evident from Mr Kelly's own evidence to the Royal Commission. For example on page 10264 of the transcript he says:</PARA>
<PARA> ''We were much more interested in the problems of administration and having inspectors available at the right time and at the right place than we were at that time about the bribery and corruption. That was a secondary matter to us. Getting the machinery to construct it to work well was our first requirement.''</PARA>
<PARA> And on page 10267:</PARA>
<PARA> ''I repeat it was a minor part of our duty that was laid on us when we were doing the Report and I was much more interested in the welfare of AMIS than I was of the comparatively minor skullduggery that I knew about.''</PARA>
<PARA> In assessing the significance of his meeting with the Minister, it is important to note what Mr Kelly himself said about various aspects of it. In his primary evidence on page 10243, Mr Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA> ''The primary purpose of the meeting was to present the Report and any discussions had in relation to areas outside the terms of reference of the Committee would have been general and merely coincidental to the meeting.''</PARA>
<PARA> Then, in relation to the discussion itself, Mr Kelly referred to a minute prepared by Mr Landos which he said recorded that at the meeting with the Minister, the Committee expressed strong views as to the sordid nature of the meat industry and meat inspection. However, later Mr Kelly was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Is the position this in reality that you, apart from Mr Landos' minute or document that was referred to have no independent recollection of precisely what was said at the meeting with the Minister on 11 February at all?''</PARA>
<PARA> He responded:</PARA>
<PARA> ''That is right, no precise memory.'' (Transcript 10259). </PARA>
<PARA> When he was then asked whether he was prepared to accept that what was in Mr Landos' document must be accurate he said:</PARA>
<PARA> ''No. I am not saying it must be accurate. I am prepared to say-I repeat, I was startled and gratified to find that I myself had refreshed my own memory.''</PARA>
<PARA> As to the specifics discussed with the Minister, the question was put:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Mr Kelly, you were asked whether or not at the meeting with the Minister you provided the specific names of particular places where malpractices were said to have happened, and my recollection is that you said that you either did not or that you had no recollection of doing so; is that correct?''</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'That is right.' (Transcript page 10275)</PARA>
<PARA> And when asked why he had not reported his findings to the Commonwealth Police or to the Federal Police, Mr Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Never even thought of it. It has nothing to do with me. My responsibility was to chair my Committee that had to examine this question of dual inspection problems. That was all I was worried about.' (Transcript page 10272)</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Landos also gave evidence (page 10277A of the transcript) that:</PARA>
<PARA> 'By far the great majority, if not all, of the allegations received by the Committee were based on rumour or on second-hand evidence. The Committee found a great reluctance to-for any people to pass on first-hand experience.'</PARA>
<PARA> He also stated (page 10288 of the transcript) that the real purpose of the meeting was:</PARA>
<PARA> 'to present the Report to the Minister and to stress to him the necessity of structural change with regard to the meat inspection arrangements.'</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Landos, when asked whether any examples of graft or misuse of inspector power were raised at the meeting, replied: (page 10282)</PARA>
<PARA> 'I do not believe any specific examples were raised with the Minister.'</PARA>
<PARA> I should mention at this point that in the transcript of the Royal Commission evidence, and in paragraph 8.41 of the Report reference is made to notes prepared by Mr Landos during the Kelly Inquiry and to a minute he wrote sometime after the meeting between Mr Kelly and the Minister. This minute was designed as Mr Landos's final overall impressions of the Kelly Inquiry. It was not a response to the meeting between Mr Kelly and the Minister. It was prepared for internal Departmental use after a discussion with Mr Cleary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commissioner said of the suggestions in this minute:</PARA>
<PARA> 'They never reached the Minister.' (paragraph 8.43)</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, Mr Landos' notes never reached either the Minister or the Secretary of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence actually given by Mr Landos that no specific examples were raised with the Minister adds emphasis to the fact that the primary purpose of the Kelly Committee was to look into the structural change needed to make meat inspection arrangements effective. The Committee was concerned with the causes of any problems evident in meat inspection and regarded symptoms of malpractice as incidental to the primary purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> This is further confirmed by Mr Gee in giving evidence before the Royal Commission. In responding to a question of whether many of his discussions with the Minister were directed to the AMIS recommendation for a single inspection service, he responded:</PARA>
<PARA> '. . . yes, that is correct and it is important, I think, to get that completely in context. That was the absolutely overriding public and political issue, to find a solution to the meat inspection administration.' (page 10338)</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the fact that there was no specific information given the Minister the evidence clearly shows that the Minister spoke with Mr Gee and asked if there was anything that could be followed-up. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Gee was asked whether in fact he followed-up problems of the kind raised by the Kelly Committee, he replied ''. . . I did not follow it up with Mr Kelly. I went to Mr Landos and enquired of him as to what evidence, what data they did have from their hearings and from their conversations and from the submissions they raised and John Landos related to me that there was nothing substantial, that there was nothing of what we would call hard evidence and I said, 'are you sure?' to my recollection, 'are you sure there is nothing that would warrant us investigating further or going to the police?' and he was of the opinion that there was not anything of that nature. On the basis of his advice I did not pursue it directly with Mr Kelly.'' (p. 10339 of the transcript ). </PARA>
<PARA> Now I ask you how could the Minister, given no specific information, have taken any further action to deal with these allegations? I submit that on the basis of all the available evidence he could not have. Where is the substance on which a Minister could be blamed and condemned?</PARA>
<PARA> There is another matter in the Royal Commission Report which disturbs me. </PARA>
<PARA> The Report, on the top of page 259, quotes half of Mr Kelly's diary entry. I have confirmed that with Mr Kelly, whom I contacted on Sunday night, and it is confirmed in the full transcript of the evidence, (page 10244). It is the half that is damaging to Mr Nixon, rather than the half that would offer support for his action. </PARA>
<PARA> The quote contained in paragraph 8.40, is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ''I went to Melbourne for the day to present meat report to the Minister, Peter Nixon. It was worth it because it gave me the chance to tell him a few of the notes that we could not put in the report, such as the bribery and blackmail which is so prevalent in the meat inspection game. Poor Peter is now to see what can be done.''</PARA>
<PARA> However, the full entry also contains the following words immediately after the previous sentence:</PARA>
<PARA> ''We were gratified today to hear that the Victorian Minister of Agriculture has stated bluntly that the present position cannot be allowed to continue. I told Nixon that both of us, Buettel and I would be prepared to help him get something done.''</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelly has advised me on the telephone yesterday that it is almost certain that the statement referred to by the Victorian Minister would have related to problems of dual administration of the Meat Inspection Service-the central thrust of what the Kelly Committee Report was all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the full diary entry reinforces the priorities of the Committee. They were concerned with the overwhelming complexity of the major problems of fixing up the administration arrangements for meat inspection. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view the last reference in Mr Kelly's diary entry to helping get something done, clearly related to the development and implementation of AMIS.</PARA>
<PARA> The preoccupation of the Kelly Committee with the AMIS proposals is confirmed by Mr Buettel's account of the meeting. In a telephone discussion with the Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry on 19 September, Mr Buettel confirmed that the bulk of the meeting was concerned with the Committee's recommendations of AMIS. Mr Kelly spoke only in very general terms about ''a lot of nonsense around the ridges''. </PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the fact that the Minister took broad, vague allegations, indeterminantly made, and subsidiary to the main elements of the report . . . having regard to the fact that he took these allegations sufficiently seriously to pass them on to Mr Gee, and that Mr Gee consulted Mr Landos who confirmed that there was nothing in the allegations that could be put to the police, I suggest that it is not possible to condemn the Minister on the ground of failure to act. I suggest it is not possible to condemn him on the evidence about what was said at that meeting. I remind the House of Mr Landos' evidence, stated above, that the great majority of the evidence received by the Committee was based on rumour or second-hand evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the actual Report itself. As the Royal Commissioner has put it in paragraph 8.46:</PARA>
<PARA> ''I think it may be that Mr Kelly did not hammer home his concern in any very emphatic way, but he obviously said something about the problems he saw and the Report was there to be read; it was clear enough.''</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed the Report was there to be read but let us see if it has been properly read and if it was indeed clear enough. Presumably, the Royal Commissioner was referring to those paragraphs of the Report which he himself quoted. His first quotation was taken from the top of page 12 of the Kelly Report. This was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Complaints were received of excessive zeal at times stemming from a grievance , real or fancied, on the part of an inspector. It is a fact that production can be slowed by unwarranted stoppage of chains to the annoyance of employees; or condemnations, allegedly unwarranted, to the annoyance of management.'' (page 12 )</PARA>
<PARA> If the report had gone back a sentence or two, it would also have included in this particular question:</PARA>
<PARA> ''The Committee recognises the inspector's task to be a difficult one exposed to friction with both works' management and works' employees.'' (page 11)</PARA>
<PARA> And then the first sentence from the paragraph that the Report quoted is also omitted. This sentence reads:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Inspection is a matter of individual subjective judgment and opinion.''</PARA>
<PARA> In my view these two sentences give a quite different perspective to that first paragraph on page 12. Without specific evidence, what can a Minister do in relation to a sentence of that kind?</PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commissioner then quoted from the bottom of page 12 and on to page 13 . The quote reads:</PARA>
<PARA> '' . . . an inspector, if he wants to be vindictive, can press the stop button on a killing chain. this puts meat inspectors in positions of considerable industrial power. That this power has not been used more often is a tribute to the sense of responsibility of most meat inspectors, but it has been used. The fear that it may be used has encouraged some abattoir managers to give inspectors gifts of meat, or to sell them meat at ridiculously low prices. It has been alleged that some managers have given inspectors this kind of inducement not only to ensure industrial peace, but to induce inspectors to turn a blind eye to procedures that give considerable financial advantages to management.''</PARA>
<PARA> I want to draw particular attention to one sentence in that quotation by the Royal Commissioner. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> ''That this power has not been used more often is a tribute to the sense of responsibility of most meat inspectors, but it has been used.''</PARA>
<PARA> Here the Kelly Committee would seem to be saying that problems posed by excessive use of such power were rare, especially against the background that all works strenuously denied that they indulged in such practices as the next paragraph quoted by Commissioner Woodward makes plain. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe in the light of all the circumstances, in the light of the fact that the priorities in the Kelly Report related to the establishment of AMIS and in the light of community concern at the existence of two meat inspection services rather than one . . . I do not believe in the light of these facts that the quotations on page 12 and 13 amount to sufficient substance to require Mr Nixon to take more action than he did. </PARA>
<PARA> This view is significantly reinforced by the treatment given to a certain paragraph taken from page 66 of Mr Kelly's Report. </PARA>
<PARA> As quoted by the Royal Commission that paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> '' . . . one aspect of the meat industry which should be tackled with firm resolution . . . is the problem of some managers trying to buy the co-operation of inspectors by giving them meat at ridiculously low prices, or countenancing excessive overtime claims, or of meat inspectors demanding cheap meat backed by the implied threat of slowing the killing chain or forcing higher offal or other condemnations if management is not compliant. Legislation should include heavy punishment for administrators, VO's, meat inspectors and management. That this kind of practice has been too common in the past we know too well. It must be stopped in the future.'' (8.42)</PARA>
<PARA> I agree fully that if you take the words as quoted in the Royal Commissioner's Report, they seem to be saying in very plain terms that there is a certain matter that should be tackled immediately with firm resolution and that certain malpractices were mentioned. In fact that is not what the Kelly Committee said. That particular quotation does not accurately represent the findings of the Kelly Report. </PARA>
<PARA> There were two critical ommissions from this quotation. They have the effect of substantially modifying the meaning of that paragraph especially when placed in the context of the paragraph that preceded it. I now quote the paragraph as it was actually written in the Kelly Report, along with the preceding paragraph,</PARA>
<PARA> ''Starting a new system would give us the opportunity to turn over a new page. We know that the firmly held stances of the past will not be lightly adandoned but at least there is more chance of this happening in a new situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one aspect of the meat industry which should be tackled with firm resolution when the new page is turned, and that is the problem of some managers trying to buy the co-operation of inspectors by giving them meat at ridiculously low prices, or countenancing excessive overtime claims, or of meat inspectors demanding cheap meat backed by the implied threat of slowing the killing chain or forcing higher offal or other condemnations if management is not compliant. AMIS legislation should include heavy punishment for administrators, VO's, meat inspectors and management who try to extract improper advantages out of the system in this manner. That this kind of practice has been too common in the past we know too well. It must be stopped in the future.''</PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, the words ''when the new page is turned'' are omitted. It is worth noting that this significant and particular omission occurred not only in the Royal Commissioner's Report but also in the primary evidence given by Mr Kelly (page 10249). </PARA>
<PARA> Without the omitted words, the injunction from the Kelly Committee would have been that the Minister should move immediately to tackle certain problems with firm resolution. Now with those words, the injunction is consistent with the whole thrust of everything Mr Kelly said in his report and with much of what he said before the Royal Commission. That was that attention should first be given to creating a new system. Then-and indeed as a part of the new system, attention should be given to those instances of skullduggery, using Mr Kelly's word. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed there was some discussion in the Royal Commission about what these words meant. I refer you to page 10266 of the transcript. </PARA>
<PARA> The other omission, which is in no way even indicated in the quotation in the Royal Commissioner's Report, is that the Kelly report said ''AMIS legislation should include heavy punishments for administrators, VO's, meat inspectors and management who try to extract improper advantages out of the system in this manner.''</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that Mr Kelly said such punishment should be included in AMIS legislation again shows plainly that the thrust of the injunction from the Kelly Committee was that the creation of a new system was the first priority. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is reasonable to ask how it happened that Mr Kelly, in his primary evidence, and how it happened that the Royal Commission report, omitted, in two places, words of such stark and significant importance, especially when the reputation of a Minister was at stake. </PARA>
<PARA> If all the omitted words had been included, they would have altered the balance of the evidence substantially in the Minister's favour. The fact that they were not included is a sad and unhappy omission, with a most unfortunate consequence. Mr Speaker, there can be no doubting that the Royal Commissioner acted in good faith in drawing the conclusion that he did. But on the basis of the evidence that I have outlined, I cannot accept that the one adverse finding against the Minister has been substantiated. I unequivocally reject it. </PARA>
<PARA> The object of the Royal Commission's criticism of the Minister was that Mr Kelly had said certain things in the meeting of 11 February, or that the Report itself said certain things, that were not adequately followed-up. That, as the Royal Commissioner said, was the only point of criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe I have rebutted it adequately and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Report of the Royal Commission is a very positive and valuable document. The very conduct of the Commission and the response that it stimulated , has been of great benefit to the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Overwhelmingly, the Royal Commissioner's findings have been positive in character. Since the substitution incident, the actions of the Minister and his Department have been found to be appropriate and by and large effective. The Department's recommendations for further improving the service have also been favourably commented upon. The Royal Commissioner has rightly emphasised that there is further room for improvement and he has suggested avenues for the pursuit of this improvement. These avenues will be followed up vigorously.</PARA>
<PARA> We are of course, still left with the difficult and complex problem of dual inspection. That matter must be resolved. The Commissioner's comments will be drawn upon heavily in our efforts to resolve that matter with the States. </PARA>
<PARA> We are indebted to the Royal Commissioner and his staff for their efforts. Let me stress again that I believe the Commission has been a very productive one, notwithstanding my reservations in relation to one finding. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a broader consideration of which meat substitution was one symptom. </PARA>
<PARA> It makes me very angry indeed to see people who have been treated well in this country, who are largely prosperous, and who are often in control of affluent businesses seeking for no other reason than greed to become even wealthier by means which are unethical and dishonest. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people are undermining our whole system. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of those involved in meat substitution, they run the risk of destroying the livelihoods of many honourable people in the meat industry and in the farming and pastoral world, because these practices have the potential of destroying our markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commissioner has indicated that current penalties for those people are severe. Personally I would not mind if they were very much more severe. The people who have been involved in meat substitution have exhibited the same corrupt attitude towards society as those who have sought to evade paying their taxes. This Government is determined to do everything it can to make these practices unprofitable for the participants. It would want to do whatever it can to eradicate these practices once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, there is one general point that I want to make. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know quite well that in the last decade or so, there have been significant breakdowns and administrative failures in a number of areas of government administration. The Narcotics Bureau and the Federal Police have been reorganised and the recent issues concerning the Crown Solicitor's Office provide a further example. </PARA>
<PARA> These are matters of the gravest concern to all Australians. There have obviously been considerable strains on the Public Service and I want to emphasise that I do not think the Public Service, with its traditional modes and manner of operation, can or should necessarily be blamed for these failures. </PARA>
<PARA> Overwhelmingly members of the Public Service do their jobs honourably and with a degree of dedication and commitment. That is not recognised as it should be in the broad community. But I also believe that in recent years the Public Service is having to face new and difficult challenges, and it needs to be equipped to meet the changes that have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The business ethics of a minority have deteriorated and it is quite clear that unethical people who wish to cheat on their obligations to others have left Ministers and the Public Service with a massive problem in attempting to catch up with, and overtake, their unethical practices. They have at times, as we have found in this Report, found people who will assist them from within the Public Service, but I should emphasise that Public Servants like that are a small minority who will be condemned by the overall membership of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> But because there have been these breakdowns and because there would seem to be elements in the community able to manipulate the increasingly complex and diverse business world, some signicant changes may well be needed within the Public Service to put it in a position of being ahead of rather than behind those who seek to despoil that system which is important to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very broad proposition, but it is a matter which is receiving my own urgent and vigorous attention and I will be saying something more about it shortly. </PARA>

<PARA>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that in the other place on 17 August the Minister for Communications tabled a copy of his statement of 4 July last announcing the Government decisions on the principal recommendations of the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission-the Dix Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill now before the Senate and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1982, which I will shortly introduce, seek to implement those decisions referred to in that statement which will require legislation. Introduction of these Bills provides the means for a cognate debate to take place on both the Minister for Communications' July statement and the provisions of those Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it important that legislation establishing and controlling the activities of the national broadcasting authority be separated from legislation which regulates the provision of commercial and public broadcasting and television services. This Bill will provide a legislative 'home' for the ABC. It should also make that legislation more accessible to those in the community with a particular interest in the Charter of the ABC, its structure, powers and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of this Bill honours the Government's undertaking to remove from the Broadcasting and Television Act the provisions for the establishment and management of the ABC. I would hope that at some appropriate time the legislation establishing the Special Broadcasting Service can be similarly treated. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Communications' public statement was comprehensive in reporting the Government decisions, I do not intend here to add substantially to those matters which were the subject of that statement. What I seek to do now is to draw to the attention of Honourable Senators the major features of the legislation, and to refer to some provisions of the Bill where an additional explanation might be helpful to a better understanding of the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of Honourable Senators to clause 2, which defines the commencement dates for various provisions of the Bill. Except for clauses 5,6 and 8, Parts I to III and clauses 34, 57 and 70 of the Bill come into operation on the day on which the Bill receives Royal Assent. Certain clauses in other Parts of the Bill regarding creating and abolishing positions in the Service of the Corporation, the preparation of annual estimates of expenditure and the making of Regulations and Rules also come into operation on that date.</PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions of the Bill come into operation on a date to be fixed by Proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA> The clauses in Part II of the Bill which deal with the establishment, functions and management of the corporation, and which will not come into operation on Royal Assent, are those which establish the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, specify its Charter and define the duties of the Corporation Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The practical effect of the particular commencement provisions is that the Board of the new Corporation will be legally established from the date of Royal Assent, and action to appoint the non-executive Directors of the Corporation can then be taken. When the Board is properly constituted in accordance with the Act , it can then proceed to consider the appointment of a Managing Director of the Corporation. When those actions are complete the remaining provisions of the Bill, and the provisions of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill, would be brought into effect on a date to be fixed by Proclamation. This latter action will effectively abolish the present Australian Broadcasting Commission and terminate the appointments of present members of that Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 of the Bill defines the Charter of the Corporation. This Charter is a significant expansion on the functions of the ABC as they now appear in Section 59 of the Broadcasting and Television Act. There are aspects of the proposed Charter which I consider have a particular importance in determining the programming policies of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation will be established to provide, within Australia, innovative and comprehensive broadcasting and television services of a high standard as part of the Australian broadcasting and television system. More specifically, it is to provide broadcasting and television programs that contribute to a sense of national identity, that inform and entertain, and which reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian community, as well as broadcasting and television programs of an educational nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (b) of sub-clause 6 (1) authorises the Corporation to provide services for reception in other countries, while paragraph (c) is a positive statement of the Corporation's role to encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In providing services within Australia, the Corporation is required by sub- clause 6 (2) to take account of the services of commercial and public broadcasters, the standards approved by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for other broadcasting and television services, and the responsibility of the Corporation to provide a balance between programs of wide appeal and specialised programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that all honourable senators will see the provisions of this clause as a proper expression of the functions of our national broadcasting authority for the present and for the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Charter of the Corporation is perhaps the most important aspect of the Bill now before the Senate. For the first time, legislation will provide a framework within which the ABC will be able to plan the development of its services and determine its future direction. The Corporation would be required to seek a balance in its radio and television services between programs of wide appeal and the specialised programs which other broadcasting and television licensees would not normally provide. One of the attractions of our broadcasting and television system is the diversity of program choices offered. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some aspects of the duties of the Board of the Corporation in clause 8 which I believe should be highlighted. It is proposed that the Board have a duty to maintain the independence and integrity of the Corporation and to ensure that this independence and integrity are not affected by the performance of any service, or the provision of any facility for the Corporation, or by the acceptance of any gift, device or bequest made to the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (c) of sub-clause 8 (1) places a duty on the Board to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. </PARA>
<PARA> The independence of the ABC is one of the principal virtues we all espouse in defending the continuing need for a national broadcasting authority. It is sometimes said that the ABC can never be truly independent while it is dependent for funding on Budget appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> I have never seen the reality of the argument that Government funding of the ABC implies subservience to the Government's will. Any Government that tried to cripple the ABC by needlessly withholding funds would quickly lose community support. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, however, that the duties of the Board enunciated by the Bill will greatly strengthen and enhance the role of the Board in what has always been a very contentious area. From comments made by Honourable Senators over the years, and from reactions received fron the general community by the Minister for Communications, I believe that these provisions would have wide support. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11 requires the Board to establish an Australian Broadcasting Corporation Advisory Council and authorises the Board to establish Advisory Councils in relation to any State, Territory or region of Australia. The functions of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Advisory Council are to advise the Board on broadcasting and television programs of the Corporation, either on its own initiative or at the request of the Board of the Corporation. The functions of other Advisory Councils are to advise the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Advisory Council on programs in that State, Territory or region, as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention of these arrangements is that Advisory Councils at State, Territory or regional level will provide a range of advices to the National Advisory Council to assist it in advising the Corporation Board in programming matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The clause also authorises the Board to establish Advisory Committees to furnish advice to the Board on particular matters. The types of advisory Committees which the Board could reasonably be expected to appoint are Committees on such matters as music, educational, science and religious programming. National Committees now exist for these purposes and have made invaluable contributions to the development of the services provided by the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA> Part III of the Bill establishes the structure of the Board of the Corporation and the method of appointment of the Managing Director. The Board shall comprise between seven and nine Directors, one of whom is the Managing Director. Non- executive Directors are appointed by the Governor-General as part-time members, and provision is made for the Governor-General to appoint one non-executive Director to be Chairman and one non-executive member to be Deputy Chairman of the Board. The tenure of office of a non-executive Director is a period not exceeding five years, with eligibility for reappointment. Sub-clause 12 (5) sets out the matters which the Governor-General shall take into consideration in appointing a non-executive Director. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 13 provides for the Managing Director to be appointed by the Board for a period of five years, with eligibility for reappointment for periods not exceeding five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The other provisions in this Part of the Bill, relating to remuneration, leave of absence, resignations, disclosure of interests and termination of appointments, as well as provision for acting appointments, conform with principles embodied in legislation establishing other statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions regarding meetings of the Board are set out in clause 22. The Chairman is required to convene such meetings of the Board as he considers necessary for the efficient performance of its functions, but there is a requirement that the Chairman convene a Board meeting if he receives a written request signed by a majority of non-executive Directors then holding office. </PARA>
<PARA> The powers and duties of the Corporation are detailed in Part IV, with clause 25 stating the Corporation's general powers. While these powers are similar, for the most part, to those vested in other bodies engaged in business activities, there are some provisions which require explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (g) of sub-clause 25 (1) authorises the Corporation to accept gifts, devises and bequests and to act as trustee of moneys or other property vested in the Corporation on trust. </PARA>
<PARA> This power is qualified by sub-clause 25 (3), which precludes the Corporation from accepting:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the performance of any service or the provision of any facility for the Corporation; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) any gift, devise or bequest to the Corporation,</PARA>
<PARA>except in connection with the exercise of particular powers of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The powers referred to are those in clause 28 concerning the Corporation's powers to establish and maintain orchestras, bands and musical groups, and to arrange for public concerts; the powers in clause 29 authorising the Corporation to publish certain literary material and sell sound recordings of its programs and public concerts; and provisions in sub-clause 31 (2) regarding the broadcasting or televising of certain announcements or programs.</PARA>
<PARA> Sub-clause 25 (3) is expressed, however, as not precluding the Corporation from :</PARA>
<PARA> (a) accepting services, facilities or moneys from the Commonwealth, a State or Territory, or one of their authorities; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) entering into an agreement or arrangement with a bona fide producer of broadcasting or television programs, cinematograph films or sound recordings, public concerts or other public entertainments, or a bona fide publisher of any literary material where the agreement is to share any expense or risk associated with the production, distribution, sale or presentation of those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of these provisions is to preclude the Corporation from engaging in what might be said to be covert arrangements for corporate underwriting or sponsorship of particular programs of the Corporation, but to permit the Corporation to accept external assistance where the programming independence of the ABC is not involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision not to introduce corporate underwriting or sponsorship for ABC programs was widely supported. The Dix Committee did report, however, that the ABC has accepted some services or facilities from outside organisations in the production of particular programs. While the financial value or this support received by the ABC by this means was not large in relation to its total expenditure, a continuation of this practice could be seen as an erosion of the independence of the ABC in programming matters. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, it is important that the Corporation is not unnecessarily restricted in its powers to accept external assistance. The costs involved in bringing orchestras, musical groups and artists of world renown to Australia are a substantial call on the finances of the ABC. If people and organisations are prepared to defray some of the costs involved or give support to a State symphony orchestra, the Government does not see such assistance as comprising the programming independence of the ABC. It is important to bear in mind that clause 31 prohibits the Corporation from broadcasting or televising advertisements, and that clause 8 imposes a duty on the Board to ensure that the Corporation's independence and integrity are not affected by the acceptance of assistance of the nature specified in that clause. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-clauses (1) and (2) of clause 27, on news and information services of the Corporation, largely re-state the present provisions of the Act, but extend the requirement to provide these services to television stations. Sub-clause 27 (3) permits the Corporation to use news agencies and other sources for news and information of current events both within Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> For reasons which are somewhat mystifying, the latter proposal has been criticised as a threat to the ABC's ability to provide an independent news and information service. The present restriction on the ABC using agencies as a source of domestic news for its radio broadcasting services is shrouded in history and is well-documented in the Report of the Dix Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sees the present law as a needless restriction on the freedom of the ABC. Reasons given in the 1930s for this provision have no validity in the 1980s. I stress that the Bill leaves it to the Board to decide whether the use of such news agencies would enable the services of the Corporation to be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of Honourable Senators to clause 30, regarding children's television programs. This clause introduces a new concept-that the Corporation Board may submit children's programs to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for classification. In the other Bill I will be introducing, there is a provision requiring the Tribunal to include in its Annual Report details of programs submitted by the Corporation for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a genuine concern in parts of the community about the effects of television programs on children in that sensitive period between six and twelve years of age. Cases no doubt will arise where the Corporation may consider it is in its own interests to have the Tribunal classify a program intended for viewing during the period set aside for children's programs. The purpose of this clause is to enable the Corporation to seek such a classification and for the Tribunal to respond. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to refer briefly to the more significant changes proposed by Part V of the Bill, which deals with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-clauses 32 (3) and (4) provide for the matters to be taken into account to determine the relative efficiency of officers for promotion, as clause 37 provides that the only criteria for promotion is the relative efficiency of the officers concerned. Sub-clause 39 (2) provides that the only ground of appeal against promotions is the greater efficiency of the officer making the appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 33 authorises the Managing Director to appoint officers and engage such temporary employees as he thinks necessary, and to determine their terms and conditions of employment. In exercising powers conferred on him by the Bill, the Managing Director is required, by sub-clause 10 (2), to act in accordance with any policies determined and any directions given to him by the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-clause 33 (4) empowers the Managing Director, with the consent of an officer, to declare that officer to be an unattached officer, the position held by that officer then becoming vacant. There is no similar provision in the existing legislation relating to the Service of the ABC, and this has caused administrative problems in cases, for example, where Commission officers are posted overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 34 and 35 enable the Board to create any position in the Service, determine the classification for that position, abolish any position in the Service, and to reclassify any position by raising or lowering the classification. The Board is not required to consult with or seek the approval of the Public Service Board for these purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of clause 38, regarding the promotion of officers who complete courses of training for special positions, are similar to provisions in the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill 1982, which is now before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 41 deals with the establishment of Promotions Appeal Boards. The clause provides for the establishment of such Appeal Boards as are required, whereas the present legislation permits the establishment of only one such Board. This has caused delays in hearing and determining appeals. Sub-clauses (9) to (11) deal with circumstances where a member of a Promotions Appeal Board ceases to be a member or ceases to take part in consideration of an appeal then being heard. The provisions in clause 42 regarding the determination of appeals are, again, similar to provisions in the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 46 and 47 would re-enact the current provisions in the Broadcasting and Television Act where an office or temporary employee refuses or fails to comply with a direction with respect to work that he is performing or is to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> Division 4 of this Part of the Bill, which concerns redeployment and retirement of officers and employees of the Corporation, substantially reproduces the provisions of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1981. Redeployment and retirement of its employees would be matters solely for the Corporation to administer, and would extend only to the possible redeployment of employees of the Corporation. Clause 58, which establishes a Tenure Appeal Board for the purposes of this Division of the Bill, provides, in sub-clause (10), for circumstances where a member of the Tenure Appeal Board ceases to be a Board member or is unable to take part in the determination of an appeal, after the appeal has commenced. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VI of the Bill, on the finances of the Corporation, contains unexceptional provisions relating to the moneys of the Corporation, the application of moneys and the preparation of annual Estimates. Clause 71 increases to $500,000, or such higher amount as might be prescribed by Regulations, those contracts which are subject to approval of the Minister. That clause also authorises the Corporation, with the approval of the Minister, to enter into so-called lease- back contracts or arrangements in relation to real or personal property. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VII of the Bill deals with the technical services of the Corporation. The clauses in this Part are a significant redefinition of the responsibilities of the Corporation and of the Minister for the provision of technical services, resulting from the decision that the Corporation own and maintain its own transmitters. </PARA>
<PARA> The subject of transmitter sites and equipment on those sites is rather complex . In many cases, transmitter sites are owned by the Commonwealth and contain facilities such as towers, aerials and buildings which are shared by private organisations and other Commonwealth authorities. In other cases, ABC transmitters are on land which is owned by a private organisation or another Commonwealth authority, with sharing arrangements for the use of some facilities for ABC purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Without pursuing a technical explanation of reasons for particular clauses of the Bill, I might just say that the purpose of these provisions is to vest in the Corporation the ownership and maintenance responsibility for transmitters which provide the Corporation services, with the Minister remaining responsible for the provision and maintenance of associated facilities on Commonwealth-owned transmitting sites which also provide services to other organisations. Where a Commonwealth transmitting site is used and will continue to be used solely to provide services of the ABC, the Minister may take action to transfer ownership of such sites to the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar principles are embodied in clause 77, dealing with the use by the Corporation of satellite systems. An earth station accessing the satellite system may serve the needs of several Commonwealth authorities and/or other organisations. In such cases, the Bill provides that the Minister may provide a satellite earth station for use in connection with the operation of a transmitter of the Corporation. In other cases, the Corporation is responsible for providing, operating and maintaining satellite earth stations required to provide its broadcasting and television services. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the Corporation shares with other users facilities provided by the Commonwealth, the Bill requires, in sub-clauses 76 (7) and 77 (3), that the Corporation pay to the Commonwealth the cost of operating and maintaining the facilities used by the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 79 to 102, which comprise Part VIII of the Bill, concern the investigation of certain complaints about programs of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 80 establishes the Office of Commissioner for Complaints, with functions to investigate written complaints that a broadcasting or television program of the Corporation was inaccurate, unfair or biased; that there was an unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of a person in obtaining material for that program; that the program constituted an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a person; or that the program was otherwise offensive. </PARA>
<PARA> By clauses 87 and 88 the Commissioner is appointed by the Governor-General and holds office for such period not exceeding five years, as is specified in the instrument of appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner is not required to investigate a complaint if he considers that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or was not made in good faith; or that the complainant does not have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the complaint. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 82 details certain procedural matters in relation to investigations by the Commissioner, and clause 83 sets out the powers of the Commissioner to require a person to furnish information or to produce documents and other records. By clause 84 the Commissioner may examine witnesses on oath or affirmation, and clause 85 empowers the Commissioner or a person authorised by him to enter premises of the Corporation for the purposes of this Part. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Commonwealth Ombudsman may refer to the Commissioner program complaints received by the Ombudsman, clause 97 provides that nothing in this Part of the Bill affects the Ombudsman's powers under the Ombudsman Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention of these provisions is to relieve some of the pressures on the Commonwealth Ombudsman by providing an alternative authority to investigate, in the first instance at least, complaints about programs of the ABC. The Government believes also that the creation of a statutory office with a specific authority to investigate such complaints will increase the community accountability of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 106 extends the membership of the Joint Consultative Committee, as now specified in the Broadcasting and Television Act, to include representatives of staff associations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 107 permits the Corporation Board to make rules on a range of matters. Its principal application will be in relation to issues concerning employment in the service of the Corporation, which are now required to be prescribed by Regulations under the Broadcasting and Television Act. Sections 48, 49 and 50 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 apply to such rules. All Rules would be required to be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament and would be subject to disallowance by either House. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I have attempted to traverse in this speech only those clauses of the Bill in which I considered Honourable Senators would have a particular interest. The Bill is somewhat complex. It deals not only with the restructuring of one of the most important Commonwealth authorities, and defines its new functions, powers and responsibilities, but it also modernises legislation relating to the service of the Corporation and details the arrangements relating to the technical services required by the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am one of the vast majority of Australians who has been informed and entertained by ABC programs over the years. I believe that we all cherish, in our own ways, the ABC as an institution. We criticise it sometimes because, as it is a public authority, we believe we have a right to do so. Much of the criticism is unreasonable, but I imagine that those who have long work associations with the ABC have come to live with this. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this Bill will provide the means for the ABC to take up its challenge with a new vigour and purpose. Any uncertainties about its Charter, its responsibilities and its powers would be resolved. I am in no doubt that those who serve the ABC will employ their vast talents to ensure that the ABC sets standards of excellence which others will find it hard to emulate. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> As its title suggests, this Bill is complementary to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Bill 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The purposes of the Bill are to establish arrangements for the transfer of assets, rights, liabilities and staff of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and to amend provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 and other legislation as a consequence of the establishment of the new Corporation to replace the former Australian Broadcasting Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will come into effect on the day fixed by proclamation for the commencement of those provisions of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Bill which establish the Corporation, specify its Charter and define the duties of the Board of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> By clause 6, the Chairman, Vice Chairman and other Commissioners of the Australian Broadcasting Commission cease to hold office on the date on which the Bill comes into effect, but the corporate identity of the former Commission is preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 8, the powers, rights, liabilities or obligations of the former Commission continue in respect of the new Corporation. Clause 9 is the saving provision for legal or other proceedings instituted by or against the former Commission while clause 9 (2) preserves any investigations being undertaken or proposed to be undertaken by the Commonwealth Ombudsman under the Ombudsman Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11 continues the employment of officers or temporary employees of the former Commission as officers or temporary employees of the new Corporation. Sub -clause 11 (5) protects the rights of the General Manager of the Commission, in the event that he is not appointed as Managing Director of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 continues in the Corporation those positions which existed in the Service of the former Commission, and Clause 13 deals with provisional promotions which have not been confirmed before the new legislation becomes effective. </PARA>
<PARA> The next major provisions of the Bill are in clause 20 which concerns the transfer to the Service of the Corporation, of officers and employees of the Telecommunications Commission who have functional responsibilities for the maintenance of transmitters of the national broadcasting and television services . </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-clause 20 (2) provides that the Chief General Manager of the Telecommunications Commission and the Managing Director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation may declare, by notice published in the Gazette, that work or class of work previously performed under the control of the Telecommunications Commission will, on a specified date, be performed under the control of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Before publication of such a notice, sub-clause 20 (3) authorises the Chief General Manager of the Telecommunications Commission to notify an officer or employee who is engaged in work to be subject of such a notification, that the officer or temporary employee may elect to be transferred to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Where officers or employees of the Telecommunications Commission elect to transfer to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Service, sub-clauses 5 and 6 ensure their rights of appointment to positions within the new Service without loss of salary and generally to preserve leave and other entitlements which they had accrued as officers or employees of the Telecommunications Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III of the Bill is concerned with consequential amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942. </PARA>
<PARA> By clause 24, the Broadcasting Tribunal is required to include in its annual report particulars of television programs for children which the Corporation referred to the Tribunal for classification under section 30 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certain provisions in the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 which now apply to both the ABC and the Special Broadcasting Service.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill (No. 2) 1982 is another of those now familiar omnibus Bills. It is bigger and more detailed than even the last one, which we debated on 21 April of this year. This measure has 280 clauses. The last measure had 237. It also has 12 schedules , amending a total of 75 Acts. Last time 39 Acts were involved. Also it affects some 17 ministerial portfolios. Size of that kind is no problem in itself but does make the task of eternal vigilance that much more difficult. We have seen too often important substantive amendments tucked away in such Bills as this. We have seen that too often to enable us to take such a Bill as this simply on trust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me recite again a little homily on the subject in the hope that repetition will finally produce results. The Opposition requests a number of things in regard to these kinds of Bills; first, that they contain no matters other than those which genuinely deal with tidying up, correction and updating, or routine administrative changes. Only matters of that kind should be included in a miscellaneous amendments Bill. Secondly, we ask that the program of reprinting Commonwealth Acts be speeded up to ensure that these amendments will be more quickly incorporated in parent Acts, which are used by members of the Parliament , the legal profession and the public. Thirdly, we request specifically that no amendments be made therein to the legislation constituting the co-operative companies and securities scheme. This Bill does include some amendments of the Companies Act and the Companies and Securities (Interpretation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, as did the previous measure, in April. </PARA>
<PARA> We take the view that it must be possible for such amendments to be contained in a separate Bill, which would make significantly easier the already enormously difficult task of lawyers, company secretaries and others in the community of trying to keep up with this already inordinately messy companies and securities legislation. Having recited that little homily for the second time in six months , might I now make clear that the Bill is not opposed by the Opposition, which has scrutinised it as it was best able, having in mind that 17 different shadow Ministers must look at their respective parts of it. We have come to the conclusion that it contains no controversial or noisome provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I believe one or two matters deserve a quick comment. I refer first to Part XII of the Bill which contains proposed amendments of the Banking Act. As the second reading speech indicates these amendments are designed to facilitate the two bank mergers which were approved by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in 1980-81 , namely that of the Bank of New South Wales and the Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd and that of the National Bank and the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd. We do not object to these amendments, providing as they do just for administrative simplicity in a whole range of matters where there would otherwise be confusion, delay and consequent complex reorganisation upon the mergers taking effect. Of course, any such confusion or delay would affect employees and customers of the banks. We do not want to see that happening. But we take the opportunity briefly to remind the Parliament and anyone else who might conceivably be interested of the Opposition's serious concern about these mergers, as spelt out in detail by the shadow Treasurer, Mr Willis, in the House of Representatives on 27 May 1981. In particular, we have expressed our concern about the undue concentration of economic power which is a product of these mergers; also, the reduction in competition, the other side of that coin, not only in banking but also in the finance industry as a whole, which flows from what is, after all, a reduction by one-third from six to four, in the number of major trading banks. We have also expressed concern about the possible loss of employment in the industry as a result of the mergers, none of which questions were adequately answered by the Treasurer, then or subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter, to which I refer briefly, is the Acts Interpretation Act amendments, to be found in Part VI of the Bill. Firstly, there is a revision of the definition of 'department'. It is a small change but one which makes manifest good sense so far as the streamlining of legislation is concerned and the facilitation of administrative rearrangements in existing departments and those that have particular subject matters within their jurisdiction-not that the Opposition necessarily believes that there ought to be quite such a constant parade of administrative arrangements as has been a phenomenon of this Government and, admittedly, the Labor Government of 1972 to 1975. To the extent that it becomes necessary to make those rearrangements from time to time, it is manifestly convenient that legislation not have to be altered to reflect such changes. </PARA>
<PARA> More interestingly, perhaps, there are in the context of the Acts Interpretation Act amendments to a number of specific Acts to bring them into line with sections 48 to 50 of the Acts Interpretation Act. This involves the continuing process of implementing the 1981 recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances relating to the treatment of subordinate legislation and the application of disallowance procedures on a uniform basis. This progressive bringing into line of other legislation with these desirable procedural changes in an entirely legitimate function to be accomplished by an Act of this kind and we record our satisfaction at seeing it incorporated in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, which is also the subject of some attention, we simply reiterate the point that we have made on a number of occasions-that we do not want ever our assent to changes to that legislation to be taken as in any way representing a resiling by the Opposition from what remains our implacable opposition to the so-called off-shore settlement and to the abdication of Commonwealth sovereignty over coastal waters and the seabed which was involved in that settlement. That is a position which I, for one, spelt out in the Senate on 27 May 1982. Perhaps it is desirable to reiterate it now. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to comment on one final matter. It is not about something which is in the Bill but about something which is not in the Bill-an amendment to reinstate all or part of section 85E of the Crimes Act which was repealed by the Crimes Amendment Act. The details of this matter are not important and do not need to be retailed here because they were raised in the hearings of Estimates Committee A last Monday, 13 September as recorded at page 285 of the Hansard. What was involved here was the apparently inadvertent repeal of some quite convenient provisions in the Crimes Act, making it possible for matter arising in one State to be dealt with by court procedures in another. On the evidence available to me it has certainly caused a lot of inconvenience to the prosecution and to the defence in a number of matters. Perhaps not in every matter has that been the case and there may be some balancing out to be done but there is obviously a case for at least making possible by consent the hearing and determination of matters in another State from that in which they arose. It is to be hoped that this correction to the legislation will be quickly reaccomplished. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular point I make in this context is that that is the kind of measure that would have been appropriate to put into again a miscellaneous amendments Bill of this kind and it does appear that as a result of some dilatoriness on the part of the Attorney-General's Department the bus was missed on this occasion and will not be caught again until something like April next year when the next round of miscellaneous amendments is with us. That is an unhappy state of affairs and one that demands some comment. Whether it justifies the Commonwealth trying to bring in a separate Crimes Amendment Bill is something I do not pursue at this stage but if it appears that the inconvenience of this legislation is mounting then perhaps that course will be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not necessary or desirable to say anything more in the context of this Bill, being the rag bag that it is, except to reiterate with some strength of feeling, for the benefit at least of those officers present if not for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), the points I was making about the proper content of this kind of legislation. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise three matters in relation to the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill (No. 2). I acknowledge that it is a Bill which is essentially of an omnibus type. I make an appeal to the Government or to the draftsmen of this type of legislation that when so many amendments are required perhaps we could be given a page reference. That would certainly have expedited the location of a number of the matters under consideration today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recognising that this Bill is an omnibus Bill of a non-controversial nature, I want to introduce a matter of minor conjecture in relation to the Audit Act. I refer to page 2 of the explanatory notes which accompany the Bill. Section 82B of the Audit Act 1901 restricts the investment of moneys standing to the credit of the trust fund maintained under Part IX of the Act to Commonwealth and State securities, deposits in a bank and the purchase of coinage. Part VII of the Bill amends section 62B of the Act so as to provide wider avenues of investment of such moneys. That is the emphasis I wish to make and to speak about tonight. The amendments will permit investment in securities issued by the Commonwealth Government on loans to authorised dealers in the official money market in certificates of deposit and in clean bills of exchange. Also, the Minister for Finance will be empowered to approve other suitable forms of investment. Section 62B (1) of the Audit Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> Moneys standing to the credit of the Trust Fund-</PARA>
<PARA>We are talking only about trust funds-</PARA>
<PARA>may be invested by the Treasurer-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in any securities of, or guaranteed by, the Government of the Commonwealth or of a State-</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, trustee authorised securities-</PARA>
<PARA> (b) on a deposit in a bank; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) in the purchase of metal for coinage. </PARA>
<PARA>What we are really doing at the moment is allowing these trust fund managers to go out into the commercial world and to ignore the guaranteed investments as stipulated in section 82B of the Audit Act-in other words, the lower interest component area-so they can now invest money in the money market. I am a little concerned about this because these trust fund managers or the managers of organisations of the Commonwealth will tend to place an undue emphasis on the yield of the investment. We know traditionally that the yield of the investment which is contemplated will be very much lower than the yield on the trust fund investment account, so there will be the inevitability that managers will delay as long as possible making the original investment and secure as high a rate of interest as possible to maximise their income derived while these funds are on deposit. There will be a tendency to delay projects rather than to expedite them , to put the money which the Parliament or the authorities approve into the particular project as early as possible. Unfortunately, in many people's minds this will tend to be delayed because they will be trying to maximise the interest rate. The consequence, if we are not careful, could be an increased cost of the overall investment. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter of some concern because after all, these funds and traditional areas in which these moneys were invested have a lower rate of interest. If these trust funds are not invested in, where will they get their funds from? It is a demand and supply situation. They will have to go out into the market more and raise their interest rate, which means that the rates on Commonwealth bonds will be edged up because these moneys will no longer be available from traditional trust fund sources. Moneys from these sources amount to many millions of dollars each year. So we will find that the Government will have to edge up its rate of return on Commonwealth securities because the funds which have traditionally flowed from trust fund sources will now be diverted elsewhere into the commercial market. This can have many consequences because it will raise the yield and return on Commonwealth securities simply because of the demand and supply situation. I believe there will be a tendency on the part of project managers to delay certain projects because the yield on the investment will be lower than the yield on the temporary moneys invested for a particular time. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that the moneys invested in Commonwealth securities are used for particular purposes. Therefore, the cost of servicing governments will tend to rise. At the end of the day, when all the arithmetic is done, I wonder whether we shall be any better off as a result of this. There is the other fact that there is the risk involved. Having authorised dealers in the money market increases the risk. It increases the flexibility, admittedly. But I just wonder whether, as a government, we should be directing these funds outside our own activities into the commercial area. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that I wish to raise concerns the changes to the Banking Act 1959. It has taken a long time to bring about these sorts of changes. I just wonder whether this Bill is the proper Bill to implement these sorts of changes. I remember speaking of concerns as long ago as the failure of the Bank of Adelaide. I said at that time that maybe that was the time to give a foreign bank an opportunity to come in in partnership with an Australian bank to test the waters and to provide this so-called extra capital from overseas. But no, the authorities at the time believed that it should be absorbed within the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. But because of tremendous pressures from overseas banks, we are now giving serious consideration to opening up the Australian banking system to immense foreign competition, giving licences to banks from the United States, Japan, Britain and other centres. </PARA>
<PARA> What will this do to the Australian banking system? It will be forced out of those areas in which it is least profitable, reducing services to customers. I issue a warning that there are some international banks whose financial stability is very much at risk at present. I warn the Government that before it opens up the banking system, taking into consideration all of my other reservations, it should not allow some banks, and certainly some of those with big American names, to come into Australia unless we check their financial stability very carefully. We do not want Australia to be caught up in a world crash. Some of those banks are just so large that if they fail the ramifications around the world will be horrendous. They are bigger than many of the developed countries' economies. Their failure would cause ramifications. If they have major offices situated in Australia, Australian financial institutions and the Australian economy will suffer greatly as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> My final point concerns the change in the Public Accounts Committee Act. This is referred to on page 57. The proposal is to approve of the Public Accounts Committee forming sectional committees. We have to recognise that the PAC is the most active committee in the Parliament. Because of the number of references before it, it has seen fit to divide its activities into a number of sectional committees. For that reason, and in order to safeguard its workings, some changes have to be introduced to stipulate certain quorums. These are outlined on page 57 of the Bill. I believe that the breaking down of the Committee into sectional committees has enabled the PAC to continue its work in an efficient manner. I do not believe that the lessening of numbers has reduced the efficiency of the Committee. I commend its work to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill, but with those minor reservations. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) has a knowledge of accounting. I also endorse Senator Evans's concern about company law matters being included in a Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill. I commend the Bill, with those reservations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my custom to speak on the adjournment, Mr President, as you are well aware, but I rise on this occasion to respond to some comments made by Senator McLaren last week concerning the activities of the Tonkin Liberal Government in South Australia since it took office in 1979. I informed Senator McLaren that I would be speaking; unfortunately, he is not able to be present. However, this line of argument has been pursued by Senator McLaren over the three years since the Tonkin Government assumed office in South Australia. Last week, on 16 September, Senator McLaren stated, as reported at page 1025 of Hansard:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a government in South Australia which was elected on a promise, among others, to stop the job rot and to get industry on its feet. Its claim at the time, that industry was lagging in South Australia under the then Labor Government, has been proved to be untrue by what has happened in the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that this claim cannot be supported by fact. Therefore, I regard it as an attempt to prop up the Australian Labor Party Opposition in South Australia. I want to record some of the facts concerning the performance of the Tonkin Government during its reign in South Australia. I do so under two headings: Firstly, investment and, secondly, employment. Since the election of the South Australian Liberal Government over $3 billion has been spent in that State by companies investing in projects or conducting feasibility studies. Those projects were identified in a publication that was produced earlier this year in South Australia under the heading 'Major Manufacturing Projects: Announced, Commenced or Completed since October 1979'. </PARA>
<PARA> Between October 1979 and June 1982 a total of 94 companies committed $1,705.9m to projects and another $1,336.5m was spent on feasibility studies. Some 88 firms invested in 117 projects and nine companies were carrying out 14 feasibility studies. Four companies are involved in both committed projects and feasibility studies. Of the 117 committed projects the majority involve investment of over $1m. I have a list which indicates that 22 projects are valued at between $100,000 and $500,000; 23 between $500,000 and $1m; 58 between $1m and $10m; 12 between $10m and $100m and two of $100m or over. The majority of feasibility studies also involve investment of over $1m. There is one study which involves investment of between $500 and $1m; five between $1m and $10m; five between $10m and $100m; and three of $100m or over. These successes are supported by facts. They compare more than favourably with the industries which either left South Australia or scaled down their operations during the period the Dunstan and Corcoran Labor governments were in office. One area that Dunstan did try to develop and attract investment to was the uranium enrichment industry . He was leading the field there-I pay him that compliment-until the left wing of the Labor Party disagreed with him. That stopped the initiative which was being displayed at that time in South Australia and which could have created jobs and attracted investment. I hope that those jobs and that investment will result but left wing influence spelled the end of Mr Dunstan as Premier of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the heading of employment. In this area South Australia has performed above average when compared with other States. Between August 1979 and July 1982 South Australia's work force increased by 6,200. In other words, the Tonkin Liberal Government had created 6,200 jobs. What happened under the previous Administration? Between August 1977 and August 1979, 20,000 jobs were lost to South Australia. The present Liberal Government has done all in its power to reverse the trend that was set in motion in those days. There are now more people employed in South Australia than there were three years ago. It is significant also that unemployment has grown at a lower rate in South Australia than in any other Australian State. Between August 1981 and August 1982 unemployment in South Australia increased by 4.1 per cent compared with the national average of 21.7 per cent. In other words, the State recorded an increase of less than one-fifth of the national average. Of course, the highest unemployment figures were recorded in New South Wales under a Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Tonkin Government has performed well in the face of a world-wide economic downturn and local stumbling blocks that have been put in its way. These local stumbling blocks include the Australian Labor Party and Australian Democrats members of the South Australian Legislative Council. These members voted to oppose the Roxby Downs project. In the words of Norm Foster, a former Labor councillor, they voted against employment. A recent independent survey has given an indication of the employment prospects of the Olympic Dam project. This study, which was conducted by research people at the Monash University, stated that some 13,800 jobs would result from this project and possibly this number could increase to 18,600. In spite of those reports and the prospects for South Australia the Opposition in the Legislative Council opposed that measure. I think that is a great pity. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the claims that have been made that the Tonkin Government has not stopped the job rot which was started by the Dunstan and Corcoran governments and that it has not succeeded in attracting industry, I believe, are totally false. These assertions are not supported by facts. The real problems faced by potential investors in South Australia and in job creation were caused by the Labor Party when in government. Under the Labor Party employment fell by 20,000 over two years and there was a flight of capital from South Australia. It is fitting to remind people of these facts in the few months leading up to the next State election. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr Houghton has in his passport what is known as an A type entry permit. This allows him to remain in Australia as a permanent resident.

Should he leave and return without a return endorsement, a number of enquiries may be made to establish his bona fides with a view to determining his status and entitlement to re-enter Australia (see answer to question 2040 (2)).

My Department considers that pensioners and beneficiaries' needs can be met by the issuing of emergency cheques in hardship situations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of the memorandum in question. It was sent to Mr R. Kennedy who was the financial controller of the Australian Dairy Corporation (ADC) by the then Chairman, Mr A. A. S. Webster. It first came to my attention when I received the Auditor-General's report on rebates paid on skim milk powder sales to the Philippines Company, Holland Milk Products Inc, in April this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The ADC has advised that the complete memorandum reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Philippines</PARA>
<PARA> Shipment of skim milk powder consigned to HOMPI, Philippines, invoiced on and after 1st June through to 30th September, 1976, on which the $25 per tonne commission is payable should be debited against the ADI/ADC Corporation share of the account currently held in Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA> With effect from 1st October an accrual of 3.75% on the net invoiced value is payuable to HOMPI and debitable to the same account.</PARA>
<PARA> The ADC has also indicated that neither of these instructions were implemented at the time.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department has advised that relevant files relating to the period in question have been examined in detail and that there is no evidence that a copy of the memorandum was supplied to the Department at about the time it was written. The Department first became aware of the memorandum in April 1982 from its examination of the Auditor-General's report referred to above.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no record of a copy being supplied to the Minister prior to April 1982 other than in the Auditor-General's report of April 1982 referred to above and in subsequent comments provided by the ADC.</PARA>
