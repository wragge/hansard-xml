<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Leader of the Government in the Senate to the fact that in recent times there have been numerous references to Australia suffering a recession. More recently the word 'depression' has been used in respect of the current economic difficulties. Can the Minister say at what point a recession becomes a depression so far as the Government's analysis is concerned?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="921" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware that the Government has referred to recession in Australia. On the contrary, the Government has said that the world outside has suffered recessive tendencies arising out of the last nine years, particularly from the quadrupling of the oil price. The Government has pointed out that because of oil prices inflation occurred in other countries, the use of their foreign exchange was directed more and more towards buying oil, and therefore there was a shrinkage of trade and a recession occurred. That recession brought about a stagnant position of almost no growth; but in Australia we-however influenced by the outside world-still experienced real growth. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development considered that we would have a real growth rate this year of something like 3 per cent- that may be a mite high but it is of about that dimension-compared with less than half that figure for other countries. There is, in broad terms, a degree of recessive tendencies throughout the free world outside, resulting in less purchasing of many of our mineral products and, therefore, less of the buoyancy that we would normally have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say that the investment of capital in Australia for manufacturing purposes and for growth industry purposes has continued in strength and, indeed, in the last quarter-the December quarter-was stronger than in the previous year. The outside world believes that Australia will grow quickly. I will make those investment figures available to the honourable senator as they are of considerable interest. Australia cannot resist the outside world. To the extent that trade in the outside world shrinks, that will be reflected upon us. Everybody hopes that the outside world will move out of its recessive characteristics to better things in the months and years ahead. No one can disguise that in Western Europe in particular the unemployment rate is at very serious levels-much greater than in Australia. That must be reflected in the level of recession. Because of this recessive tendency in the outside world there is a depression of wages; wages are being reduced. That creates a problem for Australia in that as wages are reduced and inflation comes down in the outside world, while in Australia wages are increased and inflation can be pressed upwards, our capacity to trade in the future is not as good. But certainly in Australia we are not talking about a depression. The inflow of capital is such as to reinforce the expectation that we will be expanding in the future.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TS7">Senator THOMAS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. It is reported that the Minister for Primary Industry has written to the Western Australian company which is Australia's largest livestock shipper, ordering it to reduce its exports of livestock. Is the report true? Is the Minister aware that the profitability of many livestock owners is almost entirely dependent on that trade and that if livestock exports were substantially reduced many producers would be forced to change to other enterprises? Is he aware that the livestock trade has been successfully managed by exporters and the Western Australian Government for many years and that any further intrusion by the Commonwealth beyond its obvious responsibilities is totally unwarranted?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the very brief report to which the honourable senator referred. I understand there has been some correspondence between the Minister for Primary Industry and the company referred to in the report. I am not aware of the details of the correspondence and will refer the question to Mr Nixon for consideration and reply. I am certainly aware that the livestock trade has been a very important element of the meat trade in Australia over recent years. In the State which Senator Thomas and I represent it has been a very significant market for many producers. My clear understanding is that the Commonwealth has moved in a number of respects to facilitate that trade and to get over some of the difficulties which have arisen with respect to the conflict between the industry and trade unions over the desirability of trade in livestock as against trade in slaughtered meat. I have no doubt that Senator Thomas would support the co-operative efforts which have been entered into between the industry, government and trade unions to get over some of the difficulties in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have little doubt that the Commonwealth will wish to play a constructive role where it can. I note Senator Thomas's concern that there should not be excessive government intervention, which is consistent with the view that he advocates on this and other issues and which in general has the support of the Government. I have no reason to think that any intervention by the Commonwealth would be of the sort which would hamper this trade, but at the same time we have to take into account the real conflicts within the community in Australia about the correct balance between trade in livestock and trade in slaughtered meat.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications. I refer to the installation of private and secure telephone circuits direct from the Prime Minister to ministerial bedrooms around the country. Why was this expensive alternative to the national Telecom Australia network necessary? To help us assess the degree of necessity, can the Minister tell us how many times this year he has received a phone call at his home from the Prime Minister? How many of those calls, if any, were of such a nature that absolute secrecy was required? Is it true that the cost was more than $700,000? To which department or instrumentality is that cost to be attributed? In view of the delays being experienced by Telecom in installing phones for ordinary Australian applicants due to Government decisions affecting Telecom's capital works program, how does he justify this ministerial queue jumping? Finally, if the reports of this amazing decision are to be believed, why are Ministers permitted to speak secretly to the Prime Minister only while they are in bed?</PARA></TALK.START>

I am intrigued by Senator Coates' s apparent knowledge of the furniture that exists in my bedroom or the bedroom of any other Minister. The fact is that Senator Coates is wrong again. There is no secure telephone at all in my home; much less is there one in my bedroom. The answer to this ridiculous question is that since there is no telephone there have been no telephone calls. If the Prime Minister is inserting secure telephones in various places I will get answers for the honourable senator, but if he asks that kind of question he might as well be correct on all the details.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Government will appreciate the good will that has been fostered by Australia in the Middle East countries-for example, Jordan, Egypt and Oman-through the Australian Development Assistance Bureau, State governments , private enterprise and the Australian Government itself by way of assistance with land development, agricultural expertise, et cetera. Bearing this is mind, I ask: Has the Government before it any proposals to cut back funding for projects of assistance commenced in these countries, or will it be the Government's intention to develop further projects and so establish continuing support to these Arab nations which can only bring about further mutual benefits ?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I can comment only on aid that is given to the Middle East through ADAB on behalf of the Austalian Government. At present official development assistance is given to Egypt and Jordan. In Egypt we are providing food aid project assistance, such as the provision of a cold store and travelling assistance, largely in the agricultural sector. In Jordan we are involved in a dry land farming project as well as training aid, again mainly in the agricultural sector. Australia recognises the value of aid of this type to countries such as Egypt and Jordan and considerable good will is generated through the projects involving the two countries. The Government has no intention of withdrawing the levels of support of aid that it is giving. It will be found that we will sustain that support as far as is possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Health been drawn to an article in the British Medical Journal volume 283 headed 'A New Year gift from the BBC to all smokers'? The article describes a series of six 10-minute programs designed to help smokers stop smoking and called 'So You Want to Stop Smoking'. More than two years of work, research and thought has gone into the preparation of the programs. The programs have clear objectives. They are to be aimed at smokers who want to stop smoking, not those who do not. They are to help those people to stop and stay stopped. They are to concentrate on the benefits to be had from stopping smoking rather than on death and disease as the result of continued smoking. These programs have the full backing of the British Medical Association. Will the Minister ask both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Communications whether they will encourage the Australian Broadcasting Commission to negotiate with the British Broadcasting Corporation for the rights to these programs to assist Australians who want to give up smoking? This type of program, I am sure, would be in line with the attitude expressed in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare of which both the Minister representing the Minister for Health and I were members.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Medical Association recently produced a booklet which had to do with alcohol use and alcohol policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the interjection by Senator Robertson. I am surprised that, when we are talking about positive action by medical associations to try to do something to promote health, all he can do is interject in a totally negative and destructive way. There are two interesting things about the BMJ editorial. First of all, the British Broadcasting Corporation is taking a lead in an area where useful social policy is to be made and where constructive action is to be endorsed. Secondly, it has been directed very much at the benefits which are likely to flow to individuals and to the community. Both of those are positive and useful matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked whether there was any likelihood that the ABC might approach the BBC for the use of the programs in this country. That would be a management decision for the ABC and is entirely within its authority. I undertake to have the suggestion passed on to the Australian Broadcasting Commission for its consideration. One thing I noticed in the editorial was that, in promoting its programs, the BBC, amongst other things, was actually advertising on the British commercial radio stations about its programs and about what it was offering. I think that is a most interesting and innovative step by the BBC as well.</PARA>

The New South Wales Labor senator who interjected that I do not have that information at my fingertips, I think, is by definition right. I doubt that the cost of these power difficulties will ever be capable of the sort of precise assessment that Senator Lajovic quite properly and understandably would like to see. I find it very puzzling that the Labor Party speaks with so many different voices on this matter. Each time the question of the New South Wales power problems and industrial problems comes up I am faced with a barrage of interjections which seem to suggest that there is something peculiar about these matters being raised in this place. I contrast the attitude of the Opposition in the Senate with the attitude of the New South Wales Premier who seems to be saying some very harsh things to the New South Wales power workers, including that some of them seem to have declared war on their work mates in New South Wales.

It is the oldest story in the book and again I have been misquoted by the honourable senator in his so-called point of order. The fact is that there is a quite extraordinary lack of consistency on the part of the Labor Party in this matter. In New South Wales it desperately tries, through its National President, to get out of the responsibility for the situation by blaming the trade unions, and in here it then accuses us of union bashing. I suggest that it ought to try to get its act together and decide, as a party, whether the unions are at fault in this matter in New South Wales. If they are not, it would suggest that perhaps Mr Wran and his Government are at fault.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although it will never be possible to calculate the cost to New South Wales of either the Labor Government or the trade union movement, let me say that people in industry certainly have estimated that there could be a loss of $60 or $70 a day to New South Wales workers if this zoning starts. But let me quote another authority who might have some support in this place from the honourable senator opposite who has come from the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia. Mr Joe Thompson of that union warned that zoning would have disastrous consequences for New South Wales. He pointed out that these power workers in dispute should remember that a lot of their fellow unionists are going to suffer if zoning is introduced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Amongst the many energy conservation matters that I study is, of course, the question of how to reduce the level of freight rates throughout the world. Freight costs, particularly the cost of bunker fuel, are a very serious burden to not only Australia but also countries to which we export. Considerable study and research is going on into all aspects of this matter. For example, I refer to the conversion to coal fired ships with more sophisticated methods of pulverised coal injection. I have noted the proposed use of sailing ships in a more sophisticated form. I will get further information on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the precise questions, the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council, the body advising us on research, has the opportunity to put these various matters under study. I will direct the content of the question to both NERDDC and the Minister for Transport. If what we are aiming to do, apart from saving oil, is to get freight costs down-I do not say this in any aggressive sense at all-the biggest shipping cost today in Australia is the degree of industrial disputes and port congestion that costs, in demurrage charges alone, about $1.5m a day. The fact is that in New South Wales, because of the inability to handle ships and the congestion, rationing is being carried out on the use of ports by ships.

The publication states that many imbalances and discriminations exist against small business and in favour of large business in such areas as taxation, superannuation and finance. It calls for an urgent and full inquiry into small business in Australia. Recognising the critical importance of small business, which is estimated to employ about 28 per cent of the total Australian work force, to the economic and social well-being of this country, what is the Government's attitude to the claims of the Council and, in particular, its call for a full inquiry?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is aware also that its underlying theme is that small business deserves additional support and assistance. The Government does not agree with that part of the book which suggests that there should be some form of public inquiry in this area, although it certainly does agree with some of the points made by the honourable senator in his question about the importance of small business, with respect to both the creation and maintenance of employment and, I think, the maintenance of the sort of society that Australia has. Far from discriminating against small business, the Government points to measures which it has introduced and which do assist small business in the financial and taxation areas and in management assistance programs. It is the view of the Government that small business requires less government intervention. Indeed, it is often the complaint of small business that there is far too much government interference in its activities. The Government will be looking to trying to lessen that burden on small business.</PARA></TALK.START>

In view of Mr Hawke's amazing admission in relation to our domestic industrial relations situation, does not the Minister feel that our Government must come to grips with the militant unions and union leaders and act to combat the effects which daily stoppages all over our nation are having, not only on our reputation as a reliable trading partner but also on the morale and work ethic of the Australian people?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I sometimes get the feeling that everyone in Australia is worried about militant unions except the Opposition in the Senate. Members of the Opposition always seem to be frightfully exercised whenever anyone mentions the words 'trade union'. The concern which has been reported as being that of Mr Hawke reflects the sort of concern to which I referred earlier in Question Time. The Labor Premier and the President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Neville Wran, has expressed a similar concern. I think there was a suggestion by one very prominent Labor man that there was a touch of madness in industrial relations in New South Wales. I find it very puzzling that prominent members of the Opposition always seem so intent on making representations in favour of militant unionism in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are either before the Parliament or about to come before the Parliament a number of items of legislation which I think will do something to assist the position which is concerning Senator Bjelke-Petersen. I do not think I should canvass during Question Time matters which were debated in the Senate yesterday and which will be up for debate I think next week. One measure before us has something to do with this question. A far more important matter is to come before the Parliament though; that is, the legislation which is to be introduced by the Minister for Industrial Relations and which has been the subject also of some debate in the Senate. Whatever can be done by government, whatever can be done by employers, the fact remains that sensible industrial relations require sensible behaviour by government, employers and trade unions. I hope that those scattered elements of the Labor movement that can be heard raising their voices in favour of reason will be listened to rather than the members of the Opposition who seem quite intent on preserving the most lunatic aspects of union behaviour in this community. The Government will do what it can. But it is also important that trade unions and individual trade unionists do what they can to ensure that we have industrial sanity in Australia.</PARA>

Yellowcake, if consumed, is poisonous. It is a toxic substance but it has a very low level of radioactivity. I have said repeatedly in this place that, nevertheless, whatever the degree of radioactivity one should not involuntarily expose the public to it. But I am advised by the experts that the temporary proximity of people to quantities of yellowcake is not in itself harmful. One would have to be in that position for a very lengthy period to suffer any basic harm. Yellowcake is regarded by the International Atomic Energy Agency and by all scientific advisers as a material of low radioactivity. Of course, we safeguard it for a number of reasons. Under the safeguards agreement the movement of yellowcake needs to be monitored so that it cannot be used for improper purposes. Equally, one would not want, however involuntarily, to expose people to yellowcake for any lengthy period.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just been advised that the New South Wales Premier has apparently said in the New South Wales Parliament that any reduction in the allocation to New South Wales from the Snowy scheme is a political move by the Federal Government and has nothing to do with water levels. I must make the situation very clear. The Snowy Mountains Council is under Federal-State control. The Council comprises eight persons: The chairman, being the Deputy Secretary of my Department; the deputy chairman, from the Commonwealth Department of Housing and Construction; two very senior members of the New South Wales Public Service-Mr Frank Brady, who is the chairman of the New South Wales Electricity Commission and Mr Cunneen, the very distinguished leader of the New South Wales Water Resources Commission; two representatives from Victoria; and two representatives from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. They are high public servants of great and impeccable objectivity. They are doing their job under the legislation. They have not received any kind of political instruction from me. Of course, the New South Wales representatives would be the first to complain if that were not the case. I have said publicly that the Snowy Mountains Council should do everything within its power to provide the maximum amount of electric power to New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without qualification I reject the nonsense which has been suggested. There is absolutely no politics in this, except the sensible politics of wanting to help to the maximum that one can. The situation is-this is the advice from the Council-that there is a simple physical limitation due to the extensive demands made on the Snowy scheme by New South Wales over the past few months. There simply is no further water available beyond that which can be brought from replenishment dams and the rate of replenishment is such that production can be no more than between 22 and 24 gigawatt hours a day. The Snowy scheme has been performing consistently to its designed capacity. The major reason for the present limitations is that it is being used to support base load electricity in New South Wales instead of the peak load shaving which is designed to supply Victoria and New South Wales. The only limitation right now is the availability of water. It remains true that the Snowy Mountains scheme has, over the past few months, produced 40 per cent more electricity than it was originally planned to produce.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I am giving a paraphrase of their words. It is part of a note on a number of things. They advised me that consumption in the last 24 hours was 36 gigawatt hours of which Victoria took approximately four. It is not known what Victoria's draw-down is likely to be today but it will almost certainly be four gigawatt hours or less. It now appears that the equilibrium rate of power generation from the Snowy will range between 22 and 24 gigawatt hours a day. That is a rate of generation consistent with using the water as quickly as it can be run in the short term storage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will repeat a couple of things. First of all, I correct a statement on the Australian Broadcasting Commission news today that I had said that the Snowy power output would be cut by half. I have never said that. In fact, I have given a figure of about 15 gigawatt hours. Quite clearly, the Authority, through its council, is run by officers from the States and Commonwealth. They are making the decisions as to how much is the capacity. They make that decision within the terms of the Act and the instructions they have to work under. I have given no advice at all, other than to say that they should give New South Wales the maximum amount of electric power that is within their power to provide. That must be made abundantly clear. If a State, through its own purposes, fails to maintain electricity output, the State should look to itself.</PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear that the installed capacity of power stations that exist in New South Wales and are seemingly capable of functioning is 8 300 megawatts. New South Wales could be supplied quite adequately if 70 per cent of that capacity were functioning. For whatever reason-that is a matter for the Wran Government- at the moment less than half the capacity is functioning. The Snowy Mountains and the Victorian electricity authorities have been aiming to top up the New South Wales supply to the maximum they can. They have now reached a stage in the Snowy Mountains when in the next few days there must be a decline simply because of the lack of capacity of water and the enormous draw-down that has occurred in the past. The Wran Government is on record as indicating that it would draw down heavily in summer, noting that it would be discounting its use of water in the winter. That, of course, is its responsibility.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article by Dr Norman Abramson. I agree with Senator Teague that in a matter of this importance and magnitude we want to see a decision made which is efficient and effective and works for the benefit of the whole country. I can advise the Senate that the factors to be taken into account in the selection of frequency bands are and were well understood by the Australian satellite planners. After the frequencies were selected in this country they were considered by internationally respected consultants. The views of those consultants were taken and the recommendations made were supported. They had the support of not only people in Australia but also international consultants who were engaged by this country to report on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The article referred to the White report which dates from four years ago. That report initiated detailed consideration of the requirements of a satellite communications system for Australia. Planning from that point on progressed through public inquiries which clearly identified the needs for Australia. Some of those needs-for example, the need for isolated homesteads to be able to pick up reception from the satellite-are unique. That imposes particular needs. The mission objectives of Australia are thought to be best achieved by the frequencies which have been selected. We have no information which might support the claim that the system will cost, as I think the newspaper article stated, an extra $500m over the next 10 years. If there is any detailed information I hope that Dr Abramson or anyone else will make it available. No contract has yet been let for the Australian satellite system. The Government will shortly consider a submission on implementation of the system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has been keenly aware of the need to preserve the vital industries of Tasmania, particularly the dairy and vegetable growing industries. Indeed, the Government has been taking steps, particularly with the Callaghan report of the Inquiry into the Structure of Industry and the Employment Situation in Tasmania and other reports to try to ensure that there is a development and maintenance of stable employment within Tasmania. The Minister for Primary Industry is very conscious of the needs of Tasmania. He is very sensitive to those needs and very anxious that those kinds of matters should be kept in mind in any negotiations with New Zealand or any other country . I can give that assurance. I will refer the full text of the question to the Minister for Primary Industry and, because it is an important subject, I will see whether he, apart from taking note of it, would like to add further to my answer. I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I inject new matter into this subject. First of all, I have already stated that honourable senators are seeking to put at least more than one question in three days. I am not the only senator who has not achieved that. I have put one question in three days. On a constructive basis I refer this matter to the Minister in charge of Government business. Honourable senators get locked in. I asked a question eight days ago of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, who represents the Minister for Health, about medical services in Great Britain. The Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, was asked a question-I know that she has the briefing paper on the matter-a fortnight ago. I am suggesting that we need constructive effort in order to get over the impasse that we face. If a Minister has an answer to a question asked by a senator three or four days previously he is voluntarily given the time to give the answer at the end of Question Time. That should not mean that the person concerned has to forgo asking questions on other matters that arise in the meantime. I put this as a constructive suggestion. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle has one answer for me. If honourable senators cannot ask questions, of course, they have to resort to speaking during the adjournment debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make another point, more in sorrow than in anger. I think honourable senators will appreciate it. Senator Harradine is here. He will appreciate it. Other senators and I wait patiently to ask a question. If it is good enough for me to be here at the commencement of Question Time it is good enough for other senators. I was irritated when Senator Harradine came in very late and got the call. This is a place for honourable senators to vent their spleen. That is what I am doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to the last of Senator Mulvihill's comments, regarding Senator Harradine. The honourable senator may have observed that Senator Harradine sits regularly in this chamber for Question Time. He is an independent in this place. I keep a record of questions asked and the record clearly shows that Senator Harradine has not asked a question for many days. There is a very valid reason why he was not present in the chamber earlier today . I will not disregard that situation of Senator Harradine, particularly as he is an independent on his own and in view of the fact that he has not been called upon to ask a question for many days. I hope that the honourable senator will accept that answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I have said this before, but I will repeat it: The sooner we improve Question Time, the better. Question Time has now developed into an area of non-interest for honourable senators. It is clearly now necessary for the Standing Orders Committee to have another look at Question Time. I have always resented the fact that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, without seeking leave of the Senate, can bring Question Time to an end. I have argued that this is contrary to the principle upon which this place works . I do not know how the other place works and I am not interested, but this place has always worked on the basis that the Senate itself determines what shall happen. But time and again the Leader of the Government says: 'While I am on my feet I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper'. No leave is sought and the right to deny the Leader of the Government his initiative has been taken away from the Senate. This means, of course, that there is no flexibility at Question Time. Question Time now is debating time. We should apply the rules which are on the back of our question papers: Newspapers cannot be read from, opinions cannot be given and questions cannot be debated, as Senator Chaney debated a question quite fully at one stage of the game.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Questions shall be without notice. Questions shall not be of extraordinary length. Too much information ought not be given. Too much detail ought to necessitate the placing of a question on the Notice Paper. As Senator Mulvihill said, there is a period after Question Time in which detailed questions can be answered. That should be the time for answering long questions seeking details which the Minister would not be able to give unless he had been previously briefed. We had an example of that the other day. When Senator McLaren asked for a paper to be tabled we found that a question had been referred to the department concerned at least a couple of days before the question was asked. That is not a question without notice; that is a question that should have gone on notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have debated this matter time and again. Every time this situation arises in the Senate I will repeat what I am saying until I bore people to the point of doing something about it. It is extraordinary that you, Mr President, have now been forced to take a list of the number of times that honourable senators have asked questions. The point has now been reached, as Senator Mulvihill pointed out, when Senator Harradine can be out of this place for two days, can come in on the third day late in Question Time and, because he has not asked a question, can supersede a number of honourable senators who have sat in the chamber throughout Question Time waiting to ask a question. My view is that he loses his priority position if he is not here from the commencement of Question Time. Otherwise, what is going to happen? I know that I will get a question once a week. So what will I do? If I asked my question on Tuesday and I have more important business elsewhere, I will not turn up to Question Time on Wednesday and Thursday. That is what is happening at Question Time. Instead of this place being packed with every honourable senator seeking to ask a question, we now have scattered attendance. All I am saying indicates that the standard of Question Time has fallen away. I think it is necessary that the Senate, through its Standing Orders Committee, again apply itself to improving Question Time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I undertook that by the end of Question Time I would give Senator Gietzelt some information on his question regarding the potential for growth or recession in Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics preliminary estimate of expected new fixed capital expenditure in selected industries for the six months ending 30 June this year is $8,514.9m. This is for selected industries and does not cover all industries. If the estimate is realised, expenditure by these selected industries for the year ending 30 June 1982 will be $16,528.5m, a rise of 30 per cent over the previous year. This figure compares more than favourably with the 10 per cent to 15 per cent rise mentioned in the Budget. The figures now showing are those of development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to foreign investment in enterprises in Australia, in the December quarter 1981 net inflow of foreign investment amounted to $1,427m, which was 54 per cent higher than in the previous quarter and 39 per cent higher than in the December quarter 1980. The major inflows were from the United Kingdom, $435m; and from Japan $239m. The net inflow of portfolio investment and institutional loans, which was $1,534m, outweighted a net withdrawal of direct investment of $107m. The major inflows were recorded for manufacturing, $448m; finance, property and business services, $334m; and mining $243m. The point I make from these figures is that the investment inflow that is taking place at the moment is encouraging in terms of the development of industry and employment for the year ahead.</PARA>

<PARA> Indeed, Senator Georges of the Labor Party was in Beirut the other day celebrating the seventeenth anniversary of the PLO. His trip, according to the Australian-Israel Review of February of this year,was paid for by the United Palestinian Workers, an Australian affiliate of the PLO. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me make the position clear. Over the past two or three years, I have received invitations from the United Palestinian Workers to go to Lebanon to view for myself the conditions under which the Lebanese and Palestinian people exist. Because I was visiting Europe for another matter towards the end of last year, it was possible for me to go to Lebanon. I accepted an invitation to go there just as many honourable senators accept other invitations from organizations or states, sometimes having their way paid, sometimes not. In this case the Palestinian workers in Melbourne invited me and paid my fares to Lebanon. I took advantage of that invitation to see for myself what prevails in that place. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Coleman made the statement that I was celebrating the seventeenth anniversary of the Palestinian revolution-he used the word 'celebrating'. I celebrated no such thing. No honourable senator would celebrate the cause of the Palestinians entering a state of revolution. I saw nothing there to celebrate. I saw much that concerned me-for example, the conditions under which the Lebanese exist at present. Lebanon is occupied by a variety of forces. The Lebanese have given to the Palestinian people a place of refuge, but in giving that refuge they have brought upon themselves the wrath of the Israelis. Events have brought great devastation to that country. I am not extending my comments beyond giving a personal explanation. The word 'celebrating' is the word to which I object. I went to Lebanon as an observer. Having gone there as an observer, I came away with the clear impression that the rights of the Palestinian people need to be recognised. I state that very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not my intention to raise the matter now but to speak on it when it was raised in the Parliament subsequently. I would then speak clearly to this Parliament of the need to recognise the Palestinian people and to recognise the position in which they and the Lebanese people find themselves. Mr Coleman is trying to create division within the Australian Labor Party and the community by trying to show in some way that we approve of the terrifying way in which the Palestinians, or for that matter the Israelis, react. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As the only South Australian member of the Public Works Committee I would like to make a few comments on the report concerning the proposed works at Adelaide Airport for the introduction of domestic wide-body aircraft. I will try to be as brief as possible. Firstly, I would like to make it clear that I do not oppose the proposal or the basic thrust of the report but I think there are some very important factors which need to be taken into account. Adelaide Airport is unusual in that it is located only a few kilometres from the city centre and is right in the heart of the western suburbs. Many houses and schools are in the direct flight path of the aircraft using the airport and, in some cases, jets pass overhead at heights of less than 200 metres. There are many complaints from residents about noise and structural damage to houses as a direct result of vibrations caused by jet aircraft. There has even been a letter from a school headmaster complaining about the interruptions to lessons caused by the constant barrage of jets and other aircraft between 9.30 a.m. and 3.30 p.m. Many residents have also complained about aircraft, particularly executive jets, operating inside the curfew hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I, unlike some Government members of the Committee, certainly thought the complaints were genuine. Generally, the people making these complaints were sensible, average citizens, many of whom built or purchased their homes long before Adelaide Airport became operational, and certainly before the introduction of jet aircraft. In many cases when these people complained to the Department of Transport they were treated in an off-hand way and their complaints usually fell on deaf ears. Of course, Senator Martyr believes that the Department of Transport has adequately dealt with these complaints from people living in the vicinity of the airport or directly under the flight path. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder whether his views would change if he were the member for that area. I think Senator Martyr's provocative behaviour at the recent public hearing in Adelaide clearly illustrated his insensitivity to the needs of ordinary Australians such as those who live near Adelaide Airport. What better proof is there of the extent of concern in the community than the huge number of letters we have been getting from responsible people living in this area? Surely the fact that people have even bothered to sit down to write a letter is evidence enough of the irritation being inflicted upon them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said earlier, I do not oppose the proposed upgrading of Adelaide Airport for wide-body aircraft but in view of the extent of concern in the community, I believe certain conditions need to be met. Firstly, I believe that tangible and positive steps must be taken now by the Commonwealth and State governments for the construction of a new airport, preferably in a sparsely populated outer area . There has been a lot of talk about this and a lot of bureaucratic bungling but we are still as far away as ever from that decision. Of course, the State and Federal governments have moved with the speed of lightning on the proposed upgrading of facilities for an international terminal in Adelaide-so much so that one could be excused for thinking that an election might be coming up in South Australia. Recently we had the spectacle of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) deliberately side-stepping the Public Works Committee and urging the Government departments concerned to hurry up with the upgrading works which are the subject of this report. However, when it comes to choosing a site for an alternative airport we have nothing but silence from both the State and the Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The second condition which I believe must be met is that the present curfew must be maintained and more rigorously enforced. The operation of small executive jets inside the curfew must be stopped and, similarly, the Trans Australia Airlines Airbus must not be allowed to operate inside the curfew. Finally, I believe that all schools and hospitals in the vicinity of the airport , particularly those in the flight path of the main runway, must have sound- proofing treatment and, where necessary, air conditioning, with the cost to be shared between the State and Federal governments. It is imperative that these conditions be met. I think that they represent a sensible and realistic compromise. I call upon the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) to do everything possible to ensure that these quite reasonable conditions are met. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I realise that Senator Foreman has the obligation to defend his point of view and also his patch, if that is how he would describe it. Senator Foreman has identified me as being provocative. I might be impolite and unco-operative, but I am never provocative. I examined fairly, I thought, the allegations that were made by various people at that inquiry. I am reminded of something that Senator Mulvihill said during the course of Senator Foreman's remarks. I think the implication was that I might not do the same thing in my own patch. I say now that I will do so. When the time comes for the same sort of examination at Perth Airport, if the same sort of allegations are made by much the same sort of people, I certainly shall subject them to the same sort of questioning to which I subjected those who made the allegations in Adelaide. Those allegations may be summed up as follows: That there was psychological damage to those who live under the flight path of the aeroplanes, physiological damage to those who live under the flight path of the aeroplanes and structural damage to homes under the flight path. That is a fair summing up of the allegations. I keep using the word 'allegations' because on my limited examination of the witnesses-it was not really a rigorous examination; it was a fairly limited examination of their allegations-they were not able to produce one bit of substantial evidence to back up those allegations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When people come along to an inquiry and claim that their houses are falling apart, the ceilings are coming down and plaster is falling, one would imagine they would have some sort of professional opinion to back up those allegations. These are very serious matters. Members of parliament who appeared before the inquiry were making the same sort of allegations. If those were serious allegations I would have thought that those members of parliament would have visited the places that were supposed to be falling down and viewed with their own eyes how serious the damage was. I was not able to elicit from any of those members of parliament or anybody else at that inquiry whether that had been done . They produced no substantial evidence at all to back up their allegations. In fact, under examination they indicated that they were not sure about the type of soil on which the houses to which they referred were built. They were not certain about the soil conditions underneath the houses. The cracking could have been done due to the soil or a number of other reasons. No substantial evidence at all was brought before the Committee to back up those most serious allegations about houses falling apart. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to the allegations of physiological damage. These were serious charges about people being made ill as a result of aircraft noise. One would think it would be possible to produce medical certificates or something of substance to substantiate the charges. Again, there were many vague statements about what might have happened in the past, but nothing substantial was brought forward. The allegations of psychological damage were in the same vague area. No substantial evidence was given that people were being affected. We drove around in a bus underneath the flight path and, with aeroplanes flying overhead, people in the street were engaging in ordinary conversation in the normal course of business. They were not the slightest bit affected by the noise. It is not fair to offer in the Senate these comments as serious allegations when they are without substance. I am sorry to have taken so much time but I felt that it was important to clear my part in the inquiry. I cannot see that anything I did was provocative. All I did was to examine the allegations that people made. They were serious allegations and people offered no evidence to back them up. It seems to me that I am fulfilling my function on the Public Works Committee by subjecting anyone who comes before it with such allegations to examination because it is the duty of care that I have to the Committee and also to this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I cannot sit quietly by and listen to the sorts of statements that Senator Martyr has just made. Having attended some time ago the Public Works Committee meeting in Adelaide to consider the upgrading of the airport, I could not sit back idly, after watching the treatment that those attending the meeting had meted out to them by-amongst others-Senator Martyr. He maintains that he is anything but provocative. I was indignant at the treatment that was handed out to those ordinary people who were not tremendously well versed in parliamentary proceedures or what is involved in a Public Works Committee hearing or any other parliamentary committee hearing. They were just ordinary prople who were concerned at what they saw as an invasion of their liberties, rights and privacy. I acknowledge that the majority of people who attended that meeting had been given by the media a false impression of the Committee's role. Nevertheless, putting aside the fact that they were there under a misapprehension, there was no excuse for the sarcastic, rude and frivolous treatment that they were given by Senator Martyr.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point remains that there were many very upset people at that meeting. They were upset not only because they could see in the very near future that a predicament that they had suffered for many years would be made worse but also because they were not being taken seriously enough, in their opinion, by members of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Martyr said that people made a series of allegations and they produced no evidence to support them. I can tell him that the soil around Adelaide Airport is excellent building soil. It is certainly far better building soil than that found in the eastern suburbs of Adelaide or in the hills district. It is rotten soil for growing plants-one cannot grow a carrot-but one can build on that soil a house which does not crack easily. That fact ought to have been ascertained from a soil report which the Committee could have called for. It ought not be encumbent on people complaining about the damage done to their homes by aircraft to provide expensive evidence. Most of those people are pensioners. They are certainly elderly. They have lived in that area for many years, certainly before the airport was built. Why should they have to go to the expense of getting medical evidence to prove that problems they are suffering with their health, whether physiological or psychological, and problems they are having with their homes are not the fault of some other outside interference? One has only to visit a house anywhere in the area from West Beach through to Plympton and around to Richmond to know the effects on windows and on any glassware in cupboards of aircraft flying over the home or anywhere near. It is not just the area around Adelaide Airport that is affected. One of Adelaide's most prestigious suburbs, North Adelaide, suffers the same problems. Senator Foreman mentioned hospitals and schools around the Richmond-Thebarton area. There are hospitals in the North Adelaide area which are affected because they are directly beneath the flight path. </PARA>
<PARA> It would have been encumbent on the Committee to pay a little more serious attention-or at least to appear to be paying it-to the very real problems that are being faced by the people in the area. It certainly seems to those people that this Committee is only whitewashing a decision made by the Government-it may not be-which, we all suspect, is using the upgrading of Adelaide Airport, which will be more expensive than originally anticipated, as an excuse for not building a full international airport somewhere in the north east of Adelaide. With regard to the positioning of the airport, I suggest to Senator Martyr, with the greatest of respect, that there is no comparison between the surrounding residential areas of Perth Airport and Adelaide Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> Adelaide Airport is surrounded by homes a substantial number of which, as I said earlier, were there before the airport was moved into the city from Parafield. If this Government does not do something fairly smartly about setting aside specific land for an international airport on the north-eastern side of Adelaide, that area too will be obliterated by surrounding residential areas and removed from all contention. I suggest, that in view of the increased costs further consideration be given to the upgrading of Adelaide Airport. Because of the increased nuisance value, pain and distress that is likely to be caused to local residents, we should think again about putting international facilities at the existing domestic airport and move expeditiously for a full international airport to be developed for the use of South Australians somewhere outside known developed residential areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I am obliged to enter the debate having regard to the remarks that Senator Haines has made about parliamentary committees and the way in which they deal with members of the general public. This reminds me of the experiences that I have had when we were in government. I was the chairman of some parliamentary committees and also a member of some joint committees of the Parliament which were chaired by other members. I was concerned with the attitude that was taken on some of these occasions when submissions were made by ordinary citizens to parliamentary committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall one particular case where an Opposition member, later a Cabinet Minister, subjected a member of the public to grilling and cross-examination as though the person who was giving the evidence was guilty of some misdemeanour. When I objected, my objection was supported by another member of the Liberal Party who later became a Minister. He too supported the fact that when we are dealing with members of the public they must be given some licence for the way in which they present their evidence. From those experiences it is clear that it is essential for members of the Parliament sitting on parliamentary committees to exercise a great deal of discretion and care in the way in which members of the public are handled when they have a desire to come before a parliamentary committee to present a point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree entirely with the comments that have been made by honourable senators about aircraft noise. I was responsible for convening a large demonstration and conference in the St George and Sutherland area almost 20 years ago about the problems of aircraft noise at Mascot airfield. Arising from that public concern the Australian Government, to its credit, established an aircraft noise committee. A number of us subsequently became members of that committee and played a very important part in attempting to ameliorate the problems of aircraft noise. I have to say again that members of the public do not have to be academics, leading citizens or have any other sorts of attributes in order to feel that they are being disadvantaged by parliamentary and government decisions about these sorts of matters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact of life that aircraft noise-this certainly was my experience in local government-affects people differently. Some people can put up with the noise and some people cannot. Some people have rather hysterical reactions and others have more passive reactions. We are all made up of different types of personalities and characteristics. It is all too easy to have a generalised position about the way people react. Of course, problems still exist at Mascot airfield with aircraft noise. As you know, Mr Deputy President, the problem is still a very live and burning issue in the whole of the region of the southern and eastern suburbs of Sydney. This is the reason why the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, refuses to agree to any further extensions to that airfield. An airport should be placed in some other vicinity of Sydney which is removed from residential and any type of modern development. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that not only people living in houses are affected by aircraft noise. In more recent times, I have read in the local papers of mayors of some of the municipalities finding that churches, schools, convalescent homes and hospitals are also affected. This is a matter of serious public concern. Governments have to be a little more careful about where they place such important public facilities in the future. It is pretty clear that Sydney ought to have a new airport and certainly an international one where traffic can be diverted from Mascot into an area that is, at the moment, unspoiled by residential development . As a result of public concern over the last 20 years Federal governments have been forced to recognise the major problems affecting the amenities and the lifestyles of its citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that where my parents live it is impossible to have a conversation or make a telephone call when flights go over. One can virtually put a stick in the air and touch the undercarriage of the planes as they come down. It is very untenable for citizens to have to constantly put up with that nuisance. It is likely to be increased if the question of the Sydney airport is not resolved. I support the concern of Adelaide residents. Clearly, air travel will not stand still. It will expand and more and more citizens will be affected by it. I suggest that all honourable senators and all members of the national Parliament should be exercising a little more concern about these matters and insist that the impasse that exists about airports be resolved by creating and building new airports far removed from any residential development and far removed from citizens who have to exist side by side with noise factors. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the campaign that we waged back in the 1960s the Government was forced to change flight plans and build runways which ameliorated and considerably improved the position, but there are still thousands of citizens who are affected by the inevitable use of the Mascot airport. I think it is proper that members of the Senate should be expressing their concern in some of the other cities of our Commonwealth where the problem is now perhaps minor to what it will be in the future. I make the point very strongly that State and Commonwealth governments have a major responsibility to resolve this matter which, in many cases, can be resolved only by building airports in different locations. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the main point. We are here as representatives of the citizens. I have heard it said that even the petitions of the citizens ought to be dealt with in a more formal way. I certainly object to that because petitioning is one of the means by which the ordinary person in the community can express his point of view to the Parliament. Committees of the Parliament should go out of their way to create an atmosphere that is conducive to ordinary people, the citizens of our community, feeling that they have a friend in court. They should feel that the committees are interested in their viewpoints. The community does not expect committees merely to produce acoustic reports and reports from organisations, universities or government departments to substantiate and sustain their common reaction to living with noise. If senators and members of the Parliament just do that then they will bring the Parliament into further disrepute with the average citizen. We need to establish closer links with the citizens of this Commonwealth. I hope that the debate has helped to create a better condition in these matters. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Debate has already gone on within the community in part in relation to the recommendations of the Commonwealth Schools Commission for 1983. However, I feel that, on a closer reading of the report, a rather disturbing aspect has not yet been taken note of. I refer the Senate's attention to the general recurrent grants program section. In paragraph 1.1 the Commission makes the point that the Australia-wide average real increase in expenditure was 3 per cent between the 1980-81 and 1981-82 financial years. The Commission goes on to make the point that there have been some reductions in the order of 18,000 in enrolments in government schools. In paragraph 1.3 the Commission makes the point that despite this reduction there are some dislocatory and diseconomic effects of enrolment decline. It cautions that these should not be underestimated. Indeed, the Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA> The evidence before the Commission is that present enrolment declines which are mainly at the primary level do not produce swift or automatic savings and may indeed, in the absence of actual school closures produce higher costs associated with the need to maintain uneconomic class sizes and to phase in the application of staffing formulae which dictate redeployment. They also result in higher per student maintenance costs and more expensive support services. </PARA>
<PARA>Having noted that and having made several other points about the diseconomies the Commission makes a very strong point that, whilst there may be a small decline of the order of 0.8 per cent in enrolment in government schools, that might increase rather than decrease costs. However, if one goes to the Commission's recommendations one reads in paragraph 1.5:</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Commission is recommending a 2 per cent increase in the general recurrent grants for government schools. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst the Commission makes the point that there was previously a 3 per cent real increase in expenditure and that costs may rise, it recommends a 2 per cent increase. It states that this particular recommendation will contribute to improved morale in the government school systems. I find this a rather interesting statement. Certainly, from the discussions that I have had in the weeks since this report was tabled in the House of Representatives I have found that by making recommendations which will not maintain real standards in government schools it has done anything but improve morale in government school systems. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point to which I draw the attention of the Senate relates to the capital grants program on which the Commission in paragraph 2.3 makes the comment that there have been some decreases in government funding, the most obvious one being the reductions in the Loan Council allocations to the States for capital works by nearly 10 per cent in real terms. The Commission makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA> There is not doubt that pressure on capital grants for new student places remains very high, and that many children are being educated in sub-standard facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite this fact, noting that the State governments in particular had decreased their capital works programs, the Commission went on to say on page 8 that it does not see any reason to recommend to the Government that it should make in any way compensatory Commonwealth grants. This is despite the fact that many of our children in Australia are being educated in sub-standard facilities in those schools for which the State and Commonwealth governments have responsibilities. I believe that that is a depressing aspect of this report. Despite the fact that the Schools Commission makes some useful recommendations in relation to non- government schools-these are to be applauded-I believe that its recommendations in relation to the government schools will only increase the concern that is already within the community that the Government through its instrumentality- unfortunately, not an independent instrumentality any longer in terms of its reports-will, indeed, continue to exacerbate that disjunction between private and government school systems. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said here, and I will say on every opportunity, that this is something that this country cannot stand and does not need. It does not need that continual fostering of disharmony between private and government school systems. Both systems will continue in Australia and both have in the past made great contributions to the growth of the country and will do so in the future. At the moment, as the report stands, the recommendations that continually come forward tend to foster that disharmony, to foster acrimonious debate within the community and to foster divisions between private and government schools. We do not need those. The education system does not need them. Private and government schools do not need them. Parents and citizens associations in those school systems do not need them. We need to have those systems working in harmony as they had done until a few years ago. We need to re-establish that climate of good will between those school systems for the benefit of all children in this country. I urge yet again that the Government seek to bring forward policies which will re-establish that harmony within Australia and within our schooling systems. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to confine my remarks to two aspects of the report. I refer to page 56 and the Regularisation of Status Program. It will be noted that rightly the Government gave amnesty to a number of illegal immigrants who surfaced in Australia between 19 June 1980 and 31 December 1980. It is now near the end of the first quarter in 1982. I sympathise with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It is in a squeeze play because of rigid staff ceilings. I think most senators have been confronted with people who have surfaced in this country . I think over 9,000 applications from those people to remain here were processed and only 200 remain to be processed. I think overall they have been a favourable acquisition for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that late last year the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) virtually issued a deadline. He wanted all the difficult cases sent to central office in Canberra for final assessment. We are now into March and this has not happened. The point, I suspect, is that assessment is very difficult in some areas when there is a suggestion of a criminal act. I would be the last to say that persons who are involved in drug running or prostitution machinations should not have the barrier lowered on them and be denied permanent residence. I know of a Spanish applicant who had an altercation 17 years ago with the police in Madrid at the height of the reign of the Franco Government. I would be very suspicious of the provocation of that era and would believe that he had every justification to get into an altercation. I give another example-that of a Bolivian whose name I will not mention. I know that the Bolivian Government is synonomous with the export of cocaine; it is its main source of revenue. Some of the Bolivians whose applications have already been finalised have worked here for eight or nine years in arduous industries and are distinct acquisitions to this country. The Department was fair enough to hint to me that in one case in these last 200 cases there was a suggestion of a drug offence. In my own style of interrogation, I had the chap into my office and he refuted the suggestion. No final decision has been made, but I wonder, on balance, how we adjudicate on an application from someone from a political system in which the police force might make an assessment different from our police force. How do we decide whether that person shall stay?</PARA>
<PARA> We are into the first quarter of 1982 and there is quite a number of these people. I have assured them that they appear to be fairly sure of getting permanent residence, but there are exceptions. I think there was a chap here who was sentenced in Macao to eight years imprisonment for manslaughter and who did not tell us that he had shot through. He has gone back, but that is a rare case. I take this opportunity to make the plea that, even if it means overtime, we finalise the status of these last 200 people. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I want to raise is the delays in granting citizenship. I pay tribute, as I think other New South Wales senators will, to men with the dedication of Mr John Wallace in Sydney. He goes out of his way to try to break the administrative log-jams. I mention this because I received from Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle one long answer about how we were grappling with staff problems, particularly in regard to the granting of citizenship. I do not blame the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, but I have some reservations about the stop and go role of both the New South Wales Police and the Australian Federal Police. Of course, when there is a VIP here they have to man the battlements, but I always believed that they stop in mid-air and that it takes weeks before they pick up the slack. I suppose 99.5 per cent of those who apply for citizenship are as clean as a hound's tooth, but there is no question that the police are a major factor in the delays. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I have to make is not an outright criticism. We know that people move around, and I have heard of cases of people who have asserted that when they changed their address somebody went to the Department's counter in Sydney and said: 'I have moved from Rockdale to Waterloo'. I just wonder whether that information gets back to the citizenship section. Our immigration operations are, I believe, subject to unrealistic staff ceilings and the rigidity of the Department of Finance in its obsession with ensuring that staff incur no overtime. Whether it be in the Department of Social Security, the Department of Veterans' Affairs or the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, we are dealing with the plight of people. I believe the Government could be much more flexible in those departments than it it is in other departments. I do not know what the procedure is for feedback on this information that is put out. I think that Senator Messner is listening intently to what I am saying. I hope that we get feedback about breaking the log-jam of delays in granting citizenship and, secondly, on the Regularisation of Status program. </PARA>

It is a very courageous document because it admits there have been cases in which people have prostituted Australia's refugee policy by being manipulated by the media. The Minister gives a couple of examples which, as I am mindful of the time, I will not reiterate. That is the first point. The second is the admission that some refugees are economically motivated as distinct from being in fear of political persecution in their homelands. I simply say this: I believe that what is lacking is the specifics. At the moment in Europe there is a backlog of refugees fleeing from the situation in Poland. I do not want us to have the problem we had with respect to Vietnamese refugees when people were saying: 'Are you giving priority to people from camps in Malaysia over those in Thailand or Hong Kong?' I raised this matter briefly with Senator Durack the other night. He did not have specific answers. I believe those refugees who face our posts in Europe, whether in Stockholm or Paris, have to be registered in some order so that justice is done. I think the Minister has referred in general terms to Poland and has given an overall figure of about 25,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the United Nations' concept of what we should or should not do about South East Asian refugees, I like to believe that the forgotten continent, Latin America, gets full credit. Senator Primmer and I have been fighting a battle about Uruguayans. We have been waiting a fortnight for a simple lift of 50 politically persecuted Uruguayans who were in a United Nations camp in the Argentine. I feel that we are lagging somewhat there, or perhaps I should say that there should be a more equal distribution. I am mindful of the time and I want other honourable senators to come into the play. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one final point. It concerns an economic problem. When we bring in political refugees we rightly are not rigid about their job skills and their physical qualities. I say that because I know that other honourable senators will agree with me that in another age other migrants' first idea of the lovely Australia was at the end of a jackhammer or shovelling coal into a furnace, when it was not such an easy country to work in. Many of the present political refugees-I have in mind the Vietnamese-have a rather light physique and are arguing whether they can lift particular weights in industry. I suppose that as a trade unionist I am all for the protection of people, but that other migrants did not have those safeguards is well known. </PARA>
<PARA> That gets me back to our tariff policy. If many of these people are to be put into the textile and clothing industry and even the rubber industry where the work is much lighter than that in a foundry, I believe those people who argue that we should lower our tariffs will find that we are in a jam when we face these people. The proof of that assertion is that trade union membership in the textile and clothing and rubber industries has dropped. I leave the matter with those words of wisdom because I know that at least one other senator wants to contribute to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) on the excellent paper that he has presented. It has been favourably received, even by the Opposition spokesman in another place. As one who came to this country as a refugee, I feel that I can say a few things about the Minister's statement. I am one of those 400,000 people who settled in Australia after World War II. I appreciate the humanitarianism of and the action taken by this Government in its in-depth study of the problems of refugees and how to solve them. We all know that the present Minister is one of the best Ministers we have had. He is the most humane. Therefore, I recommend to all honourable senators that they study this statement from the Minister. I particularly like the passages in the statement, as reported at page 991 of the House of Representatives Hansard, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where persons have been classified as refugees, Australia will continue to give priority consideration to those refugees with family in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>This is one of the major points in the Minister's statement. Anyone who has been separated from his or her family knows how important it is that families are united. I commend the Minister and the Government on that matter. I am also very impressed that the Minister in his statement said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided that it will no longer announce individual program ceilings for particular refugee groups. This will enable us to have maximum flexibility in responding to different or changing situations without creating undue expectations. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know the state of the world today and how vastly and quickly conditions in different countries change. The Minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the present review, I can renew assurances to people in Australia that our generous humanitarian response is directed only to those in genuine need. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The present overall program for refugee and special humanitarian entry is now 24,500, the highest intake ever in this category . . . Polish refugees in this current year illustrate that Australia stands ready to respond to new and sudden refugee situations. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Mulvihill said, we have some problems with refugee intake and processing refugees from Vietnam. Therefore I was also delighted to read what the Minister said about special procedures which have been introduced to cope with the unexpected volume of migration applications as distinct from refugee applications. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Of the order of 4,400 Polish refugees and over 1,400 Polish migrants are expected to arrive in Australia this financial year and, in addition to that, there will be approximately another 1,600 East European refugees. This intake is expected to be numerically higher on a per capita basis than that of any other country. </PARA>
<PARA>That again proves my point about humanitarian government and the attitudes of the Australian people towards refugees. Anyone who has not gone through the traumatic experience of being a refugee would not appreciate what that means. I can assure all who are listening now that being a refugee is a position in which I would not wish anybody to be. It is not easy; it is very hard and is an incredible experience. I know that the Australian people in general will recognise that refugees take a step which involves a complete break with their old country and their old friends when they move to a completely new situation. The Opposition spokesman in the other place, in his reply to the Minister, mentioned that there are about 10 million to 16 million refugees in the world today. He gave an analysis of the figures and stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There are 6.3 million refugees in Africa; 3.1 million in Asia, which includes 1 .4 million from Afghanistan; 200,000 in Latin America and 3.5 million in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA>Later he stated that the Government should raise its voice to make the point that the number of refugees which we are taking-20,000 to 25,000-is a great number but still only a fraction of the total. We should analyse the figures to see why those people flee their countries. I am afraid-I do not think I am wrong -that the majority of refugees fled their country because of the regimes installed there. The majority of those countries are run by either socialist or communist dictatorships. </PARA>

But if the honourable senator looks at the proportion of those who flee the so-called right wing regimes in Latin America and the proportion of those who flee socialist or communist regimes he will see the great difference. The question which arises is: Why did 200,000 people from Latin America want to come to Australia, Canada, France or the United States of America and not go to the Soviet Union? Why do those countries which have socialist or communist regimes not contribute a penny to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to help the humanitarian cause of the millions of people who fled their own country because of the system imposed there? Where is the humanitarian approach, the humanity of socialism or the humanitarian heart of the communist system to help those who left their country? This is another aspect of the refugee situation which we should look at. I commend the statement by the Minister and commend the Government for its humane policy on refugees.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I do not want to delay the Senate for long on this matter. I will try to complete my remarks before the sitting of the Senate is suspended for lunch. I want to make the point here that in my opinion the Government presently has not followed the advice given to it in this Industries Assistance Commission recommendation. There is a very strong outcry from the Carpet Importers Association of Australia which, I think, has some considerable justification. The Government still seems bent on its heavy protection of the carpet industry in this country. In my view it is a somewhat inordinate protection. The Government really ought to take more advice from the IAC in these matters. It asks for its advice but frequently when it comes down to a question of reducing protection the Government does not take its advice. Carpet importers particularly have been considerably discriminated against, not just recently but in previous years. I think they have a case. They make that case regularly to the Government but the fairness of the whole proposition of carpet importers is totally ignored by the Government. I am asking the Government to listen more to what these importers and other importers have to say, certainly in the proper context of IAC reports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make one or two brief comments about this motion. This issue of Afghanistan and the responses of Western governments to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has been debated over a long period in this Parliament. I do not resile from any of the comments that have been made by the Opposition. I remind the Senate that there was a bipartisan attitude at the time of the invasion of Afghanistan to the basic response that should be made to that invasion. There was a common expression of concern by both sides of the Parliament. We pointed out at the time, and still point out as a matter of regret, that there is a fundamental and strong gold thread of hypocrisy running through the attitude of the Western governments by way of response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. That hypocrisy was reflected in Australia by a greatly beaten-up debate about whether an Australian team should participate in the Olympic Games, accompanied by a refusal by this Government and, indeed, by other Western governments to impose sanctions against the Soviet Union which would have hurt the Soviet Union but which would also have hurt sections of our own communities. I refer to the imposing of embargoes on the sale of grain and so on to the Soviet Union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other comment I wish to make is that, in a sense, this initiative is a pious, platitudinous monument to the failures of Western policy in providing a cohesive response to Soviet initiatives in areas such as Afghanistan or, for that matter, in Poland. Of course, that is something which is a cause for regret . I do not want to go into the debate which took place on an earlier occasion as to whether Afghanistan is, appropriately, a Soviet sphere of influence or a Western sphere of influence. I think our position was very firmly stated at the time; that Afghanistan, as far as the Opposition is concerned, has traditionally , always been regarded by international experts as falling within the so-called Soviet sphere of influence. That is a factor which ought to have been considered at the time. Nonetheless, nobody in the Senate, I believe, would do anything but deplore the continuing occupation of Afghanistan the same as, if we had a decent debate about foreign affairs in this Parliament, many of us would want to deplore United States foreign policy initiatives in southern and middle America. That, again, is an area in which the thin gold thread of hypocrisy runs through many of the statements that are made. I wish to refer particularly to paragraph 6 of the motion which states that the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>welcomes the decision by the European Parliament to designate 21 March 1982 as Afghanistan Day . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am glad that the Government welcomes the initiative of the European Parliament in relation to this matter. I wish it would do it on a more even-handed way in relation to other matters. Yesterday I asked a question about the trial and persecution of trade union leaders in Turkey, a matter in respect of which the European Parliament has made strong statements to the Turkish Government. It appears that this is a matter in respect of which the Australian Government has made no response other than to say that the Europeans are doing the right thing. Again this is an example of double standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I do not think the declaration or recognition by Australia of Afghanistan Day will do any more, for example, than stopping an Olympic team from going to the Soviet Union did to influence events in Afghanistan. At the time we said it would do nothing to influence events in Afghanistan. We said it would have no effect on the regime in the Soviet Union and the foreign policy of that regime. Designating 21 March 1982 as Afghanistan Day will have no effect on what is happening in Afghanistan. It will be of no comfort to the people of Afghanistan. What might have been a comfort to the people of Afghanistan and what one might have hoped to hear in support of this statement is some further initiatives from the Australian Government to help Afghan refugees in Pakistan. That would have been welcome because that would have been a positive and humane contribution which this Government could have made. But the declaration of a day called Afghanistan Day in Australia, as I said, will be cold comfort to the people of Afghanistan. Indeed, perhaps it will be only a reminder to them of the fact that Western democracies do not match their words with deeds; a reminder to them, as an oppressed people, that in countries like Australia, people are prepared to make empty gestures on these sorts of matters but are not prepared to make a contribution such as additional humanitarian relief to refugees of the type I mentioned which would be a positive and constructive contribution in human terms. Apart from those comments, which indicate my own sincere qualifications about this motion, and apart from the qualifications that I have about the purpose of the motion, I see no other objections to the motion being adopted by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like my leader, Senator Button, I wonder what is the motivation, the purpose and the strategy of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) in introducing such a motion. Substantially, it reinforces and endorses the previous stand taken by the Parliament on the continuing intervention by one of the super-powers, the Soviet Union, in the affairs of Afghanistan. I think we have made our position clear. Certainly, I want to be on the public record as condemning the intervention of one of the major powers in the internal affairs of a country such as Afghanistan which was one of the non-aligned countries of the world. Even though it could be argued, ad infinitum, that the Government of Afghanistan invited the presence of Soviet troops into that country, that government did so, I believe, on the basis that there was a sphere of influence that had to be recognised and that the Soviet Union was entitled to be concerned about the events and therefore was entitled to intervene to the extent that it has. One is entitled, having recognised that fact, to say: 'Where does an impoverished country like Afghanistan, which clearly has a division of opinion amongst its own people, get the very extensive resources to fight the war that is taking place in that country?'. Therefore, one is entitled to have some doubts about who is sponsoring the rebel forces against the government of the day in that country. We are probably seeing part of a super-power rivalry being fought out in Afghanistan, with one super-power supplying resources and another super-power supplying an equal amount of resources to continue the tragedy that we know is taking place in that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, that raises the matter of spheres of influence which I think we ought to have a view about. I think we ought to be expressing a view on that. The motion fails to do that. For example, I ask how we can justify the United States of America's claim that Vietnam was an appropriate place for the intervention of American troops. Are we saying that in that part of Asia the United States had a sphere of influence? Are we saying that America was entitled to intervene in a country far removed from its borders? Are we entitled to say that the Australian Government, without any economic, social or political considerations, was entitled similarly to be involved? In the tragedy of Vietnam we saw an example of the intervention by a super-power in a country attempting to establish only the very important principle of self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion does not accept the principle of sphere of influence. The motion makes no mention of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Chile or all the other Latin American countries where the United States of America view is that Latin America , being a sphere of influence, entitles it to interfere in the internal affairs of those countries. We are aware of the fact that the super-powers themselves have decided, without the authority of the peoples concerned or of other world nations, on a subdivision of the world into two blocs-two spheres of influence. Therefore, having established those sorts of principles, they have set about saying that they are entitled to take whatever steps are necessary to maintain the so-called security of their borders. That is the justification of the Soviet Union's presence in Afghanistan. That is a justification which I and my party do not accept. We do not believe there is a moral, political or any other justification for that sort of approach. That is why, in the belief that we are supporting fundamental principles of self-determination-the right of people to determine their own affairs-we have been consistent in our approach whether it be to Afghanistan, Poland, Vietnam, East Timor, El Salvador or any other part of the world. We do not abrogate our responsibilities. We do not delegate to the super-powers the responsibility and the right to say: 'Well, this is a sphere of influence. It is on our border. Our security is affected; therefore we are entitled to intervene'. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw that absurd situation when Indonesia, a country of some 200 million people-true, not necessarily a major power in the sense of the founding members of the United Nations; nevertheless a power of some significance-said that a little area containing some 600,000 people who wanted to have their independence to determine their own affairs could be invaded and annexed and made part of the big power. This was despite the fact that there was no indigenous relationship or basic threat to the security of Indonesia whatsoever. We are seeing repeated tragedies that are part of the Latin American situation. In the small countries such as El Salvador, Nicaragua and maybe even Colombia, Guatemala and all the other countries the United States Government and the President are taking a more than unusual interest and involving the Government and taxpayers of the United States in a massive intervention in the internal affairs of those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Those matters reveal the weakness of the Government's motion. It is one-sided. It is a motion of double standards. It does not establish basic principles about the rights of the peoples concerned. It ignores the attempts made by President Reagan, an aged ham actor, to suggest that he is entitled to do what he is doing in El Salvador. He suggests that it is wrong for the people's movement in that country to seek assistance from anybody else. This is a classic case of double standards, cant, hypocrisy and humbug of a mammoth worldwide order. There is a failure by the Government in any circumstances to take an even handed position in these matters. It fails to make any representations to the Government of the United States to allow the people in Latin American countries to determine their own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look at the Latin American situation in a little more detail. It is an area of great riches. It is also an area of extreme poverty. It is an area where the very wealthy and the foreign investors have bled the countries dry. All the people want to do is to determine their own affairs. They have been subjected to unbelievable interference by the American President, the American Central Intelligence Agency, and other American agencies active in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to condemn that with great vehemence having regard to what is being done similarly in another part of the world-in Afghanistan. We cannot just condemn another of the super-powers for intervening on its southern borders. We cannot say that the Soviet Union should not have the right to intervene to the extent that it has even though, in strictly protocol terms, it can be argued with some conviction that the Government of Afghanistan did in fact invite the Soviet troops in. The Afghanistan Government did invoke the treaty that existed between itself and the Soviet Union. Similarly of course the Government in El Salvador can say that it sought assistance from overseas countries, to wit the United States, in order to resolve the civil war or civil disturbance that is going on in that country. One thing which the Socialist International, the Australian Labor Party and those in the movement for world peace are sure about is that we cannot have double standards in respect to these matters. Whilst I would not go on the public record as opposing the motion, I think it falls far short of our obligations as a section of the national Parliament. We are being one-sided if we concern ourselves only with the tragic situation that has been in existence for some three years in Afghanistan and at the same time fail to recognise our responsibilities in respect of those countries in Latin America. </PARA>
<PARA> As one who has played an active part in Amnesty International-an organisation which now enjoys the bipartisan support of the national Parliament-I can say that there is not one meeting when we in that organisation do not have brought to our attention examples of countless numbers of parliamentarians of those countries being tortured, murdered, imprisoned and driven into exile as a result of their attempts to establish in a parliamentary democratic way the rights of their countries to determine their own affairs. That is the concern of all democrats, of all of those who want to see the rights of people protected. We in that organisation feel the need constantly to press and plead with the Australian Government to take up these matters of human rights in those countries currently being affected by the United States presence, whether this be in the form of advisers or massive sales of sophisticated weapons and armaments. I believe that the United States presence in Latin America constitutes as much a breach of protocol, of proper relations between nations and of human rights as indeed does the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. Reluctantly I am forced to support the motion but I point out its grave weaknesses as a result of this Government's not adopting an even-handed position on the protection of the rights of people wherever they are in the world. </PARA>

As I said earlier, Senator Gietzelt and Senator Button have not been to Afghanistan. No doubt that is why, through their ignorance, they presume that America is supporting the local people there. America does not need to support the local people. The USSR cannot possibly penetrate that rugged country to defeat the tribes. If honourable senators opposite had visited that country they would realise that through the course of history nobody has been able-many have tried- to eradicate those people. Nobody has been able to conquer Afghanistan and its people. They are a tough people. They are able to live in the very small pockets of agricultural land that are available to them. The USSR will fail again. There is no way in which it can win this war, try as it may. It can use every inhumane means that it can muster but it cannot ever conquer these very tough people in Afghanistan.

The problem that faces me is that the motion has suddenly come before us and is directed to a problem in a particular way. I know the advice that the Senate should give to the Soviet Union is to get out of Afghanistan as soon as possible. I do not doubt that the Soviet Union would answer: 'We would like to get out as soon as possible'. The Soviet Union went into Afghanistan reluctantly and now it is in a position where it is difficult for it to disengage.

I could go through this resolution and replace the word 'Afghanistan' with the word 'Cyprus' and if I put in the word 'Cyprus' I would expose a situation which is as tragic as, if not more tragic than, that which is occurring in Afghanistan at present. If we relate the disaster of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus to numbers, the disaster in Cyprus is considerable. Let us look at how our attention seems to be directed away from our problems. Cyprus is a Commonwealth nation. It is very much the concern of Australia that the invasion of Cyprus should come to an end and that the Turkish troops in Cyprus should be removed. We should be applying ourselves even more to that problem than to the problem of Afghanistan. For this reason I believe this motion to be suspect. I believe it is selective for a purpose. It is part of a campaign of anti-Sovietism which, admittedly, does not do the Soviet Union any good but which does Australia no good either. The matter has to be resolved in the context of world peace. We quickly have to come to an understanding with the Soviet Union. We should not allow ourselves to be brought into the environment of the cold war. That is Reagan's purpose. We ought to deny Reagan his purpose. We ought to be moving towards understanding and communication. This sort of proposition does not help, especially when it is so selective. </PARA>
<PARA> Again if we are talking about troops occupying other countries we could look at the situation in several places. We could look at the Israeli occupation of certain territories which the Israelis refused to the Palestinians. The Government ought to agree to a resolution in this regard but it is not prepared to do it. Apparently it is not prepared to agree to such a resolution concerning Cyprus. It is certainly not going to agree to a resolution later this year in favour of our having a Timor day, setting up some sort of organised protest about what has happened in Timor. Although this proposition expresses our strong objection to the existence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, the manner in which it has been introduced, the terms in which it has been drafted and its selectivity indicate that it is part of a campaign of anti-Sovietism. That is the basis upon which this document should be considered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The matter embraced in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing is regarded by the Government as a significant one and one that should be taken seriously, researched and studied. The Government made an interim response, about which the Jessop Committee was informed, and then sought consultations with the Presiding Officers so that it could then reach a set of recommendations to bring back to the Senate and the Parliament. There have been some difficulties, as you know, Mr President, in completing these consultations. The Government realises that it is desirable to bring the matter to a conclusion. I seek the indulgence of the Senate to schedule this matter for debate next Thursday, today week. I give an undertaking that I would very readily schedule it. I am seeking the time both to complete the discussions with the Presiding Officers and to give the Government an opportunity to complete its deliberations. I do so with the full understanding that this matter has dragged on. It is not of my choosing that it should so do. I seek the indulgence of the Senate in light of the fact that the next matter listed for debate is a contingency motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I have listened with interest to the remarks of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick). I point out that whilst the Government regards the matter as a significant one, we of the Opposition-I think I also speak on behalf of all members of the all party Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Staffing and Appropriations that was appointed by the Senate to inquire into and to bring down recommendations on the matter-regard it as being one of the most important recommendations that this Parliament could consider. If I might use the Canberra Times as an exhibit in this debate, I note that on 7 December last it ran an editorial headed 'Parliament the Master'. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Parliament resumes on February 16, the Government will be obliged to take action on a motion carried by the Senate on the last day of the session, November 26, which has historic implications for Australian democracy. Decisive action would, eventually, make Parliament master of the five departments which serve it and work within its own building. These departments administer the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Joint House, the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Parliamentary Library. </PARA>
<PARA> They are now controlled and dominated by the Government, as if they were ordinary Government departments. They have been denied the means and the confidence to serve with proper effect the Parliament, which must be sustained against the Government if democracy is to be real. Parliament's tame acceptance of this state of affairs has been a disgrace. Now, the Senate is beginning to reject it. </PARA>
<PARA>I would raise other matters canvassed in that editorial if I had sufficient time but I emphasise that this debate, the gravamen of which is the subject of Senator Jessop's notice of motion, is one of the most important and significant debates that the Parliament could be conducting. By the establishment of such a committee Parliament is asserting its supremacy over the Executive and over the bureaucracy. We of the Opposition are determined to have Senator Jessop's motion not only scheduled for next Thursday, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate suggested, but also resolved by next Thursday before the Parliament rises for the Easter break. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have emphasised, the Select Committee on Parliament's Staffing and Appropriations was an all party select committee comprising Government members, members of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats. It was established as long ago as May 1980. It reported in June 1981-nearly 12 months ago. The report was debated in the Senate on 26 November and following that debate the Senate adopted the Committee's recommendations. Following the adoption of the report by the Senate, Senator Jessop, as the chairman of the former select committee, rightly gave notice of the motion that now stands in his name on the Notice Paper. When that notice of motion by Senator Jessop was called on, despite the fact that the Senate had adopted-from recollection unanimously-the Committee's report, instead of the Government declaring the matter to be formal, Senator Peter Baume, who was then in charge of Government business in the Senate, declared the matter to be not formal. What happened to Senator Jessop's notice of motion? It became General Business item No. 55 on the Senate Notice Paper. General Business notice of motion No. 1 on the Senate Notice Paper was given as long ago as November 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, had action not been taken yesterday by my colleague Senator Robertson, by way of a contingent notice of motion involving the suspension of Standing Orders to enable Senator Jessop to bring on for debate the terms of his motion, item No. 55 on the Notice Paper probably would have remained there until this Parliament was prorogued. Therefore we regard the matter as very important indeed. That is the reason why Senator Robertson, on behalf of the Opposition and also as a former member of the Senate Select Committee, gave his notice of motion yesterday. Frankly, I cannot for the life of me understand what appears to me and to members of the Select Committee to be uncertainty, suspicion or hesitancy on the part of the Government. As we see it, there can be no problem with the establishment of such a committee. I have heard doubt expressed around the place about the constitutionality of such a committee being established by the Parliament. I can tell those who are suggesting that the committee would be unconstitutional that senior officers of the Attorney-General's Department gave evidence to the Committee and said that there was no constitutional difficulty at all in the establishment by the Parliament of a committee of this nature because the Parliament is master of its own destiny. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this is an important recommendation. The proposed committee is an important committee. By its establishment we would assert the supremacy of Parliament, not only over the Executive but particularly over the bureaucracy. I remind all members of the Executive that before they can become members of the Executive they have to be members of the Parliament. They have to remain so. This is an important recommendation. We believe that it should be determined. We are determined not to let this matter go through to the keeper. We will face up to it when it comes to the wicket next Thursday. Whilst we appreciate what the Leader of the Government has said and that he will give an undertaking that the matter will be scheduled for debate next Thursday, I indicate on behalf of the Opposition that we will be moving next week to bring the matter to a determination. </PARA>

I was glad when I heard the Leader of the Government say today that the matter will be debated thoroughly on Thursday of next week. I lend my support and that of Senator Missen to what Senator McClelland has said.

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Bounty (Drilling Bits) Act 1980 and the Bounty (Non-Adjustable Wrenches) Act 1981 to extend the bounty assistance under those Acts until 31 December 1982 but at half the rates of bounty and half the annual limits on the amount of available bounty as specified in the principal Acts. The bounty schemes, which terminated on 31 December 1981, provided short term assistance to Australian producers and manufacturers of cemented carbide drilling bits and non-adjustable wrenches pending further inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Bounty assistance on non-adjustable wrenches was payable at 11 cents for each bountiable implement and the total bounty payment was limited to a maximum of $ 620,000 during the bounty period. Bounty assistance on cemented carbide drilling bits was scaled on the basis of bit size and the total bounty payments were limited to a maximum of $150,000 in any one year. The extension of the bounty assistance to these industries follow the Government's acceptance of the recommendations by the Industries Assistance Commission contained in its report of 30 June 1981 on 'Cutlery, Industrial Knives and Handtools'. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of non-adjustable wrenches the Industries Assistance Commission found that the major local manufacturer, Siddons Industries Ltd, improved its market performance since receiving the bounty and was rationalising its operation. The Commission considered this industry to be relatively economically efficient at moderate levels of assistance but was concerned that the sudden withdrawal of the additional assistance might cause resources to move out of this activity. It therefore recommended bounty assistance at half the previous rate for a further 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the drilling bits the Commission found that the greater part of the local industry producing rock drills is, with moderate levels of tariff assistance, relatively economically efficient and that its further development is consistent with the Government's broad objective of promoting a more efficient manufacturing sector. The Commission recommended that, in order to provide the local producer with the opportunity to improve its market performance further, short term bounty assistance for drilling bits should be extended for a further 12 month period but at half the rate of those previously payable. After 31 December 1982, the manufacture of non-adjustable wrenches will be assisted by a long term General Tariff of 25 per cent and the production of drilling bits will be assisted by a long term General Tariff of 15 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Aboriginal Land Rights Legislation Amendment Bill which seeks to amend the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act of 1976 and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Act of 1979. I state at the outset that the Opposition does not oppose the Bill, although we have reservations about some aspects of it. I place on record my thanks to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) for his co-operation in making available to the Opposition his officers and information to help us to grasp the consequences of the legislation we are currently debating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill provides for amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. A number of the amendments are in response, we understand, to requests by Aboriginal and Islander peoples and, therefore, have our support. Clauses 4, 5 and 6 which provide for the Hermannsburg area to be granted to the Aboriginal traditional owners in a form more in accordance with their wishes certainly have the Opposition support. The Hermannsburg traditional owners wanted five separate land trusts instead of one and they wanted to vary the membership and chairmanship of trusts. These amendments accommodate their requests. The Aboriginal people who live in the Hermannsburg area have been waiting for a long time for their land. The area is, as the Minister pointed out , one of the areas listed in Schedule 1 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act for granting to an Aboriginal land trust, and is the only area listed in Schedule 1 which has not yet been granted. The Opposition feels it is high time that the people of Hermannsburg have title to their land. I point out that the need is all the more urgent in view of the Northern Territory Government's recent moves to pre-empt the grant of land at Hermannsburg in respect of the area of the proposed Palm Valley gas project. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment briefly on this aspect to bring to light the Northern Territory Government's determination to do everything in its power to frustrate the intentions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. The Northern Territory Government recently indicated to the Central Land Council that it would resume the area of the Palm Valley pipeline and the area of gas production under the Northern Territory Petroleum (Prospecting and Mining) Act. It indicated it would do this regardless of the status of the land as land scheduled for grant to Aboriginals, thus removing the need for an easement agreement with the Aboriginal traditional owners. This Bill, by making it possible to grant the Hermannsburg area immediately, will pre-empt the Northern Territory Government's resumption and protect the rights of the Aboriginal traditional owners. I congratulate the Minister, Senator Baume, for acting quickly in this matter and urge him to make the Hermannsburg grant as soon as possible after the passage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is aware of the pressure being put on the Federal Government by the Northern Territory Government to ensure the emasculation of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. We are aware that negotiations are still under way between Aboriginal land councils and Federal and Northern Territory governments about further amendments to the Act. Let me put the Minister on notice that the Federal Opposition will examine all proposed amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act with great care to ensure that the Act is not weakened. Conversely let me assure the Minister of the wholehearted support of the Australian Labor Party for any legislative moves to resist the Northern Territory Government's attack on land rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Other aspects of the Bill currently before the Senate which the ALP does not oppose are contained in clause 10 which allows for the granting of legal aid in respect of the closure of seas hearings under the Northern Territory Aboriginal Land Act 1978. Clauses 8 and 11 which allow for a consolidated title for Bathurst and Melville islands to be held by the Tiwi Land Trust and the granting of a small additional area also have Opposition support. We believe such changes to be in accordance with the wishes of the Tiwi people. The Labor Party does, however, have reservations about clause 7 of the Bill. This clause allows the Minister to vary the number of land trusts in a grant area and to give land recommended for grants to land trusts in stages rather than as one grant. There is nothing objectionable in these amendments themselves. However we must place on record that we believe the impetus for their introduction at this time is the facilitation of the Jabiluka uranium project. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs announced in a Press release dated 8 March 1982 the granting of all the land recommended for grant in the Alligator River stage 2 claim with the exception of a number of areas affected by High Court actions. The land to be granted included 95 per cent of the Jabilunka project area. On 16 March 1982 the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, announced conditional approval for the development of the Jabiluka uranium deposits. We now have this legislation. It is not difficult to see that the Government is in a rush to get Jabiluka moving as quickly as posible and Mr Anthony has made Aboriginal agreement a condition of approval. Before the Northern Land Council can complete an agreement with the Jabilunka partners it is, of course, necessary for the Aboriginals to be given official title to the land and thus Senator Baume's statement of a grant earlier this week and this legislation. The Labor Party does not propose to obstruct this legislation. I recognise that the Minister can grant the land in question-including 95 per cent of the Jabiluka project area-whether or not this Bill is passed. Without the passage of this Bill those areas of the Alligator Rivers which cannot be immediately granted due to High Court action could be lost to the Aboriginal traditional owners and, for this reason, the Labor Party will not oppose its passage. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to state the total opposition of the Labor Party to the mining and export of uranium. I would also like to emphasise the Labor Party 's opposition to mining-that includes all mining-within the area of the Kakadu National Park. The Jabiluka area, of course, falls within stage 2 of the park which is yet to be declared. I would also like to comment on clause 9 of the Bill which relates to the repayment of amounts advanced to land councils to Consolidated Revenue. Under this clause repayments will come from moneys allocated for the administration of land councils rather than direct from the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account. I have received a telex from the Central Land Council indicating its opposition to such a change. I presume that the Minister has received a similar telex. To facilitate the Minister's comments on the Central Land Council's objections I seek leave to table the telex at this stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Central Land Council has also raised with me the issue of sufficient time for consideration of the proposed amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. Senator Baume in his second reading speech indicated that the changes proposed in this Bill had been thoroughly canvassed with the land councils. However, yesterday I received an urgent telex from the Central Land Council requesting that debate on this Bill be delayed for 24 hours as it had received the Bill only yesterday morning. I understand the proposed changes had been discussed with the Central Land Council in general terms. However, members of the Council had not seen a draft of this legislation or had the opportunity to seek legal advice on its effects. The Minister, in his haste to have this legislation introduced and passed in two days, did not, I submit, give the Central Land Council sufficient opportunity to examine the legislation and comment on it prior to debate in this chamber. Even taking into account the urgency of the Hermannsburg situation, I think it would have been more appropriate for the Minister to ensure that the Council had an opportunity to examine and comment on the Bill before it came into this chamber for debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> In conclusion I repeat that in general the Opposition is pleased to support this legislation insofar as it will finally give land title to the Hermannsburg Aboriginal communities and is substantially in accord with the wishes of various Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. In general, I think the flexibility given to the Minister in the matter of granting land under this legislation is desirable and is in the interests of the Aboriginal people. Our only reservations about this Bill are its interrelationship with the Government' s determination to proceed with the uranium mine in the Jabiluka area. However, I recognise that that government decision cannot be affected by any attempt on the part of the Opposition to amend this legislation. At this stage, I make it clear to the Minister that the Opposition supports the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall briefly indicate the position of the Australian Democrats in relation to the Aboriginal Land Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1982. We will be supporting the Bill with one reservation which I will mention shortly. I believe that if other legislation were introduced into this chamber with at least as much care and consultation as this one has been we would, in fact, avoid many of the problems that could subsequently arise. I believe that the approach of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) in tabling the Bill here first is the correct parliamentary procedure. It is a pity that the pressure that has been placed on the Federal Government by the Northern Territory Government has telescoped the debate to such an extent that we have run into a couple of problems in relation to two items. I do not believe, however, that that was in any way anything to do with the Minister's activities. I place on record our commendation of the activities of the Minister in regard to this Bill, for the extensive consultations that he has enabled to take place and for the information he has provided to the Senate and to honourable senators prior to the Bill coming into the House. For that we are very appreciative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our one reservation-it is one that Senator Ryan has already raised-relates to clause 9 of the Bill. We hope that the telex which came from the Central Land Council will be addressed by the Minister in detail so that we will be able to satisfy ourselves about the types of problems that were raised. I believe that some of them are genuine ones. In a sense probably they ultimately come down to a matter of principle. The feeling of the Australian Democrats is that self- determination of the Aboriginal people is the ultimate principle upon which a judgment should rest. In this case there is some difficulty as to whether it is the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Authority or the land councils that would most adequately represent that position in the long term. I made our concern known to the Minister prior to his introducing the Bill. I hope that he will place on record his position in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think ultimately our position would have to be that we accept the Bill as it is presented but we hope that the Minister will seek to meet the points that have been raised, in particular, by the Central Land Council. If there is still any dissatisfaction at that stage I believe that we may have to seek some further action in relation to clause 9. I hope that we will be able to give the Bill as rapid a passage as possible both here and in the other place so that possible problems will not arise in the Northern Territory Government and so the land which is currently being granted to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory will swiftly become theirs. We do not see ourselves causing any legal difficulties in that regard. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Bill. We await the Minister's comments in relation to the Central Land Council's problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, support the Aboriginal Land Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1982. This Bill proposes some significant changes. The five main aspects of the Bill are as follows: The grant of the title deed to Hermannsburg land, the consolidation of the title over Bathurst and Melville islands, the grant of land on report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, repayment of moneys advanced to land councils from revenue, and the payment of legal costs for people involved in Land Commissioner hearings in respect of closure of seas applications. As honourable senators can see, all the changes are of considerable significance. The first two were specifically requested by the Aboriginal people of the areas concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am particularly interested in the grant of the title deed on Hermannsburg land. This story goes back quite a long time to the beginning of the granting of land rights in the area when the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act was brought in in 1976. It was clearly indicated in those days by the Aboriginal people of Hermannsburg that they were dissatisfied with the fact that there was to be only one land trust for the whole area. They made many very strong protests and submissions to the Government asking it to consider having a series of land trusts, each having its piece of paper in the form of a grant in fee simple over its own land. The principle that was enunciated by the people of Hermannsburg was that they could speak for their land and for no one else's land and no other person could speak for their land. They were saying that one grant in fee simple did not recognise the traditional ownership of the land. The submissions that were put to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs of the day, Mr Viner, brought about a statement from the Minister that the Government would continue to explore the possibility of the title being held directly by the traditional owners themselves and that it was the aim of the Government eventually to achieve this goal but the subject presented considerable legal and practical difficulties. It is now, I suppose, some six years since that promise and that promise has been fulfilled. I commend the Government for that action. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime a lot of work has been going on behind the scenes. I take the opportunity of expressing the commendation of, I believe, many people who have witnessed the work carried out by Pastor Paul Albrecht, the field superintendent at Hermannsburg, Rex Ziersch, the former teacher at the school, and Garry Stoll, the superintendent of Hermannsburg mission. These people in the last few years have put in practically all of their time tracing the geneology and anthropology of the Aboriginal people of that area. They have carried out vast amounts of research. They have camped out and lived with the people for many months on end to gain a complete understanding of the people of that area. I believe that the work these people have done has brought about to quite a degree the measures which were introduced by the Government and are being debated today. At Hermannsburg the small clan groups will have their own title-their own piece of paper, as they express it. The land title will be held by the Aboriginal people. It has been said that the Northern Territory Government is endeavouring to emasculate the Northern Territory land rights Act. That, of course, is completely wrong. It is to be stressed that in all the negotiations on Aboriginal matters in the Northern Territory that have taken place between the Northern Territory Government, the Commonwealth Government and the various land councils there has always been agreement after discussion. It is a fact that the Northern Territory supports the land rights proposed. Over the years there have been plans for a gas pipeline from Palm Valley to Alice Springs which will put Alice Springs on to natural gas-a very desirable thing. This is also desired by the Aboriginal people of the area. For some considerable time now they have been requesting and, indeed, pressing for the completion of the negotiations. When the negotiations are completed and the gas starts to flow to Alice Springs considerable royalties will go to those people. They are realistic enough to see that the royalties will bring considerable benefits to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that far too much has been made of the present situation. It has been many years now since gas was discovered in the area. The Magellan Petroleum Corporation was the discoverer and has been the developer over the years. This project has been held up while negotiations have taken place. It is natural now that all interested parties wish it to proceed. When the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) speaks in reply I ask that he clearly indicate whether, when the legislation has been passed and the grants in fee simple are made available to the people, arrangements for the easement as requested by the Aboriginal people will be carried out as quickly as possible. Of course, this will enable the negotiations to continue, the tenders for the pipeline to be called and everything to be brought to a successful conclusion. I think there is very little to say about the granting of title over Bathurst and Melville islands. The Tiwi Land Council is the youngest land council of the three. The Tiwis have proved that they are well capable of looking after their interests. I believe the Bill contains just a minor amendment in this regard to have these and other islands included in the Tiwi land. The grants of land on reports of the Land Commissioner have been discussed at length. It was a reasonable request and I wish to make no comment on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The repayment of moneys advanced to land councils from revenue is a matter of particular importance. Honourable senators will realise that over the years substantial amounts have been paid to the land councils to help meet administrative costs in the early years of their formation when royalty payments were relatively low and activity on land claims and mining negotiations was at a high level. Royalties were small and this brought about a situation in which the Government had to make advances to land councils to allow them to meet their administrative costs. To date some $1,598,000 has been advanced. The provisions presently in the Act require the payment to Consolidated Revenue as a once-only lump sum. I do not think that is realistic. I commend the Government for bringing in this amending legislation which will now provide for gradual repayments at the Minister's discretion as surpluses become available. In the Northern Territory, mining royalties will accrue tremendously in the next few years; they will amount to many tens of millions of dollars. As the money becomes available, the money that was advanced to the land councils will be repaid. Section 64 (1) of the parent Act provides that 40 per cent of the royalties is to be distributed among land councils to meet their administrative costs. If repayments were not made from this 40 per cent, the amounts available to Aboriginals generally in the Territory would be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Already the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account disbursements to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory have been greatly reduced because of the large amounts going to land councils and communities directly affected by mining. Numerous complaints have been received from communities seeking ABTA assistance to develop enterprises and to help improve living conditions. The ABTA Advisory Committee, which is composed of representatives of the three land councils, has very firmly recommended repayments from the land councils' share of royalties. This was indicated in the letter tabled by the Minister in the Senate on 2 December 1981. It is appropriate that advances for land council costs be repaid from the share of royalties allocated by the Parliament. There is no question of the money not being repaid. Of course, this is a point that has been discussed at length, particularly in the Northern Territory, over the last few months. I make the particular point that it also means that the moneys for the administration of the land councils will come from that share of the royalties. That means that the other moneys, the 60 per cent, will be paid to the traditional owners under the formula that was set down in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. So there will be no chance whatsoever of the administrative costs of the various land councils being taken out of the moneys due to the traditional owners through the formula. </PARA>
<PARA> I go on to mention the assistance provided in the payment of legal costs of people involved in Land Commission hearings on closure of seas applications. The actual principle has been very contentious. The principle, which was introduced some time ago, and agreed to by the Federal Government, is that people involved in land claims-that is, people who wish to put their points of view on particular land claims because they feel that there is injustice or that the claims have some effect on their actual conditions-can make a claim for funds to pay legal expenses, provided they can prove that their financial situation is such that they cannot pay their own legal costs. The principle has now been extended to those people who wish to oppose claims on the coast of northern Australia. I wish to say only one thing about this, and I have quite strong feelings about it. A type of means test is applied to people who claim financial assistance. Previously it was applied in respect of land claims and now it will be applied in respect of closure of seas applications. I once again ask the Government to give sympathetic treatment to people who make such claims for payment of legal expenses. Very many people and small organisations in the Territory do not have the financial ability to stand up to the huge costs involved in land claim hearings. I believe at times these people are hard put to meet these legal expenses. I suggest to the Government that, even now, it should not take the hard attitude that I believe it has taken. I believe the means test system has been a little too hard and that other people should be given legal assistance. In this instance such people will include fishermen and those people who are living on and making their livelihoods from the coast and the islands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe so. This organisation could well be considered for such legal assistance. All in all, I support the legislation. I think it is very good legislation. I note that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in his second reading speech, said that it is not to be confused with the present negotiations that are taking place between the Federal Government, the Northern Territory Government and the land councils in regard to further amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. That particular parcel of legislation is of considerable importance and, like many other people in the Northern Territory, I hope that the negotiations will continue as quickly as possible. They have considerable ramifications for the whole of the Northern Territory. I look forward to the day when that further package of legislation comes into the Senate where it may be processed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am particularly interested in that package of legislation which has yet to come before the Senate because I believe it has a lot to do with the future well -being of the people of the Northern Territory. By that I mean the ability of both races to live alongside each other or to live in what I call co-existence. I believe it essential for the future of the Territory that these matters be considered and rectified as quickly as possible. There can be no future for the Northern Territory if the people of the Northern Territory cannot co-exist. So I encourage the Government and all those people who are participating in the discussions at present to pursue them as quickly as possible so that the amendments may be brought into the Senate. When they come before the Senate I hope that all sides-the Australian Democrats, the Opposition and the Government- will see that they are for the ultimate benefit of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing I merely repeat that the leases for the pipeline easement between Palm Valley and Alice Springs will be on Aboriginal land. The leases to this land have been held up for some considerable time. I hope that all parties will reach agreement and this line will be constructed as quickly as possible. There have been charges and counter-charges about the matter. I believe that if the Federal Government sees fit to issue these grants in fee simple as quickly as possible, to allow an easement for the pipeline, tenders could be called, construction of the pipeline could be carried out in the latter part of the year and all would be well. The Aboriginal people would be satisfied, the Magellan company and the Palm Valley gas fields could be developed after so many years in limbo and Alice Springs would benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to take only a few minutes but I want to make some comments. Firstly, I am critical of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). This legislation is an example of his usual rush jobs in bringing in a Bill at the last minute. He has done that ever since he has occupied the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. I realise that in some cases there are problems. He has three co-Ministers working with him. He cannot do anything in Queensland until he gets permission from the Premier. He is not able to do anything in the Northern Territory until he gets permission from the Chief Minister. Until the recent retirement of Sir Charles Court he could not do anything in Western Australia either. I hope there will be some improvement there. Resolution of the problem at Hermannsburg has been held up for a long period. It should have been attended to many years ago. Part of the reason for some of our problems associated with these amendments was summed up very well by our shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Ryan, in a Press statement on 16 March. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The action of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, today in granting approval for mining in the Jabiluka uranium deposits puts unacceptable pressure on the Aboriginal traditional owners of the area to give the go-ahead for mining. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony's approval means that the Jabiluka project partners can begin negotiations for the sale of uranium from Jabiluka before the Aboriginal owners have agreed to allow mining to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Northern Land Council has initialled an agreement on Jabiluka, the agreement has still to be discussed by the Aboriginal owners of the area as specified under Section 48 of the Northern Territory Land Rights Act. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Aboriginal owners are to be given sufficient time for thorough consideration of the agreement this could be a lengthy process. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony's decision will put pressure on the Aboriginal owners to make a hasty decision in favour of the mine. It assumes that the Aboriginal owners can only make one decision, that is to give their approval, and therefore disregards the Aboriginals' power of veto under the Land Rights Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The last three amendments that came into this chamber, concerning the Northern Territory land rights legislation and the uranium mining legislation, were dealt with in a hurry. If the Minister had cats' eyes he would probably sneak into the chamber in the middle of the night and want to debate the legislation at daylight without anyone having access to the Bills. It is just not good enough. I suggest that the Minister take time to think the matter over. He has done the same sort of thing in other areas as well. I asked a question here recently regarding the operation of the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program. I received a most strange reply, the crux of which says:</PARA>
<PARA> The delays have been caused by the need to develop a workable program which meets the requirement of both the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists as well as Governments and which includes appropriate Aboriginal involvement. Allocation of Government funds for the project during this financial year will depend on acceptable workable arrangements being developed. </PARA>
<PARA>We are almost at the end of the financial year. This is another area in which the Minister has fallen down badly. He has made no attempt to get this scheme operating effectively again. It worked effectively before, it saved the eyesight of many hundreds of Aborigines, particularly children. But this year nothing is happening because the Minister is too busy arguing with the three States in which this scheme will not be allowed to operate. The Northern Territory has a half-baked scheme which will cover half the patients. Western Australia also has a half-baked scheme which probably will not cover half the patients, and as far as I know the people conducting the program will not go to Queensland because Joh says that they cannot. In the meantime the health of the people suffers. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that somewhere along the line the Minister is moved to another portfolio . Alternatively I hope that if he stays in his present one he will not make all the decisions himself but will consult with the Aborigines, which he is not doing now. A legal organisation-the equivalent of the Aboriginal legal services- in Townsville was wiped out of existence just before Christmas because the Minister had what he thought was a very important report. He would not let the Aborigines look at it but he acted under it. He decided that whatever dad said was right. The Minister has now become the big white father who lays down the law. I make those few remarks to point out that many people are unhappy about the way the Minister is failing to administer his portfolio, the way he is failing to consult with Aborigines at any level and the way he makes dictatorial decisions about when programs will be brought in. I suggest that he should develop a political backbone and not be dictated to by the people I have nominated and others such as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable senators who have taken part in the debate. All except Senator Keeffe dealt with the Aboriginal Land rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 which is before us. I listened to what Senator Keeffe had to say. I reject most of it. I am pleased that he said it because the more he says it the more I know I am on the right track. In relation to what other honourable senators had to say, I am grateful for the support that has been given for this legislation which Senator Keeffe might note is the first piece of legislation I have brought in. Therefore he need not talk about my constant practice of bringing in legislation at the last moment. I thank honourable senators for the support they have given for the principles of the legislation and acknowledge the points they have raised, the particularities on which they have questions and on which they want some further elucidation in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take a few of the points raised and suggest that the comments on clause 9-the one on which honourable senators have asked for specific information-might best be dealt with in the Committee stages rather than my going over it twice. Senator Kilgariff raised the question of the easement for the Palm Valley pipeline. Let me be quite clear about this matter. With the passage of this legislation the preparation and issue of the pieces of paper may still take some weeks, but the Aboriginal communities can go ahead now, negotiate and complete the agreements. Even under the best negotiating conditions that will take them several weeks. Therefore we will be ready without delay to finalise the arrangements which, as the honourable senator said, will bring into those Aboriginal communities the benefits they are seeking to obtain from the royalties which they will receive once the gas starts to flow. By passing this legislation the Senate will assist those communities in getting that economic benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the advice which we may have received from communities, I indicated to Senator Ryan-by way of interjection-that we had not considered it proper to distribute the legislation until it was introduced into the Parliament . What we did was canvass the issues and get agreement in principle to the matters which were raised. The honourable senator is quite correct that at that stage we then passed out the legislation. I think it was introduced into the Parliament on Tuesday. It was in Darwin that night and handed to Aboriginal Land Council representatives, from whom we now have some further information. The Government is grateful for the support it has received from the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats for the legislation. I will discuss, during the Committee stages, the issues relating to clause 9. I hope I will be able to answer queries to everyone's satisfaction. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Jabiluka project area is contained largely within that piece of land which has been recommended for grant in the Alligator Rivers region. The purpose of clause 7 will be to allow me to grant any land in stages. That could apply to the Alligator Rivers region, as it could to any other region. The honourable senator raises the question about whether I need this clause to be passed to enable the Jabiluka project to go ahead. The short answer to that is no, it is not necessary for this clause to be passed. The Jabiluka area can be granted once the appropriate survey work is completed. The Jabiluka project could go ahead whether or not this amendment is passed. In fact, the purpose of this amendment is to put beyond doubt the capacity of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to make progressive grants. The purpose of that is to ensure that Aboriginals are not disadvantaged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will take a moment of the Committee's time to explain that within the Alligator Rivers area there are eight small parcels of land in the area recommended for grant by the Land Commissioner, each of which is held up at the moment because of concerns that we have over the Finniss River appeal which is before the High Court of Australia. The matters being appealed in the Finniss River case are matters which are relevant to these eight small pieces of land. It is my intention to proceed to grant land in the Alligator Rivers region as quickly as I am able, leaving those eight small pieces of land out until I have the result of the High Court judgment on the Finniss River. This matter is not even coming up for mention before the High Court before April. We will be lucky to have a result from the High Court before the end of this year. Who knows? The Court works to its own timetable. </PARA>
<PARA> Those eight pieces contain land which may be of great importance to traditional Aboriginal owners because they include areas which are controlled by Peko- Wallsend Ltd which may contain mineral wealth and which Aboriginals want to become Aboriginal land in due course so that negotiations could take place in the usual way for mining to proceed on them. If the Senate or the Parliament chose not to pass this amendment, the only losers could be the traditional Aboriginal people; the only winners could be the people who hold the pieces of land, perhaps Peko-Wallsend or some other company should it choose to mount challenges in the court and should it be successful. The passage of this amendment will put beyond doubt my capacity to make progressive grants. Coming back to the question asked by Senator Ryan: As soon as the survey work is complete I could grant the land necessary to enable the Jabiluka project to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) for his explanation. Indeed, on behalf of the Opposition, we welcome the steps that the Minister has taken to protect the right of Aboriginals to the eight small pieces of land which are currently affected by claims before the High Court of Australia. Returning to the grant of land to the traditional owners in the area involved in the Jabiluka project, the Minister has just stated that it is his intention to make those grants as soon as possible. Of course, the passage of this legislation will facilitate that. I ask the Minister: What steps will he be taking to monitor the application of the principal Act, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, insofar as it requires the Northern Land Council to consult with traditional owners and insofar as the traditional owners will have access to information which will help them decide whether or not to exercise their veto rights over mining? I raise this matter because the Minister will be aware that from time to time some traditional owners have complained that consultation by the Land Council with the traditional owners has not been adequate. When we are dealing with such a controversial matter as uranium mining I think all of Australia will be anxious to know that the Aboriginals' veto rights in this matter, insofar as they exist, are being properly investigated, that all due process of consultation is taking place and that all information that the traditional owners need to be able to decide whether or not to exercise that veto will be available to them. I seek general assurances from the Minister on this point.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Under the Act I am required to satisfy myself that a number of things have happened. Before I give my approval for an agreement for mining to proceed or for any agreement which may be entered into by a Land Council, I am required to satisfy myself that the Land Council has sought and has received proper instructions from the traditional owners in the first instance before it starts negotiating. I am required to satisfy myself that the relevant Land Council has acted upon instructions that it has received and not in any other way.

The situation is that we now have an initialled agreement between the Land Council and the company. We are at the stage now where the Land Council is going back to the traditional owners to explain to them the agreement which has been reached to ensure that it has their agreement. As part of that monitoring process we are trying to ensure that the appropriate information is available to traditional owners to enable them to make the judgments which they are required to make. I will not give my approval unless those things are done. There are other things which I want to know too. I want to know that the agreement accords with certain principles. I think I have to approve the distribution of moneys which is proposed. I will want to make sure that that is adequate and appropriate before I approve it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated during my summing up that I would answer some questions that were raised during the second reading debate. This might be an appropriate time to do it. The issue raised by this clause concerns the repayment of moneys which have been lent by the Consolidated Revenue Fund to keep the land councils operating. The issue which comes up is that there are several areas from which the repayments can be made. During their contributions to the debate, honourable senators drew attention to the conflict that might exist between the land councils, as a source of the repayment, and the rest of the Aboriginal community , as a source of the repayment. I draw honourable senators attention to letters which I tabled which indicate a division of opinion within and among the Aboriginal community. In the letter from the Central Land Council dated 7 December which I received on 18 December the view of that Council on that matter was set out. I draw the attention of the Committee to a couple of paragraphs in the letter. The letter stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Central Land Council has accepted supplementary funding offered by your Department on the understanding that this supplementary funding would be repaid to consolidated revenue by the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account. This is provided for by the Land Rights Act. It has never been the understanding or the scheme of the Act that the supplementary funding should be repaid from amounts due to the Land Councils under s. 64 (1) of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The view of the Central Land Council is that the money should be repaid from the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account and not from the land councils. On the other hand is the view expresed in the letter, which I tabled, from the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account which I received on 22 December. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We also understand that you have written to the Northern Land Council and Central Land Council enquiring whether they will agree to repay recent advances made to them by the Government, as and when their share of royalties exceed their administrative costs. The Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account Advisory Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>feels that having the Land Councils repaying this money is the correct thing. The A.B.T.A. has already got to repay old loans made by the Government to the Councils and the Councils should be made to accept some responsibility for these later loans. With regard to the repaying of the old loans by the A.B.T.A., my Committee consider-</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continued on a technical matter. The letter is signed by Mr Leo Finlay, who is of course an Aboriginal and Chairman of the Advisory Committee. Incidentally, he is also the Deputy Chairman of the Northern Land Council. I put it to honourable senators and the Committee that here we have two views. In the end there is no view that will satisfy all Aboriginal interests. However, it may be possible to resolve the matter by acknowledging that all we are talking about is the repayment from that part of money allocated to the land councils which is in excess of their needs for administrative purposes. If I do not have this amendment all I will be able to do is to have the money go back in one lot. No one questions the fact that the money has to be repaid. The issue now is whether I can repay it in bits or in one hit. Having looked at the two letters and thought the matter through, my proposition is that it is money that was advanced to the land councils for their administrative purposes and it is appropriate that we look, when the income is sufficient, to repaying it from that amount of money in excess of the administrative needs of the land councils. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Ryan, or Senator Macklin, referred to section 35 of the principal Act, which sets out the way in which these moneys are to be distributed. Excess money is money to be distributed by the land councils to communities within their land council area. It seems to me that if we go the way the Central Land Council wants we will end up with the ABTA being very poor for a long time and the land councils very wealthy. As I see it, in terms of equity and judging by rule of thumb, it is probably appropriate to make the repayments from excess moneys available to the land councils once their administrative needs have been met. </PARA>

<PARA>The amount to be repaid has accumulated over several years. The amount was made available to the land councils because it was considered appropriate that the land councils should have enough funding to enable them to operate effectively, even though at that time the royalty income was negligible. I think this is merely to allow the debt to be cleared. It is a finite debt; we know what it is. It is $1.6m at present. In terms of the kinds of amounts of money that will be coming in, it will be no real hardship to repay it, particularly if we do it in segments year by year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Senator Peter Baume) for his explanations so far. The Australian Democrats will not press their objections. I would like to place on record that after listening to the Minister's reply and to the various representations that have been made I think the point that the Central Land Council made is a telling one. It is that ultimately the wealth of the Aboriginal people comes from their lands and therefore the land council is the organisation that we should seek to bolster in the long term. However, we will not press our objection basically because of the other problems that have arisen with the legislation. We hope that in the administration and recovery of costs the Minister will not in any way remove administrative moneys from the land councils in such a way as to make them less able to undertake their work, which is seeking to further land claims as expeditiously and as effectively as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>CANNED FRUITS MARKETING LEGISLATION REPEAL AND AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes to amend and repeal existing legislation to allow for the termination of the operations of the Australian Canned Fruits Sales Promotion Committee and for the residual assets and liabilities of the Committee to vest with the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sales Promotion Committee was established in 1959 with the single function of promoting the sale of Australian canned deciduous fruit. As a matter of policy, the Committee has always restricted its promotional activities to the domestic market. The Committee's activities are funded from the proceeds of a charge on grower deliveries of fruit to canners collected under the Canning- Fruit Charge Act 1959. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the announcement of the decisions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions on 31 April 1981, the Minister for Primary Industry canvassed with grower and canner interests the desirability of rationalising the operations of the Committee within the existing broad marketing and general functions of the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation. This has been accepted, and the domestic promotion programs of the Committee were taken over by the Corporation as from 1 January 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>CANNED FRUITS LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes increases to the rates of levy imposed on canned deciduous fruit production to finance the administrative operations of the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> As from 1 January 1982 the operative rate of levy increases from the equivalent of 11 cents per basic carton (24 x 825 gram cans) to 27 cents per basic carton. Provision is also being made for future alteration of levy rates by regulation up to a maximum of 30 cents per basic carton. The new maximum and operative rates for various container sizes are set out in the Schedules to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased levy rates have been recommended by the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation following its decision in November 1981 to reduce canned fruit production in the 1982 season to approximately one half the level achieved last year. This decision was made necessary following the drastic downturn in export market outlets last year and the build up of unsold stocks to near record high levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation's marketing plans for 1982 have been developed in close consultation with grower and canner interests and the reduction in production is seen by the bulk of the industry as the best response to the current oversupply problem. Significant marketing and promotional problems will continue to face the industry this year and the increased levy rates proposed by this Bill are essential if the Corporation is to have the resources necessary to deal effectively with these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also giving urgent attention to the problems facing the industry. It agreed late last year to an urgent IAC reference. The Commission is scheduled to report on the industry's short term assistance needs by 31 March. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has assured industry interests that the IAC report will be accorded urgent consideration by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA>DAIRY PRODUCTS (EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGE) BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to introduce, as from 1 July 1982, charges to recoup a proportion of the cost borne by the Commonwealth for inspecting dairy products for export. This is part of the Government's programme to recover costs of providing export inspection for certain agricultural and fishery products. </PARA>
<PARA> Export inspection is designed to ensure that products meet minimum standards of quality, hygiene and presentation when exported. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government introduced charges for inspecting meat, grain and wool in 1979, and fish and dried fruits in 1981. These charges are aimed at recovering approximately 50 per cent of the inspection costs of the Commonwealth. The Government proposes that fees aimed at a similar level of recovery should be imposed for similar services provided by the Department of Primary Industry for other products. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to specifics in this Bill, Honourable Senators will see that it provides for the recovery of dairy product export inspection costs to be achieved through charges on dairy products inspected for export. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the person who furnishes an Export Notice for inspection purposes is liable to pay the charge. Exemptions may be provided in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> A maximum rate of charge of $5.00 per tonne is specified. The actual rates of charge will be specified in regulations. It is proposed that the following rates for 1982-83 be recommended to the Governor-General for promulgation by regulation</PARA>
<PARA> Butter packed in bulk or pat form-$2.50 per tonne</PARA>
<PARA> Butter packed in other forms and butter fat products-$1.00 per tonne</PARA>
<PARA> Cheese packed in bulk-$2.50 per tonne</PARA>
<PARA> Cheese packed in other forms-$1.00 per tonne</PARA>
<PARA> Concentrated, condensed and dried milk-$0.50 per tonne</PARA>
<PARA> Milk and other milk products-$1.00 per tonne</PARA>
<PARA> On current estimates of export production for 1982-83, charges at these rates will yield approximately $307,000 in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>DAIRY PRODUCTS (EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGE) COLLECTION BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is related to the Dairy Products (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1982 just introduced. Its purpose is to provide for the collection of charges proposed in that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It follows provisions for the collection of levies in other export inspection charge legislation. Specifically, provision is made for persons to pay charges due to the Commonwealth for the inspection of dairy products for which a certified Export Notice has been served. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In January of this year several people discovered that at least one load of hay had been transported from Queensland in breach of regulations relating to the control of cattle tick and delivered to the Bendemeer property of the Minister for Communications, Mr Sinclair. In the first parliamentary week of this year-that was from 16 to 18 February-jibes in the House of Representatives about tick-tock and tickey hay apparently alerted the Minister. In a speech to an obscure New South Wales National Country Party branch on Saturday, 20 February, he attempted to defuse the issue by trivialising it and by pretending that he was an innocent bystander-a victim of circumstance yet again. On 23 February I spoke in the Senate pointing out that he was not an innocent bystander or a victim of circumstance and that he was fully in control of the farm operations, according to a statement he had given to the Land newspaper which was published in January this year. My speech was reported by the Tamworth newspaper, the Northern Daily Leader, on 24 February under the heading 'MP Passed Blame for Breach'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Sinclair once used the forum of Parliament to reply to me, to Senate committees or to anyone else who was exposing his assorted villainies. Sometimes he got his party leader and party ministerial colleague, Mr Nixon, to assist him in doing that-those well-known financial wizards of the National Country Party, Messrs Anthony and Nixon. The defences lately have not been terribly successful. Perhaps that explains why he chose as the forum for reply an article that was published in the Northern Daily Leader on March 1. Another reason could be that if he makes assertions in Parliament which are too easily or too unequivocally shown to be incorrect even he could be in trouble. Perhaps the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) would be in even more trouble if he refused to take action pursuant to that. The Minister asserted in what I think is a weekly column of his in the Northern Daily Leader as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> As explained in a speech to the Country Party at Kingstown at the weekend, a small quantity of hay was innocently acquired by my farm manager from a local carrier at the end of the drought last year to feed calving cows. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh, however, claims I owned the hay when it crossed the border, which I did not . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those points are crucial. Mr Sinclair's version of this incident is that the truck driver was acting as the principal in the transaction, effectively hawking hay from farm to farm, some of which was purchased by Mr Sinclair's manager. What actually happened, and what was disclosed by Mr Sinclair's manager in a statement to the relevant New South Wales authorities, is that the manager, in replying to a newspaper advertisement, rang a fodder merchant in Gatton, Queensland. He was quoted a price for the hay, delivered. He formed the opinion that the delivery charge was too high and hired a local Tamworth carrier to transport it. I add that the carrier was not paid for six months. Perhaps he should count himself lucky. The Walshes still have not been fully repaid the money the Sinclairs pinched from them up to 10 years ago. It was later discovered by the authorities that the hay had not been fumigated or sprayed and Mr Sinclair's farm was put in quarantine which lasted, I understand, for about three months. The Minister has also endeavoured to leave the impression that his manager and not he is responsible for what happens on his farm-a version which conflicts directly with a statement by Mr Sinclair quoted in the Land newspaper of 14 January. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> But I still like to be involved in all the major stock decisions. I'm there at the weekend and I try to have a look at the stock. I sign cheques and give orders and ask why last week's orders weren't carried out. Occasionally I participate in calf-marking or hay-making or something like that, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On his own prior statement he cannot plead ignorance or innocence of this incident on the grounds that the manager, not he, is responsible for everything that happens on the farm. Another matter, which arises from a question asked last week, has the appearance of yet another attempt to cover up activities of National Country Party Ministers-on this occasion apparently, with at least the passive assistance of a couple of senior Liberal Ministers. On 9 March I asked Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle whether the appointment of Mr Al Wallace, the former head of the Dairying Division of the Department of Primary Industry to a supernumerary position called 'special adviser' within that Department complied with the Public Service guidelines and also with the directive on Government expenditure circulated by her Department last month. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Walsh's question would primarily fall within the area of the Public Service Board or the Department of Primary Industry. I will seek information from those departments with regard to the appointment that he has outlined, about the requirements of the appointment and the other matters to which he has referred. </PARA>
<PARA>I dispute on factual grounds the Minister's implied assertion that it really did not have anything to do with her Department but was a matter for other departments, because her Department issued a directive last month about Government expenditure and about the deferring of all expenditure that could possibly be deferred into the next financial year. But I leave that aside. The more important fact is that nine days later there still has been no reply. Yesterday in the Senate I reminded the Government of the fact that there had been no reply. Obviously, that question could have been answered within 24 hours had there been any will on the part of the Government to do so. One could speculate about the reason for Mr Wallace's new appointment, one of the beneficial-to the Government-consequences of which will be that he will no longer appear before Senate Estimates committees as the head of the Dairying Division of the Department of Primary Industry. The officially stated reason for his appointment as a special adviser is that he is to advise upon the reorganisation of the Department of Primary Industry consequent on the exposure in this Senate and in other places of very serious deficiencies, to say the least, within that Department. Nobody who saw Mr Wallace perform before the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations would doubt his loyalty to his Ministers, past and present. They would, however, doubt his competence to reorganise anything or to give valid advice on how to reorganise anything. The Committee, in its report, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Regrettably Mr Wallace's evidence was so guarded and qualified and his manner so evasive that far from providing unqualified support for Mr Sinclair's version of the events, Mr Wallace at best only offered lukewarm and tentative confirmation.</PARA>
<PARA>At one stage Mr Wallace's performance was so inept that the Chairman felt obliged to note explicitly for the record that the laughter around the room-from assembled journalists, senators and interested spectators-was, as he put it, at and not with Mr Wallace. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter about which I asked a question last week was the appointment of a barrister to represent Mr Nixon before the royal commission into the meat export substitution scandal. Since I asked the question, I have had firm corroboration of the fact that a barrister has been appointed. In my question last week I asked whether it was a fact that a barrister had been appointed. We now know-no thanks to this Government-that that is so. I also asked who authorised this appointment, how much it would cost and who would pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are questions which could probably have been answered within half an hour had there been any will on the part of this Government to answer them. A telephone call to Mr Nixon's office would have provided the answers. I do not know whether Senator Carrick made any attempt to get an answer. I suspect he would have done so. I have usually found that when Senator Sir John Carrick is asked to provide information of a straight factual nature such as those questions sought he has attended to his duties quite diligently. I expect that Senator Sir John Carrick or someone on his staff would have contacted Mr Nixon or Mr Nixon's office seeking answers to those questions. The answers have not come through. The only conclusion which is compatible with those facts is that Mr Nixon does not want the answer to be made public. He is deferring it for as long as possible, in keeping with a well-established National Country Party tradition of deferring by any means all potentially unpleasant decisions and matters in the hope that they will go away. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was reminded yesterday that these questions had been asked and had not been answered. I appeal to Senator Sir John Carrick-if he cannot do it today, he should do so at the very latest, at the conclusion of Question Time next Tuesday-to tell the Senate whether he has put these questions to the Minister and whether he has received any reply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity of this first reading debate to raise two matters relating to East Timor. One is family reunification, which I have mentioned in this place on a number of occasions, as have many honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. The other is what I have called the need for the door to be opened; in other words, the availability of access to East Timor by people from outside the province. I am prompted to make these comments by two matters that have been reported in the newspapers. The first is the visit of the Honourable E. G. Whitlam, Q.C. and Mr Peter Hastings of the Sydney Morning Herald to East Timor. This was reported in the Canberra Times on 12 March. The second is the visit to Indonesia of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, Mr Paul Everingham, as reported in the Northern Territory News of 6 March, the previous week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to comment on the situation in East Timor at present or even, for that matter, to discuss reports which have been made by Peter Hastings and which have appeared in a number of newspapers. The reason I do not want to do this is that Hastings was invited to visit Indonesia and then East Timor by the Indonesian Government. When someone is invited, as in this case, I believe that anything he says when he returns must become suspect. I am supported in this by an editorial in the Canberra Times which, after commenting that other journalists had not been allowed to visit East Timor-I will have more to say about this later-stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hastings would have welcomed, of course, a general invitation to foreign media to send to East Timor correspondents selected by themselves. Then his own position would not have been so lonely and exposed. Journalists believe in competition for the truth and they believe that their own reports should be tested by the reports of their competitors, if the people they serve are to be well informed and also convinced. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, Mr Hastings was not served well by the Indonesian Government in being closely associated during his visit with Mr Whitlam, another man of integrity but also the Prime Minister responsible for Australia's controversial foreign policy during the planning period for Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in December, 1975. Again, the purpose of the Indonesian Government's special invitation to Mr Hastings and Mr Whitlam becomes apparent when it is realised that the Minister for Information, General Ali Murtopo, is the man who planned the political preliminaries to the invasion and that the head of BAKIN (the Indonesian security intelligence body), General Murdhani, was the commander of the invasion forces. It has to be asked why such men would want Mr Hastings and Mr Whitlam to visit East Timor and not, apparently, other foreign observers? The question is unfair to both Mr Hastings and Mr Whitlam, but it is one to which Indonesian policy has now subjected them. </PARA>
<PARA>In no way do I cast any aspersions on Mr Whitlam, our former leader, or on Mr Hastings, who is not known to me but whose integrity I have no reason to question. I am not saying that the account is biased but simply that there is insufficient evidence to enable us to make any sort of comment on the situation in East Timor. If we wanted to speak about it we would need a balance by looking at reports from other people or making observations ourselves. I will discuss this matter later. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the matter of family reunification which I have raised previously in the chamber. The Northern Territory News article to which I referred earlier stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Red Cross team now in East Timor was doing a survey which might result in an accurate list of people who had families in Australia, the Chief Minister, Mr Everingham, said yesterday . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The President-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the President of Indonesia-</PARA>
<PARA>had said that people would progressively be allowed to leave Indonesia to rejoin their families in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chief Minister said that once the Red Cross team had prepared its list of people, the Australian Embassy would be consulting it to make arrangements 'for Timorese people to come progressively to Australia as all their formalities such as passports, exit visas and so on are cleared up'. </PARA>
<PARA>It is rather interesting that this is the same Mr Everingham who was not very happy with the Indonesian Government in 1976. A newspaper article which referred to Mr Everingham's visit stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Back in 1976 Mr Paul Everingham, then Deputy Leader of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, castigated the Indonesians over the 'continued slaughter of innocent men, women and children in East Timor'. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the lessons to be learnt from Timor, he told the Assembly, 'is that the Indonesian Government, although it may be bungling and inefficient, is nevertheless quite cold-blooded and ruthless. It will be friendly to us only as long as we continue to appease it or do not get in its way'. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I rather more admire,' he continued, 'the diplomats from the Soviet Bloc than our own diplomats because at least they have the guts, or if they don't have the guts, they have the instructions, to stand up and say what they want.'</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is rather interesting when we recall that Mr Everingham is the Leader of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory, the Chief Minister of the Legislative Assembly at the present time and one who certainly is no friend of Soviet Russia. Mind you, he has had a change in attitude. I will come back to this later. The comments made in the statement by Mr Everingham about family reunification seem most encouraging. But let us take the matter a little further. Let us look at the record. On 30 March 1977 the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr MacKellar, made a statement in the other place in which, in part, he said. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to inform the House that agreement has been reached with the Indonesian Government concerning arrangements for the reunion of East Timorese in Australia and their close relatives from Timor . . . The Australian Government has very much in mind the distress occasioned by the separation of families and arrangements are proceeding for the visit to East Timor to take place as early as circumstances permit . . . It is necessary to set a closing date for receipt of nominations so that the operation can proceed as quickly as possible. Nominations received by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs up to close of business on 22 April 1977 will be considered in this operation. </PARA>
<PARA>The full statement was rather lengthy. It was reacted to by the shadow spokesman at the time, Mr Innes, who noted amongst other things that the Minister had used what Mr Innes called unusual definitions. He said that throughout the statement the Minister had used the word 'refugee' to describe people from East Timor. He did not use the word 'evacuee', although that word was used later on. He did not use the phrase 'asylum seekers' which Senator Durack used the other day in this place. This does not seem very important until we see later that refugee status is important in terms of coming to Australia and getting assistance. I do not want to pre-empt what I will say later, but let me just comment that one of the problems that we faced in the Northern Territory was to get the Minister to accept the fact that the people from East Timor are refugees within the term of a statement from the United Nations. If we regard them as ordinary immigrants it is more difficult to get them out; it is more difficult to meet the requirements that have been changed since 1977. I do not want to get in front of what I have to say in the other context. The saga continues on 3 June when the former Senator Justin O'Byrne asked a question. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it correct that the Government does not consider the East Timorese people in Australia to be refugees but evacuees. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, answering that part of the question, replied:</PARA>
<PARA> For many years victims of many different circumstances have been called refugees. These have included displaced and stateless persons, those seeking political asylum, defectors, members of oppressed minorities and victims of natural disasters. </PARA>
<PARA>It is rather interesting that Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle later on defends the use of the term 'evacuees' as one of the reasons why the people from East Timor-those that we would call refugees-were not being brought to Australia. We jump now to March 1978, 12 months later, when Senator Button and Senator Missen, after attending a meeting in Victoria, both came into the chamber and in the adjournment debate raised the problems of the people in East Timor. Senator Button, in an excellent speech, reported that nothing had happened in the previous 12 months. During his comments he quoted a report of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid. Speaking of East Timor specifically, the ACFOA had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> ACFOA is concerned that the Minister appears to be reneging on his former statements regarding the acceptance of refugees from East Timor. It is particularly concerned about the change in criteria which will not allow many people to come from East Timor to be reunited with their families. </PARA>
<PARA> ACFOA believes that the continual lack of action regarding the reuniting of families from East Timor, separated since the latter part of 1975, is causing emotional hardship and possible long term psychological damage both to those who are already here and those separated from them. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> ACFOA believes that the past ambiguities of Australian policy towards East Timor have resulted in confusion and the raising of false hopes amongst East Timorese people. We should therefore regard all East Timorese wishing to come here as refugees and treat them as such. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Missen, when he spoke, again drew attention to the lack of activity over the previous 12 months and mentioned the reply given by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle on refugees. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements for reuniting East Timorese now in Australia with their relatives either in Australia or in East Timor follow from an agreement between the President of Indonesia and the Prime Minister of Australia that officials of their two countries would meet to resolve the problems of the East Timorese ' refugees' who had come to Australia without their parents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Indonesian authorities have given their agreement in principle to a visit by Australian officials to East Timor to interview migrant applications sponsored-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Missen went on to say in his remarks:</PARA>
<PARA> That still awaits. The situation is that we do not have a team. We have not reached a situation where any of our specialists can go there and see the position. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to be very critical of his own Government and its treatment of the people of East Timor and the slow movement of people to Australia for the reunification of families. In defining families he again referred to the report by the ACFOA where families were defined in this way:</PARA>
<PARA> 'families' should be widely interpreted in the terms of the culture and background of the refugees concerned rather than according to the normal criteria of Australian immigration procedures-this would involve the acceptance, appropriate to each particular ethnic group, of degrees of what we might describe as 'extended families'. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is a point which has been made in this place many times by many honourable senators. Certainly I have raised it on a number of occasions when I have spoken particularly about the people from China and the ethnic Chinese from Timor. Senator Missen went on to talk about the problems of individual case histories. He called for a team to visit East Timor, something which we have done over the years as well. It is good to see that both sides of the chamber see the problems in East Timor. Senator Missen continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Our responsibility as I see it is, firstly, urgent and effective pressure from Australia for the acceptance by Indonesia of an Australian immigration team in Timor and the achievement of early reunion of families from there; secondly, for a more compassionate re-examination of the Portugal refugee program and the bringing from Portugal of many more of the people who are there at the moment and who want to come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He noted in his address that the Indonesian Government said that visits would be arranged after the election. I quote again from Senator Missen's speech. He said :</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Indonesian Government has advised that arrangements for a visit to East Timor by a Department of Immigration team will be discussed after the elections this month. It is therefore anticipated that a visit will take place in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we are talking of the elections not of 1981 or 1982 but of 1978. Senator Missen was speaking in 1978 about the elections which would be held then . It is interesting to see that the comments made in that original article that I read, noting Paul Everingham's visit to Timor, were related to problems associated with the election and pointed out that we would be able to do these things after the election, not in 1977 or 1978 but in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> We jump now to 1980 when a question was asked in this place referring to an article in the National Times regarding Australia-East Timor family reunion. The question was:</PARA>
<PARA> Will the Minister comment on this report and, in particular, on the claim that Indonesia appears to have slammed the door on further departures from East Timor of people included in the Australia-East Timor reunion scheme? Is it correct that to date only half of the 600 refugees approved by the Indonesian Government to join family members in Australia under the scheme have in fact been granted permission by the Indonesian authorities to do so?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister responded by saying that the Government was very unhappy at the slow progress of movement of people from East Timor for family reunification in Australia. It put the blame squarely back on the Indonesian Government by saying that Indonesian immigration procedures were slowing things up. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the present situation, in March 1982? The answer is that people are still waiting. Of the original 2,500 in Timor who said that they wanted to join their families in Australia-honourable senators will recall that that number was cut by the Indonesians from 2,500 back to 600-only 300 have arrived in Australia . People are still in Portugal and in other countries. I realise that they are not the responsibility of Indonesia. We should simply be concerned about the 2, 500 people who want to come to Australia. Honourable senators will recall that that number was cut to 600. They are still not regarded by the Australian Government as refugees; they are still regarded as either evacuees, ordinary migrants or asylum seekers, as Senator Durack has said, although I must admit that I do not know the definition of an 'asylum seeker'. Perhaps an asylum seeker is someone from the Soviet Union in a red bikini who jumps off a boat. Perhaps that is different from a refugee or an evacuee or someone wanting to come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We still have problems with passports. The Indonesians are making much of this. Honourable senators will recall that when East Timor was a province of Portugal the people of East Timor had the choice of a Portuguese passport or, if they happened to be of Chinese ethnic origin, a Taiwanese passport. Obviously they would select the passport which suited the particular movement they wanted to take. At present Indonesia is demanding that people from East Timor take out Indonesian passports because it claims-we have accepted the de facto recognition and de jure recognition to follow some time later, despite the feelings of the people of Australia-that East Timor is now part of Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer back to Hastings's article. Hastings comments very favourably on the education of the East Timorese people, who are now attending good Indonesian schools, learning from good Indonesian text books in the Indonesian language. This is seen as a great improvement for the people of East Timor. Yet we have to be very careful about Mr Hastings because he said that the Fretilin people, those few who were still up in the hills, were just a nuisance. </PARA>

The people in East Timor, who are fighting for their own country were pests to the Indonesian Government and, of course, would be wiped out. I do not have to go through the comments that have been made in this place by myself and others about the action that was taken by the Indonesians either to starve out the Fretilin people or to 'encourage' them to come out of the hills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Indonesian authorities are demanding that people from East Timor should have Indonesian passports. Of course, once one gets an Indonesian passport one cannot be seen as a refugee. Quite clearly, if one is carrying an Indonesian passport and one lives in East Timor one is very happy with the situation in Indonesia and would not want to leave. We know that bribes are still being required of those people who insist on trying to come from East Timor to Australia, that bribes are required to move from East Timor to Jakarta and that bribes are required to move from Jakarta to Australia. As I have said in this place before, there was only one occasion when Australian officials were involved in this. When I drew this to the attention of the responsible Minister, to his great credit, he made sure that no Australian officials-the people involved were locally recruited-were involved in the bribery. Bribery is not indulged in by the Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions must be asked. Is Indonesia dinkum about what it is doing? Is it really interested in the well-being of those people in East Timor? We hear a lot from Mr Hastings about the improvement of the roads, about the fact that there is more food than there was a few months ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what we are not sure about. I do not want to comment too much because, as I said earlier in my speech, we do not have the information . We have had only one report from a man who was invited by the Government to go there. We have to be a little careful. I will come to the suggestion that we be allowed to see for ourselves. Then we will be able to answer perhaps, more clearly, the honourable senator's question. I come back to the Australian situation. Are we doing enough or is our concern for trade and oil overriding our obligations to these people who are our former allies? I think I will leave that aspect and move on to the need for Indonesia to open the door to Australia. The editorial in the Canberra Times of 13 March opens in this way:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> ''There is no doubt that Indonesia now has a story to tell. It would be dreadful, counter-productive waste of all its efforts and those of others, if it does not begin to allow more foreign journalists and observers in to see for themselves,'' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst that is part of the Canberra Times editorial it is actually a quotation from something which Mr Peter Hastings, a foreign editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, had written. The Canberra Times used this quotation from Hastings to open up what it had to say. I will leave and come back to that quotation in a moment. The Canberra Times agreed with what Mr Hastings had saw in its introduction to editorial. The Canberra Times noted that Australian journalists had been excluded from Indonesia. It noted that the Australian Broadcasting Commission was not allowed to have a resident correspondent in East Timor. It noted that foreign journalists were not allowed in. The Canberra Times stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As The Times, London, wrote in an editorial on February 24, 'Indonesia has obviously not won over the hearts and minds of the East Timorese, and her very unwillingness to allow independent observers access to the territory corroborates that'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Canberra Times makes the editorial comment:</PARA>
<PARA> If The Times is mistaken and the East Timorese have been won over, then why has its correspondent in Singapore, Mr Watts, been refused permission to go there?</PARA>
<PARA>I am trying to make the point that Mr Hastings was invited. He was quoted in the article. The Canberra Times went on to say that other Australian journalists are not allowed in, no other foreign journalists are allowed in and the ABC has not been allowed to have a correspondent there since the famous occasion when one ABC man was drummed out of Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a personal situation. I have been trying to get to East Timor for years. I make two or three requests a year; they have all been rejected for various reasons. I will not go into those reasons now but they are fairly wide ranging-from the fact that the East Timorese were unsettled and did not want me in East Timor to the situation that it is very difficult to live there at present. I make the point strongly-I think this is the point that Senator Coleman was coming to earlier on-that politicians need to go to East Timor to see for themselves what is going on. Mr Whitlam, when he came back from East Timor, told me that he went anywhere he wanted to go. He went with a Red Cross team. He had no officials with him. He did not have an Army interpreter; he had an interpreter who was part of the Red Cross team. He was allowed to go to any spot that he wanted to go to. This is good. I commend this. It is tremendous if a person-someone of Mr Whitlam's standing-can go to East Timor and be allowed to see anything that he wants to see. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the situation not the same for the rest of us who are interested, who have been interested over the years, who have been involved over the years and who, perhaps, have been a little more critical than Mr Whitlam has been of Indonesia and her relationship with East Timor but who, nevertheless, have had an involved interest? The Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has indicated that it wants to go to East Timor. I hope that it can go. I hope that the discussions which Senator Scott has had with the Indonesian Ambassador will mean that the Committee will go there, will be given the same freedom as Mr Whitlam was given and will be able to see whatever its members want to see in East Timor. I see this only as a first step. I see this as a step towards other people, other senators and members of the House of Representatives , if they are interested, being allowed to go to see for themselves what is happening in East Timor at present. </PARA>
<PARA> If, as Mr Whitlam indicates, things are better, I would be pleased to see for myself. I have a great warmth of feeling for the East Timorese people. I hope that their conditions have improved; certainly, from the reports given to me a couple of years ago, they could not have gotten any worse. I do not make that as a facetious comment. I hope that things have improved, that roads are being built, that crops are being developed, that people are being allowed to return to their own areas and live in them and are not being closeted together in the so-called protective villages-the same concept as was used with such devastating effect in Zimbabwe and as I understand it is being used in South Africa at present. I hope that we will be able to go and see whether the East Timorese people have accepted the yoke of the Indonesians, have agreed to become Indonesians, and whether there is a general feeling that they are now happy with their lot and are ready to open their doors to those of us from Australia who have such happy memories of East Timor and who would like to go back to re- establish that contact which we had years ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few remarks concerning society's response to the use of cannabis within our community. I take this course in the belief that all senators and all those who are in a position of having to make decisions concerning society's response to the circulation of this drug within the community have a common aim; that is, that we should create a society where the drug-ridden aspects, the inebriated aspects, of our society which have been so eloquently commented on by Senate committee reports fade away and are not perceived as inevitable features of our society in Australia and where recourse to drugs does not occur as a matter of addiction but rather as a matter of choice between properly understood health hazards and the natural desire of people to take some substance which is a relaxant or part of a recreational or social situation. In other words, can Australia move away from being the drug-ridden society it is claimed to be because of our abuse of alcohol, tobacco, analgesics, cannabis and other drugs--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, an intoxicated society, which is the sub-title of a report of one of our Senate committees. Can Australia move to a situation in which drugs are taken, if they are taken at all, with the full knowledge of the health hazards involved but as part of a general relaxation, a social, recreational pastime which is a feature of human cultures and societies? It is one thing to concentrate on the known health hazards associated with marihuana use, if I can use a colloquial term; it is another thing to alert us, as did Senator Walters in her contribution last week, to the emerging knowledge which might lead to more caution in the use of this drug and in society's reaction to its use than has hitherto been the case. There are reports emerging that certainly suggest that we need to undertake further study of the long term effects on individuals of the use of cannabis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe this approach is totally unbalanced if no consideration is given to the curious fact that society is latching on to the mere use of a drug and declaring it criminal. It is not saying, as it does with most criminal offences, that there is a victim quite apart from the offender-somebody who is the victim of the offender's actions, as in the case of murder, theft or whatever. It is not even saying, as in some of the old laws relating to those who are alcohol dependent in our society, that the person is drunk and disorderly or drunk and incapable of taking care of himself. There is nothing of that nature. It is merely latching on to the fact that the person uses this particular drug. That should alert us to the fact that society is doing here something quite out of the ordinary which needs defending. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason I am pleased that we have now brought into the debate a discussion paper entitled 'Social Policies on Drugs' prepared by a national workshop convened by the Australian Foundation on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence . The document which that workshop put together is, as is said in the foreword, not a blueprint for social reform but a paper which demands serious study of all the issues involving the framing of our social policies. In the section dealing with cannabis use it says:</PARA>
<PARA> The participants were unanimously of the view that it is most important that the proposals should be introduced only after widespread community debate, including debate in the several parliaments of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>As part of the contribution to that debate in the several parliaments of Australia I wish to offer my views which, as it happens, largely coincide with the views of the participants who put together that discussion paper. Those participants are worthy of our respect, if not of our automatic concurrence. They include such people as Mr Justice Michael Kirby, Chairman of the Law Reform Commission of Australia, Professor Narelle Lickiss, Head of the Department of Community Medicine at the University of Tasmania, and Mr John Toohey of the Drug and Alcohol Office of the Labor Council of New South Wales. Those people cannot be dismissed, as I have so often been dismissed in past years, as trendy radicals. They are people who deserve and command the respect not only of those who know their work within their own fields but also of the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made the point that we are dealing here with a peculiar sort of law. Those who take Senator Walters's point of view invariably fail to mount a defence of the impact of the present law on those individuals who fall foul of it and on society as a whole. Those who argue for the status quo have to mount an argument, I believe, for the continuance of the total prohibition model, the model which was adopted by the United States in relation to trying to prevent alcohol abuse in the 1920s and 1930s with all the disastrous results which flowed from it. That is the model that has been adopted in Australia to deal with the problem of cannabis abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me list two or three of what I believe to be the quite disastrous social impacts which the present law has. Firstly, it means that we have really devised a system whereby, upon conviction, the lives of many Australians are blighted. Their careers can be put in jeopardy and their jobs taken away from them. Years of training can be undone. These things happen to Australians who potentially offer so much to the community-law abiding, decent, ordinary Australians who, because they are among the very few who are detected, prosecuted and convicted as a result of using this drug, have attached to them a stigma of conviction which they must carry through the rest of their lives in a way which affects very adversely their opportunities to contribute by the use of their skills in a profession or job of their choice and their opportunities to travel to certain countries because then they have to apply to a passport. So the stigma of conviction attaches to a few. I emphasise 'a few', and I will return to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> A second effect of the present law is that many hundreds of thousands of Australians find themselves in a semi-criminal subculture in which they must deal in order to obtain this drug. In other words, many Australians find themselves in a shadowy world in which I believe they are now vulnerable to those who wish to lead them on to the use of harder drugs. Ultimately the distribution of marihuana in the main is controlled by criminal syndicates, as we know. So our young people in particular are put into a social situation in which they are vulnerable to the progression to harder drugs. There is no pharmacologically-proven progression. If one starts with marihuana one will not invariably end up taking heroin. But it is almost always true that those who are heroin addicts began on marihuana. In the same way, those who start with a beer do not end up as alcoholics but those who are alcoholics probably started with beer. The fact is that these people find themselves in a situation in which they are likely to be vulnerable to the pressures to go on to harder drugs. Let it be understood, as I am sure it is by many here, that when there is a drought in the availability of marihuana, invariably the harder drugs are offered as a substitute by those who have a profit motive in leading young people into the use of harder drugs. Of course, society is ensuring that there is a ready flow of cash to the criminal syndicates for them to finance their more nefarious and socially destructive activities. It is a peculiar situation in which a legal system creates such problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there is the effect on our law enforcement officers-the police officers, the Customs officers and the Narcotics Bureau personnel, the people on the street and in the cars trying to enforce these laws, and the top administrators. The pressure on them exhibits itself, as the report says, in simple stress in that they are involved in an area of law enforcement which is not widely understood or supported by the community. This adds to the stress of an already difficult job. Further, of course, many opportunities for corruption arise when such large sums of money are at stake. Very large sums of money are at stake and, as we know, corruption does occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, and related to that, because for many hundreds of thousands of young Australians their only awareness of the criminal law, their only consciousness of it-the fear that they may be breaking the law or in peril-is in relation to their marihuana use, they develop, if not a contempt of the law, an indifference to the rule of law because they regard it as absurd. It is a bad situation for society when this indifference to the rule of a law is so widespread. It means that, eventually, there is an indifference to the democratic parliamentary institutions which support and sustain such laws. </PARA>
<PARA> Which young Australians are we speaking of? I did a survey, when I was at the University of Tasmania, of those who were convicted for marihuana use in 1975 and 1976. There were 821 convictions in Tasmania for offences relating to marihuana; 111 were recorded against labourers and 288 against the unemployed. That is, 50 per cent of those convicted for offences were either labourers or unemployed. Yet it would be a very brave person indeed who would say that 50 per cent of the users of marihuana in Tasmania were labourers or unemployed. In other words, the law latches on to those who are vulnerable and most defenceless in our society, those who are living perhaps in groups, in poor dwellings or in certain defined areas of town where the drug squad can operate most effectively and freely in order to get its monthly quota of convictions. We as legislators ought to be protecting the poor, the defenceless and the vulnerable in society instead of creating criminal laws which invariably have their impact on them. The fact is that the use of marihuana is extremely widespread. The discussion paper is of the view that a survey carried out by the Age is a valid one. A table was produced showing the percentages--</PARA>

The figures were as follows: For the 60 years and above age group, 1 per cent of the population; 45 to 59 age group, 3 per cent; 35 to 44 age group, 8 per cent; 25 to 34 age group, 26 per cent; 21 to 24 age group, 42 per cent; 18 to 20 age group, 37 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. My point is that each of those persons, some 42 per cent in the 21 to 24 year age group, was a potential criminal according to the sorts of laws which the honourable senator is defending. In other words, if they had been unfortunate enough to be the subject of detection by a drug squad detective, to be charged, prosecuted and successfully convicted, their lives would be blighted . They would have the stigma of a criminal conviction which would affect their careers, job opportunities and their travel abroad for the rest of their lives and would lead to the horrendous consequences that I have outlined. But the fact is that that number of people will never be detected because the criminal law is used against the poor and the defenceless. My statistics from Tasmania show that that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe it is in that order. In the 60 years and above age group only one per cent of the population use marihuana but in the 21 to 24 year age group 42 per cent of the population use it. The scale establishes that young Australians are using this drug to a very great extent. The fact is that only a minority are detected. The law is enforced in a way which reinforces the drug stereotype which the general community is invited to believe, that the normal drug user, the user of marihuana, is somehow a layabout, hippie, unemployed labourer type. In fact, use of marihuana is across all classes of society but the law is directed to the poor, the vulnerable and the defenceless. I take very much to heart Lord Justice Lawson's words in an English case some six or seven years ago. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing to be said, and said very firmly indeed, is that Her Majesty's Courts are not dust-bins into which the social services sweep difficult members of the public. Still less should Her Majesty's judges use their sentencing powers to dispose of those who are socially inconvenient. If the courts become disposers of those who are socially inconvenient the road ahead would lead to the destruction of liberty. It should be clearly understood that Her Majesty's judges stand on the road barring that way. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that this Parliament, and other parliaments in Australia, should stand on the road with the judges barring that way, instead of requiring them to do what my figures for the situation in Tasmania show they are doing. To put it another way to summarise this part of my remarks, if society wanted to establish a mechanism which induced our young people into a semi-criminal sub-culture, which provided a situation of extreme stress and temptation for our law enforcement officers, which insured a cash flow to criminal syndicates for their more nefarious activities, which undermined respect for the law and ultimately for the parliamentary institutions which sustain those laws, it would adopt the total prohibition model in relation to marihuana-as did the United States in the 1920s in relation to alcohol with all these consequences.</PARA>
<PARA> I think I have established that the penal laws are totally inappropriate to achieve the aim which I said we all have in common, namely, to bring about a situation where in Australia we are not drug ridden, inebriated and intoxicated, but where the use of drugs as a relaxant-as social or recreational matter common to all human cultures-is undertaken as a matter of choice with good knowledge of the health risks involved. I believe that the potential users and the actual users of drugs will listen to information concerning those health risks-such as Senator Walters outlined last week-only if those potential or actual users believe that society is dealing in a fair-minded, even-handed way with drug use and abuse in our society. The discussion paper, in its foreword, states:</PARA>
<PARA> A rational society should seek to develop its control policies on all mood- altering substances on a common set of values. Integrity in our values will help ensure credibility of our actions. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the view of many hundreds of thousands of Australians, particularly young people, that we have a hypocritical society in which tobacco tycoons and brewery barons are festooned with honours every time Her Majesty has a birthday or celebrates New Year's Day. However, users of marihuana are subject to the full wrath of the criminal law when it selects them out for some sort of symbolic punishment-a punishment, of course, which acts as no deterrent at all. It has no deterrent value. But the law comes down with all its repression on the defenceless and vulnerable in our society whilst, as I said, having a well developed system of bestowing honours on the distributors of the other drugs which are common to our social system. What we have-it has been stated by others before-is really a witch hunt syndrome which most societies seem to need whereby all the evils are visited on one social activity and made the subject of severe punishment from time to time. It is a scapegoat, a witch hunt mentality which seems to be part of our society at the moment in relation to marihuana. We have made terrible mistakes in relation to the distribution and use of alcohol and tobacco in our society by making them--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walters" NAMEID="UJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator Walters</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So let's make another!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I am saying that we have made terrible mistakes by making them the source of private profit and government revenue. Nothing I would say about the way to deal with marihuana would see in our response to the circulation of alcohol or tobacco any model for dealing with marihuana. It should not be the source of private profit or public revenue. At the same time, as I have pointed out, we cannot allow a situation to continue in which the circulation of marihuana is the source of funds for criminal syndicates, the cause of corruption of our law enforcement agencies and places our young people in a more vulnerable situation of being prey in the shadowy sub-culture that they now inhabit when they want to deal for marihuana. It is time for a fresh approach and here, I believe, the discussion paper is extremely useful in putting forward proposals which I think may well command widespread support. I believe that several steps need to be taken over a period but in this order: Firstly, there must be an expunging, a wiping out, of the convictions and the stigma of conviction attached to so many hundreds and thousands of ordinary, decent Australians-otherwise law abiding members of our community-who presently have these convictions blighting the rest of their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rehabilitation of offenders legislation has been passed in the United Kingdom. I emphasise the word 'rehabilitation' because its aim is to bring back into full society those who have transgressed the laws relating to marihuana. We should do the same. We should expunge those convictions. In fact this has been recommended by royal commissions in this country. It is time the Parliament acted on that as a first step, as a token of faith in our young people, in particular. Society does not want to create such a situation that their careers and their lives will be in jeopardy for one transgression, for being selected out of a mass of offenders by a detective and the court processes set up by our own parliaments. That should be the first step. </PARA>
<PARA> The second step is that we should remove the criminal penalties for the use, or possession for personal use, of marihuana. One would only remove criminal penalties in relation to that simple use or possession for personal use. I am not saying, as Senator Walters tried to say last week, that there is not a problem in relation to the use of a motor vehicle whilst under the influence of marihuana or the use of industrial machinery while under the influence of marihuana. There are problems. Offences need to be created relating to the driving of motor vehicles or the use of industrial machinery while under the influence of marihuana. </PARA>
<PARA> A certain paragraph of the discussion paper states that in imposing penalties for driving while intoxicated by cannabis one needs at the moment to take into account urine or blood samples to detect the level of cannabis in the blood. Society has found, by the use of technology such as the breathalysers and so on, a means of detecting the levels of alcohol in a person driving under the influence of alcohol. I am not minimising the difficulty of finding a technology which measures accurately drugs in the system. One has also to take into account the fact that because cannabis is retained in the fatty tissues-I think that is right-there is a slower release than in the case of alcohol which is burnt up reasonably quickly. Therefore, it may be some time after one has used cannabis that the deleterious effects on the motor system become apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> We do have a problem. We have to have offences and penalties for the driving of motor vehicles or the use of industrial machinery while under the influence of drugs. There are difficulties there. But the point that I am emphasising is that in relation to the mere use or possession for use the criminal law should not operate. It is a most peculiar situation at the moment. There is no victim apart from the offender, as there is in the case of murder or theft. We do not even say that our policy is, as in relation to some of the old laws relating to alcohol, that person is drunk and incapable of taking care of himself. We merely say that a person's using the drug is sufficient for the criminal law to be applied. I argue against that proposition. We should remove criminal penalties for that simple social situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, and only concurrently with a very sophisticated campaign alerting Australians to the dangers of drug abuse, we should smash the criminal rackets, the shadowy subculture, the semi-criminal world in which many hundreds of thousands of Australians deal at the moment, by placing the production and distribution of this drug in the hands of a government monopoly. This should be done, as I stated before, in a way so that it is neither a source of private profit nor, I believe, a source of government revenue. When the distribution of a drug becomes a source of government revenue, as the ill-effects on our health become apparent over the years governments will be half-hearted in their reaction and in their campaigns against the use of that drug. Let us admit that that is one of the features of our half-hearted approach to the abuse of alcohol and tobacco in our community at the moment. While it is a source of revenue for the Treasury, governments will not act in a half-hearted manner to combat that abuse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I make my speech? Senator Walters made her speech last week. Will she please allow me to make my speech. I believe that it may well be the case that the distribution of this drug-this is a personal view, not the view of the discussion paper-ought to be through chemists' shops so that people are psychologically aware that they are purchasing a drug, and there is always a pharmacist on the premises. This would create a cautionary atmosphere, an atmosphere in which the drug is being produced and distributed through a government monopoly not set up for profit or for government revenue. The distribution should occur through registered pharmacists.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What do you say about growing marihuana for personal use?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My personal belief is that if society takes the bold step of allowing circulation of this drug by a government monopoly in the way that I have described, those who want to use the drug ought to accept that as a very significant change in our social attitudes. As part of that arrangement or deal they should refrain from producing the drug. To say that is not to stop them actually growing marihuana for personal use. I believe that it would be very difficult to devise a social system that could really combat that. I believe that if hundreds of thousands of Australians came to the view-a view that they do not presently have-that society was dealing in a fair way with the distribution of marihuana, and that they were getting a drug of controlled and known strength or strengths-there may be four or five types or packets available in the chemist shop-then they may not want to take the risk of growing and ingesting something of an unknown strength.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On a more general note, I believe that if society took this sort of approach we might create a society where the use of drugs-the escape, the addiction to drugs -may not be so widespread because we would, in fact, be creating a more tolerant society, a society where tolerance was seen as a moral virtue and, as I will argue in a moment, as a political virtue which I believe would have a spin-off. People would not feel the sorts of pressures that they presently feel as we live in a most intolerant and repressive society. Of course, the intolerance and repression is selective and generally visited on those least able to defend themselves, as I have pointed out. The Catholic Diocesan Pastoral Council made a submission to the Tasmanian House of Assembly Select Committee on Victimless Crime. I make it clear that it did not endorse the decriminalisation or legalisation of marihuana but in the course of its general submissions on the area of victimless crimes it said:</PARA>
<PARA> Law must keep close to the moral sense of the community and the moral sense of the community must inspire law. This is not repressive of minority opinion because in a civilised and Christian community tolerance of differing moral view -points and practices will be part of that general moral sense. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe if half of the moral outrage that we hear in this chamber on this type of issue were channelled into an equal sense of passion on behalf of the virtue of tolerance we could indeed create a structure of laws and of social attitudes to the use of marihuana and other mind-altering drugs which would create such a society that the need to escape in an addictive way into the use of drugs would be less common than it is now. Not only is tolerance a moral virtue; I believe it is also a political virtue. The very definition of a democracy is not simply a society where the majority, for the time being, makes the laws. If that was the definition we could easily have a majority acting in a most repressive, totalitarian way. A democracy is a society where the majority for the time being makes the laws but also where there is a tolerance of ways of life which do not involve violence but which might differ from those of the majority and a tolerance of people putting forward points of view dissenting from those of the prevailing majority. That is a tolerant democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in many ways the cannabis debate can be one of the touchstones of our attachment to democratic ideals. In any case I believe that the workshop of the Australian Foundation on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence has served the Australian community very well in the production of this report. It is too early to say what our legislative response ought eventually to be. In that respect I believe that Senator Chipp may wish to wait until there is further discussion and debate within the community before he moves in the way he indicated that he might. I believe we are a long way from coming to a proper legislative response from parliaments such as ours. But it is up to parliaments and chambers such as ours to help engender a responsible, creative and constructive debate in relation to this most serious social situation that we presently find ourselves in. I hope that other senators from time to time may contribute to that discussion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take advantage of the first reading of the Tobacco Charge (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1982 and associated Bills to raise matters relating to the Australian Federal Police, the Customs Bureau and the matters on Nugan Hand Ltd raised by my Leader, Mr Hayden, in the other place over the last several days. When we look back on the decisions of the Fraser Government to amalgamate the Australian Capital Territory Police and the Commonwealth Police to create the Australian Federal Police, the decision to disband the Narcotics Bureau and to have a drastic overhaul of law enforcement authorities at the Federal level it would appear that they were more than just mechanical decisions and arose from a great number of deficiencies and weaknesses that existed in these law enforcement agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent time we have seen a number of incidents which would indicate that we have reason, as a Parliament, to be very concerned about the Australian Federal Police. For example, we have seen the drop in morale and various transfers taking place in that organisation. Criticisms are constantly recurring in respect of the Customs Bureau. Criticism was made also about the activities of the Narcotics Bureau, particularly from 1975 until it was disbanded in 1979. The Government has failed to come clean on these matters and to present a factual and truthful report of the reasons why it took the steps it did in 1979 and 1980 to effect dramatic and drastic changes to these agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned at what appears to be an attempt by the Australian Federal Police to dramatise its activities. There is an element of theatre about the way in which the organisation carries out its activities, and about the persecution that takes place in the lower ranks of the force. I do no more than remind the Senate of the constant attempts by my colleague Senator Grimes to deal with the fiasco commonly known as the Greek conspiracy case and the very obvious attempts made by the Superintendent and some other leading members of the Australian Federal Police to gild the lily and in a Hollywood-like way attempt to create in the public mind the impression that the Australian Federal Police had something new and better in law enforcement at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Evans referred several weeks ago to the raids on Dr Wainer 's residence and surgery in Victoria. This is another element of the dramatisation of the activities of the Australian Federal Police. It was an attempt to create in the public's mind an impression of a degree of efficiency that clearly does not exist. The raid was an attempt to create in the minds of the public and the Parliament the impression that the organisation was carrying out a worthwhile task. I believe there is a need for the Parliament to be given information as to the real position in the Australian Federal Police. Hardly a week goes by that I do not have representations made to me by the lower ranks in the organisation about the dissatisfaction and concern that exists at middle management in the Australian Federal Police. I am prepared to exempt Sir Colin Woods, the Commissioner, from any great criticism that I make about the Australian Federal Police. I think he is a victim of circumstances. I think he is burdened with management at a lower level which makes it very difficult for him to handle properly the attempts being made by those who are firmly entrenched in the bureaucracy in the organisation itself. I say that because that is not only my impression but also the impression of the lower ranks of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer very briefly to one incident in recent times. I refer particularly to the Acting Assistant Commissioner, Mr Antill, who, together with some of his fellow officers at that ranking, is known to socialise very heavily with certain elements of the restaurant trade here in Canberra. As a result of such socialising he developed a relationship with a person whom he subsequently sponsored in an application for travel arrangements. The action was subsequently found to warrant some disciplinary action against the Assistant Commissioner. The Assistant Commissioner was known to be a very strict disciplinarian who always went out of his way to exert the sternest measures against some of the lower ranks for any actions that he considered as misdemeanours or constituting dereliction of duty. Mr Antill was a commissioner who had been promoted very rapidly in the service. He gave the green light to a passport clearance to a person subsequently found not to be of a character that would entitle him to those privileges by the Australian Government. He placed the then Minister for Immigration in a very embarrassing position. Of course, these matters were not dealt with in the way in which the matters of discipline are dealt with in the organisation; he was shifted sideways and made the officer in charge of the Northern Division. Of course, that creates, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would well imagine, a degree of concern and justifiable criticism by other members of the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the constant requests and demands that have been made by the Customs Officers Association, particularly those that were made by Mr Spanswick. I speak on behalf of those members who consider the activities of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to be unsatisfactory. I wish to deal also with matters which were partly dealt with by Mr Hayden last week and again this week. I refer to the information that came to hand regarding the Nugan Hand organisation. It might be recalled that in 1979 the Government took steps to disband the Narcotics Bureau. We were not given the real reasons for that. We were told that it was done in the interests of efficiency-the centralising of authority and so on. The facts that are starting to come out include that it was disbanded because some of the officers in the Narcotics Bureau were playing a double game in respect of drug trafficking and other related matters in this country. Persons involved in that organisation found great difficulty in expressing to the Government and to management their concern at some of the events that were taking place in that organisation. The Government took steps to disband it and, to that extent, it recognised that there was a problem. In mid- July 1979 the Government, I think as a result of information which is now becoming public, established a joint Commonwealth-State task force on drug trafficking. This arose as a result of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs conducted by Mr Justice Williams and the Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking conducted by Mr Justice Woodward. They were concerned about the drug problems-matters perhaps more serious than those raised in the very important contribution made by my colleague, Senator Tate, who preceded me in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Substantially that is where the matter has rested. We have been asking questions in the Parliament about the activities of the task force. I believe it is only because of matters that were raised by Mr Hayden last week and again this week that we finally flushed out from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser ) a statement which he gave to the Parliament in the last 24 hours. He indicated that some progress had been made on this question of Nugan Hand. The Government felt that it should act, and in this respect the Prime Minister made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that there is intense media interest in the activities of Riley, Wainwright and Nugan Hand; in the investigation by the Joint Drug Task Force of these activities, and in the anticipated report of the Force to the Governments on the investigation undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>He then stated why these matters should not be debated. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is thought likely that in due course criminal prosecutions will be commenced against a number of individuals named in the Report for drug, conspiracy, perjury and passport offences. </PARA>
<PARA>It has taken us from 1975 to 1982 to get to the point where some of these facts are being acknowledged by the Commonwealth Government. Information was given to the Narcotics Bureau way back in 1975 that there was a process by which drug trafficking was taking place in this country and that the Nugan Hand organisation was involved. Information from investigations was provided to the Government through the Narcotics Bureau. There was then the death of Mr Frank Nugan. I think it has been said that he committed suicide but when one reads the documents that are now available one has some doubts as to whether it was a suicide. Certainly there is a body of opinion that suggests that because of that gentleman's links with the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence gathering organisations in this country and in Asia there is more to it. Having regard to the whole problem of drug trafficking that is taking place in this country, particularly the importation of the hard drug heroin, in which the Nugan Hand organisation was involved, one does not have to be influenced by a conspiratorial mind to suggest that there is more to this than meets the eye. A lot of people at the government level and at the bureaucracy level have been warned about this. There is still much more to be done before we finally get to the bottom of this whole horrible operation. </PARA>
<PARA> One finds it difficult to understand why, several years ago, the Narcotics Bureau both in Canberra and in Sydney had consciously limited its investigations in this matter to background checks of a covert nature. Sections of our intelligence organisation took the extraordinary step of discussing this matter with the present leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. When he was interviewed back in 1977 I think he was spokesperson for the Liberal Party in the affairs of the Attorney-General. I know that he came to Canberra and discussed with Government Ministers information that was made available, as I saw him here and heard him discussing the matter with government Ministers in the parliamentary dining room. Information is available which shows that Mr Phillip Bailey of the Narcotics Bureau had this to say in a report as early as 14 November 1977:</PARA>
<PARA> If Nugan Hand Ltd, is involved in the drug business it is most likely as either a behind the scene financier of drug importations or as a means of laundering the money made from drug sales. The second possibility should take into account the information received on folio 65. </PARA>
<PARA>When Mr Hayden referred to a number of these documents in the House of Representatives he was assailed by the Government to produce evidence to substantiate some of the matters that were raised in these documents. It is an impossibility to be able to prove any matters concerning an organisation which is clearly clandestine and which is probably involved in counter-intelligence activities. The American Congress and the American Senate dealt with the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency of that country and with the activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Their reports show that it was only on the basis of the presentation of witnesses and documents which had not been destroyed that they were able to verify any matters through the appropriate parliamentary process. I find it rather strange that Mr Newman should be so sensitive when Mr Hayden raised these matters in the other place, when words have been bandied about in the Parliament suggesting something improper by the leader of my party, when he raised questions as a result of representations made to him. Indeed, these same representations have been made to me. </PARA>
<PARA> The Nugan Hand organisation, which was suspected of heroin importation, first came to the notice of the Narcotics Bureau in October 1975. It was a merchant bank that had a turnover of $220m in the year 1976-77. I know that journalists of the calibre of Brian Toohey and Marian Wilkinson have written a number of articles in the National Times about the role of Bernard Houghton and his links with the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States of America and about a number of admirals who have retired from the United States Navy and who are known to have been actively involved in Vietnam and in intelligence gathering. As these documents show, a whole group of these operators in Australia, the principals involved in the whole operation, are former United States citizens who have been naturalised as a result of their terms in Australia. They have played a covert role of some sort in laundering money and have been involved in illegal activities relating to currency and drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is very difficult for members of parliament to establish the veracity of these matters, but I think it is wrong to impute a lack of integrity or party political considerations when members of parliament ask questions and seek to have a judicial inquiry or some sort of public investigation into the very serious matters which have been raised, particularly by Mr Volkman. I am concerned that the Prime Minister in his statement said that the task force interim report, which is of a private and confidential nature, has been made available to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). In fact, if we look more closely at what the Prime Minister has said we will see that there is a certain restriction on the information contained in that report. Mr Acting Deputy President, having a legal background, you would know that a royal commission can deal with only those matters which fall within its terms of reference. The Stewart Royal Commission, which is currently examining a number of these matters , has very restrictive terms of reference. They are associated with drug trafficking as it relates to Mr Asia and that connection. They are narrow. Therefore I suggest that the wider matters which Mr Hayden has raised following the allegations made by Mr Volkman are not able to be properly dealt with in that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> So we are still confronted with only part of the story. We are still confronted with the wholesale manipulative process that has been part of the activities of the Nugan Hand organisation and its links with very important sections controlling finance capital in this country, with land development companies, with respectable banking institutions, with political parties, with prominent citizens and with criminals. We have before us an unholy mess, only part of which has come to the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate is to deal with another matter at 8 o'clock I will have to say what I want to say about Mr Volkman in the next few minutes. Mr Volkman was employed by the Commonwealth Government for a considerable number of years. His line of investigation accidentally got him into the position of lifting a small part of the curtain on Nugan Hand. He did not take kindly to the suggestion that was made to him by management in the Narcotics Bureau that there should be no further investigation by him and his fellow officers. He considered that it was his bounden duty to the community, to the Australian people, to see that this matter was properly ventilated, examined and investigated. Some members of the senior management in the organisation for which he worked decided to get him, to seek some vengeance because he had refused to be part of the cover-up arrangements relating to Nugan Hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, whether he is guilty of the charges that have been preferred against him is not for me to say. But I think you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would agree that when an officer of such an organisation-a public servant, a person who has given long service to the community, to the people-has been subjected to committal proceedings for 16 days in the Court of Petty Sessions under Stipendiary Magistrate Nash in New South Wales and it has been found that there was not a case to answer, one is entitled to ask why the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, has filed an ex officio indictment against Mr Volkman and why the Commonwealth authorities have approached the New South Wales Supreme Court seeking a period of six to eight weeks to deal with the charges preferred against Mr Volkman and others. The maximum penalty for the charge which has been preferred against Mr Volkman is $1,000. The judge, when asked to set aside that period, made a very pertinent and relevant point. He asked why the Commonwealth should be so concerned when the maximum fine, assuming that there was a case of guilt, would be a mere $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Volkman has made allegations and has provided a number of documents which are in the hands of the Leader of the Opposition. He has asserted that a number of documents on the file relating to Nugan Hand have been destroyed. Mr Hayden has suggested that the way to test the veracity of the allegations by Mr Volkman would be to produce the files that deal with the Nugan Hand matter. Then we could get to the bottom of the extent to which leading members of the Australian establishment are involved in Nugan Hand and its activities. Mr Volkman has been supported by two other persons, former colleagues of his who worked in this area . One is prepared to have his name used publicly and the other, for obvious reasons, is not. I spoke earlier about the persecution that takes place in the Australian Federal Police and the Bureau of Customs. One can understand the reluctance of the second person to be identified, having regard to what he knows to be an attempt, as we see it, to frame or get even with Mr Volkman. In addition, Mr Spanswick has reiterated his call on behalf of his organisation for a full scale investigation by the Government into the Bureau of Customs. One is entitled to say that on all the evidence that is available there is something rotten in the state of our law enforcement agencies; that there is a case for an examination of the allegations that have been made; and that there is a case for the Parliament, if not to be involved in its own right, to seek to have an investigation into these allegations. I cannot imagine why Mr Spanswick speaks continuously about these matters in his own right when, in fact, he claims to be speaking on behalf of all the people who have been involved in investigations into the Nugan Hand operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister indicated very clearly in his statement that in the establishment of the Commonwealth task force it was necessary to have the support of the New South Wales Government and its Corporate Affairs Commission. He indicated that the task force has 11 New South Wales police officers, five Australian Federal Police officers and one Corporate Affairs Commission officer. It is within the knowledge of members of parliament and interested members of the public that the Corporate Affairs Commission in New South Wales has been carrying out a very extensive investigation into the Nugan Hand organisation. Today, in the New South Wales Parliament, documents were tabled which indicate that Mr Nugan, who was one of the principals in the organisation, which was set up deliberately, was prepared to pay a large sum of money to anyone who was prepared to frame the New South Wales Attorney-General, Mr Frank Walker. That story was in the news and was made public in the New South Wales Parliament today. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not talking about fairy tales. We are not trying to create a conspiracy that does not exist. We are talking about facts. Law enforcement officers are involved in the drug scene in Australia. Certain people whose task it is to protect the Australian people and the users of hard drugs, are involved in drug distribution. It is quite clear that heroin is imported into this country on a massive scale. There is an interchange of opinions between honourable senators about marihuana. The use of that drug is child's play compared with the massive importation of heroin that is taking place in this country. It is not for me to suggest how it is coming in, but it obviously is. There is massive importation and disruption of our law enforcement agencies. It is an area in which there is a great deal of corruption. I do not believe it is possible for drugs to be continually brought into our country without the involvement of people in high places. It is impossible for ordinary John Citizen to be involved in this process of importation. Drugs are clearly coming into the country with connivance. It may be happening behind the scenes, but it is coming into this country in a successful way and our law enforcement agencies are failing to deal adequately with the problem. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>I comment, briefly, that the amendments came about as a result of a number of things. Most of the amendments came about by consultation with the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland and, in particular, by consultation with the National Aboriginal Conference representatives from Queensland. Other amendments came about because Senator Missen, Senator Bonner and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, raised issues concerning the first draft of the Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Self-Management and Land Rights) Bill. Most of those comments have been accommodated. I think all of the substantive issues raised by Senator Missen have now been accommodated by way of amendments. There are also amendments which I prepared myself to overcome some of the technical problems with the drafting. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of the amendments is to clarify those parts of the Bill which were not sufficiently clear, to strengthen some of the self-management provisions in the Bill, to put into the Bill the normal kind of parliamentary scrutiny of the regulatory making powers of the councils and to clarify, in particular, clause 14 which provides that all of the laws of Queensland shall apply to reserves except those laws which are prescribed by the Minister, and they will be prescribed only if they are discriminatory towards Aboriginals and Islanders. Those honourable senators who have been actively involved in debate over this Bill have had the amendments in hand for a couple of days. Other honourable senators will have received them recently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the amendments that have been moved . I agree that most of them relate to recommendations by the Queensland Aboriginals. Senator Ryan pointed out that when this matter was being debated at the second reading stage I was in general support, but I was concerned particularly with clause 14 because it appeared that it allowed a very sweeping opportunity to remove the laws of Queensland, including even human rights laws and laws which, of course, were for the benefit of people in the reserves as well. I agree that the amendments Senator Ryan has put forward, which enable the prescribing of laws in Queensland so that the Commonwealth Minister can set out those laws which ought to be not required to be complied with by members of the reserve, now make considerable sense in relation to this clause and, I believe, make the Bill quite workable. Honourable senators are well aware that Senator Bonner spoke last week and expressed views on the proposals which the Queensland Government had made alleging that land rights were to be given to people in the reserves in Queensland.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, indeed it was. What is not compelling is the proposal of the Queensland Government. Honourable senators will remember that the debate on this Bill was deferred for a period to enable the Queensland Government to come up with a genuine offer of land rights for the people of the reserves. What has come up since are really just proposals contained in statements. As far as I know there are no signs of a Bill. Certain rights are proposed under the relevant lands Act which can be abolished at any time by the Queensland Government. I do not find that, in any way, a genuine offer of land rights for the Aboriginal population of Queensland. I know from the people and the many organisations which have made representations to me that they do not find this offer acceptable and in accordance with the obligations which we, as a Federal Government, accepted in the 1967 referendum. It would not be a fulfilment of our obligations to the people of Queensland. I do not see that the duty that we owe to Aboriginal people in Queensland is very different from what we owe to the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory or in other places. Of course, we have provided for land rights in the Northern Territory. In Queensland the offer , which so far has not even been translated into a Bill, as far as I know, is one which, of course, is open to be destroyed by the whim of the Queensland Parliament and does not give the security to which I believe Aboriginals in Queensland are entitled. I do not propose to expand on this in detail. Senator Bonner has said more on this subject. I support him most strongly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having supported the second reading of this Bill last year and finding no reason now to find acceptable the offer which the Queensland Government now makes, I believe this is a Bill which, with the sensible amendments in it, ought reasonably to be carried through this place. If there were other defects in the provisions of this Bill, of course, one would expect that before this Bill went through the House of Representatives the Federal Government would have ample time to look at it again. I have yet to see any commentary from the Federal Government on the terms of the Bill and the amendments. Of course, there is time . A Bill passing through the Senate has to go to the House of Representatives. Therefore, if there are any defects, it is well within the position of the Government to bring them forward and to debate them in the other chamber. I believe it is important that we pass this Bill. I believe the amendments which are now proposed make a very sensible piece of legislation that ought to have the support of this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I add another reason why it is important for the Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Self-Management and Land Rights) Bill 1981 to be passed. I refer to the unhappy circumstances that are developing in Queensland, where we face, as the Commonwealth Games approach, confrontations between the authorities and the Aboriginal people. Citizens-both black and white-will be caught up in that situation. The police forces will be involved and even, as was intimated in answer to a question by Senator McLaren, perhaps the armed forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill will give some satisfaction to the Aboriginal people that at least the Senate-and, I hope, the Parliament as a whole-recognises the rights of the Aboriginal people and will pass sensible legislation in connection with land rights. I cannot too strongly stress how important this is, how it will defuse the situation in Queensland and how it will take the initiative away from the Hinzes and, for that matter, the Premier of Queensland who are determined in some way to exacerbate the problem. For that reason I strongly support those who have taken the initiative and who have brought this Bill to this stage. I will not speak any longer because I hope that the Bill has a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak to clause 14 of the Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Self-Management and Land Rights) Bill 1981 because it is one of the clauses about which I had some grave reservations. I am very pleased to see that Senator Ryan has proposed an amendment to clause 14. It is certainly now acceptable to me. All of the clauses that have been changed are in keeping with what I would have wanted. They strengthen the Bill and make it a far better Bill than it was. That is no criticism of Senator Ryan' s earlier Bill. These provisions have strengthened the Bill and have made it a much better Bill. It can be said that the passage of this Bill at this time may be only an expression of opinion. We do not know what will happen to it when it leaves this place. We cannot be sure whether it will have as speedy a passage down at the other end of the building as I am sure it will have here. The Bill will be an expression of opinion of this chamber of the Commonwealth Parliament. It will give encouragement to the Aboriginal people not only of Queensland but also of all the other States where there is at the moment no land rights legislation before the Houses of Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am proud again to have the opportunity of standing up in this chamber and supporting this Bill as I did on the last occasion with my colleague Senator Missen. There were two or three other people on this side of the chamber who I am quite sure have a great deal of sympathy and support for what we are endeavouring to do in the passage of this Bill. Senator Georges touched on a very important point. Senator Georges is concerned that-I too am concerned- confrontation could occur in our State during the Commonwealth Games. I pray that that will not happen. I hope it will not be necessary for Aborigines to offer any kind of protest, demonstration or whatever. I hope that we will be able for the first time in my State of Queensland to bring justice to the indigenous people of that State. I still have some small hope that the Queensland Government will come good-to use a common Australian expression-that it will, as it were, produce the goods in what it is endeavouring to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I pointed out in my speech here recently what is wrong with the Queensland proposal. We do not have any legislation. We do not have a Bill or anything like that. I availed myself of a copy of the Act which will govern the proposal that has been put forward by Queensland. All the things that I said the last time I spoke on this issue are in that Act for anyone to see. The proposal certainly is a most unacceptable proposal if it is to remain as it is at the moment. I sincerely hope that that will not be the case and that, with the passing of this Bill in its amended form, some encouragement will be given to the Government of Queensland to come up with a better proposal. If that happens Senator Ryan will have served the indigenous people of this country very well indeed. </PARA>

I am quite sure that he and the Senate would be unwilling to pass this Bill and send it to the House of Representatives unless it were in the best possible form that could be supported by the majority of senators. Therefore, I hope that the Minister, if he has any comments on any of these amendments, particularly any that he feels need to be altered, would put his argument now. If not, I suppose that we could assume that since the Bill would have been looked at in detail by the Minister we probably have what might be the best Bill, given the collective resources of individual senators and the Government, and may now pass this Bill to the House of Representatives for its deliberation and, I hope, passage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I might speak briefly at the third reading stage to set out the Government's position, but it is appropriate to speak now at the Committee stage to respond to the point made by Senator Macklin. I believe that we received the amendments last night. There has not been a lot of time to look at the amendments that have been circulated, so we have a number of questions and queries. I make it clear that this is a private senator's Bill; it is not a Government Bill. The Government still does not support the Bill for reasons which I will set out later and, therefore, I have some queries which I think Senator Ryan can probably answer. I will take them seriatim, if I can, and ask them one at a time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The definition of 'Aboriginals' that Senator Ryan has used in clause 3 of the Bill requires that an Aboriginal person be one who is 'identified as such by the community in which he lives'. I do not believe that any Commonwealth statute uses the three-part working definition of an Aboriginal. The question arises as to how the definition will work. For example, what rights of appeal will people have if they are not so certified by their community? It may be that they will have no rights as Aboriginals under this legislation. So there is an appeal procedure under the Act using the definition in the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The definition was broadened to include the phrase 'identified as such by the community in which he lives' at the request of the National Aboriginal Conference. It goes beyond the constitutional definition of Aboriginal and Islander but we believe that it is a constructive suggestion by the National Aboriginal Conference because it will solve the problem of people coming into a community in order to participate in the ownership of land when those people are not acceptable to the community. If an unacceptable person were attempting to participate in the ownership of the land, that would be a disruptive situation. We believe that the communities can identify their genuine members and that this would help to create social harmony . There is no appeal procedure in the Bill as yet. If the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) would like to suggest one, I am sure we could consider it. There is in the Bill provision for a disputes commissioner. Perhaps the disputes commissioner could also have the task of hearing an appeal against the non-according of resident status to a person. I suggest that the disputes commissioner could be given that extra function.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This definition is almost identical to the definition used by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It is almost the definition used for National Aboriginal Conference elections. It is not word for word the same. The definition used by the Department and for NAC elections is that an Aborigine is a person of Aboriginal descent who identifies as such a person and is accepted in the community in which he lives as such a person. That is almost identical to the definition used here. I do not understand why there should be a need for a disputes committee or whatever, because the Department does not have a disputes committee. If someone is rejected for a house or for a housing loan because he does not fit that criterion, there is no appeal that I know of.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This is not my Bill. I am merely drawing out some of these problems. I said very clearly that the definition is not in any other statute. It is correct that it is used by my Department. Recently I was in Tasmania talking to Aboriginal communities there. One of the subjects they brought up for discussion was the difficulty which this definition gives to that community in making it work. One of the questions they brought to me was: Who certifies that someone is accepted as such by the community in which he lives? The question of an appeal procedure came up. I am just making the point that Senator Ryan, by using this definition, may be building in a power of veto against which someone has no appeal. I am not certain that it sits well with clause 18, I think, in which reference is made to the rights of a person who was born in a community. I am not sure how that person's rights are going to sit with the need to be an Aboriginal according to this definition. This definition, because it is now in a statute, may be testable. I just ask whether the honourable senator has thought through the difficulties she might have with the definition and whether she requires an appeal mechanism. As no one has risen to answer that point, I leave it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to clause 7 and ask Senator Ryan: Is it a fact that this is the first of several amendments which change words which were previously in the Bill? Senator Ryan used the words 'Aboriginal and Islanders' and changed them to 'persons'. I think she has also done that in clauses 9 and 10. I just ask whether this change will meet the constitutional validity test; that is to say, can the power to make special laws for the people of any race give to the Parliament the power to make laws, or to authorise the Aboriginal councils to make laws, to apply to any persons? Has Senator Ryan thought through whether she might have created problems for herself in terms of constitutional validity by changing those words in that way?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The replacing of the phrase ' Aboriginal and Islanders' by the word 'persons' occurs a number of times throughout the Bill. It creates a situation whereby the councils are responsible for all persons living on the reserves but responsible to Aboriginal and Islander people only. The Aboriginal councils will be able to make by-laws, in respect of which, by the way, there will be parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance procedures, and everbody living on the reserves will be obliged to live by those by-laws. I would think that the same sorts of constitutional powers that allow any local council to make by-laws would be the appropriate powers here-not the special constitutional powers concerning Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) an example of the kind of situation which led us to accept this amendment, which was proposed by Aboriginal and Islander people. If a community makes a decision that alcohol will not be permitted on that community and makes a regulation to that effect and if that regulation is scrutinised and maintained by the Minister , by the Government, then any white person living on that community-a school teacher, an administrator or any such person-shall be bound by that regulation not to bring alcohol on to the reserve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what Senator Ryan has said in respect of this matter. I certainly think that this is a constitutional provision which will stand up. As she says, this happens in the Northern Territory. The provision as expressed in the original Bill suggested that in making special laws for Aboriginal people, the powers of the council which runs a reserve are confined to dealing only with Aboriginals; and teachers and others employed by the council who are not Aboriginals would be otherwise not under its control. I think that a special law for the race that is being protected here and given power over the reserves would be a very inadequate law. I have no real doubt that a proper power here is given to the council to make laws which also affect others who are on an Aboriginal reserve but who happen to be white Australians. To my mind that is a very useful and necessary power if the councils are to control the reserves properly. For these reasons I believe that it is one which should be upheld.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that such actions taken by the council are made by regulations and are subject to veto by this Parliament. That is not a constitutional point. From the point of view of ensuring that there are not too sweeping rights, that white Australians' general rights and privileges are not taken away from them, it is well within the competence of this Parliament in reviewing such regulations to ensure that that does not happen. So far as the constitutional position is concerned, I believe that this is a proper and competent power which can be given. Of course, it relates to a number of other amendments which will be made further down the line. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respond to one point. Again, I am just trying to bring out some of the problems that I have seen. Senator Ryan cannot compare a situation which exists in the Northern Territory. She is no doubt aware of section 122 of the Constitution, which creates a special capacity for the Commonwealth to make laws in respect of the Territory. I repeat that I do not agree with Senator Missen's interpretation . The power under which we are acting is one restricted to making laws for a person of any race for whom it is deemed necessary. I doubt that it is a capacity to make laws for any person.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously clause 12 gives a power to the Aboriginal land council to exclude from a reserve a person who is not an Aboriginal or Islander. Its ability to affect white Australians presumably has to be part of the authority that such a Bill gives. It must be able to extend to white Australians or there would be no power, for example, to exclude people. If the point that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) is making is correct, I think it does threaten to a very large extent the ability of the Aboriginals and Islanders under the rest of the Bill to control those lands in any real sense. If this Bill cannot affect Europeans in relation to who is allowed to enter or who is excluded from a reserve, presumably there is very little point in pushing ahead with the legislation. However, I would have thought it would be beter not to move these amendments, given the types of questions that have been raised, but instead rely on clause 12 which contains a fairly obvious power. If one could establish the reserves in such a way that white Australians or Aboriginals in some circumstances could be excluded from the reserves I think that that would give sufficient power to the council to pursue matters raised under the clauses referred to by the Minister, 7 and 9.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macklin raised an interesting point concerning the entry to reserves and communities dealt with in clause 12. A very similar proposition appeared in the Bill from which to some extent this Bill was copied. The Bill which this Government carried in 1978, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-Management) Act 1978, is a prototype. A number of provisions are similar. The provision in regard to entry into reserves and communities is differently phrased in section 12 of that Act which we passed. But essentially it has the same purpose. It provides that where the council for the reserves is satisfied that it is for the benefit of the Aboriginal community it may permit persons to reside or visit and it can so authorise. In other words in the Act which the Government passed in 1978 we make it clear that decisions can be made by the councils which may allow or forbid white persons to come on and go off reserves. So it hardly becomes the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) to speak as he did in the light of the legislation which the Government previously passed which deals with Queensland and which turned out to be ineffective legislation because the Queensland Government abolished the reserves. Nonetheless we relied upon those sorts of powers in 1978. It is very difficult to see why we cannot rely on them now.</PARA></TALK.START>

Clause 9 goes to the provision of services by councils. It is curious that it refers to powers to make by-laws on forestries, waterways and fisheries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand why the Minister raises those matters because these particular activities-forestries, waterways and fisheries-are controlled by the State. They are included because they are traditional Aboriginal activities. Many of the communities will be getting part of their livelihoods, for example, from fishing and so on and they will wish to make some sorts of regulations concerning them. However, I must point out that State law will apply and that any regulations that the Aboriginal councils make with respect to those functions will be subject to State laws except insofar as State laws have been proscribed. If there were any conflict between a regulation that the Aboriginal council made concerning fisheries and the State law, the State law would override unless it had been proscribed. I do not anticipate that laws concerning fisheries would be proscribed. But it may be the case that regulations that the Aboriginal councils make with regard to fishing are in accord with the State law and so there would be no conflict and no problem at all.</PARA></TALK.START>

It would be for the Minister in this Parliament to decide that such and such a law does act unfairly towards members of the reserve and that, therefore, it ought to be prescribed. So, within the control of the Minister there is the determination of what laws are to be prescribed. That can be checked.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Honourable senators will probably be aware that I have a complete analysis of the Bill. It is quite pointless, therefore, raising point after point. However, there is one other matter I feel I should raise because I do think it is a substantial matter and it worries me. It relates to clause 44 of the Bill. I will leave all the other matters aside because I accept what honourable senators have said, that the Bill requires considerable drafting work to make it really acceptable or watertight. But clause 44, under the regulation-making power, as I understand the amendment, purports to require prior approval by the National Aboriginal Conference and the land trust or the council for any regulations even to be put to the Governor-General. Have I read the clause correctly? My understanding is that, if that were the case, the amendment would put the NAC and the land council or the land trust between the Governor-General and his advisers in a veto position. If I understand that to be the case that would be completely unacceptable, certainly in a sense of constitutional propriety. I have no objection to a requirement or a desire that one should consult with these Aboriginal groups. But it would be quite another thing to provide them with what is a virtual statutory veto. I find this to be a matter of some concern as the clause appears to be drawn.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Minister has drawn his interpretation too widely altogether. The provision that is proposed in this amendment is that there shall be consultation with the National Aboriginal Conference before regulations which affect Aboriginal councils are taken before the Governor-General and, therefore, brought into effect. It is a certification that there has been consultation. That consultation in no way implies that the Governor-General has to agree with the advice of the National Aboriginal Conference. But surely it is a very sensible thing that he should have consulted it and told it about these regulations just as we have in the situation, commonly now, where regulations are being made affecting the Australian Capital Territory. The House of Assembly is constantly consulted and advised of them. But that in no way binds the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not quite singular. Just recently the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills reported on a provision in a Bill-I cannot remember which Bill it was, but it was mentioned in one of our three reports already brought down-in which there is a provision for consultation with an industry body. It relates to one of the schemes for control of primary industries. That provision is included in a recent Government Bill which has not passed through the Senate. It is, therefore, in no way unique. There ought to be consultation. There is no provision here that interferes with the right of the Government to give advice to the Governor-General, quite ignoring the view of the National Aboriginal Conference once it has been consulted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated during the Committee stage of the debate that I did not want to take time then in talking generally. Indeed some honourable senators who contributed raised some general matters. I thought would take the opportunity of the third reading to make the position of the Government clear. We opposed the Bill when it was introduced. We opposed during the second reading and although we have not pressed the matter to a division the Government is still opposed to the Bill for the reasons which we set out previously. It is really no more urgent now than it was last September when it was introduced in the run-up to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The fact there are now so many amendments necessary to the Bill, and that it still has so many loose ends shows just how hastily drafted the original measure was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the amendmens will go some way towards removing the orginal objections, which incidentally were also commented upon by the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills. The legislation when it was introduced was defective by any test, including the test of the Senate's own Committee. The real question still remains as to whether the Bill is really necessary or appropriate at this time. To answer that I really have to advert to what several honourable senators referred to in their contributions during the Committee stage. The Queensland Government has quite recently announced in broad terms what its own proposals are. Although these proposals represent a move in the right direction towards obtaining secure tenure for Aboriginals in Queensland, we are still looking for clarification of Queensland's intentions on particular matters-either matters not spelt out or matters on which we have sought some modification. We have yet to see the details of any Queensland Bill. We have yet to see the fine print of the Queensland proposals. I think we should keep that Queensland announcement of 1 March in perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> A year ago, in January 1980, the Queensland Premier announced that he would abolish the Acts, abolish the reserves and leave the reserves as Crown land with Aboriginals to live as other Queenslanders. The recent statements by the Queensland Premier represent a major move from the position and are a major advance. They are certainly a big move along the right road. This is something we could not have imagined a year ago. As I said at that stage, Queensland was talking about abolishing the reserves without intending to do anything to provide a better scheme of land holding arrangements for the Aboriginals. Later on there was talk of granting 50-year leases and of maybe giving perpetual leases. Now there is an intention on the part of Queensland apparently to Aboriginals much more than this. I think it is inappropriate to pursue this Bill when the Queensland proposals still are being developed further and when the Senate does not know what those proposals are to be. </PARA>
<PARA> How this private member's Bill is handled is entirely up to the Senate. Surely the sensible course would be to wait until Queensland's proposal is known-with all its positives and with all its faults-to continue to discuss with Queensland Ministers and Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people who live on reserves what it is they want and to reserve judgement on the final package. I believe that it will be a question af looking at the proposed amendments to the Queensland Act.Then, and only then, can we understand fully what it is that Queensland has proposed and in what ways, if any, that falls short of what the Senate would require. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a value position. Aboriginal opinion still needs to be gauged through further consultation. The Commonwealth believes that it is highly desirable to find a solution in Queensland which is just to Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Queenslanders alike. I would rather see the Queensland Parliament develop its own solutions rather than to try to impose an artificially contrived scheme of the kind presented in this Bill. I assure the Senate that the Commonwelth is continuing to be very closely involved in the development of this matter. It is for that reason, because we do not know where the matter is going to end and because people-my colleague Senator Missen, for example-are making assumptions about what the end point will be, that we still find ourselves unable to support the honourable Senator Ryan's Bill. It is not, as people might want to suggest, that we are not seeking a just settlement. The only good settlement is a settlement that will be fair to the Aboriginal people of Queensland and to all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that we wish to see a Queensland solution to this matter does not mean that we are seeking any disadvantage to Aboriginal people. On the contrary, we hope that it is they who will benefit from any arrangements. If we can find arrangements which avoid confrontation between the Commonwealth and the Queensland Parliaments, we believe that will be in the longer term interests of all Aboriginals, and indeed all Australians. There is no need for urgency. When the Opposition was in government between 1972 and 1975 it was faced with exactly the same issues. The Labor Government of the day advocated that persuasion was more effective than confrontation. It took that view in this approach to Queensland. In 1973 the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gordon Bryant, told the International Commission of Jurists conference on Aboriginal rights and law:</PARA>
<PARA> We are going to be quite firm about the situation in Queensland. We are not going to tolerate the continuation there of the Queensland system but we are going to try to pursuade them first. There are a lot of advantages in persuading them because the Queensland apparatus in Education, Health and so on is what is going to operate across the board. </PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Government felt that legislation would not be appropriate then. I believe it is still inappropriate to try to find a federalist solution. We know that the exercise of such Commonwealth power would bring with it a test which would bring out all the doubts which exist as to the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of any legislation. Of course, if we had to move to confrontation we would have to move to the high cost of acquiring the reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for the Senate to decide at what stage in the matter it wishes to relinquish control of this Bill. It should be made clear that once the Senate in its wisdom decides to give the Bill a third reading-that is a matter for the Senate-it loses all control over what happens. </PARA>

I believe that what will come out of Queensland is significantly more advanced than people here know or believe.

I rather wonder which is worse-a cashiered coach or a petulant politician. We have had a fair indication of this tonight. I mean that in all seriousness, because the sort of thing about which we have been talking all this time has been the spirit of co-operation which has existed in relation to this Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Self- Management and Land Rights) Bill, the fact that it has gone to people and has been talked about. This is one of the features of the Bill about which the Minister was speaking only a short time ago-that it has been to people, that it has been spoken about and that there has been plenty of time for a good Bill to come before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>

I believe the Bill represents an enlightened approach. As one who has been concerned with Aboriginal affairs for many years I believe that this is the sort of Bill which we have been looking for for a long time. I do not believe it is appropriate for the Minister to say that it is not time for this legislation to come in. It is certainly not. It is overdue in coming to this place. When we hear the Minister say, 'Let us wait a little longer', does it not ring a bell? I seem to remember Senator Chaney saying: 'Let us wait a little longer'.

We have a fair indication of what Queensland will do because we have seen its general attitude towards Aboriginal people. We have seen the legislation that it has introduced in the past. We have seen the legislation that it has introduced against the non-Aboriginal people of Queensland. So I do not think we need to wait too long for that. The legislation which has gone through tonight-I believe it is enlightened and is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has passed through this place in recent months, if not in recent years-is, in the opinion of the people on this side of the chamber and I believe a good number of people on the other side of the chamber, in the best interests of the Aboriginal people.

It was well aware that the Bill was deferred to give it an opportunity to come up with something positive. To date it has not done so. What it has come up with is completely and totally unacceptable. The Minister has talked about consultation. There has been consultation between the Minister, his Department, the Queensland Government, the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Islander Advancement, the Premier and the Deputy Premier. But there has been no consultation with the Aboriginal community as a whole. One has to look no further than today's Courier-Mail editorial for proof of that. I wish to take up a little of the time of the Senate to quote from that editorial. I quote only the important part of that editorial, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is time for the State Government and representatives of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders to try to reach agreement on the future of land reserves . </PARA>
<PARA> The State Government's plan for the reserves was released more than a fortnight ago. All interested parties have had time to study its major provisions, and to form opinions on its wisdom and fairness, or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> When the proposals were released the Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, said that everyone would be happy and satisfied with them. But this has not turned out to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Most Aboriginals are not happy. The Archbishops and Bishops of the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches in Queensland are not happy. Many other white Australians who share a concern about the future of Aboriginals are not happy.</PARA>
<PARA> These differences over the proposed plan are no reason, however, for the State Government to see the issue as one for confrontation. Rather it is a matter for communication. </PARA>
<PARA>The Courier-Mail editorial is referring to communication with Aboriginal people. Despite what happened last year when this Bill was introduced and despite the fact that the Queensland Government was given time to come up with something, it has not done so. It has not consulted broadly with Aboriginal people. It has refused to do so. I have tried on five separate occasions to meet with the Premier of Queensland. I wanted to meet with him, his Minister for Aboriginal and Islander Advancement and the Deputy Premier. I have had no response from that Government at any time. I have made speeches in the Senate and have spoken everywhere about this whole issue but the Premier has refused to meet with me. If he will not meet with me-a fellow politician-what hope have the Queensland Aboriginal and Islander communities of having fair consultations on this important issue that affects not only them but also the lives of their children, grandchildren and their future generations? I think we have given the Queensland Government an opportunity to come up with something better. It has not. For that reason I am in total support of the passage of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I rise to answer some of the points made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). Firstly, I restate my reason for introducing this Bill as a private member's Bill. I did not do so, as has been suggested by the Minister tonight, for some irrelevant political motive. I introduced this Bill as a private member to implement the Australian Labor Party's policy on land rights for Aboriginal people in Queensland. We believed then and we believe now that land rights to Aboriginal reserves in Queensland will be secured only by action from the Federal Parliament. Nothing has happened in the several months that have elapsed following my introducing this Bill. The very extensive consultations and discussions that have taken place with people such as Senator Bonner and Senator Missen, and the announcements that the Premier of Queensland has made from time to time, have not altered my conviction, the conviction of the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland and the conviction of many other people throughout Australia, that if land rights are to be secured for Aboriginal people in Queensland it will happen as a result of action by this Parliament. It will not happen unilaterally as a result of action by the Government of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister is still asking us to wait to see what kind of proposal the Premier of Queensland will ultimately offer to his Aboriginal and Islander constituents. I point out to him that the legislation which will be passed through the Senate tonight is enabling legislation for the Federal Government. If this legislation goes into the House of Representatives next week and is passed it will merely enable the Federal Government to grant land rights to the people living on reserves in Queensland. It will not force any issue that the Federal Government does not want forced but it will enable the Government to secure that land for those Aboriginal and Islander people. If the legislation were passed through the House of Represenatives next week and if in the following week the Premier of Queensland came up with a suitable proposal, no harm would have been done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is in a somewhat contradictory position. On the one hand he has said that he and the Government do not wish to proceed with this legislation because they believe that the solution can come from the Government of Queensland. On the other hand he claims that there has been some improvement, some progress, in the attitude of the Government of Queensland. If there has been any improvement-I must say that I tend to agree with Senator Bonner and Senator Missen that there has been very little indeed-surely it has been partly because of action in the Senate. </PARA>

If this Bill were to be passed through the House of Representatives next week that would be a further incentive to the Premier of Queensland to act in the interests of Aboriginal and Islander people. It would not force the issue. It would still give him the opportunity of doing it. The Minister shakes his head. Frankly, I would shake mine, because I do not believe that any solution will come from the Premier of Queensland. I must remark too on the Minister's criticism of the Whitlam Labor Government's action in respect of Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland. The Minister asked why we did not proceed to legislate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister quoted Mr Bryant, from I think 1973, expressing the view that a negotiated settlement was better than legislation. But by the time 1975 came around the Labor Government realised that negotiation was not to be the solution. In 1975 the Labor Government introduced and passed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act. That legislation was passed through the Senate. That Act exists, yet the Fraser Government has not been prepared to use it for the protection of Queensland Aboriginal and Islander people. I think it is inaccurate for the Minister to suggest that the Labor Government was not prepared to legislate to take steps with regard to the situation of Aboriginal people in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to consultation, the Minister said that the Premier of Queensland will ultimately come up with a proposal, that there will then be consultation and that everything will be satisfactorily resolved. I suggest to the Minister that my Bill-and the way it has been handled in this Senate and with the communities involved-provides a model of the very consultation he is suggesting. I introduced the Bill some months ago after consultation with Aboriginal and Islander people. Having introduced the Bill we then engaged in extensive consultation. We had the benefit of suggestions from the Australian Democrats, from Senator Bonner and from Senator Missen. The amendments that have been moved and passed here tonight-I notice that the Minister did not try to change them- are the result of all of those people working in a co-operative manner towards a common goal, which is security of tenure for the Aboriginal people of Queensland . All the kinds of consultation that the Minister likes to advocate in other circumstances have in fact been carried out. This is why we have before us tonight a Bill with a number of amendments which, I believe, satisfies the requirements of Aboriginal people for their land in Queensland. I do not believe that there are any serious defects in the Bill. If there are the Minister has had his opportunity to move amendments to overcome those defects. I can assure the Australian Democrats, who were subjected to some sort of threat by the Minister that they will no longer have any influence on discussion of this Bill, that when the Bill goes into the House of Representatives next week, the Labor Party will be only too willing to listen to any comments they may wish to make with regard to its passage through the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Australian Democrats, Senator Bonner, Senator Missen, members of the National Aboriginal Conference from Queensland and all the Aboriginal people and the vast range of community and church groups who have contributed to this discussion. I believe that the Bill is a better and more appropriate Bill for the rights of Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland because all of those people bothered to participate. I say in conclusion that as far as the Australian Labor Party is concerned the settlement of this matter must be as a result of Federal parliamentary action. In our view human rights are more important than State rights. In our view the human rights of Aboriginal and Islander people must include secure title to their land. It is the purpose of this legislation to provide just that. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for amendment of the Repatriation Act in four respects. The first is in relation to the control of the disability pensions for veterans suffering serious service related mental illness. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Prime Minister announced last year, following the Review of Commonwealth Functions, that deductions for maintenance from the pensions of a small number of mentally ill veterans to whom section 49 of the Repatriation Act applies, were to be discontinued and that the disability pensions of certain veterans should be handled in the same manner as all other disability pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 49 of the Repatriation Act is a special provision that can be applied by the Repatriation Commission to withhold the pension of an unmarried veteran suffering severe mental illness. The severity of the mental illness must usually be such as to warrant long-term hospitalisation in a mental institution. </PARA>
<PARA> If a veteran recovers to the extent that he is able to control his own affairs, all retained money is paid to him. If he dies without recovering, the accumulated funds do not form part of his estate but are disposed of at the Commission's discretion to members of his family or to persons dependent on him, with any remaining funds being paid to Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the provisions of section 49, which had their origins in legislation enacted in 1920, are out-dated and create some significant differences between the way these mentally disabled veterans are treated and the way other disabled veterans are treated. For example, it has been the practice under section 49, for half the disability pension to be deducted as a contribution to the cost of their maintenance while in a mental institution, and to pay this deduction to Consolidated Revenue. It is the Government's view that, since no other veteran is required to make such a contribution when receiving treatment for a service-related disability, the practice is discriminatory and should cease. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, in repealing section 49, will provide for a veteran's pension and any accumulated money to become his property, in the same way that it is for every other veteran. As a result, if a veteran dies while still suffering from his disability, all of his accumulated pension will form part of his estate and be distributed in accordance with his wishes if a valid Will has been made, or otherwise, in accordance with the laws of intestacy. </PARA>
<PARA> If a veteran is in a mental institution his affairs are normally controlled by the State Public Trustee. Some of the veterans to whom section 49 applies are not the responsibility of State Governments, and these are generally those veterans who are no longer in mental institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that upon the repeal of section 49, the accumulated moneys of these veterans will be transferred to the trusteeship of the Repatriation Commission under regulation 9 of the Repatriation Regulations or, if it is thought that the veteran is able to manage for himself, his pension will be returned to him with the interest earned. The Bill provides for these arrangements to come into effect on the date of the Royal Assent. Discussions have been held with the various State Governments with a view to transferring the appropriate funds to the respective State Public Trustees who would be responsible for the veterans' welfare. Agreement has been reached with five States on the proposed arrangements, and a reply is awaited from the other State . </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements will mean that a Public Trustee would assume the responsibility which he would normally have in respect of these veterans but for the existence of section 49. In many cases the Public Trustee already has responsibility for the other assets or income of the veteran and therefore the current dual trustee arrangement would be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for transitional provisions to finalize the accounts of veterans who have died, or who die before Royal Assent. These provisions extend the benefits of the new proposals to those veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the extension of Repatriation benefits to Australian members of the Multinational Force and Observers committed to the Sinai region. This is in accordance with the undertaking the Government gave last year when Repatriation benefits were extended to Australian representatives of peacekeeping, observation or monitoring forces. Repatriation benefits are to be extended on the same basis as applies to Australian members of other peacekeeping forces under Division 10 of the Repatriation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Bill also provides for two other matters. The first is to facilitate the recovery of Commonwealth expenditure for medical treatment provided to patients eligible to receive either workers' compensation benefits or third party damages and to align such provisions with those in other Commonwealth Acts. The present provisions of the Repatriation legislation are restrictive in that they allow the recovery of medical treatment costs from the injured party only and not from a third party, such as an insurer. The cost recovery process would be far more efficient and less demanding on patients if the Repatriation Commission could act directly with third parties as is the case under the Social Services Act and the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act. The Bill will achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA> The second, Mr President, is to enable Regulations to be prepared which will protect from legal actions those employees in Repatriation hospitals who may be required to carry out duties arising from State legislation. These employees, in order to comply with State law as part of their community service, require the full cover of that law in order to be properly protected in the execution of their duties. However, because of their status as Commonwealth employees and the separation of Commonwealth and State jurisdictions they do not have that protection in some instances. At this stage, the main concern is the taking of blood samples in accident cases for the purpose of blood-alcohol testing. As the protection of medical and ancillary staff is not extended by State legislation, Repatriation hospital staff have not been permitted to undertake these procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are to come into operation from the date of Royal Assent. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Act 1962 to provide for the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority to restrict the use of electricity in the ACT following the declaration of a state of emergency by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Territory currently derives 60 per cent of its bulk supply of electricity from New South Wales, the balance coming from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. Due to the significant amount of total bulk supply of electricity that is purchased from New South Wales the Authority is particularly vulnerable to emergency situations occurring in New South Wales. Shortages of electric power and energy in New South Wales have resulted in emergency situations and requests to the Authority to reduce load. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the Authority has sought to achieve this reduction by means of public appeal to its customers for voluntary restraint coupled with reduction of the supply voltage. These methods have not, however, resulted in a reduction as significant as that achieved in New South Wales by means of legislation enabling the supply to be restricted. </PARA>
<PARA> In order for the Authority to respond effectively to emergency situations and to provide an equitable distribution of the available supply, it is essential that the Authority has power to impose restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is indeed unfortunate in the extreme that this action is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales has supplied a large part of the electricity requirements of the Territory since 1929. With the exception of the early postwar years and a short period in 1973, the Government has been able to rely with confidence on a continuation of adequate supply. </PARA>
<PARA> This, unfortunately and regrettably, is no longer the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Since June last year, the supply of electricity from New South Wales has been uncertain. We cannot be confident that the situation will improve. </PARA>
<PARA> The power supply problems in June 1981 were due to a combination of factors the principal one being the shutdown caused by plant difficulties in two large generating units combined with major industrial problems, this is, in fact, what the Electricity Commission of New South Wales has admitted in so many words. Failure of two more large units at Liddel power station in November 1981 exacerbated again by industrial problems caused the imposition of restrictions yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> Some relief was expected with the Commissioning of the first generator at the Eraring power station but this too has been now delayed for months-again due to further industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the chain of events is such that it must be fully prepared to deal with future emergencies-for the welfare of the National Capital and its residents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes a provision for the Minister to declare, by notice in the Gazette, that an electricity supply emergency will exist during a period, not exceeding 28 days, specified in the notice. The Minister may make such a declaration where he is satisfied that the supply of electricity available in the Territory is, or is likely to be, so inadequate for the needs of the Territory as to require restriction of use. The declaration may be revoked by the Minister by notice in the Gazette if the need for restrictions cease. </PARA>
<PARA> During a period of emergency the Authority may, by order in writing, restrict the use of electricity in the Territory. Details of the emergency orders to be made will be published in the Gazette and in a newspaper circulating in the Territory. Details may also be published by radio or television broadcast if the Authority considers it appropriate to do so. The orders will come into force on the date of gazettal or such later date as is specified in the Gazette. The orders will be subject to disallowance. They will be laid before both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days of their making and either House may then disallow them within a further period of 15 sitting days.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that on 26 May 1981, my colleague, the Attorney -General, avowed the Government's commitment to the principle that delegated legislation and such like should be subject to review by parliament. In accordance with this principle, provisions for the disallowance of instruments of a legislative character should, unless there are good reasons for variation, incorporate the substance of certain traditionally accepted safeguards, such as requirements that they be laid before each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of their making and that a motion for disallowance must be dealt with within 15 sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA> While, in accordance with this principle, emergency orders will be subject to disallowance, the very nature of emergency orders and the time constraints which an emergency imposes, necessitates, on this occasion, the incorporation of a further procedure in the Bill to make Parliamentary review more effective. Accordingly, in making the emergency orders the Authority will comply with guidelines made by instrument in writing by the Minister which have themselves been subject to disallowance by the Parliament. The guidelines will be laid before both Houses of Parliament and either House of Parliament may, within five sitting days after a copy of the guidelines has been laid before it, pass a resolution disallowing them. If neither House disallows the guidelines, they will come into force at the expiration of the five sitting days. The Authority cannot make an emergency order unless the guidelines are in force. </PARA>
<PARA> The period for disallowance has been limited to five sitting days because it is considered essential that the Authority be in a position to impose restrictions this winter. This might not be possible if the disallowance period were the usual 15 sitting days. In addition, it may be necessary for the Minister to amend the guidelines quickly if they prove inadequate to deal with the emergency at hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Persons, including bodies corporate, who without reasonable excuse contravene or fail to comply with an emergency order, shall be guilty of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> During an emergency a Justice of the Peace may, where he is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a contravention of, or a failure to comply with, an emergency order has occurred, grant a search warrant effective for a specified period, to an officer or employee of the Authority, authorising that officer or employee to enter and search the land or premises for the purpose of ascertaining whether such a contravention or failure has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will bind the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The motto of the Williamstown Naval Dockyard is 'Deeds not words'. For the last 10 years or so the deeds have not been very satisfactory but there has been a flood of words about this dockyard. It has been described, I think with some accuracy, as inefficient, badly managed, strike plagued and just plain unworkable. There have been many reports in the last decade about this dockyard. They have been both secret and public. They have all identified problems that need solving if the dockyard is to be made efficient. The trouble is that very little has been done about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Until 1970 the dockyard was a small shipbuilding and refitting yard. It had a relatively good record. It was not perhaps a highly efficient dockyard by world standards, but by our shipbuilding industry standards it was quite efficient. Things started to go wrong in the early 1970s. The first problem was the cancellation by the Whitlam Government of the DDL project which was intended to give continuity of work to the Williamstown dockyard for many years. This was compounded by the decision of the then Minister for Defence in the Whitlam Government that despite the reduction of work there would be no redundancies. This has meant that the dockyard has been paying, for most of the recent years, at least 200 men a year to do nothing. This has had shattering effects both on the efficiency and the morale of the dockyard. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation has also worsened as a result of the defence reorganisation which has made even more cumbersome the management situation of the dockyard. This is a matter which the present committee of inquiry into the Defence Department, chaired by Mr Utz, should take note of. No warships have been built in the Williamstown dockyard since 1970, which is 12 years ago. A three stage modernisation program for the dockyard has been in place. The first two stages cost $44m. The aim of the project is to make it possible to build modern destroyers of the FFG type. We have ordered four of these destroyers from the United States and have received two. It is planned that the Williamstown dockyard should be capable of building such complex ships. I point out the size of the project. The present plan, if the dockyard proves suitable and the reorganisation is acceptable, is that it will certainly build two of these ships and probably four more. Each of these ships built at Williamstown will cost more than HMS Invincible. There has been great debate in the Senate about whether too much is being spent on HMS Invincible. Each of the six ships planned to be built at Williamstown will cost more than HMS Invincible and the total project cost will be in excess of $2 billion. We are talking about a major project at the Williamstown dockyard. We certainly need assurances that the dockyard will work efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent committee of inquiry into the Williamstown dockyard made what in my view was a shattering report on its organisation and efficiency. It identified four main areas of defect. The first is late material and equipment supply. Major items of government furnished equipment, normally ordered through the Department of Administrative Services, have arrived years late for ship construction projects. Some major items of equipment arrived after the relevant ship was scheduled to be completed. The whole structure of equipment supply is seriously awry. The second area of concern is the use of Public Sevice procedures in a shipbuilding organisation. This has had serious effects not only on the organisation of the dockyard but also on financial areas, industrial relations and general man management. In an organisation such as a shipyard, Public Service procedures are quite inappropriate. The third area of concern is the defence reorganisation introduced by the Whitlam Government. This has caused a serious loss of confidence and efficiency and a much less responsive head office. The final area of defect in the structure is the lack of separation between the producer and the customer. They have been in the same organisation and this has caused quite serious problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent committee of inquiry looked at all the inquiries that were made into the Williamstown dockyard during the 1970s. Its examination revealed that many sensible and appropriate recommendations were made. In some cases those recommendations were approved, but there has been practically no effective follow-up. The committee concluded that the present defence departmental system is much more effective in the identification of dockyard problems than it is in doing anything about them. The committee of inquiry, chaired by Mr Hawke from Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd-not from the House of Representatives-concluded that local dockyard management is currently deprived of the necessary level of control and flexibility with regard to the key areas of manpower, finance, information, materials and support services. In other words, they are deprived of all necessary areas of control and flexibility to run an efficient dockyard. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am stating why they are in trouble. The report identified a number of areas. The committee looked at various possibilities for improving the operation of Williamstown dockyard within current Public Service operation and ownership by the Department of Defence. Its conclusions were that the dockyard must be made to operate as nearly as possible as a successful commercial shipyard producing warships. Taking this as a principle, it concluded that some movement towards a more appropriate organisation is theoretically possible within Public Service and departmental ownership. It could see that there was some possible way where suitable arrangements could be made for finance, material, information and support services although it considered-I am sure it is right-that they would be very difficult to achieve in practice. The committee said, and I would like to quote its words here because they are crucial:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . we have been given no encouragement to believe that Public Service Board control of manpower, management aspects, particular ceilings, structures, conditions of service and industrial relations could be delegated and replaced by controls of a more appropriate nature for a ship building yard. </PARA>
<PARA>It concluded that it could not recommend construction of destroyers at Williamstown dockyard under the circumstances because successful management of manpower was a fundamental requirement for any efficient shipbuilding. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee looked at various options and concluded that the only acceptable solution was to convert Williamstown dockyard to a statutory body operated by a management board responsible to the Miniser for Defence. Other options, it said, either were not available or fell short in one or more ways. Therefore the major recommendation-I repeat 'the major recommendation'-in relation to management was to take Williamstown dockyard out of the Department of Defence and to make the statutory body managed by a board responsible to the Minister for Defence. That, I think, is very clear. I am certain that from reading the report no one can doubt that that requirement is essential if Williamstown dockyard is to be successful. Yet the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, Mr Newman, in commenting on this report said that for the time being the Government had decided to retain the yard within the Department of Defence, to introduce new arrangements and to prosecute a program of sweeping reform. That is quite contrary to the whole thrust of the Hawke report. It misses the fundamental aspect. What is worse, it gives no explanation of why it is done. I urge that if there are cogent reasons why the Government has rejected the whole thrust of this report, which said that unless the committee's requirements were met it could not recommend the construction of destroyers at the Williamstown dockyard, they should be outlined. Why has this key recommendation been rejected?</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I am particularly interested in this report and believe that the Senate should take careful note of it. I regret that only two copies are available; the only way I could get a copy before me was to ask the Parliamentary Library to lend it to me for a few minutes. I find that regrettable. It is a very important report and its recommendations will affect the lives of many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to speak of the disastrous effects of the health hazards of asbestos which are unknown and which the other day led to the death of a close friend of mine, Jim Roulston. Jim Roulston was prominent in the Australian Labor Party in Victoria. He was a member of our national Executive. He was a person upon whom many of us relied for advice and for friendship. He knew the true meaning of the word 'comrade' and he brought good sense into all the discussions in which he played a part. Because of that good sense good counsel prevailed in discussions which involved the workers in many occupations. He died as a result of coming into contact with asbestos as a boilermaker. Many people who have been engaged in this industry will die as a result, just as Jim Roulston died after a long and lingering period of ill health. If anyone were to appreciate how he suffered they would appreciate how necessary it is for this report and these recommendations to be endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only did Jim Roulston die but also others who work in the same area will die. It is a great tragedy that this should have happened. Since it has happened , surely we should take measures to prevent any further recurrence and at the same time we should take those measures to compensate those who suffer as a result of the death of those who are the wage earners. For that reason I believe it is necessary for this report to be before the Senate. I think Senator McIntosh wishes to speak next. I trust that when he is finished he will seek leave to continue his remarks so that this paper will remain before the Senate. </PARA>

My colleague Jim Roulston died from working as a boilermaker. The health of my colleague, Gordon Grenville, is deteriorating rapidly. He was a boilermaker and worked with asbestos in boiler lagging. He worked with asbestos at a time when electro-welding equipment was covered with it. The people affected fought hard to get compensation. They had to fight very hard for the people who had been exposed to asbestos through their work to try to get some type of health coverage. This report is supposed to be before the Senate.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak on a subject which I have spoken about very frequently since I came into this Senate, and which has been of great concern to the people of Australia. I refer to the cost of metric conversion. The Senate has before it the 11th annual report of the Metric Conversion Board which is, undoubtedly, its final report. This will probably be the final chance the Senate will get to talk about this problem. It is fascinating to see that this report continues in the same vein as the report from the Senate Select Committee on the Metric System of Weights and Measures which was brought up and ordered to be printed on 29 May 1968. The report sees nothing but good in connection with metric conversion in Australia and makes no mention of the costs to the nation other than to set out that the total expenditure for the decade by the Government on metric conversion was about $6m. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not critical of the members of the Committee who brought down this report. This report was brought down a decade ago when perhaps we saw the nation was in a period when people thought they had to be trendy, to be with it, to be involved in the so-called latest move, in order to ensure that Australia was up with the rest of the world. I am sure that the personnel of that Committee gave of their utmost. I see that the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Laught from South Australia, died prior to the Metric Conversion Bill being introduced. I see that there was much praise for him. I quote from what Senator McManus said as reported in Hansard of 9 June 1970 on page 2157. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I also join with them-</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about other members of the Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>in what they have said about Senator Laught. He was a most conscientious Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on the Metric System of Weights and Measures. He was a lovable personality. We all have missed him since his death. We are sorry that he is not here today to see this legislation passed by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, I am sure that all members of the Committee were gravely concerned about this matter and did their utmost in bringing down this report. It is very interesting that Senator McManus went on to make reference to another person associated with the Committee. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I also join in the tribute that has been paid to our expert adviser, Mr Harper. We found him most competent on all the occasions on which the Committee met and we found him most versatile . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Harper, as is mentioned in the report of the Senate Select Committee, was brought in as the expert adviser to the Committee. I think there is much for Senate committees to learn in that little action. I understand that Mr Harper was well known as an advocate of metric conversion. With respect, that permeates the entire report. Mr Harper was the technical consultant. Subsequently, it is interesting to see-believe it or not-that the executive member of the Metric Conversion Board was the same Mr Harper. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report on the metric system of weights and measures brought down in 1968 one reads point after point in praise of metric conversion. But when one analyses the reasons that were put forward in the chamber one sees that it was all about being with it. For example, one of the major points and one about which great emphasis was made was that apparently 90 per cent of the world's population was using the metric system. Allegedly, 75 per cent of world trade was being carried on in metric measure and about 70 per cent of Australia's export trade was to metric countries. So, one can see that what was being proposed was: 'We have to be in it'. </PARA>
<PARA> When members of the Committee looked at cost advantages no money was put forward in the proposal. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A cost advantage may be expected in the purchase of imported materials . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A decade on there is no evidence of that. Certainly, education authorities favoured the system because it was simpler. That may be but one has to look at what has been the cost to the nation. I read again from the summary of conclusions and recommendations. The Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Although no meaningful estimate could be made of the cost and benefits which would result from the adoption of the metric system, the Committee is satisfied that the ultimate benefits would greatly exceed the costs of the conversion. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Committee made no attempt whatsoever to assess the cost to the nation but it was firmly convinced that the benefits would exceed the costs. A predecessor of mine from Victoria, Senator Greenwood, summed up the reasons given in a couple of simple sentences. In speaking about the decision on metric conversion he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It was based . . . on significant broad considerations of utility. It should enhance our ability to export; increase our efficiency; provide a rationalising and modernising of industrial practices; and, as was said, reduce diversification in manufactured products. It should provide a simplification of teaching of mathematics and science. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee could see nothing but good. This final report indicates nothing but good. As I said, there seem to me to be a number of lessons which the Senate ought to take from these reports. The first lesson is that Senate committees should be very wary of bringing on to the committees as advisers technical experts who have a particular point of view which they have expressed publicly. I think it is very wrong for any Senate committee to invite a person who has a particular point of view which he is trying to put forward to come on to the Committee as its technical adviser. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Bonner says, if someone has a particular barrow to push it is very difficult for senators with their busy activities to realise that they are having this barrow pushed at them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second lesson is-there are a number of times I feel like saying this-that even when a Senate bipartisan committee produces a unanimous report we must not treat that report as being sacrosanct, so that we do not question it. Some people seem to propound the view that because some Senate committee has brought down a report all of its recommendations ought to be implemented almost automatically. Some people say: 'After all, the Senate committee has had a look at it so the Senate committee report must be adopted.' I unequivocally reject that view. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I put forward the point about financial impact statements about which I was speaking last week. If only someone somewhere in the Government had tried to make a national assessment and draw up a financial impact statement of what it would cost us to convert our petrol tanks and our containers from gallons to litres, to change our road signs-all of that fantastic cost that this nation has had to suffer. If only someone had calculated whether it would be $100m or $500m or whatever. I suspect that the cost would have been more than the cost of a 35- hour week. If that had been done I believe the Bill would not have been introduced. </PARA>

I do not suppose that I could have any argument with the report itself; it talks about road construction prices and contains a review of various road construction price indexes which have been compiled by the former Commonwealth Bureau of Roads, the Bureau of Transport and Economics and the State road authorities. In addition, it presents newly compiled unput price indexes for national road construction activity. It appears to me somewhat of a farce for the Senate to discuss this report which has been placed before it when yesterday the Commonwealth Government said in the House of Representatives that it would give the States only $3,022m over the next three years, a 7 per cent increase in money terms on the original commitment but in actual fact 7 per cent or 8 per cent less than the 15 per cent actual increase in road building costs throughout Australia. It seems to me a great waste of time to have a report setting out road construction price indexes from 1969-70 to 1980-81 when the Commonwealth Government is cutting back its allocation to the States by 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not end there. Anyone who read a copy of today's Australian would have noticed that members of the National Party, including Senator Flo Bjelke- Peterson, have drawn to the attention of the Government the problems that this will cause in Queensland. The allocation of money for roads is very important to a State such as Queensland because the major employers of persons in country areas are the local and shire councils. </PARA>

It concerns the matter which Senator Sibraa raised; that is, the method by which we deal with papers in this place. The situation is that the Senate is not unduly busy, does not have an enormous amount of business and will probably rise, it has been said, before the expiry of its sitting time. At the end of the presentation of papers an important document was still to be considered. Senator Jones has been cut off in mid-stream in his comments about road construction, which is an important topic. A number of honourable senators have not been able to speak on the Sinai Multinational Force although aspects of the statement require examination and comment. We have got to the stage at which there is a degree of manipulation of the business of this place and at which, even without excuse, the consideration of a list of papers such as this, which has almost finished, will be cut off. Honourable senators who wished to speak on a particular topic will not be able to do so solely because of the impatience of certain honourable senators to get on their own business, and presumably, judging from the remarks of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), his own intolerance of any business being carried out except on a basis that the Government might determine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to continue my remarks on the Constitution Alteration (Fixed Term Parliaments) Bill 1981 introduced as a private member's Bill by Senator Evans. I refer honourable senators to Senate Hansard pages 2032 to 2040 which contain the report of earlier debate on this subject-Senator Evans's second reading speech and a paper in relation to fixed term parliaments which I had incorporated at that stage. Since that time I have had an opportunity to examine the Bill as presented by Senator Evans. I wish to inform the Senate that I am totally opposed to the Bill. My opposition is based on its professed principle and on the provisions which, in my view, cripple the Parliament. By 'the Parliament' I mean the House of Representatives as well as the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motivation for this Bill has quite clearly been put publicly by Senator Evans on a number of occasions. I would like to quote from some of those statements by Senator Evans. Firstly, in his paper given to the Australasian Study of Parliament Group he said that this proposal 'would be more likely to be politically acceptable in the short term as a solution to the constitutional problems shown up by 1974 and 1975 than either of the positions that have been taken so far by the major parties'. Then on 11 November 1981, as reported in Hansard, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the central and overriding advantage of the fixed term concept is simply that, as a possible solution to the constitutional problems of 1975, it is really, as an American might say, 'the only game in town' . . .What the Whitlam proposal sought to do directly, the fixed term parliaments proposal does very indirectly. </PARA>
<PARA>If we look at the effect of this Bill on the Senate, we see that the Senate will lose its independence, that the terms of the Senate will be tied to the House of Representatives, that the Senate will be virtually without legislative power, and that the Senate and therefore the Parliament will be at the mercy of the government of the day. That is perfectly obvious and I think Senator Evans would willingly admit those points, but I wonder whether the side effect is unintended . The side effect of his proposal is to cripple representative government by taking away the powers of the House of Representatives as well. Almost every provision of this Bill is fraught with danger. I have circulated in the chamber and to honourable senators' offices a paper which is headed: 'Constitution Alteration (Fixed Term Parliaments) Bill 1981, Observations on the Major provisions'. I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate the paper in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>OBSERVATIONS ON THE MAJOR PROVISIONS</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill aims to make six major changes to the Constitution. It seeks to:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) provided a fixed term for the House of Representatives by ensuring that the House is not dissolved before the end of that term except in special circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) alter the terms of service of Senators, so that those terms will be dependent upon the duration of the House of Representatives;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) set fixed dates for the election of the House of Representatives, depending upon whether the House expires or is dissolved;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) alter the powers of the Senate in respect of legislation;</PARA>
<PARA> (5) make new provisions for the resolution of disagreements between the Houses in respect of legislation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (6) limit the powers of the Governor-General in respect of the appointment and dismissal of prime ministers and ministers.</PARA>
<PARA>These changes are not dependent upon each other; each of the six major alterations could stand independently, although they are of course in this Bill drafted so as to be compatible.</PARA>
<PARA> Each of the six major changes will therefore be discussed separately.</PARA>
<PARA>(1) The Fixed Term of the House of Representatives</PARA>
<PARA> The idea that the House of Representatives should have a fixed term, that is, that it should be dissolved before the end of its term only in special circumstances, has been put forward in a number of different forms. This Bill contains only one of the possible forms of the idea. It is obvious that as long as the executive government is to be in any sense responsible to the House of Representatives the term of the House cannot be absolutely fixed, because provision must be made for a House which cannot or will not support a government . The advantages of a fixed term House which have been put forward are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) it might encourage more independence on the part of the Members of the House of Representatives, in that the House would be free to reject specific government proposals without the fear that the government might dissolve the House and send it to an election;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) it would prevent a government from holding elections at the time of its choosing, and would thereby deprive government of a powerful instrument which has been used to ensure its re-election; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) it would prevent the Senate from seeking to force a government to go to an early election, in that a government would not have the power to do that which the Senate would be seeking to compel it to do.</PARA>
<PARA> The disadvantages of the fixed term proposal may best be discussed in the context of the specific version of the idea contained in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 2 of the Bill provides, in effect, that the House of Representatives cannot be dissolved, leaving aside the provisions relating to disagreements between the Houses, except where the House passes a motion expressing lack of confidence in the prime minister and the ministry, and does not, within seven days after such a motion is passed, pass another motion expressing confidence in a person if that person were appointed prime minister and in a ministry to be appointed by that person. In other words, the House of Representatives may be dissolved only when the existing government does not command the confidence of the House and the House is unable or unwilling to express its confidence in an alternative government.</PARA>
<PARA> There are two major disadvantages of this scheme, both of which fall into the area of its effect on responsible government. The Bill may be said to remove an essential element of responsible government as it has existed hitherto. Responsible government as it has been understood and expounded since the middle of the 19th century requires not only that the government is responsible to the lower house, but that that House is responsible to the electorate. The responsibility of the lower house to the electorate is enforced by the government's power of dissolution, a power of appeal, as it has been called. This element of responsible government was expounded, for example, by Bagehot:</PARA>
<PARA> 'But a cabinet, though it is a committee of the legislative assembly, is a committee with a power which no assembly would-unless for historical accidents, and after happy experience-have been persuaded to entrust to any committee. It is a committee which can dissolve the assembly which appointed it; it is a committee with a suspensive veto-a committee with a power of appeal. Though appointed by one Parliament, it can appeal if it chooses to the next.'</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill removes this second element of responsible government. The first way in which the responsibility of the House to the electorate may be avoided, and the first major disadvantage of this part of the Bill, is that a House may choose not to pass a motion of no confidence, while at the same time preventing a government from effectively governing. In practical terms, there might, for example, be a split in the majority party in the House. The minority faction of the majority party may decline to pass a motion of no confidence, while at the same time joining with the opposition to frustrate major elements of the government's policies. It has been said that no group of members could be so irresponsible. But such a faction may have politically respectable reasons for such a course of action, and may say, for instance: 'We do not want the present Government to be turned out of office; we wish it to carry out parts of its policy which are valuable, and we do not want the Opposition to gain office. But we will prevent the Government from carrying out those parts of its policy which we regard as not in the best interests of the country'. Under the present constitutional arrangements a government in such a situation would be able to appeal to the electorate to give it a more co-operative majority in the House. In the past, considering all those jurisdictions which have responsible government, governments have often exercised this right of appeal, and successfully. Under this Bill a weak and debilitated government could be kept in office till the end of its appointed term, unable to carry out its major policies, and unable to resolve the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> The second way in which responsible government could be negated is by a House removing one government and installing another without the electorate being consulted. For example, a minority faction of the majority party could come to an arrangement with the opposition, or perhaps with only part of it, to turn out the existing government and install a coalition with policies which have never been put before the electorate. Under the present constitutional arrangements, a government from which the confidence of the House has been withdrawn may go to an election regardless of whether the House has expressed its confidence in an alternative government. In other words, it may appeal to the electorate to pass judgment on the proceedings in the House. Under this Bill a government which the electorate has never endorsed may be installed by a party manoeuvre, and the electorate left powerless until the end of the term of the House.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to consider these matters it is necessary to remember that Australian party politics has not always had its present stability of party allegiance and party discipline, and may not continue to have that stability in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) Terms of Service of Senators Clause 5 of the Bill removes the present fixed term for Senators and provides that Senators' terms end upon the expiry or dissolution of the second House of Representatives to expire or be dissolved after the Senators' election, except when the Senate is itself dissolved and subsequently divided into two classes, so that those of the first class have a term corresponding to that of the House of Representatives elected at the same time.</PARA>
<PARA> Presumably the purpose of this clause is to ensure that Senate elections are held at the same time as House of Representatives elections. Such a proposition has previously been proposed and put to the electors in a referendum. The main argument against the proposition then was that it would make terms of Senators dependent upon the discretion of the executive government, in that the government could choose to have a House of Representatives election at any time. It may be urged in favour of this Bill that it removes this argument, because the House of Representatives may not be dissolved except upon a motion of no confidence not succeeded by a motion of confidence in a new government. It may be said, however, that the restriction on the dissolution of the House of Representatives greatly weakens the argument for interfering with the fixed term of Senators simply to ensure that Senate and House elections are held at the same time, because an early dissolution of the House is much less likely, and, if it does occur, it will be due to political circumstances in the House of Representatives which would have nothing to do with the composition of the Senate. If the electors are called upon to elect a new House of Representatives, there is no reason why they must at the same time elect one half of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> If it is desired to avoid separate Senate and House of Representatives elections, it would be more rational to provide that after an extraordinary House of Representatives election the new House continues only until the end of the term of the previous House. This proposition is supported by the consideration that any dissolution of the House of Representatives is likely to be caused by a party split which may be temporary and which almost certainly would not justify the selection of a new House for a full term.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) Fixed Dates for Elections Clause 6 of the Bill provides for the duration of the House of Representatives, and the most important innovation in it is that it provides fixed dates for elections, depending upon whether the House of Representatives expires or is dissolved.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the provision of a fixed term for the House of Representatives does not necessarily entail fixed election dates: it would be possible to provide for elections to be held within a period of time rather than on a particular day.</PARA>
<PARA> The fixing of particular days for elections in the Constitution has the disadvantage that it is impossible to avoid holding an election during some temporary internal or external crisis or at the same time as some other event.</PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for wishing to vary the election date may be relatively mundane, for example, to avoid the day of a State election or a celebratory event-or highly significant, for example, to avoid a period of civil disturbance or international crisis.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) Powers of the Senate in Respect of Legislation Clause 8 of the Bill inserts a new provision in the Constitution which provides that an appropriation or taxation Bill which is delayed by the Senate for one month may be passed into law without the consent of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> The practical effect of this provision would be to completely remove the legislative powers of the Senate and to place it in a position inferior to the British House of Lords in respect of legislative powers.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason for this is that there is no attempt to define an appropriation Bill , nor to limit the provision to particular appropriations, such as those for the ordinary annual services of government.</PARA>
<PARA> There would be no impartial officer, such as the Speaker of the House of Commons in the British context, to determine what is an appropriation Bill. The determination would be made by the executive government by advising the Governor -General to sign into law any Bill which the government deemed to be an appropriation Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, every Bill could be made into an appropriation Bill, as that distinction is presently understood, simply by the insertion of a clause having the effect of appropriating moneys, and there would be no security against the ' tacking' of other matters on to any appropriation Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>(5) Disagreements between the houses Clause 9 of the Bill remakes the provision in the Constitution for the resolution of disagreements between the Houses over legislation. At present, a government may dissolve both Houses simultaneously when the Senate has failed to pass legislation, subject to certain restrictions. The new provisions would, in effect, allow a government a choice of putting the legislation in dispute to a joint sitting of the two Houses, or of holding a double dissolution. This would greatly strengthen the hand of a government in relation to the Senate. A government whose majority in the House of Representatives was sufficient to override any adverse majority in the Senate could pass any legislation it chose simply by holding a joint sitting.</PARA>
<PARA> Considering these provisions in the context of the whole Bill, however, it is highly unlikely that the provisions would ever be used at all, because a government would have in the new section 53 in clause 8 a much simpler method of ignoring an adverse Senate, by making every Bill an appropriation Bill. With this simple mechanism at its disposal, it is highly unlikely that any government would ever bother to hold a joint sitting or risk itself in a double dissolution .</PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, one use to which these provisions might be put. They could be used by a government to subvert the supposedly fixed term of the House of Representatives and hold an election, not only for the House of Representatives but also for the whole Senate, at a time of that government's choosing. A government in a minority position in the Senate could ensure that a deadlock, as defined by the Bill, arose, and at any time thereafter could hold a double dissolution, providing such a dissolution did not take place within six months of the expiry of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA> It may well be said, therefore, that the new section 57 does nothing except subvert the supposed main purpose of the Bill, namely the fixed term of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>(6) Powers of the Governor-General Clause 10 of the Bill provides that a Governor-General may not dismiss from office a prime minister except when the House of Representatives has expressed lack of confidence in the prime minister and has expressed confidence in another person as prime minister and the prime minister has not resigned.</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this provision would be to greatly strengthen, not necessarily a government, but a prime minister. The Bill ignores the fact that there are other circumstances in which a prime minister may be dismissed, and present constitutional usage is that the Governor-General may correctly dismiss a prime minister in certain circumstances other than those which appear to be contemplated or which are sought to be prevented by this Bill. For example, a prime minister may be deposed from the leadership of his party, perhaps at a time when the House of Representatives is not sitting, and may refuse to resign his office. Present constitutional usage is that in these circumstances a Governor-General may properly consult the other Ministers of State and may dismiss the prime minister in order to bring about the change desired by the majority party. Under this Bill, the Governor-General would be powerless to act in the absence of the required resolutions of the House of Representatives. But in a parliamentary recess the prime minister may refuse to advise the Governor- General to summon the House of Representatives. Thus an absurd deadlock would be created, and could only be broken by the Governor-General either ignoring the Constitution by dismissing the prime minister or acting against the prime minister's advice by summoning the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA> While it may seem unlikely that a prime minister would act in this way, the possibility of his so acting would provide him with a powerful weapon against his party colleagues, because he could threaten to act in this way if deposed by his party. At present a majority party can be almost certain that, through the Governor-General, they can change their leader and by the same act change the prime minister without having to engage in protracted, embarrassing and possibly dangerous proceedings in the House of Representatives. Under this Bill they could never be certain that they would not be exposed to such proceedings should they attempt to change their leader.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also the possibility of a prime minister suffering sudden and apparently permanent disability, which would require the Governor-General to terminate his appointment, with the advice of the Ministry. In December 1967 the Governor-General determined the appointment of Mr Holt; if this Bill had then been in force, how would the circumstances of that time been resolved?</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill may well be said to replace responsible government with a quasi- presidential, prime ministerial government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. When one analyses these proposals one will see that the Bill removes the main check against a government's mismanagement, corruption or incompetence by curtailing the legislative powers of the Senate. The proposals in the Bill have all been rejected earlier-in a Senate select committee of 1950, the 1959 Joint Committee on Constitutional Review, and the 1976 Whitlam proposal. These provisions are unacceptable to our founding fathers and I suggest that they are equally unacceptable today. The provision, which supposedly affects only money Bills, could, as draft, be used to ensure the Senate's veto and amendment power over all legislation would be lost. All Bills that are introduced into the Senate could in some way or other have a money section attached to them. Yet the double dissolution mechanism was preserved. One asks: Why would that be so? It was obvious that that could be only so that the Government could subvert a fixed term concept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the provisions of the Bill there would be only one circumstance in which a government or a Prime Minister might be dismissed. Of course what it is all about is what happened in 1975. I would like to offer my diagnosis of 1975. I recognise that this is a matter of great controversy within the country and the Parliament. Nevertheless, I think that it is reasonable to restate my view on the matter, which is a view which has been put by many legal technicians. Firstly, one looks at what Mr Whitlam was happy to accept in 1970 and 1974 when he had no objection to the Senate's powers in relation to money Bills. He accepted the principle that a government denied Supply by Parliament cannot govern constitutionally and should either resign or advise an election. But in 1975 he rejected that proposal. The reason he rejected the proposal was that the polls told him that he could not win an election so he did not want to have one. I put it to the Senate that the constitutional crisis was not of the Senate's making; it was not of the Governor-General's making; it was of Mr Whitlam's making because he refused to resign. The question for consideration before this Parliament is: Should we have a strong States-based Senate with power to discipline incompetent or corrupt government and ensure that the electorate has a say or should the executive government, with strongly entrenched bureaucracy, be supreme?</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill validates illegal actions of a Prime Minister and, in my view, tries to rectify a situation created by Mr Whitlam, who attempted to govern unconstitutionally. In effect, what is proposed by Senator Evans's Bill is that we will have an elected dictatorship. I am quite intrigued by the attitude of editorial writers in the newspapers. Senator Evans has been kind enough to circulate to us a number of extracts from newspapers. He quite rightly says that all of them, except one minor one, support him. I find that fascinating. I will refer to extracts from two newspapers that Senator Evans did not bother to circulate, perhaps because they occurred later. One is an article by Mr Claude Forell which appeared in the Age yesterday. Of course, Mr Forell is well known as one who supported the Labor Party's views on what happened in 1975. Nevertheless let us see what he says. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> The best solution would be for Federal Parliament to adopt and seek popular approval for the proposal put forward by Labor's leading constitutionalist, Senator Evans, for fixed term-and preferably 4-year-Parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA> At one stroke this would neutralise the Senate's power to force a government prematurely to the polls and eliminate a Prime Minister's prerogative to call an early election whenever he perceives this to be to his government's advantage.</PARA>
<PARA>What fascinates me is that that is all he can see. With respect to Mr Forell, I wish he would do more than read the heading on the Bill. I hope that he might take the time to read the paper which I have just incorporated in Hansard and which sets out some of the other problems which arise as a result of this proposal. The Canberra Times today produced an editorial in which it admits its point of view. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . The Canberra Times, are strongly of the opinion that the Senate should not continue to have the power to refuse or block Supply to the elected Government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is as it may be. Maybe there are many people in the community who are of that view. Maybe many honourable senators from both sides of this chamber have that view. There is no question in my mind that if the Senate does block Supply the Constitution should be altered to ensure that the Senate also goes to the people. What fascinates me is that the Canberra Times, having announced that it does not think the Senate should have power to refuse or block Supply, then indicates that this is what Senator Evans proposal does and therefore the Government should pick up this proposal and support it. Clearly these people have not analysed the Bill. If honourable senators look at Senator Evans's amendments they will see that this proposal takes away the constitutional right of the Parliament to deal with the executive government. If the people who wrote these articles-perhaps Mr Forell would be one-want to abolish the Senate, that is a point of view which they may adopt. Let them forget the Senate and just look at the effect the Bill would have on the House of Representatives and the parliamentary process. The inevitable consequences of a fixed term for the Senate and a fixed term for the House of Representatives, so far as practical politics are concerned, would be that the Executive would become totally supreme at the expense of the Parliament. We would have an elected dictatorship. There would not be the slightest doubt about that. The Government would serve its term , whether it be for three years or four years, regardless of its behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the United States of America where there is a fixed term government. Let me remind the Senate that the United States people had to wait four and a half years after Watergate before they had an opportunity at the ballot box to express their views about the Republican Government. Surely that was a reprehensible action but there was no way the Congress-do not worry about the people-could get rid of that Government. The Congress could not cope with the situation. The result of a fixed term would be that the executive government would reign supreme.</PARA>
<PARA> Forgetting the Senate for the moment, the House of Representatives will just merely be at the whim of the executive government. Of course, no person who is on the Government side, whichever party is in power in the House of Representatives, will dare to throw out its own reprehensible government. Of course they will not. They know that the result would be that they would immediately face an election and they would lose their own seats. So, from a practical political point of view, there would be no way that the executive government could be taken to the people. That is a question of practical politics, not some airy fairy academic approach to the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA> While we are discussing what happened in 1975, let us look at what former Senator John Wheeldon said in Quadrant magazine as recently as March 1982 in relation to the problems of the Australian Labor Party. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I don't think that one can really look back to what happened in 1975 as being part of some uniform pattern of conspiracy or that too many conclusions can be drawn from it. In fact I am reminded of something that Lord Melboure said when he was dismissed by King William IV. He said: 'I hate to be considered ill used. I have always thought complaints of ill usage contemptible, whether from a seduced, disappointed girl or a turned out Prime Minister'. This is a view to which I also tend to subscribe. I think that a large part of the problems in 1975 were of our own creation.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to Senator Evans in relation to the newspapers that not all of the newspapers have followed his point of view. In an editorial in the Australian on 17 February this year it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Of all of the nations which have a bicameral system none has a more powerful upper house than the Australian Senate. It can initiate any bills other than money bills and it can reject any bills sent to it from the House of Representatives, including, as we were dramatically reminded in 1975, those bills whose passage is necessary to provide the Government with its day-to-day income.</PARA>
<PARA>The editorial in the Australian continued:</PARA>
<PARA> There are sound historical reasons for the Senate having so much power. They have maintained much of their validity until the present day. With Australia's vast area and small population there are good reasons why there should be limitations on the concentration of power in the hands of a simple majority.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate-What date was that?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That editorial appeared in the Australian on Wednesday 17 February 1982. Senator Evans was courteous enough today to give me an advance copy of his statement that he proposes to incorporate in Hansard this evening. That statement foreshadows amendments to take account of certain objections covered both in the paper which he has previously circulated to honourable senators and in other discussions he has had. I have not had time to analyse these proposals in great detail. Of course, I want to look at the wording of the proposed amendments. But one thing is clear to me: Apart from some minor changes , the purpose of the Bill will remain the same-that is, to destroy the Senate and destroy representative government in the House of Representatives. I say sincerely to the Senate that I am reminded of the ambit claims made by certain trade unions, which are well known to us in industrial relations, where they go for broke initially and then come along and put forward proposed amendments to indicate that there is a degree of consideration for other people's points of view. Senator Evans-It is a good faith attempt to find compromise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans said that it is a good and faithful attempt to find compromise. He lays his heart on the Senate table and says that he is being very genuine about this. The fundamental principle of this legislation is a fixed term. He is not, in any way, trying to change that principle. The fixed term concept is a fundamental principle of his Bill. The fixed term concept in fact castrates the House of Representative and the Senate. It makes a eunuch of this place. In effect, it hands over government to the Executive. Despite Senator Evans' claims to the contrary, this fixed term concept, so far as I can see in his proposed amendments tonight, can still be subverted by a government which uses, for its own purposes, the section 57 double dissolution provisions. A prime minister would still be firmly entrenched in power with all the sanctions he has at his disposal against his removal by his own colleagues and by the House of Representatives as a whole. The safeguard against an elected dictatorship is still non-existent. It is very interesting to see that Professor Geoffrey Sawer, who attended the conference that I referred to before in relation to fixed term and four-year parliaments, said this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The trouble with the fixed-term proposal is that it would, unless qualified by other provisions, put an end to a major principle of the Westminster system, namely that the Cabinet chosen from a majority group in the popular House should be able to seek the view of the electorate if at any time its majority is lost through party splits or the withdrawal of marginal minor-party support.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a matter of considerable importance in this debate. In effect, the executive government of the day will be put in a position where it cannot be thrown out of office. Either it will be completely in control of its own chamber or, if some sort of party split occurs, some minority group will keep it in power and it will act in the way that the minority group wishes for its own political preservation. These are the proposals as I see the debate up until these amendments were circulated by Senator Evans. I am really not in a position to go on and deal in total with those proposed amendments but I hope I get an opportunity to speak at some later stage. Could I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage?</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>STATEMENT BY SENATOR GARETH EVANS ON RESUMPTION OF SECOND READING DEBATE</PARA>
<PARA> When I introduced this Bill on 11 November 1981, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I indicated our intention to allow it to lie on the table until the Autumn Session, in order to ensure ample time for reaction to flow back in from politicians in other parties and from the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, although the Government itself has remained uncommunicative, I have had representations from, and substantial discussions with, a number of individual Senators from all parts of the Chamber, as to various aspects of the Bill in its original form.</PARA>
<PARA> It may assist the Senate debate on the Bill if I indicate at this stage those aspects of the Bill which, in the light of those discussions, we are now prepared to amend. The proposed amendments, the text of which I shall circulate after further consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, fall into three categories.</PARA>
<PARA> First, it is proposed that following any extraordinary early elections, the newly elected Parliament not to commence a new three year cycle, but rather merely serve out the remainder of the original term.</PARA>
<PARA> This will meet the objection that the original Bill, despite contrary claims, did not in fact ensure that the Government of the day would lose its present power to freely manipulate election dates to suit its own political advantage: given the ease of cocking the double-dissolution trigger mechanism, early elections could still, under the original Bill, be called at the whim of the Government of the day simply by means of it contriving a deadlock situation. The proposed amendment would clearly operate as a disincentive to use of the double- dissolution mechanism, especially later in the life of a Parliament; at the same time it would still allow ample practical scope for a Government facing an unworkable situation in the Senate to bring about a double-dissolution early in the life of the Parliament, eg. within the first 12 to 15 months.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is proposed that Section 53 of the Constitution be amended only to the extent necessary to remove the Senate's power with respect to major money Bills-viz. those crucially important appropriation and taxation measures the passage of which is indispensable to a Government's capacity to continue to govern. The present constitutional provisions in relation to lesser appropriation and tax measures would remain untouched.</PARA>
<PARA> This meets the objection that the original Bill, which explicitly sought to remove the power of the Senate to block any kind of taxation or appropriation Bill, major or minor, went further than was necessary to solve the immediate problem to which the Bill as a whole is directed-viz. the capacity of a Government to survive in Office so long as it retains the confidence of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, it is proposed that the provision relating to the holding of a joint sitting as an alternative to a double-dissolution be deleted.</PARA>
<PARA> This meets the objection that the provision (based on the recommendation of the 1959 Joint Committee on Constitutional Review) is unnecessary to the basic scheme and object of the Bill-which, again, is to ensure the survival of a properly elected Government, rather than going the whole way toward ensuring that the will of the House of Representatives more or less invariably prevails.</PARA>
<PARA> The general effect of these three amendments will be to remove some of the more potentially far-reaching aspects of the original Bill, to confine its subject matter to that which is strictly necessary to achieve a workable fixed term Parliaments system, and to make the primary effect of the Bill a guarantee of the capacity of an elected Government to survive in Office so long as it retains the confidence of the House of Representatives-rather than a guarantee that the will of the Government will always, or at least usually, prevail.</PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear that this amounts to very much a compromise on the part of the Australian Labor Party, made in the interests of clearing away at least the most devisive and destabilising features of the legacy of 1975. Our longer term goal- which may take more time to find Parliamentry and general community acceptance- remains the creation of a Senate which will operate as a genuine, constructive House of Review, and has no destructive powers to block the passage of any money Bill, or to do more than delay-for six months-the passage of any other class of Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the proposed amendments will now ensure that the Bill receives clear majority support in the Senate. Even more importantly, I hope that they will persuade the Government of the Labor Party's genuine desire to find a compromise, consensus solution to what is obviously a crucially important constitutional problem, and will encourage the Government to reconsider its general attitude to the proposed constitutional amendment accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> Attached to this statement is a paper setting out in more detail the proposed amendments, and describing how they fit into the scheme of the present Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>MAIN ELEMENTS IN PRESENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Basic Rule: Future elections for House of Representatives and half-Senate to be held at fixed three yearly intervals, on the third Saturday in November.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Exception A: An extraordinary election for the House of Representatives ( and also for the half-Senate, to preserve simultaneous elections) is to be held when the Government is defeated in the House, and no alternative Government with the confidence of the House can be formed within seven days.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Exception B: A double-dissolution may be advised by the Government when a 90 day deadlock occurs between the House and the Senate (though not within six months of the due election date).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Restoration of Cycle: If an extraordinary early election (Exception A) or double-dissolution (Exception B) occurs the newly elected Parliament has a three year term, subject to the adjustment necessary to bring the next election date back to a third Saturday in November. (If the extraordinary election occurs within the six months following November in any year, the new term is '3-minus' years; if it is in the six months preceding November, the new term will be '3- plus' years).</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Section 53 is amended by removing the power of the Senate to block any kind of taxation or appropriation Bill, major or minor.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Section 57 is modified to provide that (in accordance with the recommendation of the 1959 Joint Committee on Constitutional Review) in the event of a deadlock between the House and the Senate, the Government can seek to resolve it by advising either a joint sitting (without a double-dissolution) or a double-dissolution.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The powers of the Governor-General to appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister and other Ministers are codified (in particular, it is made clear that the only circumstances in which a Government may be dismissed are if it is defeated on a formal no confidence motion in the House, if an alternative Government does then receive a vote of confidence, and the original Government does not then resign).</PARA>
<PARA>Basic Arguments for Bill (i) The Government of the day, so long as it retains the confidence in the House of Representatives, will be guaranteed its full term of office and not be able to be forced against its will to an early election.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) At the same time-as a politically realistic trade-off-the Government of the day loses its present power to manipulate election dates to suit its own political advantage.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Inherent advantages of a more stable electoral cycle from the point of view of Government planning, of policy implementation, of Opposition policy development, of party campaign coffers, and of voter sanity.</PARA>
<PARA>PROPOSED AMENDMENTS</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Restoration of Cycle: It is proposed that, following extraordinary elections, the newly elected Parliament do no more than serve out the remainder of the original term, rather than commencing a new three year (plus or minus) cycle. This means that:</PARA>
<PARA> In the event of an 'Exception A' election following the defeat of a Government in the House of Representatives, only the House of Representatives would go to the polls-with the next House of Representatives and half-Senate elections occurring at the ordinary scheduled time.</PARA>
<PARA> In the event of an 'Exception B' double-dissolution, both Houses would go to the polls. (The 'short-term' Senators thus elected would be due for re-election at the House of Representatives/half-Senate election at the next ordinary scheduled time.)</PARA>
<PARA> Arguments for: (i) Better preserves 'fixed term' principle in that extraordinary elections to not throw out the basic election cycle.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Overcomes an obvious flaw in the original Bill in that early elections could still be called at the whim of the Government of the day simply by deliberately setting in train the deadlock double-dissolution mechanism. The proposed amendment would operate as a disincentive to use of the double- dissolution mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Still allows ample practical scope for a Government facing an unworkable situation in the Senate to call a double-dissolution early in the life of the Parliament-e.g. within the first 12-15 months. (Double-dissolutions in the latter part of the Parliamentary term would become impractical, but note the original Bill, like the present Constitution, rules out double-dissolutions anyway in the last six months.)</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Does not reduce the full six year terms of Senators except-which is the situation at the moment-in the case of a double-dissolution.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Section 53. It is proposed that Section 53 be amended only to the extent necessary to remove the Senate's powers with respect to major money Bills-viz. those crucially important appropriation and taxation measures the passage of which is indispensable to a Government's capacity to continue to govern. The present constitutional provisions in relation to lesser appropriation and tax measures would remain untouched.</PARA>
<PARA> Arguments for: (i) Bill would continue to explicitly deal with-and remove-the most important and obnoxious of the Senate's powers.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The basic objective of the original Bill was to deal with the central problem-squarely raised by the blocking of supply in 1974 and 1975-of the capacity of a Government to survive in office. The removal of other classes of Senate power might be a desirable objective (certainly it remains the Labor Party's ultimate policy goal), but it is not necessary to the achievement of the object of this particular Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Section 57. It is proposed that the provision relating to the holding of a joint sitting as an alternative to a double-dissolution be deleted.</PARA>
<PARA> Argument for:</PARA>
<PARA> This is unnecessary to the basic scheme and object of the Bill-which is to ensure the survival in office of a properly elected Government, rather than going the whole way (which remains the Labor Party's ultimate policy goal) toward ensuring that the will of the House of Representatives prevails in all matters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats I make my approach to the debate on the Constitution Alteration (Fixed Term Parliaments) Bill 1981 different from the approach of Senator Lewis. There is nothing novel about that in this place. In fact, in the four years I have been here I cannot remember a case where he and I have agreed on anything. Contrary to Senator Lewis's view I want to commend Senator Evans in particular and the Australian Labor Party in general and my own colleague Senator Macklin for the enormous amount of work that has been put into the Bill, the amendments proposed to it and the discussion that it has already generated and, one hopes, will continue to generate in the weeks ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats are committed to constitutional reform. I have the honour of sharing patronage of, I think, several organisations with Senator Alan Missen and Senator Gareth Evans. These are organisations committed to discussion of constitutional change. All of us know that this is a process that needs community discussion. The three of us thought that by having a tripartite approach we might at least take party politics out of the whole debate. I would like to think that the getting together of Senators Missen, Evans, Chipp and others might well have contributed to the very valuable documents now before the Senate in the form of the Constitution Alteration (Fixed Term Parliaments) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> I commend Senator Evans and the Labor Party for introducing this Bill on 11 November 1981. One finds evidence of Senator Evans's impish sense of humour in choosing that date. I am sure it was not fortuitous. I also thank him for the accommodation that he and the Labor Party have given people in the community, particularly the Australian Democrats, in bringing forward the various amendments incorporated in the document before the Senate at the moment. We believe that those proposed amendments now bring the Bill to a stage where it can be usefully discussed in this place, where possibly a second reading can be agreed to and this chamber can go into Committee to iron out the details. I think, and I know Senator Evans would agree, that there is likely to be a long, tortuous, at times tedious but useful debate in Committee on each of the clauses . </PARA>
<PARA> I would not want it thought that the Labor Party and the Democrats are unanimous about all clauses of the Bill. Personally I am as keen about altering the Constitution to ensure fixed terms of Parliament as Senator Lewis is against it. In that respect I can say I am absolutely at one with the Labor Party and with Senator Evans. I have, in my normal fashion of making extreme statements from time to time, called obscene the practice of some political leaders and I do not mean just Liberal leaders. From time to time these political leaders have manipulated the electorate to a certain point and then sought a dissolution six months, 12 months, 18 months-I think at one stage it was 20 months-before due time to suit their own party political purposes. In political terms I believe that is an obscenity. As far as I am concerned, I will do all I can to assist the Labor Party in this chamber in bringing about fixed terms of Parliament. That is how strongly I feel about the matter. We have inbuilt in the present parliamentary system certain possibilities. I want to put to Senator Lewis a purely hypothetical situation. I listened to his arguments and I read his paper.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought they were worthy of commendation; they were worthy of consideration. I do not know whom Senator Lewis had in mind. It is a pity he had to incorporate his paper in Hansard. For those listening to every word I have to say they would now be wondering what was in Senator Lewis's paper. He painted a hypothetical picture of a political party-I do not know which party he had in mind-that was split. Let us assume, just to make the situation easy to understand, that the party is split into a Fraser faction and a Peacock faction and that the Peacock faction is in the minority. Under the original proposals before Senator Lewis he said that that political party, while it had a majority in the House of Representatives, could continue to combine to vote against a motion of no confidence in the leader but at the same time fragment on almost every major vote put before it. Chaos and instability would be the result. As I said to Senator Archer that was an argument worthy of commendation.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will give an illustration of why we want more discussion.

For example, we could well have a Bill to reintroduce conscription. I am taking what is maybe an extreme case to illustrate the point. This Bill may be rushed through by the weight of party numbers in the lower House, brought to the Senate and tacked on to a money Bill. That would mean essentially, according to my advice, that the Senate would be powerless to amend the Bill. It would also be powerless to refuse it. I am no constitutional lawyer, as the Senate knows, but those are the sorts of things that we want to consult on. I believe that in a relatively short time frame we can come to the point where we can carry a second reading vote on the Bill, and then move into a Committee debate which I think could be only useful and productive.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Yes; the Victorian Building Society Association's brochure was one of a number of approved publicity inserts included in pay envelopes in or around October 1981. For many years it has been the practice to allow the representative organisations of banks, credit unions and building societies to provide publicity brochures for inclusion in the cash-pay packets of staff who are employed under the Public Service Act by Commonwealth departments. Following the Government's decision in 1981 to reduce the incidence of the cash mode of pay, the practice was extended to include individual banks, credit unions and building societies; this avoided disadvantage to institutions which had no particular affiliation with representative organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> Publicity of this kind has provided a useful supplement to normal departmental sources of information aimed at informing employees of institutions approved to accept pay deposits, and has been approved on that basis rather than with a view to the promotion of particular investment opportunities.</PARA>

In the case of dieldrin, a national policy prohibiting use on animals has been in operation for some twenty years.
