<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Education, refers to the notice given by the Minister yesterday of the introduction in the Senate of the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill 1982, which deals with the student loans scheme. I ask: What progress has been made in final negotiations with the banks for the detailed arrangements under the scheme? Guidelines were announced in the Budget context and have been welcomed by many students as providing a resource additional to those provided under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and post-graduate awards. They have real expectations concerning the final details. When will the details be prepared and what progress has been made?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I gave notice that this morning I would be introducing in the Senate a Bill to guarantee loans made to students. The only legislation required to put a student loans scheme in place is a Bill to provide the appropriate guarantees in accordance with the provisions of the Audit Act. Therefore, it is not necessary to have all of the detailed arrangements with the banks complete at this time. Negotiations with the Commonwealth Bank, the trading banks and the Australian Bankers Association are continuing. They are being conducted by my colleague the Treasurer. Senator Messner, as Minister Assisting the Treasurer, may be undertaking some of that work on his behalf. There is no legislative requirement for that part of the arrangement, so we are not treating it with the same urgency; but because a loan guarantee Bill is needed it will be introduced today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that the Government, in announcing the proposed student loans scheme , advised that it would provide for an interest rate that would be 5 per cent below the current overdraft interest rate; that is, students would be able to get a concessional rate of interest 5 per cent below the ruling overdraft rate. That is an extremely generous provision for students who wish to take out loans. In addition, the scheme would provide for a two-year holiday, as it were, after graduation before repayments would need to commence. These provisions give considerable assistance to those who had worried that the scheme might have conditions or provisions which were unacceptable. I think people are quite reassured by what is in the proposed scheme and, as I say, I will be introducing the Bill today and I hope that the Senate will deal with it in the next week or couple of weeks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be the same statement that was reported in the Australian Financial Review yesterday. All that I am aware of in relation to what Mr Warner said is what I read in the Australian Financial Review yesterday. I gather from what Senator Button said that it is much the same sort of statement that is reported today. I was not present at the meeting and I cannot personally comment on what transpired there; but the President of the Liberal Party, Dr Forbes, made a statement clearly indicating the support of the federal executive at that meeting for the Government's proposed legislation to recover from vendor shareholders company tax that has been evaded through the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. I understand that the other State presidents have all indicated that the executive has supported that legislation. I cannot comment further on Mr Warner's views other than simply to refer to what has been said by the Prime Minister and by Dr Forbes. I do not know whether other presidents have yet publicly made statements of support for what Dr Forbes has said but certainly the Government, with the support of the federal executive of the Liberal Party, is pressing ahead with this most important legislation, to which it gives the utmost priority. It is being drafted. Of course it is technical legislation and has to be carefully drafted, and a little time is necessary to do that. A special group of Ministers, which I am chairing in the absence of the Treasurer, has already been working on the legislation. Certainly it is our intention at this stage that that legislation should be introduced into this Parliament during the current sitting period-that is, before we rise for the Commonwealth Games. I trust that the legislation will get the full support of the Parliament. I want to emphasise that this was a major initiative of the Government taken before the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and before the Opposition started to make a song and dance about this subject.</PARA></TALK.START>

We must use every means in our power, including direct action, to cause his downfall. Remember, power grows out of the muzzle of a gun. Remember, war is the continuation of politics'-that these phrases in no way represent the thinking of responsible Aboriginal people in Australia, and show strong signs of being the work of an agent provocateur seeking to discredit the Aboriginal people on the eve of the Commonwealth Games? Does the Minister not agree that the dissemmination in such a way of a purported recipe for a napalm weapon is grossly provocative, totally irresponsible, a libel of the Aboriginal people, and probably also a criminal incitement to violence? Will the Minister direct the Australian Federal Police to inquire into this matter with the objectives of identifying the originators of the pamphlet and taking whatever action is possible against them?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H7">Senator KILGARIFF</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Minister for Social Security, and being previously responsible for Aboriginal affairs, Senator Chaney has indicated considerable interest in a program of development to encourage viable self-management in remote areas, particularly concerning Aboriginal employment, in line with the Federal Government's policy of self-sufficiency for Aborigines. I understand that the work of the Joint Working Party on Job Training for Aboriginals has now been completed for a year or more and that the Government believes that the Community Development Employment Project has proved to be lacking in particular areas in its application. Will the Minister give consideration to forming separate joint authorities of the Federal Government and the Northern Territory Government, and other States, to overcome overlapping of funding and programs which would include Aboriginal participation and to bring about a comprehensive, efficient and flexible training and employment program which could be applied to individual Aboriginal groups and communities?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question raised by the honourable senator touches on a number of portfolios, in particular, I suppose, my own, as it is my Department which has the responsibility of administering unemployment benefit. Also the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs administers a number of programs, including that referred to in the question, the Community Development Employment Project-a program which provides funds to communities to enable them to provide employment in lieu of unemployment. The amount of funds available is the amount of unemployment benefit plus a small additional percentage payment to cover overheads and materials. In his question Senator Kilgariff suggested that the Government believes that the CDEP has proved to be lacking in some areas. I think it would be fair to say that the results of the Community Development Employment Project have been somewhat uneven. Some Aboriginal communities-I think Elcho Island is one-have found the CDEP very beneficial. There have been others--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume, who of course has had responsibilities in this area too, has just reminded me of Torres Strait communities which seem to get particular benefit from the CDEP. I think it would be unfair to suggest that the Government sees that program as being a failure. Rather we see it as a program which has had very good results in some communities and poor results in others. However, I confess to the Senate that over a period of years and, indeed, since I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 1978 to 1980, I have been concerned about the overall administration of Commonwealth programs in this area. It is a matter which has been the subject of a whole series of discussions between Senator Baume and me, Senator Baume and Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and various Ministers who have responsibilities that impinge in this area. There have also been discussions at departmental head level. Those discussions have got us to the point where we still have the CDEP within the programs of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and where we have a series of arrangements for the bulk payment of unemployment benefit to communities which seek some form of bulk payment. That bulk payment is often used in very much the same way as CDEP funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are still examining the matter to see whether a more satisfactory overall approach can be devised. In that regard at this stage I simply acknowledge the suggestion Senator Kilgariff has made that we need some form of joint authority from the Federal Government, the Northern Territory and other States to overcome overlapping of funding and so on. I think I should express some interest in that because certainly the officers of my Department with whom I have had discussions over recent months-that is, officers working in the Northern Territory-have expressed concern about the co-ordination and overlapping of programs. The result of those discussions has been to reopen discussions on this subject between the now Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Ian Wilson, and me. I will, therefore, take into account in the course of those discussions the suggestion Senator Kilgariff has made. I think we would probably find unanimity in this chamber for the idea that it would be desirable, wherever possible, to provide some form of employment in remote Aboriginal communities rather than the simple payment of sit-down money which is so often so destructive. I think we would all agree that in principle we want to see the programs of the Commonwealth and of the Northern Territory Government co-ordinated so that there is as little confusion and overlap as possible. I agree that we have some way to go in meeting our various objectives, including those two broad objectives I have named. I will certainly take Senator Kilgariff's suggestion into account in my consideration of this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Acting Treasurer that on 17 August this year by way of a question I outlined the actions of a Sydney tax consultancy service which offers its mainly ethnic clientele refunds on their income tax returns before they are lodged with the Australian Taxation Office in exchange for the clients signing over the proceeds of their income tax refund entitlements to the agency. I then proceeded to point out to the Minister that these clients were being ripped off by the agency as the legitimate tax refunds were usually worth a great deal more than the original sum paid to the unsuspecting client by the agency. Is the Minister aware that the New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs, the Honourable Paul Whelan, on 24 August this year in answering a question asked by Mr Webster, the member for Wakehurst in the State Parliament, named the taxation consultant involved, Mr J. Dekanic of Newtown, and read out statutory declarations detailing the agency's disreputable operations? Is the Minister also aware that the New South Wales Minister wrote to the Treasurer on that same day urging him to take action immediately to put an end to the agency' s unscrupulous practices? Finally, when will the Treasurer outlaw this type of exploitive taxation practice?</PARA></TALK.START>

The earlier question was referred to the Treasurer in the normal way. I would undertake to see what information he is able to provide on it. As I said at the time, there is the likelihood that those who act as tax agents have the assessment and any cheque or adjustment mailed to them. I have had no information on what arrangements they have made in this instance with their clients.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I refer to the suggestion last week by the Australian Council of Trade Unions that half of the recently announced tax cuts should be forgone and the amount saved should be used to set up a fund to provide jobs for the unemployed. I ask the Minister: Is this the first public recognition by the trade union movement of the linkage between unemployment and excessive benefits to those in work and, while accepting that the ACTU scheme would not achieve the objects it claims, is there not something there which would help our search for a fair wage system which would match our present economic situation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="770" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like other members of the Government and no doubt members of the community, was interested to see the proposition put forward by the ACTU last week which included as one of its elements the proposition that there should be some forgoing of tax cuts and the funds thereby made available should be used to provide jobs for the unemployed. Senator Hamer asks whether this is the first public recognition by the trade union movement of the linkage between unemployment and excessive benefits to those in work. My response to that would be to say that, whilst it may be the first formal acknowledgement of that linkage by the trade union movement in Australia, I think there has been some informal acknowledgement of it in some recent wage settlements which have in a number of cases been on a basis which is rather less than one would have expected over recent years and where there has been, I think, in that practical sense, an acknowledgement by trade unions that wage rises which outstrip increases in productivity are likely to be counterproductive, and, I suppose, a welcome return to the view which was put by Frank Crean that in some circumstances one man's wage rise can be another man's job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the ACTU proposition of last week. That was the first formal recognition by the union movement that excessive wage increases are one of the factors contributing to our current economic difficulties and an acknowledgment of the importance of curbing unemployment. It does stand in some contrast to previous formal announcements by the movement which have tended to focus more on increasing the incomes of people in employment with little recognition of any responsibility of the union movement to the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government certainly has no quarrel with the basic objective to increase employment. Indeed, that is its fervent wish. We do have some concerns with the nature of the ACTU proposal and with its timing. It is a matter of regret, for example, that a proposal with as many suggestions that are relevant to budgetary consideration should have been put last week after the Budget rather than at the 7 July tripartite conference which was held by the Government to provide an opportunity for employers, trade unions and the Government to consider the very significant economic difficulties which face the country. Another difficulty is that it is a precondition of the ACTU plan that there should be government support for the maintenance of real wages which is probably something which could not be undertaken in the present economic circumstances if we are to increase employment. There are, of course, a number of practical problems, including whether the ACTU is in a position to speak for the whole of the working people of Australia in offering to forgo tax reductions which have been pretty eagerly sought by the great bulk of Australians. But I think the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has indicated that he is willing to discuss the proposal further with the ACTU if it wishes. I think the original statement of the Acting Minister, Mr N. A. Brown, did make the same point that he was prepared to have discussions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has been in contact with the President of the ACTU and has made it clear that the offer stands-that is the offer originally put forward by Mr Brown-and that he is prepared to meet the ACTU, discuss the plan and try to put some flesh on its bones to see how relevant it might be in the preparation of next year's Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government maintains the view that wage restraint in the present economic circumstances is essential if sustainable economic growth is to be achieved. By interjection the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate denied that Mr Brown had offered to discuss the ACTU offer. I refer to page 3 of the Press release which was issued by Mr Brown on 3 September, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> If the ACTU wishes to have discussions with Government on the proposals it has put forward, then the Government is willing to do so. However, such discussions would need to be on the clear understanding of the importance the Government attaches to wage restraint in present economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>As a participant in the tripartite discussions which took place in Canberra in July, I believe it is important that we maintain a dialogue with employers and the trade union movement. There are problems which I believe cannot be solved by government alone, by employers alone or by the trade union movement alone. I believe therefore that those opportunities for dialogue should be pursued.</PARA>

It is unfortunate but I have to say to Senator Townley that there is no way in which that matter can be raised by Cabinet at this stage of the game, nor is any change contemplated. The benefit to which the honourable senator referred is very significant. It follows a significant increase in the funeral benefit last year-from $300 to $400. This further rise of $100 to $500 represents a very significant benefit for relatives of veterans who unfortunately died owing to their war caused disabilities. It is a policy of the Government to continue to review the amount of the funeral benefit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Social Security concerned that the amount of unemployment benefit paid to young people between the ages of 15 years and 18 years has decreased in real terms by something like 40 per cent since 1975? How does the Minister expect young people living away from home to exist on the miserable sum of $40 a week? Is he at all concerned that this low benefit has contributed to the problems of homeless young people in the community and indeed forced many of them into prostitution? Will the Minister undertake to put pressure on the Prime Minister and other members of Cabinet to have the amount of benefit paid to 15 to 18-year-olds increased to a more realistic level?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question raised by Senator Foreman is an important one and it is difficult to answer it shortly. Indeed, if he looks at the recent report on homeless youth by the Senate Standing Committe on Social Welfare he will see some of the complexities of this matter, and the fact that that all-party Committee reported unanimously-although some honourable senators have put a slight gloss on the report since in speeches in this chamber-that there really are no simple solutions to the significant problem which he has raised. It is true that since 1975 the holding of the rate of unemployment benefit for the under 18-year-olds has effected a diminution in its real value. That is a fact. The Budget this year contains an increase. The level of benefit is to rise from $36 to $40 a week in November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In examining this matter the Government has not looked at the problem in isolation. Over recent years the Ministers with responsibilities relevant to that group, and principally the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs-as he then was-the Minister for Education and the Minister for Social Security have looked at their proposals affecting the 15 to 18-year-old group in common as part of the Budget process. I speak from memory now but I think the statistics roughly show that we have 750,000 Australians in that age group. Of that number about 500,000 are in education. We would welcome that, of course, and believe that if anything that number should be increased. Something like 200,000 are in employment and about 50,000-I say about because the figures may have varied a little recently-are unemployed. We have to examine the alternatives available to people in that age group. We would see unemployment as being the worst alternative. We have looked at the education allowances-the current Budget made significant improvements in them, both with respect to secondary assistance and the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme-because we do wish to encourage the maximum number of those people to increase their skills and remain in education. Obviously we see employment as the next best option. In that regard I think we have made a 25 per cent increase this year in training allowances and the sorts of subsidies to employers which will help to reduce the barriers between that group and employment.</PARA>
<PARA> In the final and worst alternative, that of being unemployed and on unemployment benefit, we have to try to maintain a situation where the unemployment benefit is not seen as a significantly better financial alternative to the other alternatives available to youth. So we have tried to ensure that there is not an imbalance between the incentives for young people either to remain in education or to be employed or to be on the dole. The great bulk of the age group that Senator Foreman mentioned in his question live at home. A recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey shows that something in excess of 80 per cent of the age group he mentioned remain living at home with their parents. Again, that is a matter we would wish to encourage. We believe that the maintenance of some parental responsibilities for people who are still very young is desirable and it does colour the extent to which we should have benefits which might be trying to show that these people are automatically to be regarded as fully dependent.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, there remains a problem and the problem is that a relatively small number of people in that age group who are independent are, for a variety of reasons-some of them because they have been rejected by their families, some because perhaps they are adventurous and have simply left home-living away from home and trying to survive on at present $36 a week, soon to be $40 a week. The Government acknowledges that this is a problem.</PARA>
<PARA> What approach is to be adopted? In the current Budget we simply adjusted the benefit and, in acknowledging that the problem remains, we also produced additional funds for the Youth Services Scheme. There was an increase of $500, 000 in the funding which was offered to the States for that scheme-a rise from approximately $1.3m to $1.8m for the current financial year. That is matched money and will, I think, enable a significant maintenance of effort among homeless youth.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, for the first time the Government made available to my Department some additional money-I think the figure is $300,000-which will enable us to provide some additional assistance to those agencies which are working among the homeless unemployed youth. That figure really relates, I think, to additional assistance of about $10 per week per child who has been away from home for more than about eight or 10 weeks. It is meant to be a sort of interim measure of assistance while the Government considers the report of the Senate Committee, while the Government considers the report of the evaluation of the Youth Services Scheme and while we further consider what are the appropriate policies for that age group that Senator Foreman has mentioned-the under 18-year-olds.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry to respond at length but this matter is not a simple one. I want the Senate to be quite clear that the Government, across a range of departments, has addressed itself to the problem. It sees the maintenance of incentives for students to remain in education as very important. It sees the maintenance of programs which will bridge the gap between those who have left school and employment as important. It sees the maintenance of effort in the social security area, particularly the maintenance of effort among agencies working with that group, as very important. I think that approach by the Government is in broad in line with the all-party approach adopted by the Senate Committee. I can assure the Senate that the matter that Senator Foreman has raised is receiving continuing attention. It will be the subject of discussion among officials at the Commonwealth-State administrators meeting which I understand will be held in October. It will certainly be the subject of discussion between Commonwealth and State Ministers at the welfare Ministers conference in February . I can only say that I think we are making some progress in this vexed area but there are still answers to be found.</PARA>

It is alleged that the survey has established that up to one third of these children have early signs of coronary heart disease and chronic lung diseases.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw an article in the Sydney Morning Herald which drew attention to the health of school children in respect of the early signs of a number of degenerative diseases. I presume that is the article to which Senator Lajovic referred. It seems to me that many of the degenerative diseases which plague our society develop during life. It is not surprising that children, particularly those whose lifestyle is unsatisfactory in some way, may show some early signs. I imagine that the factors which would have to do with the evidence revealed in the survey mentioned by Senator Lajovic would include smoking, obesity, dietary factors and lack of exercise if, indeed, that was a characteristic of the group. It merely brings home once again that the main area of reversible illness in Australia that we have to approach concerns lifestyle- induced diseases and that many of the solutions to these problems do not rest with better hospital facilities but with a better lifestyle and better advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will certainly approach the Department of Health, as Senator Lajovic has sought, with a view to getting the best figures that are available on the health of Australian school children, particularly as they may relate to the presence of risk factors or to the evidence of illness.</PARA>
<PARA> I mention to the honourable senator that recently in the Senate I was asked about nutritional advice. I was able to advise then of some work being carried on through the National Health and Medical Research Council and one of its sub- committees in which nutritional advice is being given more widely. Of course, honourable senators will be aware of the emphasis on healthy lifestyle factors generally through departments of Health, certainly through programs such as the one that was mounted through the Health Commission of New South Wales some years ago in Lismore and not least, of course, through programs which are being promoted within this Parliament for those of us who have the honour to serve as parliamentarians. While I cannot guarantee that the evidence which appeared in the newspaper report was accurate, I have no doubt that the thrust of what was being presented is correct; that we do have a problem and that the way to approach it is to try to attack lifestyle factors and to promote exercise and a healthy diet in that group of children.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware that the statement calls for concerted action under a national housing policy to give priority to improving housing conditions for the poorest? How does the Government's policy of spending $415m on tax rebates for home owners, irrespective of their income or housing needs, square with the priorities enunciated in the Catholic Commission's statement and with the Minister's own announced priorities for social welfare generally? What action does the Government now intend to take in response to the clear need to redress the woeful inadequacies in its housing policy, particularly as they relate to those most in need of assistance?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="774" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am familiar with Press articles on the report which has been put out by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. I think it has been made available to me but I have not yet had a chance to study it. But I am aware of the broad points made by it which, as I understand it, are along the lines raised by Senator Giles in her question. She asked about the priority given to improving access to housing for the poorest. I remind the Senate that there was indeed an acknowledgment of the difficulties in this area not immediately in the Budget, although of course it is part of the Budget provision, but prior to that at the Premiers Conference when the Commonwealth announced a considerable increase in the funds made available for welfare housing. The increase for this year is a 27 per cent increase over last year and all of the increase is in the form of non-repayable grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, at the time of the Premiers Conference, the Commonwealth indicated to the States that it was prepared to allow the States, if they diverted additional parts of their housing and works programs to housing, to receive the loan moneys at concessional interest rates. In other words, the States not only were given additional funds-indeed a 27 per cent increase over last year-but also were encouraged to divert additional funds of their own. The encouragement is fairly considerable since the money is made available at, I think, a 50-year term with an interest rate of something like 4 1/2 per cent. In Australia in 1982, they are pretty attractive terms. I know that a number of States, including my State of Western Australia, showed great interest in this. I understand that a series of States have been able to lift their welfare housing effort as a result. So, in fact, in the field referred to by the honourable senator the Government has sought to respond to the problem. The response has been in the form of cold hard cash.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the question also raises the question whether, at the same time, we should be providing relief to home buyers through tax concessions on interest payments. It is fallacious to look at any Budget from one point of view only, whether it be the welfare, defence or any other point of view. In framing the Budget the Government has to look at the range of requirements of the Australian community. Unless Senator Giles is woefully out of touch with her electorate and suburban Australia she would be aware that many modest Australians, who regard themselves as not wealthy, feel that current interest rates exert real pressure upon them. I believe that they would resist any suggestion which might be made by Senator Giles that they do not warrant assistance or relief in the current circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that there has been some interest relief through the tax mechanism would be widely welcomed by the 70 per cent or so of Australians who own their own homes. Many of them would have seen that as providing fairly important, perhaps essential, relief, given recent increases in interest rates. In a Budget which has to take account of the needs of all Australia I point to the fact that there has been a 15 per cent increase in the appropriation for my Department. After one takes into account the fact that this is a 26 pay-days year, rather than a 27 pay-days year such as we had last year, this represents an 18 per cent real increase in the proposed effective expenditure of my Department. I point also to the 27 per cent increase in the welfare housing field and the interest concessions offered to the State governments to encourage the increased provision of welfare housing. I point also to the doubling of assistance in regard to the emergency accommodation for families program. There have also been significant increases in the provision for the aged and disabled persons housing program. The Government acknowledged the difficulties in the low income housing area. We do not claim that the problems have been solved but would claim that in the current Budget provision we have made most significant contributions to reducing them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not like Senator Giles to be under the impression that I am trying to imply that she is out of touch. After hearing her repeat her question, I think I would state bluntly that she is indeed out of touch with her electorate. As I tried to explain at some length in the answer to her question-I am conscious of Opposition complaints about long answers-the Budget has to be framed to take account of a wide range of needs and requirements in the community. I pointed out that my own Department, which deals with a substantial proportion of the community which is in need, has been granted very significant increases in proposed expenditure. I referred also to the very significant increases in proposed expenditure on those programs which relate to housing for people who are on low incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the broad assistance which has been given to all home buyers in Australia is concerned-it is important to note that all home buyers still paying mortgage interest will receive relief under the current Budget-I remind Senator Giles that the recent increases in interest rates have imposed a real degree of hardship on many who would not have regarded themselves, in any sense, as being welfare cases. I believe there will be massive agreement among them that those changes were needed. The definition of need is very elastic. I point out that those who argue the poverty case will always say that hardship is a relative matter. I would say that in suburban Australia there has been a degree of relative hardship which has been of concern to the community. It has been of concern to the Government also and I do not believe that the Government has to be apologetic for granting relief in that area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information on this subject. I am advised that the Air Navigation Regulations require the owner, operator or pilot in command to use the grade of fuel specified in the aircraft flight manual unless otherwise approved by the Secretary to the Department of Aviation. It follows that the regulations prohibit the use of any other kind of fuel. The fuel grade or grades specified in the flight manual are those for which the aircraft and the engine manufacturer have shown compliance of the engine and aircraft with safety design standards. Some light aircraft flight manuals specify grade 100 to 130 aviation fuel as the only approved fuel. The Secretary to the Department has advised that grade 100LL-I understand that that stands for low lead-aviation fuel is an alternative. Some light aircraft flight manuals specify grade 80 to 87 aviation fuel. This fuel is no longer available in Australia and the Secretary has approved the use of grade 100 to 100LL aviation fuel as an alternative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department is aware of the problems to which Senator Crichton-Browne has drawn attention in respect of the maintenance of some engines. Some engine manufacturers are aware of supply difficulties with low octane fuel and have recommended engine modifications to counteract some of the difficulties with the use of higher octane grades of aviation fuel. I understand that advisory circulars are issued to operators in the industry on all those various measures.</PARA>
<PARA> There are safety problems with the use of motor spirit in aircraft engines primarily because of the higher volatility of motor spirit and the differences in specifications and quality control of motor spirit and aviation gasolene. As far as is known, the use of motor spirit overseas has been on a very limited basis. I understand that in the United Kingdom it is permitted in a limited range of light aircraft with temperature limits which are unsuitable for the Australian climate. The United Kingdom also has special quality control on the fuel provided in this way. The only known approval in the United States of America has been for use in experimental categories of aircraft. The Minister and the Department are aware of moves in Australia to have motor spirit approved for use in aircraft. The Aviation Industry Advisory Committee has recently been formed and an ad hoc working group, with representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce, is currently being set up to advise on the use of motor spirit in light aircraft. The working group is monitoring activity on this subject from overseas and is awaiting the outcome of experimental work being done on the subject within this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. Sturt's desert pea, which has the botanical name of Clianthus formosus, was first recorded by William Dampier in the north- west of Western Australia in 1699. Dried specimens of this plant can still be seen at Kew Gardens in London. The explorer Sturt first saw the plant in 1844, 145 years after Dampier discovered it. Will the Minister endeavour, through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other relevant authorities, to have the common name of the plant changed to Dampier pea? The famous botanist Alan Cunningham gave it the botanical name Clianthus dampieri. Most shires in the northern part of Western Australia use it as part of their official emblems. I believe that the change would be an appropriate way of marking the 300th anniversary in 1988 of the year William Dampier first landed in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know about other senators but I was certainly impressed by the wealth of botanical knowledge and expertise shown in the question. I understand that there are strict international rules governing the scientific names given to plants but that common names, such as Sturt's desert pea, are entirely a matter of local usage. My colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, may be able to ask the Bureau of Flora and Fauna, which advises him on the names of plants, to examine whether there would be any difficulty in recommending to the Australian public that this plant be called Dampier pea. That would be a matter of usage rather than a matter of scientific name. Mr President, as you would be well aware, the plant known as Sturt's desert pea was gazetted in 1961 as a floral emblem of South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The recovery of tax evaded by vendors who sold company shares at prices which made no allowance for the company's contingent tax liability, and the need for the Senate to unequivocally support this action. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax cheats have been plundering $40 a week from the average Australian household . The time has come to make them give it back. For many years this larceny was viewed benignly by a Prime Minister whose fundamental instincts on this subject are similar to those of a former Chief Justice. For five years the present Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has supinely presided over non-enforcement of the law. For two and a half years the Treasurer (Mr Howard) watched the diversion of billions of dollars from the public revenue to the Liberal Party and other tax dodgers. He then limited the diversion but for another one and a half years did nothing to recover the money which had already been stolen. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last two months, spurred by fear of electoral retribution, the Government has proclaimed its intention to recover a tiny fraction of the money stolen by tax cheats. This tardy move has been denounced by a gaggle of Liberals , not because it is pusillanimous, which it is, but because it threatens to retrieve anything at all that has been stolen from those who have stolen it. The ganders of this gaggle include the Premier of Western Australia, Mr O'Connor; an endorsed Liberal Party candidate, Mr W. W. Mitchell; the President of the Liberal Party of Western Australia and its current bagman, Mr Ian Warner, and Mr Ian Collie, a Melbourne solicitor, who laundered Garland's companies for him in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party is in open revolt. Last Tuesday the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) strutted around the House of Representatives impersonating a tough leader who had stood over the Liberal Party and imposed his will on them at the Liberal Party's Federal Council meeting. The Liberal Party President, Dr Forbes, has given identical assurances in letters published in all major newspapers. Yesterday, Western Australian Liberal Party President Warner dropped the bucket on them and revealed that the Prime Minister had in fact appeased the tax dodgers at the Liberal Party Council meeting by watering down the proposed legislation. He went further than that. He threatened to tell the world, to give the world a comprehensive account of what had in fact happened at that meeting. As my colleague Mick Young said in the House of Representatives a couple of days ago, we want the minutes of what happened at that Liberal Party meeting, not the Prime Minister's version of it or the official Press release. </PARA>
<PARA> This campaign to prevent the recovery from these thieves of a tiny fraction of the money they have stolen from Australian households and Australian taxpayers, a campaign to which the Prime Minister has already, to some degree, succumbed, so Mr Warner tells us, is supported by claims that the vendors of the companies or of the shares in the companies were innocent bystanders and therefore it is quite unfair to take back from them the money that they should not have had in the first place. It is difficult to imagine a more absurd proposition. It is like saying that if a bank robber has managed to keep a stolen payroll for a few years he should not have to give it back either. These people are getting off lightly. Many of them should be prosecuted under criminal law. All of them will pay back the tax that they have evaded after they have had the use of that money for many years and after inflation has eroded the real value of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The foremost exponent of this innocent bystander line is Denis Horgan, a tax dodger, a Liberal Party bagman and the holder of seven government offices. He was the principal shareholder of Treamog Pty Ltd which was flogged off to Maher in 1976 and which, in the process, evaded a $1.7m current year contingent tax liability. Denis Horgan's personal share through his direct and indirect holdings in the company was $1m. He has offered various excuses in public. He said that there was no current tax liability at the time the company was sold. That applies to almost all the companies that were flogged off to Maher and his ilk. </PARA>
<PARA> He said the company had plenty of money available, when he sold it, to pay the tax. Of course it had plenty of money. It had nothing but money. That is why the company was sold. It was sold because it was bursting with money. Horgan said he had no idea what Maher would do with the company after Maher had bought it and, therefore, he was an innocent bystander. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to quote from the 1976 annual report of Metro Industries Pty Ltd, which was taken from the Corporate Affairs Office in Perth. Metro Industries was a shareholder in Treamog, the company that was sold. Metro described Treamog as an indirect subsidiary of Metro. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Treamog Ltd, 93.15%, representing net tangible assets of $4,068,583, was disposed of for a consideration of $5,799,267. </PARA>
<PARA>Net tangible assets of $4m were disposed of for a consideration of $5.7m. That $ 1.7m difference represents the tax that Denis Horgan and the other shareholders evaded. This was disclosed in the annual report of Metro Industries, a company of which Denis Horgan is also a shareholder. Horgan also claimed on another occasion that he had paid tax on the profit derived from the sale of Treamog through the other companies in which he also had an interest and of which he was a director which had derived profits from the sale. That might have been plausible if he had not flogged off three other companies to Maher and Donnelly, all of which were shareholders in Treamog. That is not necessarily an exhaustive list. We know of three other companies which he flogged off to Maher and Donnelly. The companies were Henderson Investments Pty Ltd, Norwood Investments Pty Ltd, and H.B.D. Holdings Pty Ltd. All of these companies, directly or indirectly, were major shareholders in Treamog, the company which was originally sold off. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard photostat copies of documents taken from the Corporate Affairs Office of Western Australia giving details of the directorial changes in those three companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Denis Horgan has the chutzpah to say that he did not rob the bank ; he just sold the robbers the get-away car. He sold four cars to the same robbers. He said that he could not tell the crooks but the crooks kept coming back to buy another car so that they could rob another bank. Because they are exempt companies we cannot get the full financial details of the other three companies I have named, which Horgan flogged off to Maher and Donnelly. They are incorporated in Perth. For the financial details of just how much extra tax he evaded on those companies we will have to wait for the election of a Labor government in Western Australia and the appointment of a McCabe-type investigation of the Corporate Affairs Office in Western Australia. That is something that will happen next year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator Peter Rae</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That doesn't require a Labor government. It was a Liberal government which set up the inquiry in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A Liberal government might have done it in Victoria, but I guarantee a Liberal government will not do it in Western Australia. There would be too many skeletons lying around there. Some of them have now been deposited here. As well as being a multiple tax dodger who flogged off at least four companies to Maher and Donnelly-I might add that in one case at least he left the minority shareholders whistling for their money and set them up to be fleeced by these other crooks-this fellow has been the beneficiary of multiple government patronage. He currently holds seven government offices, including a directorship of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and a commissionership of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. When this matter was raised with the Treasurer a couple of weeks ago he said that just because someone is mentioned-I repeat the word 'mentioned'-in the McCabe-Lafranchi report does not mean he is not fit to hold government office. Mr Horgan was not just mentioned in the report. In the first place he was identified as a major beneficiary of the sale of a company for the deliberate intent of evading a contingent tax liability. We now know that he flogged off at least three other companies to the same crooks. Has the Treasurer asked Mr Horgan at any stage any questions about his multiple involvement with Maher and Donnelly, or does the Treasurer, like the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), not want to know about it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A couple of weeks ago the Prime Minister said that he had ordered the tax dodgers to get out of the Liberal Party. If that really happened, the party would be able to hold its State conference in a backyard dunny, at least in Western Australia. But more importantly is the Prime Minister saying that he expects higher standards of personal propriety in the Liberal Party than he does in the Government over which he presides? Whether that is what he means to say, that is in fact what is happening. He told the tax dodgers to get out of the Liberal Party, but he allows this tax dodger to continue holding seven government offices. He denounced tax dodgers as recipients of stolen money, although his actions on 19 September 1980 suggest that he does not believe that condition should disqualify anyone from holding a position in Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> This Treasurer, who purports to be tough on tax dodgers and who is being fraudulently sold to the public as the toughest Treasurer there has ever been on tax dodgers, appointed Denis Horgan to the AIDC Board in March 1981. Within four months the AIDC was into tax dodging, as the Auditor-General's report tabled a couple of days ago reveals. Horgan showed the AIDC how to do it. Did the Treasurer appoint him to the Board so that he could show the AIDC how to get stuck into tax dodging, as he had been doing with his own business for at least the previous six years? Is that why this Treasurer, who purports to be tough on tax dodging appointed this tax dodger to the Board in the first place and now refuses to remove him, even after the public disclosure of so many of his infamies? If this limited legislation-which has already been compromised, so Mr Warner informed us at the Liberal Party State Council meeting-gets through the gauntlet of Liberal Party tax dodgers, will it ever be enforced?</PARA>
<PARA> The present Attorney-General has presided over the non-enforcement of the law. His answers two days ago suggest that he is quite satisfied to procrastinate for seven years over whether prosecutions should be launched. If he remains Attorney -General, most of the tax dodgers will be dead before he gets around to prosecuting them. He admits-or claims I suppose I should say-that his whole defence rests on the claim that he did not know what was going on in his own Department. He was told by the McCabe report what was going on in his own Department. The report mentioned Kierad, the company disposed of by Syd Corser, the Liberal Party bag man before Denis Horgan. We keep coming back to this nest of crooks who run the Liberal Party in Western Australia. McCabe told the Attorney-General that that was not an arm's length transaction for reasons which I do not have time to explain. </PARA>
<PARA> Two days ago I asked the Attorney-General whether he had instructed his Department to investigate the Kierad case. He said no, he had not, and then admitted that he did have the power to do it. He has known about that for three months. He not only does not know what is going on in his Department but also when someone from the outside tells him what is going on he still does not instruct his Department to do its duty. He sat for three weeks-or as Senator Lewis insists 15 days; I do not care which it was-on the Costigan report before he suspended those crooks in the Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth. How many files fell through the bottom of the drawer and into the shredder in those 15 or 21 days? He now says he is going to appoint a special prosecutor. Well, that is good. Nobody would oppose the prosecution, by whatever means, of these people. But above all we do not want special prosecutors. What we actually needed was a Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office that was not staffed by drunks, brothel keepers and incompetents. We needed an Attorney-General who terminated that condition and we have not got one. The Attorney-General does not frighten tax dodgers any more than he frightens John Dawkins. It is a pity he was not as quick at launching prosecutions as he is at issuing stop writs. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we come to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). There was no action at all on tax dodging and no action at all on the recovery of money from these thieves who have stolen money from Australian taxpayers for years until the McCabe and Costigan reports appeared. Then for the basest of electoral reasons we got a proposal for the limited recovery of stolen money and a lot of tough talk, most of which was exposed as fraudulent by the Western Australian Liberal Party President yesterday and today. We have a Prime Minister who has tolerated and continues to tolerate Mr Howard as Treasurer and Senator Durack as Attorney- General, both of whom were aware for years of widespread evasion of income tax and refused to take effective action against it until the full magnitude of their negligence was disclosed in other reports prepared by people outside the Government bureaucracy. The Prime Minister knew about tax dodging at least as early as September 1980 when we started asking questions about the tax dodging activities of one of his former Ministers, Mr Garland. What did he do when he found out about that?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government fully supports the matter of urgency which has been moved in the Senate today. That does not mean that we support the language of Senator Walsh or the demeanour of Senator Walsh in moving what is a matter of urgency and of importance. The Government supports the matter of urgency because it encompasses the basic thrust of the Government's proposed legislation to recover from vendor shareholders the company tax that was evaded in bottom-of-the-harbour strips of untaxed company profits. In order to understand the Government's proposal to recover this evaded tax it is perhaps important to realise the true nature of such schemes. I do not know whether the talk of recent days puts clearly just what is the Government's proposal so I think I ought to do that right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unlike many other notorious schemes such as the Curran scheme, the bottom-of- the-harbour scheme did not involve sophisticated tax avoidance arrangements under which the liability for tax was avoided. On the contrary, it involved a case of outright and illegal evasion of tax in which most of the tax for which a company was liable ended up in the pockets of the people who sold the company. The companies concerned were simply put in a position where they had no assets to meet their tax liabilities. To this day those tax liabilities have not been met and are still outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA> The first step in the chain of events in this sort of operation was that the shareholders, known as the vendor shareholders, in a profitable company, known as the target company, sold their shares to a promoter who paid the full value of the target company's assets less his commission. Of course, the assets included funds which under normal circumstances should have been set aside to pay the target company's tax bill. Vendor shareholders thus received a sum of money considerably greater than that which they could reasonably have expected under a normal commercial sale because the promoter had no intention of paying the target company's tax liabilities. In a typical case, the promoter then transferred the company to men of straw-that is, people of no financial substance-or to fictitious persons or companies at fictitious addresses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It could have been members of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. At this point the company's records often, but not always, became untraceable; that is, they might well have been at the bottom of the harbour. That is the origin of the scheme's picturesque title. The Commissioner of Taxation might then have issued an assessment for income tax against the target company but the Commissioner could not succeed in collecting the taxes owed because the target company by then had no assets left to pay the bill. The new directors or owners of the target company were either completely fictitious, untraceable or else they were so-called men, or sometimes women, of straw. In the McCabe-Lafranchi report there was a vivid description of how some of these men of straw were recruited at race tracks by criminals and offered a free holiday in Brisbane in return for their signatures. One person recruited, a woman, was quoted as telling how she spent days signing cheques-some of them for $12m or $14m and one which she remembered for $74m. It is clear that at some point at least some, if not all, of the participants in this type of scheme intended to defraud the Commonwealth of money. That is, they intended that money , which should have been set aside as a provision for tax, in fact went into the pockets or bank accounts of the vendor shareholders and/or promoters. A very small part-literally a few dollars out of many millions-went to the men of straw who were induced to sign the forms, documents and cheques for a fee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One might well ask what has been the action with regard to this. I remind the Senate that in 1980 the Government brought in special criminal legislation against these practices. The Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act now makes it a criminal offence punishable by up to five years gaol and/or a fine of up to $50, 000 either to promote or to take part in these schemes. The Government was advised at the time that this special legislation was needed to deal effectively with the problem that had been identified. More recent legal advice has suggested that criminal law remedies against at least the promoters of these schemes were available under the law prior to December 1980. As announced by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in his response to the Costigan report, proceedings under this law will be pursued with vigour through a special task force. But a great deal of revenue had already been lost to the Government-not in the sense that it was not owing to the Australian Taxation Office but in the sense that under ordinary, existing procedures it could not be recovered from the companies concerned. The very great amount of money involved has become apparent in the intervening period. </PARA>
<PARA> The McCabe-Lafranchi report commissioned by the Victorian Liberal Government was the first point at which names were put to the vendor shareholders of many of the bottom-of-the-harbour companies in Victoria. The New South Wales Government said later that it would hold a similar investigation. Today the Attorney-General of New South Wales made some statements in that regard. Ironically, the Federal Government, which was the principal victim of the scheme , could not provide names because of the strict secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which prevented the Commissioner from revealing any details of taxpayers' personal affairs. Whether or not it was strictly necessary, there can be no argument that the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act has proved a most effective deterrent to people contemplating bottom-of-the-harbour arrangements. But as evidence has mounted as to the true prevalence of the practice before the Act was passed and the sum of money outstanding to revenue as a result, the Government has been forced to consider whether it should take steps to recoup these debts to Commonwealth revenue. Therefore, it has announced that it will enact legislation to make the vendor shareholders-the people who sold their profitable companies to promoters-liable for the tax debt of the company. That is why we have no problem in supporting the matter of urgency. It is already the subject of an announcement and many statements by the Government. On 25 July, prior to the Budget, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) made a statement outlining proposals to enact legislation to collect these funds and named the sums, as known to us at present, that would be collected. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of people have voiced concern about possible retrospective elements of the proposed legislation, but in considering that issue it is important to bear in mind that the legislation will not create a debt which was not previously owing. It will make vendors of the bottom-of-the-harbour companies-those who profited most from the schemes-liable to pay the tax assessed on the profits of the companies that they sold. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The matters that we have been discussing are the subject of the legislation which has been foreshadowed by the Treasurer and which it is hoped to introduce in the Parliament within the next week or two. As the Attorney-General said at Question Time this morning, that legislation is the subject of very detailed consideration so that it will be effective. Its intent has already been described, and I believe that when it is introduced we will see support for it from all sides in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the vendor shareholder aspect, which is virtually the subject of this matter of urgency, it has been put by those who would argue against the proposed legislation that many vendor shareholders had no idea that after the sale of their shares the taxation liabilities of the companies would be illegally evaded. Indeed, it is understood that many vendor shareholders were counselled by their advisers not to ask questions about what was to happen. In other words, their ignorance of what was to happen after the sale would be their defence. On this issue it is worth noting that, as far back as September 1978, senior counsel advised that any prudent vendor would have satisfied himself about the intentions and capacity of purchasers regarding the payment of the company's tax before entering into the arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the proposed legislation is the subject of a great deal of consideration and detailed discussion on the part of Government Ministers and their advisers. It will require each vendor shareholder to pay an amount equal to his or her share of the evaded company tax. The special tax would, of course, be refunded to the vendor shareholders if it should happen that, after the special tax has, in relation to a particular company, produced for the public purse an amount equivalent to the evaded company tax, proceedings against the promoter under the general law were to secure payment of the amount of the company tax itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The situations to which the special legislation will relate are those in which the shareholders of a company have together sold their shares in the company for a price that made it evident that company tax on profits that had by then arisen would not be paid. The shares, having been purchased from these shareholders, were typically sold in turn to other persons, culminating in their becoming owned by men of straw. The legislation will apply to the vendor shareholders in the first of these sales, but only where the company tax had not then, or has not since, been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation could be invoked only when the company tax liability was finally established, that is, when rights of objection and appeal had ceased to be available through the effluxion of time or had been exhausted, and assessments were final. Once the new special legislation has been enacted, the Commissioner will call on each vendor shareholder to pay an amount representing that person's share of the evaded tax. The way in which the proceeds of the sale of a company were split between the vendor shareholders will generally determine each shareholder's share of the evaded tax. A claim will not be made against the estate of a deceased person or against beneficiaries of that estate where, at the time the vendor shareholder died, a claim had not been made. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be immaterial whether the company tax has already been assessed, is assessed in the future or, as has happened in some cases, the target company has already been liquidated. Vendor shareholders will not be protected from the special liability by the target company having been put, in association with the strip, into a tax avoidance scheme, if that scheme is held not to be effective. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will not affect those people who sell their company at a commercially realistic price to new owners in whose hands the company becomes unable to pay its company tax due to commercial misadventure. Some vendor shareholders will have been companies, or will have held the shares as trustees. Beneficial ownership at the time of sale could have rested, perhaps through a chain of ownership, with others. The broad aim of the legislation in these situations will be to attribute the special tax liability to the people who have received the benefit of the proceeds of disposal of the shares concerned. An assessment will be due for payment 30 days after notice of its issue. Any amount of the special tax that remains unpaid after that date will carry the statutory penalty tax for late payment. The Government aims, by that level of penalty tax, to indicate its objective of recovering quickly the amounts of evaded tax. To underline that policy the penalty tax will be capable of remission only in the most exceptional circumstances. Assessments of the special tax will, of course, be subject to the usual rights of objection, review by an independent Taxation Board of Review and appeal to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident that the action which it proposes to take will return very large amounts of outstanding revenue to where it belongs-the public purse on behalf of the Australian people. Not to take such action would be to confirm that the Government expects the average Australian taxpayer, particularly the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer, to dig deeper into his pocket in order to meet the national debts and bills. At the same time, the tax evader would be permitted to enjoy the rights of citizenship and government services conferred by citizenship without contributing properly to costs. A number of difficult considerations are involved in this whole issue. The proposed legislation needs to be very carefully prepared. As I have said, it is the subject of very active consideration and work at present. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the confidence of the average citizen in the overall fairness of the taxation system can best be maintained by proceeding with recovery of the tax outstanding under these schemes. As I said earlier, we welcome the opportunity to talk about it and to build the community opinion to support the legislation when it is introduced. There has been a lot of public comment with regard to those who oppose the proposed legislation and it is very timely for the Senate to show that it can support what has been the announced policy and foreshadowed legislation of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement issued by the Treasurer towards the end of July indicated that the amount of revenue to be collected is estimated to be about $450m. That figure may grow as we proceed further into this activity but that amount was identified by our advisers at the time of preparing the Budget. That amount is significant and those of us looking at the matter closely would consider that it will grow. Certainly it is an amount that we would expect to be collected and one that we believe the proposed legislation will make it simpler to collect and possibly more secure as far as receipt into the Commonwealth revenue is concerned. For those who are interested, details of the proposal are in the statement of the Treasurer of 25 July. There are also the further statements made by those speaking on behalf of the Government on matters of public importance in the Parliament. It was stated that it is expected that a couple of hundred million dollars can be expected to emerge this year from legislation to recover from vendor shareholders the tax that was evaded in the bottom-of-the- harbour strips of untaxed company and Division 7 profits carried out before the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act of 1980 made such conduct a specific criminal offence under Commonwealth law. </PARA>
<PARA> The fraud involved in these transactions was always a fraud as it involved offences against companies Acts and crimes Acts. The proposed legislation to recoup the proceeds of these frauds does not create any retrospective offence. It was always an offence, and that offence is one that has resulted in tax not being properly paid. It does not make illegal something that was legal at the time when these arrangements were entered into; it simply seeks to recoup the proceeds of these frauds from those who benefited from the frauds which were perpetrated by promoters who did not themselves benefit to any great degree apart from their relatively modest commissions. The promoter simply charged a fee-in many cases as small as 3 per cent-for arranging the fraud, with or without some of the beneficiaries knowing that it was a fraud. The fact remains that the benefit was passed to the vendors of the companies involved and it is these vendors who are now being obliged to repay the money that they received as a result of these fraudulent acts by the promoters with whom they associated. </PARA>
<PARA> The dilemma that has faced the Government is a simple one. Whilst it has been keen to proceed against the promoters, and such action is now being pursued, it is evident that no real revenue benefits will emerge. The advice the Government received-that the only way to protect the interests of the taxpayers who actually pay their taxes and whose burden is naturally higher because of the evasion of the responsibilities of the people in these schemes-was to seek recoupment from those who benefited from the schemes. Much has been made of the argument about retrospectivity. One hears all sorts of general comments, general attitudes, being stated against retrospective legislation. It has been said that it is immoral to introduce retrospective legislation or what can be termed retrospective charges on those who believed they had legally avoided taxes. </PARA>

That is the basis of what we are talking about. They are now being required by this proposed legislation to give back the money to those to whom it properly belongs-that is, the Australian people. It does not mean that people who sold companies at higher than their asset backing are at risk; it is only those cases where the companies acknowledge tax liability were evaded by fraud that will be covered by the proposed legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Opposition believes that, in this context and in the context of the statement made by the Western Australian Liberal Party President, especially in recent days, the motion is most timely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has been born out of deceit and treachery. It has been presided over by the same people and it governs for the treacherous. As I said earlier, it is the most scandal ridden and corrupt government in our history and it and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) will be remembered as a latter day Ali Baba with his nest of thieves. Let us look at the Government, some of its members and some of their interests. We start with Garland in 1976 and his run through the courts. We then had the de facto mayor of Stumpy Gully, Phillip Lynch. Then we had cases involving Ministers Moore and MacKellar. National Country Party Ministers have always found themselves in the newspapers, having been involved in scandal, whether they be Mr Nixon, Mr Sinclair or Mr Anthony. We have the case which has been continually pressed by my colleague, Senator McLaren, of Doug Anthony who borrowed money from the Federal Government at 4 3/4 per cent, bought a home with it and then leased it to the Central Intelligence Agency. We have the continuing case of the parole officer from Armidale, Mr Sinclair, who has seen his days in court as well. The history of this Government so far is one that would make the loans affair of early 1974 and 1975 look like a boy scouts picnic. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to tax avoidance which, as I said earlier, has been a massive fraud perpetrated on this Government. We have within the Government people who themselves have acknowledged that schemes that they have been involved with have been tax avoidance schemes. I refer very briefly to the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, who in the Canberra Times of 26 November 1977 is quoted as saying: ' Yes, well, I did have a family trust; it was a way of avoiding tax.' If the Prime Minister is sincere about tax avoiders in his Government he should take Mr Anthony to task for that statement and that description of the scheme in which he was involved at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The defence is put up, especially by the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party, that vendor shareholders are innocent bystanders and that as such the Government, negligent in not pursuing them at the time, has no moral right to pursue them now. As Senator Walsh said, these vendor shareholders and promoters are getting off easy. There is a criminal law that should have been applied in respect of them and which possibly could still be applied. The question of recovery is one which the Government is tackling. But in some instances these people have had seven, eight or 10 years to use these stolen funds, as the Prime Minister refers to them. Considering normal forms and returns of investment, these people would now have in their own coffers two or three times the amount of money that they defrauded from the Commonwealth. It is probably used at the moment for other like schemes. The vendor shareholders knew or should have known what they were involved in and as such should be made criminally liable and should also be made to pay back moneys to the Government together with interest accrued. Let us look at some of the statements of these vendor shareholders. The great promoter, the one who has become notorious but who should not be singled out as the only person involved, is Brian Maher from Queensland. In an interview on Nationwide on 2 September 1982, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I, at times, become very annoyed with the press, who seem to be obsessed with the fact that Brian Maher is a man involved in tax avoidance and race horses. In fact, I love both. </PARA>
<PARA>He was saying that he knew what he was doing. He was showing no guilt about it at all and would unashamedly continue to act in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Melbourne Age of this morning Mr Peter Gallus, formerly a Liberal Party branch president and branch secretary and party State council delegate in the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party, has been described by one Victorian Liberal Opposition back bencher as 'a strong influence and a prominent member in the eastern suburbs in the Liberal Party'. </PARA>

He was exposed this morning in the Melbourne Age as being involved in the accountancy firm of Ward, Knight and Dunn, a firm which in recent months has been seen to be implicated with the Mr Asia syndicate, with Nugan Hand and with every other such rort. Mr Gallus, in response to the inquiry from the Age, said that in 1979-80 taxation minimisation schemes were 'fair game'. He also said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I regret it. Obviously, the community reaction to tax minimisation has changed markedly. </PARA>
<PARA>So, fair game they were. The Treasury was fair game then, but the only reason why this prominent member of the Liberal Party regrets his involvement at the time is that the community attitude has now changed. The fact that his activities then were both illegal and immoral is of no importance to him. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned Mr Maher and Mr Gallus. The size of the fraud perpetrated on the Commonwealth can only be imagined, given statements such as that made by the Attorney-General of New South Wales, as reported in this morning's edition of the Sydney Morning Herald. He says that Brian Maher was involved in 400 companies but that in New South Wales over 4,000 companies have been found to be involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. So we have a fraud extending over those figures, cumulatively, of $10 billion to $15 billion over its term of operation. In that context we have a government whose response has been quite shallow. </PARA>
<PARA> The degree of the fraud can be appreciated by looking primarily at the reports of the Commissioner of Taxation. The Commissioner, time after time, came to the Parliament with his annual report detailing the number of companies that he assessed as being involved in tax avoidance. In October 1981 he said that he could identify over 22,000 persons and the degree of the money defrauded from the Commonwealth was $973m. That was his assessment on the information that he could obtain. This compares with a figure in 1975-76 of 861 people he identified as tax avoiders. It is clear from the Commissioner that this tax avoidance industry has blossomed under the Fraser Government, and it is not very hard to understand why that is so. The same Commissioner came before an Estimates committee of this Senate last year and said that with the government cutbacks, with a three per cent reduction in staff ceilings, he was in no position to enforce the taxation laws efficiently. He said that the reduction in staff ceilings would ensure that he would lose 179 officers in the enforcement section of his office and as a consequence government revenue would be down by $46.8m. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact one can clearly say that the Government has been at least negligent in its application of tax laws, because at that time-the Treasurer, in his statement on 26 June in response to the McCabe-Lafranchi report identifies that particular time-the Government was quite aware of the full extent of taxation evasion. Page 3 of the Treasurer's statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> It was not until 1979 or 1980 that the full extent of such schemes really became apparent to the Australian Taxation Office and to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>We dispute whether that was the first time that the Government knew about it. But for the moment, let us accept the Treasurer's statement at face value. At the particular time the Government knew that tax evasion was rampant, the response was to cut back the number of people in the Taxation Office involved in implementing taxation laws, and all for a saving of $1.5m-a shallow and false saving at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this response by the present Government is not a response of a Liberal government federally only. We in South Australia are experiencing the last days of the Tonkin Government, and that, too, has implemented staff reductions. We have a scandalous situation in South Australia in which the Corporate Affairs Commission of South Australia has not been able to institute proceedings in the magistrates court for about three months, all because of staff reductions and cutbacks, staff cutbacks which have forced people in the prosecution area into other parts of the Corporate Affairs Commission. Whereas prior to this Government action there would be 20 or 30 such complaints listed per week, we now find that 20 or 30 corporate crooks in South Australia are getting off scot- free. But that is also quite understand- able, given the history of the Government in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week my State colleague, Chris Sumner, identified a tax avoidance scheme which he referred to as the bottom-of-the-Torrens scheme in South Australia. It centred on the sale in 1975 of the Liberal Club Ltd in North Terrace, Adelaide. What prevailed there was a scheme whereby the sale of the property was cut up into 27 transactions, all for the saving of $7,662.25 in stamp duty. </PARA>

<PARA>Program: Nationwide</PARA>
<PARA>Date: 2 September 1982</PARA>
<PARA> Richard Carleton: This taxation scandal is getting more and more complex, more and more confusing, and more and more like the 'loans affair' of 1975. The bureaucrats are now brawling at the highest levels, as each department, each commission, each office, tries to distance itself from these quite scandalous circumstances. Whereas Nationwide reported last night that there were three, and not just two, Q.C.'s opinions recommending action over the tax evaders under the then existing law, it now appears that there may have been half a dozen or even more opinions, legal opinions all recommending the same thing, prosecute, prosecute. And the Government didn't and hasn't. Mr Fraser has unfolding before him a problem of enormous proportions. These legal opinions were sought by various arms of the Government, one arm not showing the other what it was doing. Some of the opinions were volunteered. Some were from liquidators, chasing company shells. At least three of the opinion givers are not now just common or garden $2,000 a day Queen's Counsel. They're now judges themselves. Just to run through some of the names: Webb, Forsyth, Traill, Lockhart, Davies, Russell, Brinsden, Connolly. Four States: New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria, and that's so far. Millions, if not billions of dollars, and the Government has suspended three civil servants. This evening Senator Durack has released a statement that is in many respects a rejoinder to last night's Nationwide. Last night Nationwide said that there was an investigation into the Sydney Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office, not just the Perth office, over a failure to prosecute a tax matter. Tonight Senator Durack has confirmed that. We said last night that the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office had sought the opinion on a tax scheme from Mr Lockhart, Q.C., now a judge of the Federal Court. Senator Durack tonight confirms that. We said that no action was taken to prosecute. Senator Durack does not deny that. Nationwide said the tax scheme was a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Maxine McKew: As is well documented now, Brian Maher, the boy from north Queensland, first came into business prominence in the jungle of Sydney's Parramatta Road car yards. It's now on public record that in December 1961 Maher was convicted of 16 charges of false pretences and was sentenced to three months imprisonment. It was a beginning far removed from his present Gold Coast lifestyle, and his naming in the Victorian McCabe-Lafranchi Report as the Mr Big of the bottom-of-the-harbour tax avoidance schemes. But certainly Brian Maher is no stranger to inquiries into his business dealings, and it's those earlier inquiries in his resident State of Queensland that have now led the A.L.P. Opposition into insisting that the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes could have been nipped in the bud had the Queensland Government pursued the activities of Mr Maher with a lot more diligence. In 1978 Opposition M.L.A., Kev Hooper, first raised the matter of Maher and his company dealings in Parliament. The Hansard records show that Mr Hooper called Brian Maher a white collar crook. </PARA>
<PARA> But Maher's company dealings had been under investigation long before Kev Hooper's attack in the House. In November 1972 Mr P. D. Connolly, Q.C., began examining the affairs of Finance and Guidance Proprietary Limited. Maher was one of its directors. Mr Connolly, now a Supreme Court judge, in fact prepared three reports. In the third he clearly showed that there were major malpractices by some members of the stock exchange in their dealings with Maher and his companies. Mr Connolly found that Maher and fellow director, Neil Oliver Gibson, were guilty of conspiracy to defraud the investors. He also found that Maher had made fraudulent representations to clients of the Finance and Guidance operation . But in conclusion Mr Connolly said, 'As to the criminal liability of the directors, I doubt whether a prosecution under section 3044 of the Act could be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA>Extract from Interview Brian Maher: I, at times, become very annoyed with the press, who seem to be obsessed with the fact that Brian Maher is a man involved in tax avoidance and race horses. In fact I love both. </PARA>

<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Page 3 ''It was not until 1979 or 1980 that the full extent of such schemes really became apparent to the Australian Taxation Office and the Government.''</PARA>
<PARA>Page 12 ''A case of company strippping came to the attention of a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation early in 1973. Following an extensive investigation by Taxation officers the matter was reported to the Commissioner's Head Office in July 1974.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''The Deputy Commissioner received this opinion in January 1975, and it was to the effect that on the material presented by the Commissioner to counsel, grounds existed for prosecution under Section 67 of the Companies Act and under Section 86 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and that proceedings could be instituted under Section 367B of the Companies Act.''</PARA>
<PARA>Page 13 ''Having checked that secrecy provisions would not operate as a barrier to prosecution, in August 1975, the Commissioner authorised the Deputy Crown Solicitor to take the necessary steps towards action under the indicated sections of the Crimes Act and the Companies Act.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''The police having in November 1976 reported in favour of action under the nominated Crimes Act and Companies Act provisions.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''The Commissioner in March 1978 took the matter to the Crown Solicitor himself , using as a particular instance the then unresolved case of the company whose situation had been before the Deputy Crown Solicitor. Discussions and correspondence ensued and in April 1979 the Commissioner received Crown Law advice to the effect that there was insufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of 'conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth'.''</PARA>
<PARA>Page 14 ''Throughout the pre-1978 period, the Taxation Office had been seeking to initiate action in relation to other stripped companies.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''For example, in one case, reported to the Taxation Head Office in April 1976, it was proposed that the stripped company's past or present officers or directors be prosecuted. Again legal opinions were sought as to whether actions would lie against appropriate persons under Section 231 of the Assessment Act, the Crimes Act or the Companies Act.''</PARA>
<PARA>Page 15 ''However, following an extended series of discussions and taxation enquiries, conferences between taxation and legal officers and counsel, advice was received from counsel, along with comments from the Deputy Crown Solicitor, to the effect that proposed assessment action against the vendor shareholders would be unlikely to be upheld, that prosecution action would not lie against any person, that Section 367B of the Companies Act could not be successfully invoked and that further enquiries would be to no avail.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''To conclude this section, in each of the cases taken to the Commonwealth's legal authorities for advice, it turned out that the advice was to the effect that prosecutions could not, with sufficient prospects of success, be launched.' '</PARA>
<PARA>Page 28 ''Advice was received on 12 December 1979 from the Deputy Crown Solicitor that no offences could be established under the Crimes Act or the Assessment Act.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''The Deputy Crown Solicitor did suggest that winding up proceedings could be instituted against the company but doubted whether such proceedings would have any beneficial effect in relation to the recovery of tax. Moreover, he considered action under Section 367B of the Companies Act not to be advisable, in view of the costs involved, unless there appeared to be some real prospect of recovering money.''</PARA>
<PARA>Pages 29-30</PARA>
<PARA> ''Because of his continuing concern about the general matter, the Commissioner of Taxation again wrote to the Crown Solicitor in May 1980 about the first of the cases that I have outlined in this statement. The Commissioner indicated in his memorandum that the particular method of avoiding or evading the payment of tax by companies was continuing to be used quite extensively and was creating serious problems for the Taxation Office. The Crown Solicitor was asked if he would further examine arrangements of this kind for the purpose of advising whether, in his opinion, there was any reasonable basis for the possible application of section 367B of the Companies Act, section 231 of the Income Tax Assessment Act or section 5 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. It was indicated to the Crown Solicitor that the particular case could be taken as typical of the case with which the Taxation Office was currently concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crown Solicitor replied to this memorandum in September 1980. In his memorandum of advice he observed that what had been seen to be the particular deficiency when the matter was last looked at was that of evidence, namely that there was insufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of conspiracy to defraud, and this problem still remained.''</PARA>
<PARA>TRUST USED TO MINIMISE TAX, ANTHONY SAYS</PARA>
<PARA> ORANGE: The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, said yesterday that his family trust was used to ''minimise tax payments''. </PARA>
<PARA> In a reply to a question at a press conference, he said the trust was used for a number of purposes for distribution of income to his family. He said it was a way of avoiding tax. </PARA>
<PARA> When asked did he believe government ministers should disclose their pecuniary interests, Mr Anthony said it made no difference. He had accepted a guideline as laid down by the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> He did not think that a reasoned judgment could be obtained in such matters during an election campaign and to do so the matter would obviously go deeper and deeper. </PARA>
<PARA> On Thursday night at an election campaign meeting in Griffith, Mr Anthony strongly defended the right of all people to be involved in family trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> ''Family trusts have been a part of British law going right back to about the 14th century'', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> ''There's nothing illegal about them, as court after court has said, 'A person has the right to minimise his tax commitments as much as he possibly can, provided it is legally done.'</PARA>
<PARA> ''And a family trust is merely to enable a family to be able to share the benefits and to confer an interest in a property''. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony said he had a family trust ''to try to protect my interests''. </PARA>
<PARA> ''I've got a farm and I would like my children to have some association with that farm'', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government had closed the loophole in the family-trust structure which now precluded children under 16 being included for the benefits of tax deductions. </PARA>
<PARA> ''We did this before any attention was drawn to this matter (resignation of Mr Lynch) and it was Phil Lynch who did just that'', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> More than 50 of his audience of 250 people acknowledged that they were involved in family trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony said the ''dirtiness'' being introduced into this election campaign relating to family trusts was being pushed by socialists who believed that people must not own anything and they must not protect anything. </PARA>
<PARA> ''And it is the same when I hear Mr Whitlam beefing about the elimination of estate duties which he says are only for the wealthy'', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> ''This is part of the socialists' platform. You must not own anything and it's dirty to have property. This distinguishes you from other people in society''. </PARA>

<PARA>KINGSTON ELECTORATE MEETING</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a great deal of publicity in recent times as a result of publications in Victoria and also as a result of the Costigan Report against so- called bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. I sometimes wonder how many people know what these schemes are about, but basically they involve getting rid of companies that had a tax liability to the Commonwealth to the benefit of the shareholders. In other words, the shareholders were converting a tax liability to the Commonwealth or if they like, to the generality of all other taxpayers to a situation in which their own shares were worth more and could be sold for more . This is obviously something that was improper on the basis of latest legal advice, has probably always been illegal and subject to litigation. This has been brought to notice as a result of the McCabe/Lafranchi Report, as a result of the Costigan Report and as a result of the Taxation Commissioner's own investigations. As a result of the Costigan Report the Commonwealth is establishing a special prosecutor, a special task force will be formed to pursue the promoters and special legislation will be introduced to recover the funds that would otherwise have been paid as tax over past years. That is not creating a new liability, it is collecting the funds that should have been paid in any case. In a real sense, the recipients of those funds have in their hands stolen funds, whether you want to say stolen from the Commonwealth or stolen from other taxpayers it doesn't matter very much. </PARA>
<PARA> I was delighted when the Federal Executive of the Liberal Party last Friday, unanimously issued a statement which supported what the Federal Government is doing in relation to these particular matters. In the light of some of the publicity out of Western Australia, that particular press statement ought to be noted and ought to be given maximum publicity. </PARA>

<PARA> During the 1970s and up until about July last year Mr Gallus held numerous positions in the Liberal Party. He served as president of the Doncaster North branch, vice-chairman of the Doncaster electorate committee and was a delegate to the party's State Council. His most recent position was as secretary of the Doncaster North branch in mid-1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gallus has been described by one Victorian Liberal Opposition back-bencher as a 'strong influence' and 'prominent member' in the eastern suburbs. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gallus said that in 1979-80 taxation minimisation schemes were 'fair game'. 'But I regret it', he said. 'Obviously, the community reaction to tax minimisation has changed markedly. There's a political furore developing about it. I just don't like being part of that sort of thing.'</PARA>
<PARA> He added: 'I have never done anything wrong to my knowledge. I state that very categorically. I have always had a good reputation in the past, I try to maintain that. All of the schemes were completely legal.'</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gallus speculated that he obviously had 'political enemies left in Victoria. Some of them, I think, have got the knife in for me, by the sounds of it. I am very disturbed. I have always been an honest person'. </PARA>
<PARA> The commission found that Mr Berger then contacted a finance broker with whom the company had had 'previous dealings'. </PARA>
<PARA> Soon afterwards, Mr Berger was contacted by Mr Gallus. The report said that Mr Gallus 'got in touch' with a Mr Robert Dillon, an estate agent acting for the commission, and a central figure in relation to Housing Commission land deals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave- Following the remarks of Senator Bolkus about a transaction involving a company known as Liberal Club Ltd in connection with the sale of a building on North Terrace in Adelaide to a company called EC Holdings Pty Ltd, I point out this matter was referred to in the Legislative Council in South Australia last week. The matter was raised by way of a question by the Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Chris Sumner, addressed to the Attorney-General, the Honourable Trevor Griffin. I would just like to point out a few facts in connection with that transaction. Firstly, it is true that Mr Griffin was the President of the Liberal Party in 1975. At that time he was also, by virtue of his position as President of the party, a director of Liberal Club Ltd. As a result of that he also knew of the sale of the building on North Terrace to the company EC Holdings Pty Ltd. The transaction was undertaken by way of a single contract. Subsequently there was a presentation to the company, upon execution of the transfers for the sale of the property, of 27 separate transfers. This was referred to in Mr Sumner's question last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The chairman of Liberal Club Ltd, Mr John Coumb, sought legal advice on whether he was required to sign those 27 transfers when they were presented for execution. I am informed that he was advised that legally he had no alternative but to sign. I make the point here that in the contract initially there was no reference whatsoever to those separate transfers being drawn up and there was no indication at that stage or at any later stage, until the receipt of those transfers for execution, that that was a requirement of the purchaser. Accordingly, the Chairman, Mr John Coumb, signed those documents. There were no savings or benefits to the Liberal Party, its members or any of the shareholders of Liberal Club Ltd. As I think Senator Bolkus mentioned, this was a very common practice and it still is. It is known as moiety transfers. They have been applicable in this kind of transaction for many years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am coming close to the point. Senator Bolkus also referred to my personal involvement presumably with EC Holdings. At least I presume that that is what he was referring to. I have had no connections with that company whatsoever, except insofar as I was involved through another company with the sale of properties to one of the companies of that group, whose name I cannot remember at this stage, in about the middle of 1975. At that time I was instructed to incorporate a company known as Liberal Investments Pty Ltd. My secretary and I were both the subscribers and the original directors of that company. Almost immediately-I cannot recall the exact dates-transfers of those shares and the details of directorship changes were recorded. That was transferred, I think, to one Mr Christianos and one other person. That was the last matter in respect of that company with which I was involved. There can be no inference that I was in any way involved as the company's accountant and I gave no advice to the Christianos group of companies, whether it be EC Holdings or any other company. As such I was in no way involved with the company referred to by Senator Bolkus, the Liberal Club Ltd, the owner of the property, which sought the sale of the property to the Christianos group.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The recovery of tax evaded by vendors who sold company shares at prices which made no allowance for the company's contingent tax liability, and the need for the Senate to unequivocally support this action. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst we support the motion in general terms I point out that it is superficial and is not even accurate as a description of what the Government is taking action to overcome. Perhaps it gives some measure of the appreciation or lack of appreciation of the situation on the part of the Australian Labor Party that it cannot even get the wording of the motion right so that it correctly spells out what is the subject matter of the action needing to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget statement makes it very clear that the Government is taking action. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle has outlined in considerable detail the action currently proposed. But there are other matters which I believe it is important to refer to and I will be quoting from the Budget Speech in just a moment. Legislation is being carefully prepared by the Government to overcome the problem of what are known as bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and some of the other avoidance schemes all of which have gone out of existence according to every person who is knowledgeable on the subject. They have gone out of existence since December 1980 when this Government introduced legislation to make it a crime to engage in that type of practice. That was action taken by a Government nearly two years ago and that Government is being criticised for its inaction. In fact, it has successfully wiped out the tax avoidance scheme industry. The motion also does not add anything to the fact that the Government has clearly announced and repeatedly discussed the steps which it is proposing to take in relation to bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the Senate's view can be expressed today in relation to this matter. I have little doubt that the body of support around the chamber will be in favour of action being taken against fraudulent activities which resulted in losses to the general revenue and, thereby, increase the tax liability on the part of the honest taxpayers of Australia. The motion does not refer to all of the types of tax avoidance or evasion, nor does it refer to the other steps which are being taken by the Government to counter those forms of tax avoidance and evasion. For instance, with cash payments possibly an even greater amount of tax is being avoided by Australians than has been avoided under some of the notorious schemes which have been eliminated by the 1980 legislation. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his Budget Speech said:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that as much if not more revenue is lost through outright evasion and non-declaration of income together than under artificial tax avoidance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore as part of its ongoing policy against both tax avoidance and evasion the Government has taken a firm decision to introduce from 1 July 1983 a system of deducting at source an amount on account of tax in respect of certain payments for labour and services. </PARA>
<PARA>Later he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Government has taken a firm decision to launch the new system it wishes to fully consult affected groups regarding implementation. </PARA>
<PARA>It may be a more appropriate use of the Senate's time for it to be debating to some extent what would be an appropriate or practical way for the Government to take steps of the type it has outlined than to be regurgitating a matter which has been the subject of considerable debate and time in this chamber in the past couple of sitting weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion, which refers to the sale of company shares at prices which made no allowance for the company's contingent tax liability, does not in fact describe the nature of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The problem with bottom-of-the- harbour schemes was not the price at which the company shares were sold but the fact that the assets of the company were stripped and the liability which attached and continues to this day was not able to be met from any remaining assets of the company. That is the problem and that is what leads to the situation in which the Government has said that the vendors must, in cases of fraud-it is only the fraudulent sales which are being attacked by the Government 's proposed legislation-be taken to have known that there was something peculiar or unlawful happening for them to be able to obtain, in the circumstances in which they did, the sort of sale price which they obtained. In speaking to this matter in the other chamber, one Government member pointed to the fact that it is really no different from the situation in which a man in the pub buys a gold watch worth $1,000 for $10. He can hardly afterwards be heard to say that he really thought he was just getting a bargain. He must be taken as having known that he was buying something which was either stolen or had in some way been unlawfully obtained, if he buys a watch worth $1,000 for $10. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the law has traditionally been to the effect that if someone does that he gets no better title to that watch than the title which the vendor of the watch had. If it is found that those people are in possession of stolen goods they must return those goods. Similarly, where there was a tax liability which had arisen in relation to companies and where the owners of the shares, in circumstances which amount to fraud, avoid that liability, it does not seem unreasonable that action be taken under the law to recover from those people. What is proposed, as I understand it, is that there will be a further examination of the possibility of taking acting under section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. There is the possibility of action being taken under the Crimes Act and legislation will be introduced to support action taken to recover from those involved in fraud. But the emphasis is that there must be a fraud. There must have been a fraudulent activity taking place before anyone need be concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> That point, I think, is misunderstood in much of the debate about the alleged retrospective nature of the legislation which is proposed. We have not as yet seen that legislation. I do not know whether its effect will be retrospective. We have heard the Treasurer say repeatedly that it is not retrospective legislation; it is not making something illegal which was legal at the time that it was done. I think that is probably the most important point and one which we need to emphasise in relation to the way in which the Government is proposing to recover. If the legislation does turn out, as it has been indicated that it will , to do no more than facilitate the recovery of a legal liability which had arisen and if it is established that at the time a fraudulent arrangement was entered into, that is not retrospective in its effect because it is simply facilitating the recovery of a liability which had already arisen. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view, and I am still curious as to the reason why more has not been done, that where that type of scheme is being entered into that is very clearly what section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act was intended to do; to give the Commissioner of Taxation discretion to be able to set aside the scheme and recover the tax. I am still dubious, notwithstanding some of the well-known decisions of the High Court of Australia in relation to that section, as to why it would not apply to these clearly fraudulent schemes which were entered into. But I do not dwell upon that; I merely make the point that if the schemes were fraudulent then there ought to be no objection to recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has in fact taken many steps with regard to tax matters. I should like to run very quickly through some of them. Since July 1977 the Government has brought in more than 30 separate measures to deal with specific tax avoidance arrangements. That is hardly what has been described by some Opposition speakers as the activity of a government that has not bothered about this matter at all or has not taken any steps in regard to it. Over 30 measures have been introduced since 1977 and, as I said earlier, the tax avoidance industry has been completely destroyed by the Crimes (Tax Offences) Act of December 1980. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Walsh and Senator Bolkus made what amounted to a series of unsubstantiated allegations about individuals. I can say only that they must be scraping the bottom of the barrel fairly hard if they have to come up with allegations such as the one which was answered totally and absolutely by Senator Messner here just a few minutes ago. If the basis of their allegations is to try to make some mud stick on the Government parties it is pretty poor if the best they can do is to raise a matter that can be answered as totally and completely as Senator Messner answered it. I suppose it could be suggested that they are trying to introduce here the bottom-of-the-barrel scheme of slander under privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference was made to the Australian Industry Development Corporation. There was an allegation that the Corporation had been involved in tax evasion. That is not true. What happened was that senior counsel advised the AIDC in relation to certain commercial transactions. Commercial auditors also advised the Corporation in relation to certain transactions. That advice was to the effect that the matters being undertaken by the AIDC were normal commercial practice and within the powers of the Corporation. No question has been raised that the AIDC was involved in any form of evasion of tax. But yet again this is thrown in by the Labor Party speakers in this chamber as if it is some form of guilt by association, because somebody who had been involved in some tax avoidance scheme in Western Australia had some association with the AIDC. </PARA>
<PARA> In the tax evasion area the Government has proposed a large number of steps with which it is going ahead. I believe the allegations which have been made here today by Opposition speakers under the cover of supporting the Government's already proposed action has been just another form of endeavouring to smear the situation. Where there is positive proof, action has been taken by this Government to prosecute and to amend the law. I do not believe that this Government or any other government should act on the basis of suspicion, smear and innuendo to take action against individual people or, by some form of guilt by association, to condemn innocent people. Earlier I mentioned the question of fraud. If innocent people are involved-this is something to which Senator Chipp referred by way of interjection-I do not see why those people should not recover from their advisers damages for the action taken. This should apply if people are misled as to the nature of the transaction and if they believe they were behaving properly and innocently. I believe that matter ought to be investigated . </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we need to look at the Tax Agents Registration Board to ensure that that Board has sufficient power to be able to take action against any person who has been involved as a tax agent in the preparation and development of tax avoidance schemes and to ensure that that person can never again practice as a tax agent. I believe that the Tax Agents Registration Board should be given extra power. In the past difficulties have been experienced by the Board in obtaining information from the Australian Taxation Office because of the provisions of section 16 which are alleged to apply and the question of defamation. If that is so I would seek to have the Government amend the law to ensure that the Tax Agents Registration Board can be effective in playing its part in reducing any type of tax avoidance in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating an urgency motion, on which I presume there will be a vote, in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The recovery of tax evaded by vendors who sold company shares at prices which made no allowance for the company's contingent tax liability, and the need for the Senate to unequivocally support this action. </PARA>
<PARA>The last two weeks have seen some remarkable revelations about the workings of organised crime in Australia under the very noses of Ministers and Government departments. Tax avoidance and evasion schemes have cost the Australian community thousands of millions of dollars. It is difficult to comprehend how they have been allowed to multiply to the extent to which they have. As a result , the average taxpayer has had to pay more tax and people in need have been denied assistance which could have been financed from the tax which has been evaded. Our system has failed dismally to protect the basic stability of our democratic society. With thousands of millions of dollars in the hands of unscrupulous criminals, our legal and political system as a whole cannot be considered safe from corruption. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Costigan has decribed the workings of the criminal system in chilling detail . First, there are the investors who supply the capital. They do so at arm's length but knowing full well they are a party to secret crimes. Secondly, there are the financial and managerial experts who assemble the funds and put them to use in an organised manner. The third tier is the group to which Senator Peter Rae just referred-the shyster lawyers and accountants-which provides assistance for the scheme itself and assistance whenever it or any of its participants run into trouble with law enforcement agencies. Finally, there are the criminal operatives, the cosh merchants, the people who carry guns, the drug pushers, the enforcers and the couriers. </PARA>
<PARA> The urgency motion before the House addresses itself to one sector of the tax evasion industry, the large number of tax evasion schemes collectively known as bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. There are many variations on the theme. I gave an example of one oversimplified scheme yesterday. Today, because we are not on air , I wish to give another variation of the theme which is not quite so simple but one that I believe is closer to reality. I take the example of a legitimate trading company with substantial current year profits, and therefore having an obvious tax liability, which is cashed up. That means that all assets, including the goodwill, stock and equipment and the liabilities, are transferred to a newly incorporated company. I will call that company A1 because usually in these schemes the new company was registered with a very similar name to the original company, The new company, A1, carries on the normal business of the original company A. Company A, the original company, retains only cash in the bank equal to the accumulated and current year profits. The name of the company is then changed to Z. All shares in the company are sold and new directors are appointed . The cash in the bank account of company Z is withdrawn totally by the directors as a dividend or as an intercompany transaction but, most often, by way of a loan. The money is eventually paid to the original shareholders and the promoter as payment for the shares of the company, usually via a financier. At best the company books would show a bad debt to the financier. In most cases, the books are destroyed by being burned or sent to the bottom of the harbour. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be seen from this example that the original shareholders either must have known or had some inkling of a shonky deal or, at best, a wilful scheme to evade tax illegally. There is no doubt about that. That is the case to which the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) eloquently referred today . I commend her and the Government on the statement that she made today insofar as it goes. We were very pleased with what she said with one reservation which I will come to in a moment. This is in the spirit of what Senator Peter Rae just said. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this spirit that we certainly and vigorously support the matter of urgency moved by the Australian Labor Party. We will vote for it. I hope the House does come to a vote on the matter. In other words, we assume that the Labor Party, having used the word 'evaded' in the first line of its motion, means that there was a wilful and conscious intent on the part of the vendor shareholders to evade illegally their proper tax liability. I assume that is the position. I listened carefully to the Minister and I did not hear that component put into the set of circumstances which she described. That is not a criticism at this stage because I can understand the difficulty of the draftsmen and Cabinet in coming to draw up this kind of legislation. It must be one of the most difficult propositions faced by Cabinet in years. It must be extremely difficult to draw up the sort of legislation which will be fair and cover all points. However, the so-called retrospective legislation currently being drafted by the Government must be done with extreme caution so that it does not punish innocent people who sell shares in companies for quite respectable, reputable and genuine reasons, and people who have absolutely no intention of defrauding the Commonwealth or evading their proper tax liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the oversimplified example which I gave yesterday where a man and his wife own a company which has a successful year. Let us say that it makes a profit of $100,000 and has a tax liability at the end of that year of $46,000. So its equity is $54,000. Someone comes along and says: 'I will give you $60,000 or $70,000 for it'. I can understand circumstances where a man and his wife, not versed in income tax law or whatever, could say: 'This man is not exactly Father Christmas but this seems to be a genuine and a generous offer. We are both in our late 50s and we are thinking of retiring. We have a pretty prosperous business'. Why should they not sell that company to this promoter-Mr C, or whoever it is-at a reasonable profit? That could well have happened in 1972, 10 years ago. Those two people would now be in their middle to late 60s, retired and in some humble little cottage at Gosford or whatever. I wonder about the equity of those people. I would assume that there would be some people who would suddenly get hit with a bill of $46,000. That is why I hope the Government has, in preparing this legislation, given thought to the conscious and wilful intent on the part of vendor shareholders. It seemed to me, on listening to the Minister this morning, that the Government is going to open up a whole embracing section which will mean that any vendor shareholder who sold shares without any thought to the payment of tax is going to be caught in the end and that the onus of proving that he or she is innocent will rest entirely on them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Peter Rae for reading that into my speech. I do not think I am doing the Minister an injustice by saying that she did not say that this morning. That is not necessarily a criticism of the Minister. But I am grateful to Senator Peter Rae for his interjection. We support the Australian Labor Party's urgency motion, for reasons eloquently described by Claude Forell in yesterday's Melbourne Age. Our support is based on the contention that bottom -of-the-harbour schemes are and were unlawful at the time when they were committed. People may have been lulled into feelings of security by lack of prosecution but this does not mean that they were or are innocent and that the tax evaded by them should not be recovered. I quote Mr Forell, who is a journalist for whom I have an unbounded admiration. In talking about these schemes, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They involved the deliberate evasion of company tax through the contrivance of artificial schemes peddled by promoters who took a commission and used criminals to dispose of the asset-stripped companies. </PARA>
<PARA> As Mr Costigan . . . pointed out, the schemes flourished not because they were legal at the time but because existing laws were not enforced, owing to neglect and incompetence by officials of the Crown Solicitor's Office and a lack of persistence by the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA>He came to the nub of the problem here, I think, rather nicely when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Whether the perpetrators of the 'bottom of the harbour' tax evasion schemes can still be prosecuted under the Crimes Act or common law on charges of conspiracy with intent to defraud the Commonwealth remains to be tested. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not, however, what the argument about retrospectivity is about. Such action under long established laws would be belated, not retrospective, prosecution of criminal offences. A criminal wrong does not become a right because of tardy law enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA>In that article Forell, of course, is not necessarily arguing for the creation of new offences. </PARA>
<PARA> In Chapter 10 of volume 2 of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, Mr Costigan said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . It is . . . apparent the law enforcement agencies have not identified in any meaningful way the nature and extent of organised crime operating here. They have not taken any steps to suppress it. Indeed, in some of the agencies there is ignorance as to its existence. </PARA>
<PARA>He does not blame the people now working in these agencies. He continues that they:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . have shown an . . . earnest desire to enforce the laws . . . and a willingness to apply themselves far beyond the strict terms of their employment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But he does detail the reasons why they have been unsuccessful, and they are matters of political will and of management. They are: Firstly, because of inadequate numbers of personnel and appropriate skills and capacity, secondly, inadequate equipment, reflecting nineteenth century attitudes and, thirdly, a lack of power to seize records, including bank accounts and tax records. These are reasons for a thorough overhaul of law enforcement agencies and also for the establishment of a permanent crimes commission with an attached prosecutors office to undertake prosecutions where these cannot properly by done by existing agencies. I advocate that without suggesting for one moment that the Government can use the establishment of a crimes commission to curtail or truncate Mr Costigan's inquiries. Mr Costigan has shown the way. We should not ignore his wisdom. It is clear that the tentacles of these operations have reached well into our political structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by making an appeal to the Government-I believe the Labor Party will agree with what I am about to say-that, if anyone requires further examples for the urgent need for public funding of political parties, surely these revelations and, as I understand, these revelations that are about to take place with particular reference to members and supporters of both the National Country Party and the Liberal Party, we need no other evidence to support it than what has come to light. </PARA>
<PARA> We have recently read of a fund raiser of the Liberal Party, a former chairman of the Sydney Stock Exchange, raising, in five weeks, something like $2m in Sydney to wipe off a Liberal party debt. I do not know where that money came from. No member of parliament knows. But somebody knows where it came from. I am not prepared to believe that none of it came from people who might have been involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. If someone heavily involved in a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme did make a substantial contribution-$500,000 or whatever-I need only to state the kind of pressure that individual can exert on senior members of the Liberal and National Country Parties when they are framing this legislation. I believe that, if any example were required for the urgent need of public funding of political parties to get these creatures out of the way and to clean up this political system, this is it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating this urgency motion which has been raised by the Australian Labor Party. Senator Chipp has said that he looks forward to the vote. I believe that every honourable senator in this chamber from all parties will unequivocally support this urgency motion because the terms of it are such that I believe that every true Australian should support it . I ask honourable senators to look at the wording very carefully. It begins with:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recovery of tax evaded-</PARA>
<PARA>I know we often think that we are talking of semantics when we talk about the terms 'evasion' and 'avoidance', but there is no doubt about it in this case. The emphasis is on the word 'evasion'. It concerns the understatement of income, the overstatement of expenses and all these sorts of things, including artificial schemes, contrivances, et cetera. Everything that is envisaged in both the original and amended section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act are conjured up in this term. There is no doubt that the full force of the law has to be brought to bear upon those people who sold company shares at prices which made no allowance for the companies' contingent liability. That effectively isolates certain types of transactions. I think this is important.</PARA>
<PARA> The motion ends with the words:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . and the need for the Senate to unequivocally support this action. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, every true Australian must support this sort of motion. But why is the motion necessary? The Government has already indicated what it is going to do. It is true that we have not seen the actual wording of the legislation. I think that is a little unfortunate. Perhaps the Opposition parties believe that they have something to gain by pushing us forward because, after all, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) made it very clear on Budget night what he intended to do. Of course it is difficult to speak as to the exact application of the proposed legislation because we have not seen it. But we are told that the emphasis will be on fraud-where fraud is involved, there is no difficulty. Having established fraud, we are really seeking to collect the tax which resulted from that particular fraud. In other words, I believe we are seeking to introduce certain types of machinery provisions, not the taxing provisions. The fraud exists and the money is to be collected. We intend to introduce the appropriate machinery- type provisions to enable funds derived in a fraudulent manner to be recovered. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been so much hysteria in relation to this whole question of tax avoidance involving companies that a lot of very innocent people cannot sleep at night. In fact, people who have generally sold shares on the stock exchange are now wondering whether they will be liable for the payment of tax. Aged women who sold shares listed on the stock exchange, perhaps for the purpose of buying a carpet for their home, are now wondering whether this sort of transaction will be taxed. Of course it will not be taxed. But this is the sort of hysteria that has been generated as a result of a lot of ill-informed and mischievous reporting in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We then come to the question of shares in proprietary companies, particularly exempt proprietary companies. We have the situation of people who sold shares to other people ringing up the company secretary and saying: 'Is this the subject of a bottom-of-the-harbour-type scheme?' Of course such a transaction is not. Then we have the other situation which has occurred with a fair degree of frequency in my own State of Tasmania when mainland companies have bought out a number of existing operations. They have not bought the company as a whole; they have bought the assets and plant, they have taken over the debtors and creditors , and the tax liability has been set aside and met. The result is that after some time we are left with a shell of a company with no more than unappropriated profits represented by certain cash. Most of these companies have sat there for a year or two and the tax liability on the current year's profits has been met and paid and then along comes a promoter who offers a price and those shares are sold. It may be that further down the line there is some sort of distribution, but at that point there cannot be any liability so far as tax is concerned. In fact, such a practice is not covered by the motion before us. As I understand it , the Government's projected legislation is not intended to cover such a practice. In fact, I think we should note that the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union- the Costigan report-clearly distinguishes the two cases. I refer to paragraph 3. 119 on page 89 of the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The statistics provided to me by the Taxation Office concern two types of application of schemes described in this report. The first concerns companies which have accumulated profits, but on which they have paid company tax. The purpose of the application of the scheme is to avoid the payment of tax on the distribution of those profits to the shareholders. It was this type of operation that the decision in Slutzkin concerned. It is not the type of case with which I am concerned in this Report. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not the type of case that is covered by the urgency motion we are debating today. The report at paragraph 3.120 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The second type of case is of a very different order. In these instances the company has accumulated profits during the year upon which company tax is payable (and upon which, on distribution, further tax may be payable by the beneficiaries of the distribution). Some promoters describe this as a 'current year profits' case; the Taxation Office describes it as a ''pre-tax profit strip ''. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the cases that are covered by the Government's intended legislation. They are the cases that are covered by this urgency motion. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> In these cases the object is to avoid the payment of the company tax properly levied upon the company by leaving only the shell of the company with no assets to pay the tax. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to look at the statistics and this is the reason why the Government is taking action. In 1973, 27 companies engaged in this activity. In 1980 the number was 1,412. It grieves me greatly when I hear members of the Opposition say that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) stands accused, that he watched over tax evasion schemes. This sort of language implies connivance or an indifference. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a list of the measures that have been undertaken by the Treasurer from 1 July 1977 to the current date to prove to those people who read what has been said in this debate that measures have been taken and to put an end to this falsehood that the Treasurer has merely stood by and watched. </PARA>

Any rebate scheme entered into after 9 February 1982 will attract additional tax on the same basis as do schemes covered by Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> 11 May 1982-statement aimed at making it clear beyond all doubt that trust stripping schemes can no longer have their intended effect of enabling participants to avoid payment of income tax. If found to be necessary, existing legislation aimed at striking down trust stripping schemes will be strengthened and will include provisions for additional tax at least as great as that which applies to schemes covered by Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> 24 June 1982-announcement that measures will be introduced to deny equity participants in certain kinds of leveraged leasing and similar arrangements all the deductions attributable to the ownership of the plant. The Government will continue to review the operation of leveraged arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> 25 July 1982-announcement that special legislation will be introduced to recover from vendor shareholders the company tax that was evaded in 'bottom-of- the-harbour' strips of untaxed company profits, carried out before the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act 1980 made such conduct a specific criminal offence. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is wrong to say that the Treasurer has purported to be tough; he has been tough. Tough measures have been taken, particularly measures such as the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act under which promoters of a scheme can be sentenced to five years' goal or fined $50,000. If anything is lacking in the discussion today it is the failure to attack the promoters of these sorts of schemes. It is true that the schemes will be attacked under the Crimes (Taxation Offences Act) 1980. But I believe that we should be a lot harder on these promoters when we are framing proposed legislation because they are the people who sought to make ordinary pay-as-you-earn taxpayers pay more than they would otherwise have to pay. It is our Government's resolve to make sure that there is equity, vertical and horizontal, so far as taxation law is concerned. However, we have to be careful in respect of a number of innocent types of situations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we review a number of files which deal with the above matters we find that at the point of sale there is usually provision for the payment of 46c in the dollar on the current year's profits. What about a situation in which the tax on these profits has been deducted by the purchaser and has been clearly identified as such in the sale documents? In some cases the primary tax payable may be provided for and deducted and in some cases it may be actually set aside and paid into a special bank account by the purchaser at the point of purchase. The vendor shareholders have acted honourably and done the right thing. They put the money into a special bank account and there was no intention to defraud. How are we going to deal with situations in which the vendor actually takes the money? Are we going to come back and attack the vendor shareholders for the tax that they set aside, put into a special bank account and handed over to the purchaser of the company because the tax liability from the Taxation Office has not yet been determined and therefore was the responsibility of the new owners? I believe that in framing the legislation we will have to be very careful that we attack only those vendors involved in fraud. In the case I have mentioned, the vendors did the right thing. They calculated the tax, they set money aside, they put it in a special bank account and it was also deducted from the purchase price. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is unfortunate that we have not had enough discussion about how we will go about dealing with this whole scheme. There has been a lot of innuendo and hysteria. Many loose words have been spoken. But what we must emphasise is that where there is fraud involved in the transactions-there was always fraud- there are offences against both the companies legislation and the crimes legislation. As Senator Rae said, there are offences against revised section 260 . All these things do not create a retrospective offence. We are not seeking to make illegal something which was legal at the time of execution. We are simply seeking to recoup the proceeds of the fraud. The emphasis is on the fraud from those who benefited from that fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> What we also have to do is to attack more savagely the promoters. Senator Rae made a very good point about attacking those involved in tax avoidance schemes by cancelling their registration on the Tax Agents Registration Board. I believe we may even have to go further because one of the problems that the Treasurer faced was section 16 of the secrecy provisions. Maybe we will have to open up and widen certain of the secrecy provisions to assist the Treasurer to follow through these tax avoidance schemes. I believe that a lot of the criminals involved in this have tried to confuse and muddy the waters. That is unfortunate . What we have to try to do, and what I hope I have done, is clarify the position so that innocent people are not indicted along with those who are criminally involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate referred the question of tenure for academics to the Standing Committee on Education and the Arts almost 12 months ago. We have comprehensively investigated this matter, having received 150 submissions from all parts of Australia and held public hearings involving more than 70 witnesses . These included, of course, people from individual universities and colleges of advanced education, the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee, the Australian Conference of Principals of Colleges of Advanced Education, the Tertiary Education Commission, staff associations and many individual Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> General observation of the higher education sectors shows that since the mid- 1970s tertiary institutions have experienced little growth. With student participation rates levelling off and only small real growth in financial resources, there has been a dramatic collapse in the numbers of new academic appointment opportunities. Whilst in the period of expansion staff turnover for new appointments had been 10 per cent and more and whilst a normal turnover would be 5 per cent, we have found that in recent years the actual opportunities for new appointments have fallen to 1 per cent in both universities and colleges . This has very serious consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, so few new academic appointments are available that career prospects for younger academics are quite uncertain and initial entry is not at all promising. The low rate of academic staff turnover is analysed carefully in chapter 3 of the report. This analysis clearly indicates the threatening prospect of academic stagnation within some institutions. Because of the degree of autonomy of tertiary institutions and their diversity in nature and operation , and because the problems they are facing are complex and apparently entrenched , the solution of these problems has tended to be relegated to an administrative and political no-man's land. This report has taken on the task of identifying and clarifying these problems, as well as suggesting changes designed to stimulate progress in Australia's universities and colleges of advanced education. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggested changes to the tenure system in no way deny the advantages of tenure, which the Committee sees as substantial. Tenure provides the security of employment and remuneration which allows the freedom of inquiry essential to academic work in our democracy. However, the tenure system impacts significantly on the academic staff structures of institutions and the present system has limited and inhibited institutional flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's inquiry revealed that the legal position of tenure is uncertain and there is great diversity among institutions in appointment and dismissal procedures. The evidence showed that tenure relies more on convention than on contractual right. The Committee has identified the specific need for more unified and coherent conditions of service for tenured academic staff. The general thrust of the Committee's report and recommendations, therefore, is not to dismantle the tenure concept but to modify and improve its operation for present day circumstances. I believe that the Committee has responsibly tempered the utilitarian call by many for the abolition of tenure in order to gain an increase in staffing and financial flexibility, by recommending a more responsive and accountable tenure system. The report seeks to strengthen the advantages of tenure while at the same time ensuring that there are in operation effective program procedures which overcome the tenure system's principal problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I now highlight some of the specific recommendations in the report. The selection and appointment of an academic to a post which holds the expectation of tenure requires the most careful appointment procedures. The earlier prevalent practice of appointment being undertaken alone by 'god-professors' is a thing of the past. International advertisement for most tenurial posts, combined with the selection processes of broadly-based selection committees, ensures a thorough and sound assessment before appointments are made. The Committee commends these current practices and has further recommended the wider international advertising of academic vacancies, particularly in the colleges of advanced education. Currently, before tenure is confirmed an academic must successfully undertake a probationary period of service. At present, this period of probation varies greatly between institutions. For the reasons outlined in chapter 4 of the report, the Committee has recommended that the period of probation for the first appointment to a lectureship should be a minimum of three years and preferably five years. </PARA>
<PARA> A central issue in this inquiry was the need for institutions to achieve a greater degree of financial and staffing flexibility. Currently, the proportion of tenured staff in these institutions is tending to increase-for many beyond 90 per cent-and is hampering flexibility. It causes rigidity and frustrates new teaching and research initiatives, and it can lock up resources from constructive change and deny new and invigorating appointments. To overcome this problem without threatening the sound concept and operation of the tenure system , the Committee has recommended that the proportion of academics at the level of lecturer and above who are tenured should not in any circumstances exceed 90 per cent of the total full time equivalent number of lecturers and above in universities, and Lecturer Level II and above in colleges. </PARA>
<PARA> Tenure should not be, or be seen to be, a protection against incompetence or inefficiency. Tenure should be conditional upon an academic satisfactorily performing the duties and responsibilities expected by that academic's university or college. To give effect to this concept, the Committee has recommended, subject to certain necessary safeguards, that academics should individually participate in annual consultations and periodic reviews of their work. Where it is found that performance is inadequate, provision should be made for the termination of the academic's appointment. The Committee also believes that other provisions for the termination of an academic's employment should include serious misconduct, serious incapacity to perform academic duties by reason of physical or mental illness and financial exigency. Universities and colleges should therefore examine their statutory powers so that where necessary they can be amended or for the most part just put into practice to ensure that institutions have sufficient power to terminate appointments on these grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the terms of appointment of tutors. Under present financial and staff constraints, the career prospects and employment opportunities for tutors are contracting more than for other academic staff. The Committee is in no doubt as to the importance of tutors and the tutorial system in higher education institutions. Nevertheless the Committee agrees with the arguments of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission that tutorial staff are separate and distinct from career academic staff whether lecturers, senior lecturers, readers or professors. There should be no expectation that tutors are apprentice lecturers or that they should by right expect to progress from tutorship to lectureship. The Committee believes that tutor positions are, with some exceptions, short term appointments which give graduates the opportunity to assist in undergraduate teaching while acquiring a post-graduate qualification. Thus the Committee believes that tenure should not be extended to tutors. The Committee has concluded that only a specified minority of senior tutors should retain tenure and then only where sound advantages are defined. However the Committee was disturbed to uncover a degree of exploitation of tutors by tenured members of faculties, departments and, to some extent, institutions. The Committee views this with concern and has made a number of recommendations designed to lessen tutors' sense of insecurity and protect them from this exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the Senate's attention to the Committee's recommendation relating to superannuation. The Committee has recommended that every encouragement should be given to the establishment of a comprehensive, portable superannuation scheme for academics in higher education. This would not only ease the present financial burden on institutions but also encourage movement and interchange of academics between institutions. Such a proposal would help rejuvenate both institution and academic alike and would be a welcome innovation in the higher education sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to conclude my remarks by reference to the academic staff distributions and age profiles described in chapter 3 of the report. Corrective measures still need to be taken to overcome the distortion in the academic age profile brought about by the years of rapid expansion of tertiary education being followed by cessation of growth. This distortion will increasingly become an indigestible problem for higher education institutions and, without corrective action, will reappear, on the reverse cycle, in a more intense fashion by the turn of the century. Unless managers of tertiary institutions, professional tertiary education bodies and individual academics recognise the consequences of this distortion, the existence of the institutions and the concept of tenure of employment may well be challenged. A healthy college and university system is a prerequisite for the existence and operation of the tenure concept. Institutions in these systems must solve their problems now, otherwise tenure may become, for that reason alone, seriously undermined. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's 39 recommendations seek to provide a realistic and comprehensive set of reforms which together should achieve sound and accountable arrangements for tenure and achieve an essential margin of flexibility for higher education institutions. The Committee urges the implementation of these recommendations in the careful manner set out in the report and so looks toward the enhanced well-being of teaching, research and scholarship in the universities and colleges of Australia. This is a unanimous report and, we believe, a sound report. The members of the Committee join me in thanking our staff, whose professional work in assisting this inquiry lived up to the highest standards of the Senate. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might suit the convenience of the Senate if I make the two statements one after the other and, if senators wish to make comments, it may be appropriate to deal with them together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I present for the information of honourable senators the report of the Commonwealth Schools Commission containing its funding recommendations for the calendar year 1983. This report is in response to the Government's policy and financial guidelines on assistance for schools in the States and the Northern Territory. Honourable senators will recall that in the guidelines which I presented in the Senate on 17 August, the Government provided over $1,240m for all schools in 1983, a real increase of 3.9 per cent over the 1982 level. This allocation represents a continuation and an extension of the Commonwealth's commitment to all schools, whether government or non-government. Included in the guidelines allocation for 1983 are: A real increase in general recurrent grants for government schools to help overcome the financial difficulties facing government school systems, as reported by the Commission, additional general recurrent grants for Group 3 non-government schools, those with the lowest recurrent resources, to discharge the Government's commitment to raise these grants to 40 per cent of average government schools standard costs, maintenance of the base capital programs for both government and non-government schools, and additional grants for severely handicapped children and newly arrived migrant and refugee students. The Government also agreed to extend access to special education programs to children of below school age. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission reports that there has been some public comment, both critical and supportive, on its overall funding recommendations and the Government's guidelines decisions. Much of the criticism has overlooked the relative roles and responsibilities of Commonwealth and State governments in the funding of government and non-government schools and that the Commonwealth is committed to ensuring high standards of operation in both sectors. In particular, mention is rarely made of the fact that, in real terms, more has been allocated for the total recurrent support of government schools by my Government last year, this year and next year than in the last year-1976-funded by the Labor Government, notwithstanding the decline in enrolments and the continued growth in State expenditure on government schools in that period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's support of non-government schools is a separate issue based on equity. The Commission has reported that the great majority of non-government schools have recurrent resource levels some 30 per cent below those of government schools; almost 95 per cent of the increase in Commonwealth general recurrent grants in 1983 will be directed to those schools assessed as being in the greatest need. The Commission rightly notes that informed public discussion of these matters is needed. I support the Commission's intention to foster public debate about the most appropriate ways of meeting the priority needs of all Australian school children. I interpolate that I know that one of my colleagues in the chamber was calling for a rational debate only a few months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's report is essentially concerned with the distribution of approved funds between States and sectors. The recommended allocations largely reflect demographic movements and various adjustments to funding formulae. All of the Commission's financial recommendations, which are summarised in an attached table, have been accepted by the Government. The Government has also accepted the Commission's recommendation that 10 per cent of the capital grants program for government schools be distributed on the basis of various indicators of trends in new pupil places. As well, in accordance with the guidelines, the Commission has initiated discussions in relation to other aspects of this program, including the adoption of measures to obtain greater identification of the use of Commonwealth capital funds; a general clause will be included in the States Grants (Schools Assistance) legislation indicating that, prior to the granting of funds to a State, the Commonwealth Minister must be satisfied with arrangements to identify projects to which Commonwealth funds are to be applied. The per capita general recurrent grants for non-government schools approved for 1983 are as set out in an attached table. I seek leave, Madam Acting Deputy President, to have the contents of the tables-there are two-incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I endorse the Commission's intention to implement fully the Government's previous decision to give consideration to income as well as expenditure in the assessment of non-government schools' subsidy categories. I would therefore expect that the income checking procedure introduced on a limited basis in 1982 will be applied to all non-government schools which are eligible for Group 2 or Group 3 grants in 1983. I add that they are not needed for Group 1 non-government schools. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that eligibility for grants under the Short-Term Emergency Assistance Program be extended to include any non- government school suffering a financial crisis caused by a sudden disaster. An important initiative is that funding for intensive programs of English language instruction for newly-arrived students in 1983 will be allocated on a per capita basis of $880.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Commission has made recommendations on the funding of six CAEs which have yet to be consolidated in accordance with the Government's decision in the 1981 Review of Commonwealth Functions. An acceptable proposal has been made with regard to the amalgamation of the Institute of Early Childhood Development and Melbourne State College. Funding has been approved for this amalgamated institution for 1983 and 1984. Acceptable proposals have yet to be made in respect of Armidale CAE, Newcastle CAE, Milperra CAE and Hawthorn Institute of Education. The Commission has indicated that considerable progress has been made in negotiations towards amalgamation at Newcastle. At Armidale, however, the University has maintained its opposition to amalgamation and has declined to enter into negotiations to this end with the CAE even though that College is prepared to enter into such negotiations. The Government stongly supports the view of the Commission that higher education in Armidale and the surrounding region would benefit from an amalgamation of the University and the College. The Government urges the University to reconsider its position on this matter so that the amalgamation can proceed quickly and effectively. It is a matter of concern that the attitude of the University is threatening the continued funding of advanced education at Armidale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has decided that funds be put aside for allocation by me, on the advice of the Commission, if acceptable proposals are recommended in respect of the institutions which have not yet met the Commonwealth's requirements on consolidation. The Government's requirement for consolidation as a precondition for 1983 and 1984 funding has not altered and it is now urgent for decisions to be taken. Furthermore the Government remains convinced that these mergers will mean that students can be offered a wider range of educational courses. Large institutions would also have greater flexibility to redistribute workloads or to redeploy staff within institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has also considered the future of the engineering school at Bendigo CAE and the Orange Agricultural College. It has indicated that it is not prepared to support proposals which involve the retention of engineering at Bendigo CAE. The Government supports the Commission's recommendation that funds be provided to enable Bendigo CAE to enter into an arrangement with Ballarat CAE under which students undertake the first year of the applied science course at Bendigo CAE and then proceed to the second year of the engineering course at Ballarat. The Government also supports the Commission's recommendation for the continuation of separate funding for Orange Agricultural College in 1983 on the understanding that consolidation arrangements will be implemented by January 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the total grant for TAFE capital programs, the Commission has made recommendations for the construction of seven major building projects and the design of a further two building projects in 1983 under the new three-year $60m national priority projects program. This new program will provide facilities to meet needs emerging as a result of economic and technological change. The seven projects are at Lithgow Technical College, Broadmeadows College of TAFE, Grovely College of TAFE, South East Community College at Mount Gambier, Bunbury Technical College, Fremantle Technical College and Katherine Rural Education Centre. The two projects at the design stage are Knox College of TAFE and Central Highlands College of TAFE. The project at Mount Gambier is the first example of a project intended to serve more than one State. This facility will provide specialist training for students in the timber industry from Victoria and Tasmania, as well as South Australia. The first instalment of this new three -year program in 1983 will be $12.2m. This level of activity recognises that expenditure on new projects is inevitably less in the first year than occurs in later years. However, the Commission's recommendations provide for the full expenditure of the $60m allocated over the period 1983-85. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983, 15 per cent of particular purpose TAFE recurrent funds will be allocated to advanced English language instruction for migrants. This provision follows the Government's consideration of the evaluation of post-arrival programs and services for migrants by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. The Government has transferred an additional $1.1m to the particular purpose program of the Commission to assist in meeting the cost of this commitment. The Commission will consult the States on the implementation of this program and will report in October on the most appropriate method of giving full effect to the decision within 12 months. I expect that the report from the CTEC due in October will contain recommendations for positive action to promote wider access to TAFE for migrants. The Government believes that the TAFE sector has one of the best networks to get migrant language courses out to those in most need. The provision of the advanced English language instruction for migrants through TAFE colleges in the way sought by the Institute is an essential element in ensuring that migrant needs are met. Legislation will be introduced into the Parliament without delay to give effect to these decisions. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make some comments on behalf of the Opposition on the reports that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) has just presented to the Senate. Firstly, with regard to the Schools Commission report it is very clear that what has happened over a number of years now of Fraser Government administration of the Schools Commission is that the independence of the Schools Commission, its original raison d'etre, has been eroded very seriously. The Schools Commission has now become so locked into the processes imposed on it by government that it is no longer able to distinguish between which of its recommendations are independent advice to the Government and which are the results of government directive. The current report appears to be devoted almost entirely to dividing up the funds in the way which the Government has decided in its guidelines and is virtually devoid of advice as to the appropriateness of those allocations or how they relate to the real needs of children in Australian schools. This incestuous relationship between the Schools Commission and the Government destroys the independence of the Schools Commission and deprives those interested in Australian schools of information and analysis to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> The nearest the Schools Commission comes to disagreeing with Government policies occurs when it expresses its regret at the discriminatory treatment meted out to government schools in the matter of cost supplementation. The outrageous decision of the Government to supplement fully its grants to non- government schools but to supplement only to the extent of two-thirds its grants to government schools was condemned by the Australian Labor Party when it was announced in June. We would have expected the Schools Commission to express a view forcefully and to explain the financial consequences of this unjustifiable decision. </PARA>
<PARA> A further example of the timidity of the Schools Commission occurs over its reference to what it calls the apparent re-emergence of the State aid debate. That the State aid debate is re-emerging strongly in the community is hardly news to the Government or, for that matter, to the public. Obliquely, the Schools Commission appears to be saying that in previous reports it put recommendations directed at achieving a proper balance in Commonwealth funding. The failure of the Government to act on its recommendations is the basis of the growing conflict over the Commonwealth's role in school funding. This is absolutely correct, of course. The Government has no policy in relation to funding the needs of government schools. The Schools Commission report shows that the share of Commonwealth funds going to government schools has declined from 61.9 per cent in 1976 to 47.2 per cent in 1982. This is a disastrous trend and it should be no surprise to the Government that those who choose government schools are deeply resentful of the policies long followed by the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Nowhere in any Government statement does one find any acknowledgement of the needs of government schools for additional support. Instead, the Minister is intending to rest on the far from impressive statistic that he has at least restored funding to government schools to its 1976 level. That, of course, ignores the fact that the 1976 level of funding was only part way through a program of resources of improvement set in train by the Labor Government in 1974 and 1975 and not carried through by the Fraser Government. It also ignores the multiplication of problems and challenges which schools have had to face since 1976 resulting from increasing poverty, changing family structures, youth unemployment and so on, all mainly the result of the Fraser Government's economic strategies. While the Government refuses to adopt any targets for resource improvements in government schools it is axiomatic that its funding formula will continue to operate so as to disadvantage government schools and the state aid debate will grow in deafening intensity. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make it quite clear that the Labor Party does not wish to see a divisive state aid debate growing and becoming more intense. But we predict that this will be an inevitable result of the discriminatory attitude of the Government to government schools and of the Government's refusal to acknowledge the needs of government schools. In my electorate the state aid debate has been provoked by the decision of the Government to fund a number of new independent schools and, in particular, a third grammar school in the Belconnen area. It will be the third grammar school for the entire Australian Capital Territory. It is understandable that this decision has provoked a great deal of resentment amongst the parents of those children who are attending government schools in need or non-government schools in need. At a time of shrinking resources and, indeed, declining enrolments in a number of areas of Canberra the decision to fund a new school which seems to offer nothing particular in the way of curriculum that could not be offered in any of the existing schools and which is not being established to meet any additional need is a provocative decision indeed. I am sure that this is an example that could be repeated many times throughout Australia. In concluding my remarks on that report, I would like to repeat the regret of the Opposition that the independence of the Schools Commission and its ability to give objective advice on the needs in education have been so seriously eroded. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Tertiary Education Commission report. I point out that the major defects in this report concern the failure of the Government to compensate institutions for salary and wage increases. The Government did attempt to predict these increases and to include sufficient funds to cover the estimated cost of the increases but the estimates were faulty. Most universities and colleges of advanced education have indicated that they lack the ability to meet the recent increases awarded by the Academic Salaries Tribunal. However, the increases must be paid. There are two consequences of that. The first is that the quality of teaching and research in the universities and CAEs will decline and jobs will be lost. Of course, both of those things will lead to a third consequence, which is that students will have available to them fewer and poorer courses. </PARA>

The obvious next step is to provide extra funds. I hope that the Minister will be able to do that shortly. Of course, similar action will be required for the other sections of the tertiary education sector which similarly have been left without adequate funds to meet wage increases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to make a couple of comments on the question of amalgamation of colleges. It was the Government's intention, prior to and certainly after the razor gang's report, that 30 colleges of advanced education were to be amalgamated with other colleges and universities. That target has been met, although four have not yet been able to make satisfactory arrangements. In the case of these four, which are Armidale, Newcastle, Milperra and Hawthorn, it is our view that the Government should reprieve these colleges from the amalgamation program. We believe that satisfactory arrangements have not been able to be made in those cases because the amalgamation proposals are inappropriate. We believe that a great deal of damage will be done to these institutions if the Government insists on amalgamation and, of course, the students will again suffer. As the Government has managed to score 26 out of 30 amalgamations, we believe that it is time for a review relating to the final four. In particular with regard to the Bendigo CAE, it is distressing to see that the Government is maintaining a stubborn attitude towards the amalgamation of this college. The proposal for two years of the Ballarat course to be taken at Bendigo was a reasonable proposal and should have been supported by the Government. The Labor Party regrets that the Government has not been able to see that point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of great concern to us to see the funding situation of both the Schools Commission in respect of government schools and the Tertiary Education Commission so inadequate to meet real educational needs. It is of great concern to us that at a time of massive unemployment, at a time of massive structural unemployment, at a time when the economy needs all the skills and expertise that can be mustered throughout our community, the Government seems to be intent on preventing people from gaining appropriate skills in CAEs and universities. We hope that the Government will review its decision with regard to the wage and salary supplementation costs of the tertiary sector. Otherwise the loss in jobs and the loss in quality of education will be very serious indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The statement that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) has put down on the report of the Schools Commission for 1983 unfortunately, I think, as Senator Ryan has already pointed out, is illustrative of recent reports. These reports used to be looked forward to as a major input into the educational debate regarding schools in this country. I think the major problem with this particular report is that the Commission spends an enormous amount of time on the distribution of funds and very little time on the reasons behind its decisions and projections forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On page 3 of the Minister's statement the point is made that there is an endorsement of the Commission's intention to implement fully the Government's previous decision to give consideration to income as well as expenditure in the assessment of non-government schools subsidy categories. Certainly the Australian Democrats welcome that extension. We believe it is a matter of concern that such an off-hand, as it were, comment has been made about something which is causing the community an enormous amount of concern, that is, growing division and acrimony because of the debate about the funding of government and non-government schools and the distribution of funds between those schools. I would hope, in line with the comments that I have made for some considerable time now, that the Commonwealth Government would give a lead in this area and would raise for national debate what it sees as being a way out of a continuing and destructive debate in the community. Whereas up to five, even three years ago, there was some considerable agreement on the part of both government and non-government schools as to where they might be going and the juxtaposition between the required funds for each group, we now have total disagreement, to the point where we have the major teachers union having as its policy, announced earlier this year, no funds for government schools. That is obviously a position which is totally unacceptable to all political parties in Australia but one which is, I think, understandable in light of that union's endeavour to have a reasonable debate about what might be the best way of accommodating two major schooling institutions within this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Minister ought, in this statement, to have alluded to those parts of the Commission's report, brief though they were, in which this item was raised and given some lead as to the Government's thinking or where this thinking may have been derailed. I am sure that the Minister himself, in the time that he has been in this portfolio, has already run up against this problem time and time again, if not every day. We need some imaginative responses from this Government. I have called repeatedly for a peak conference of the various groups concerned to see whether at round table discussion those various groups could come to some modus vivendi. They certainly would not come to an agreement on all matters, and that is not to be thought likely. The contenders for both the government and non-government schools systems would be putting, at their very basis, diametrically opposed propositions. But I do believe that there are some areas in which agreement could be reached. </PARA>
<PARA> May I raise one area that concerns me, that is, the notion of entrances and exits from non-government schools. I do not believe that non-government schools are implacably opposed to controls over that area similar to those that operate in government schools. It is just not a matter of justice that one school system , the government school system, should have imposed on it an obligation to accept every child within the community who presents himself to that school, and another schooling system, almost equally funded now, certainly in the recurrent area by taxpayers' money, should be without that particular obligation. I believe that the entrances to schools ought to be on a par. I have expressed this view at meetings with representatives of non-government schools. While they said that they would not agree to it straight off, in continuing discussions they did not express any opposition in principle to that proposal. I believe that may be one step towards alleviating some of the tensions that exist so that government schools do not have to carry, as many of them do, rejects from the non-government school system. These are students whom the non-government school system found too hard or too difficult to teach or who had some disadvantage, social or otherwise, so that they were jettisoned out of that school system. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am saying they are jettisoned out of the private school system and they present themselves to the government school system and the government schools have to take them in under their legal obligation. The point I am making is that it may be one step forward if we look at a similar regulation governing the entrance to non-government and government schools. I do not think it would be beyond the capacity of the Federal Government, which has the responsibility for the majority of funding to non-government schools, to discuss that with the non-government schools and to come to some arrangement in relation to it. If we had these types of arrangements in regard to entrances to various schools then similar controls would have to be exercised also on exits from non-government and government schools alike. I believe that some movement in that area or other areas, for example, a delineation of the responsibilities of the various systems in training teachers, would be an advantage. The government schools system currently picks up vastly in excess of its proportion or its equitable number, as it were, of inexperienced teachers. The first, second and third years in the teaching life of any teacher are concerned very much with learning on the job. The teachers are operating below par. That is not in any way an indictment on them; it is a fact that anybody going into a profession is not able to operate at the peak of that profession when entering it. The teachers are learning. Therefore, the schooling system-there may be an arithmetic judgment in relation to the student-teacher ratio-is not getting the same value out of its teachers as many of the private schools which pick up the cream of our teachers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many other aspects to this matter. I refer to the fact that by and large government schools look after the isolated children in this country. The costs of isolated or remote education are extraordinarily high when compared with urban education. Yet we have a straight arithmetical operation that does a disservice to the complexity of the education system. There are those and many more aspects which I hope the Government will look at. I hope that the Government will give some lead to derail what is becoming an increasingly deleterious debate on the distribution of funds between these two schooling systems. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the statement made by the Minister on the Tertiary Education Commission report. I wish to refer to a couple of matters only. I believe the report is very disingenuous in some ways in its wording. The Government strongly supports the view of the Commission about Armidale. The Minister's statement agrees with the Commission in relation to the Bendigo College of Advanced Education and the Orange Agricultural College. The statement spends a great deal of time agreeing with the Commission. Quite frankly, in the real world of educational policy decision-making the original impetus for all of this came from the Government. The fact that the Commission is falling into line with the Government's guidelines and recommendations, as are included in the appendices to this report, hardly suggests that we now ought to have a statement from the Minister agreeing with the Commission. The Government, having got the Commission , under its guidelines, to agree with it then used the Commission as a substantiating argument for what is happening in relation to the amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA> One point which worries me excessively is that the University of New England has not agreed to come into an amalgamation. It has made a judgment-a judgment which I believe most of the institutions which are forced into these shotgun marriages would have made-that the educational justification probably would be zero. The justification for these ideas came out of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee. Indeed, it was an economic decision tarted up to look like an educational decision. The part of the Minister's statement with which I am concerned is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of concern that the attitude of the University is threatening the continued funding of advanced education at Armidale. </PARA>
<PARA>I cannot imagine the universities seeking to do anything to threaten educational funding in Armidale. I am quite sure that the people of Armidale do not see the university as threatening the funding. I suggest that the people of the electorate which includes Armidale will be concerned to discover that, contrary to the comment in the Minister's statement, it is the Government which is threatening the continued funding of advanced education in Armidale. I am quite sure that next time the Minister goes back there he will receive a more heated reception than he had last time. The fact of the matter is that most of the amalgamations will save very little money. Educationally very little will be achieved. The types of things that the Government was seeking to do-if it was seeking to do very much in an educational sense-could have been achieved by a multicampus arrangement which most of the institutions had already instigated. I do not think that the forced imposition of a new idea on amalgamation has necessarily added to the educational output of those insitutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I now deal with technical and further education. The types of expenditure which the Government has made are very welcome, particularly those in relation to the development of new capital works. In that area I believe that the Government has had a very good record for some considerable time. However, the Government itself must now give close attention to the problems of technology in relation to TAFE colleges. By and large TAFE colleges must keep an extremely close link with industry. Industry is undergoing enormous changes in terms of computer technology and, in particular, changes in the area of metalwork. Many of the TAFE institutions, owing to the lack of funds in terms of equipment grants, do not have within them the machinery to train students to use in industry. That is a continuing problem. It is a problem which TAFE institutions probably feel much more than most because of the rapid technological changes which occur. I do not necessarily believe that one needs to equip TAFE colleges with all types of machinery, but additional funds may be needed to establish a closer work- educational link with the industries so that we do not need to have a duplication of resources but will be able partly to fund, as it were, the employment of those machines in industry in return for their use by TAFE students. I do not think it is beyond the wit of the TAFE colleges to do that but obviously there would need to be a supporting funding arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The other item to which I refer in relation to TAFE arises out of a similar problem regarding technological development. I refer to the necessity for staff to upgrade themselves in their own area of expertise. Some years ago we had an unholy attack concerning the study leave of academics working in various sectors . The attack was based on the assumption that these were glorified overseas trips that people took to enjoy themselves. It was almost impossible to be heard in that debate. If one were to do a cost-benefit analysis one would soon discover that Australia benefits enormously from an academic going overseas. By and large the academics pay for the trip almost entirely and they bring back new -found information and understanding. That is a cheap way-in fact, it is at somebody's expense-for Australia to get hold of the latest developments that occur outside this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, in terms of TAFE, this does not occur once every seven years. It may occur seven times in one year and not at all in the next six years. There needs to be a much more flexible arrangement in relation to continuing the upgrading of staff understanding in the TAFE area. I believe that insufficient attention has been given by the report, the Technical and Further Education Council and the Government's announcements to the growing problem of the technological revolution as it relates to the TAFE sector. I would not like my critical remarks to be taken as an indication that the Government has not done a great deal in this area, as it should, and in the types of developments in which it has engaged. The fact is that the Government has at least maintained, or slightly increased, in real terms the funding to the various levels in the tertiary sector and it ought to be applauded, particularly in view of the types of cuts that have been made in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I merely repeat the point I have reiterated many times on behalf of the Australian Democrats: We see the education sector not as an area that ought to be counted in terms of costs but rather an area which must always be looked at in terms of its investment. By funding to a greater extent than we are now doing we can hope to meet the types of challenges that the technical revolution is bringing upon us. To do anything-including the aborted scheme to implement fees- which would in any way damage the prospects of getting every possible student who is academically qualified to engage in any tertiary education we are able to provide and which would prevent any one of those students from continuing would be a loss to the country and a loss to our development. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the next time we debate a report from an education commission we will get some of the things Senator Ryan spoke about; that, is, a bit more rigorous and gutsy presentation from the Commissions as to what they see are the problems of education in this country. In terms of its policy response the Government can then say: 'We cannot meet all of those, but this is what we can do'. At least the Commissions will be pushing the Government, as is their role. They ought to be pushing the Government, because of their expertise, about where we should be going. They are not bodies which should follow behind the policy judgments that the Government gives. I am quite sure that the Minister, in his own quiet moments, would not mind having a much more rigorous and gutsy approach from the commissions concerning the problems of education in this country. At least when he gets into a debate he will have something to react to rather than the bland presentations we have had in these two reports.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Honourable senators will remember that on 27 May this year I tabled the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Management Education, the document known as the Ralph report from the name of its distinguished chairman. The Ralph inquiry had arisen , it will be recalled, from the Government's consideration of a recommendation contained in the report presented by the Study Group on Structural Adjustment, known as the Crawford report. Along with the reports from two other broad inquiries commissioned by this Government, the Williams and Myers reports, the Crawford report contributed towards stimulating a climate of community thinking in which more precise action for the future of management education became possible. Working on the best possible advice obtainable in the Commonwealth in the related fields of education and training, technological change, and issues of policies and structural adjustments for Australian industry, the Government has in this manner set out on a course of constructive concern for the future of technological and business studies in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I tabled the Ralph report, I therefore issued at the same time a statement seeking wide-ranging public comment on the content of the report. In view of the significant studies that had been commissioned by the Government since late in the 1970s, and in view of the deep interest which they had aroused in all sections of the educational, commercial, and industrial communities, it is not surprising that the report's presentation drew the volume of response for which we had hoped. </PARA>
<PARA> Representations about the report have been made directly to my office, and to various sectors of the Commonwealth Education portfolio. They have come not solely from the central administration of universities and colleges of advanced education, from departments and individual lecturers within institutions, from education authorities in the States, from State governments themselves, and from the business community, but also from students who have a personal stake in the future of management education courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The advice given to me about the report by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission has also been tabled today as an appendix to volume 3 of the Commission's report for the 1982-84 triennium. The advice given there makes clear the reasons for the width and depth of this reaction to the report. Fundamental issues of academic standards, of institutional autonomy, of rationalisation of expensive resources, and of access to courses in management education at various levels, were addressed there. Implementation of decisions about these kinds of issues requires, in the Government's view, the most careful consultation with the implementing bodies involved. The results of our deliberations are, therefore, arranged around this theme of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will observe that the Commission supports substantially the recommendations contained in the report, with some reservations, and that it makes positive suggestions for implementing the report's objectives. The major recommendations refer to the rationalisation of programs of management education offered by institutions of higher education, the establishment of a second graduate management school under special, ear-marked funding arrangements, the concentration of part time Master of Business Administration studies in one management school in each mainland State, the provision by other tertiary institutions of a variety of programs encouraging wider access to management education through formal and informal courses, and the creation of an Australian foundation for management development. </PARA>
<PARA> Here it will be appreciated that the overriding interest of those responsible for the Ralph report has been to find methods to attain and maintain the highest possible quality of education for those who will be the nation's middle-level and senior business managers. The report's central objective has been to raise this quality of business management education at all levels, not solely on the plane of courses leading to the degree of Master of Business Administration, but also at other levels of award courses, and also in the non-award sector. The basic argument of the report is that it is better to achieve, by concentration of effort, high-quality MBAs and post-graduate diplomas rather than MBAs of varying standards. To do otherwise would both devalue these degrees, and disadvantage students, managers, and the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The report, therefore, asserts that adequate numbers of well-qualified staff are required to provide better courses to meet the varied needs of the business community. It lays particular emphasis on the future of higher education in business management. It recommends the establishment, under special funding, of a second graduate school of management at the University of Melbourne, offering substantially full time MBA and Ph.D. courses, and providing leadership through research. This school would complement the Australian Graduate School of Management at the University of New South Wales, and it is intended that these two would be the only institutions offering full time programs towards the degrees of Master of Business Administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted the recommendation to establish in 1983 a second graduate school of management with a national role at the University of Melbourne. This will entail provision of up to $4m by the Commonwealth-in 1982 out-turn prices-towards the construction of a building for the school. The University and the business community will be expected to meet a significant part of the total cost. Commonwealth support for the project will also depend upon the University providing satisfactory responses to the requirements stipulated by the Committee of Inquiry and supported by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. Discussions on the establishment and management of the Melbourne school will be under the joint direction of the Chairman of the Committee of Inquiry, Mr J. T. Ralph, and the Secretary to my Department, the Department of Education, Mr K. N. Jones. This will be with a view to promoting the active co-operation and involvement of the Australian business community in the management and financing of the school. I shall then report to the Government as soon as possible on the arrangements proposed. Along with this provision, additional recurrent funds would be allocated under the CTEC programs , amounting to $200,000 in 1983 and $300,000 in 1984, also in 1982 out-turn prices. The Commission believes that this funding will suffice to enable the University to appoint additional staff, and to improve its support services, where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Grants towards the establishment of the second graduate school of management will be incorporated in States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) legislation, shortly to come before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will have noted that the Ralph report recommended limitation of part-time MBA programs to one institution in each mainland State, and that it named these institutions, all universities. The recommendations would also reduce the external MBA course offered by Deakin University to a post -graduate diploma, and would limit colleges of advanced education to offering, at the post-graduate level, diplomas in business administration. Honourable senators will be aware that some colleges of advanced education offer well- regarded MBA courses. The Government, therefore, agrees in principle with the desirability of rationalising programs of management education and of concentrating resources for part time MBA courses into one institution in each mainland State, but recognises that the Ralph Committee did not state the criteria used for differentiating between institutions. Nor did it provide an overall program to meet the varied needs in each State for access to different levels and forms of business administration courses. </PARA>
<PARA> In this connection, there has been considerable criticism by institutions which would be affected adversely by the proposed limitations on the courses which they would continue to offer. State governments have expressed similar concern. Accordingly, the Government agrees with the proposal by the Commission to seek submissions from State authorities and institutions on how best to achieve the rationalisation of courses and the concentration of resources envisaged by the Committee of Inquiry. It has decided to request the Commission to report by March 1983 on the best means to achieve this in each State. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ralph report also proposes that an Australian Foundation for Management Development should be established to provide a continuing overview of management education, to establish standards, and possibly to accredit courses in management education. It would perform the functions which are undertaken by professional bodies in other fields. A foundation of this kind should make a significant contribution towards advancing management education, and the Government agrees that its establishment is a vital ingredient in improving business administration. It, therefore, proposes that the business community be invited to establish and provide continuing financial support for an Australian Foundation for Management Development, with $50,000 being provided by the Commonwealth in each of the years 1983 and 1984 to assist establishment. </PARA>
<PARA> As a means of improving the qualifications of academic staff working in the field of management education and of encouraging research by highly qualified students, the Ralph Committee has recommended that scholarship and teaching assistantships should be provided. I shall submit to the Government proposals to be considered in the context of the 1983 Budget. This would allow for measures to operate on behalf of staff and students from 1984 onwards. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be said that the Ralph report gave limited consideration to the educational needs of small business. The Government is convinced that this is an important area which requires further study. It will, therefore, ask the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission to consult with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and the Department of Industry and Commerce to report on business management programs in tertiary education to meet the needs of small business. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the 45 recommendations contained in the Ralph report largely concern matters which are the prime responsibility of State authorities and institutions and are not matters appropriate to Commonwealth direction. I shall ask the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission to seek to promote these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> It only remains to say that the Government and the Australian community are greatly indebted to the members of the Ralph Committee for the considerable and highly valued work which they have devoted to their surveys and deliberations and the compilation of their report. It was a difficult task to be undertaken by the first committee to report on national needs for management education since the Cyert Committee that was established in 1970. The concerns which the Ralph Committee was asked to address were disposed over a much wider range of reference than those of the Cyert Committee. The intervening decade has seen a vastly accelerated degree of change in the exigencies and long term problems that are being presented for solution by Australia's present and future business managers. The achievements of the Ralph Committee and the decisions which have now been taken by the Government represent one further step in the program which I have outlined for the enhancement of management education in this country. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) has just delivered to this Senate the Government's decisions on the recommendations in the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Management Education-the report of the Ralph Committee . I say at the outset that the Opposition does not argue with some of the main thrusts of that report. We accept that there is a need for post-graduate management training of the highest standard. We accept that there is a need for a rationalisation of resources. We accept that the proposed new course at Melbourne University which will complement the existing course at the University of New South Wales is a desirable development. We acknowledge that management education in Australia has been erratic and of a fairly low standard in the past with some notable exceptions such as the New South Wales course. I think, as far as the general public is concerned, one has to look only at the plight of business in Australia, at the mismanagement there is at so many levels in the private sector in Australia, to agree that we should be looking to the development of excellent post-graduate education in the area of business management. </PARA>
<PARA> However, having said that and having said that we do accept the proposed new course at Melbourne and the reasons for it, I must point out that the Opposition has a number of reservations about the report and the Government's reponse to it . In particular we find that the report has been too narrow in its recommendations and the Government's response has been equally narrow. Whilst we accept that there ought to be these two major courses, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne, and we acknowledge that each State would have one institution where a part time master of business administration course would be offered and other institutions would be able to offer courses at a lower level, we believe that the whole area of business management education has now become too restrictive. It seems to us that the Ralph Committee's approach has been overall an elitist one, that it has shown a preoccupation with the needs of top level management in the large corporations to the exclusion of other very important areas in the economy-for example, to the exclusion of middle-sized small business, which I think the Minister has acknowledged. Of course, the needs of the public sector and of public enterprises have not been adequately addressed in this report or in the Government's response. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the consequences of the implementation of the Government's decision that management courses in institutions other than the ones nominated should be ceased is that many people, many students, will lose access to management education. I am particularly concerned that students who have been availing themselves of part time courses such as the one at Deakin University will no longer have these courses available to them. Many people who are studying management on a part time basis simply cannot afford to take off a year to study full time in any university doing a higher degree. </PARA>
<PARA> I attract the Senate's attention to the particular needs of women with regard to management education. As honourable senators will be aware, because I and some of my colleagues have made this point a number of times, women are seriously under-represented in management in this country both in the public sector and in the private sector. Once we go beyond the middle level of management in the private sector or in the Commonwealth Public Service we find very few women indeed. I hope that is a source of concern for senators on both sides of the chamber. Women themselves have been attempting to address this disadvantage by undertaking part time courses in business administration. Many women currently working in corporations are seeking to overcome their past lack of access to promotion by availing themselves of part time courses. Many of those women simply will not be in a position to take off a year full time to undertake a post-graduate course or indeed may not yet be at the level where they would be able to gain entry to the post-graduate course at the University of New South Wales or the one now proposed at Melbourne University.</PARA>
<PARA> So, there is a whole range of needs of students-and I use women as one specific example-and of people working in management to have access to part time courses. We do not believe that range of needs is going to be met by the implementation of the recommendations of this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the Minister said that he would be calling for submissions from State bodies and so forth about how the recommendations are going to be implemented. It seems to us that there will be a narrowing down of courses available in this area. It is our view that that narrowing down will lead to a significant lack of access. I give the example of Deakin University which has a largely part time student body. I do not know what the Government has in mind for Deakin University. I presume that negotiations have to take place. But I think that the work that has been carried out at Deakin in this respect and the kinds of students who have been able to avail themselves of the course at Deakin exemplify the sort of broad range of management education courses which ought to be available and which we are concerned will no longer be available once this report and the Government's response are implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We think that the whole question of people living in non-metropolitan Australia is not properly addressed in the recommendations. People will be seeking to pursue studies at regional institutions, colleges of advanced education and the like. While some courses may be offered at a diploma level, it seems that there will be a winding down of these courses. Of course, we cannot look at the particular recommendations with regard to management education in isolation. A few minutes ago the Minister presented to us the report of the Tertiary Education Commission and Senator Macklin and I have made some comments on the problems facing tertiary institutions in this country, on the extent to which courses are being restricted and staff is being restricted. Now we have a proposal for a new approach to management education which in itself is restrictive. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure Senator Macklin will agree with me that management education is something that this economy certainly needs. But we do not think that the Government's response to the established need is adequate. We fear that the Master of Business Administration courses are increasingly going to be available only to those who work for large corporations and, of course, to those who are selected by those corporations to attend. That means that the whole access to the MBA courses will continue to be elitist and will be more elitist than in the past. People who have not been able to gain promotion through large corporations -as I have said, women form a very large group who have had difficulties in that respect-will simply not be in that top rung of executives who will be chosen by corporations to be given the benefit of a year's leave to go and study full time for an MBA. This restriction of access to these courses to such a narrow group of people will, I think, lead to intellectual inbreeding at a time when Australian business desperately needs to attract new talent and new ideas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his remarks, acknowledged that the needs of small business have not been adequately addressed in this report. It is the view of the Opposition that the needs of small business have been almost entirely ignored by the Ralph Committee's report. I note that the Government has proposed further action in this respect but I should like to remind the Senate that small business is vitally important to Australia. Overall, it is one of the largest sources of employment in Australia. It is the backbone of our business community . It has been particularly hard hit by the economic strategies of the Fraser Government, by monetarism. It has crucial and urgent needs for improvement in the management skills. Yet, of course, these needs have not been taken up. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister points out that people in small business will not be able to spare the time to do a full time course. Again, I think that reinforces my view and the view of the Opposition that we need available a wider range of courses in administration so that people running a small business will be able to avail themselves of the courses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other major defect in the report concerns the needs of the public sector with regard to management training. These needs have almost been ignored. I point out to the Senate that this is a matter of great concern to the public. The public has a huge amount of money invested in public corporations, such as Telecom Australia, Trans Australia Airlines, electricity commissions, Qantas Airways Ltd and health commissions. There is vast public investment in these enterprises and, of course, these enterprises are also extremely important to our society in a fundamental way because they are engaged in the delivery of basic services. The management of our large public corporations is a matter that should be of great concern to all of us. I think it has to be admitted that in these large public corporations there is evidence of a need for improved managerial skills. The kinds of courses which are now proposed by the Ralph Committee will not meet the needs of these corporations. In fact, in such huge public corporations as Telecom, there are very many employees who are just below middle level management, who need these courses available to them, who will not be eligible for the full time one-year MBA courses in Sydney and Melbourne but who would profit very much from a variety of courses. Given the Government's current approach, and indeed the approach it has pursued for the past seven years, towards staff ceilings and leave entitlements in the Public Service, many people working in public corporations would be able to pursue management education only if part time courses were available to them. I hope that the Government will take note of this. We recognise that the Government has a fundamental hostility to public enterprises but, while they exist, surely the Government should agree that they ought to be managed in the interests of the public, which after all has such a huge investment tied up in them. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of existing courses the Minister has indicated that there will be further discussions and submissions. But it is the view of the Opposition that this response is not adequate. We believe that the question of uncertainty surrounding existing courses, which it seems are now to be wiped out, will be very confusing and very distressing to students and teachers of those courses. The matter is urgent. People cannot start a course this year without knowing whether it will continue next year. The insecurity and uncertainty surrounding existing courses that do not fit into the Ralph Committee's recommendations need to be addressed immediately and not left for many months of further discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I point out, as I did at the outset, that the Opposition does not oppose the setting up of a new MBA course at Melbourne University. It does not oppose the rationalisation of these courses or the attempts to ensure that these courses are run at the highest possible level. In fact, we endorse all of those objectives. But we do oppose the narrowing of access to management education which this report implies. In our view the question of existing courses should be dealt with immediately and it is our hope that as many of them as possible will be able to continue so that a whole range of people-people in small business, women and people in non-metropolitan areas who will never be able to do a full year's MBA course at Sydney or Melbourne-will be able to improve their understanding of management. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -One of the principles enunciated in the report of the Ralph Committee of Inquiry into Management Education reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> the objective of a national pattern of management education must be to provide as many managers as possible with access to forms of management education best suited to them</PARA>
<PARA>One of the principal objections from the academic and business communities to the Ralph report was that it did not fulfil that injunction. I do not think that the Government's response has done that either. In saying that I do not think that the Government's response has done that, I point out that the person who obviously drafted the other ministerial statements and this one has adopted a rather nice style because when I read it first I thought: 'My goodness, why have they done that?', and then I read it again and discovered it was something else entirely. On the third reading I probably discovered what the intent was. The Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), by way of interjection, pointed out in relation to regional schools, for example, that it looked as though there was an acceptance of the Ralph Committee's report, but on closer reading it may not be there. I am still not sure what the final intent is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly agree with the Minister on that, but in relation to one particular institution I do not think there can be any equivocation. That is Deakin University. It is the only institution of its kind and therefore there could not be any problem, to quote the Minister, about 'the criteria used for differentiating between institutions'. I presume that Deakin is to be reduced to a post-graduate diploma.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It could but the point of Deakin is the external studies. If that be the case, I should like to address my remarks to the point that Deakin may be reduced to a post-graduate diploma course. The problem with that-I pointed it out before but I think it is worth reiterating-is that the Deakin external studies started after the Ralph Committee had been going. I do not really believe that the Ralph Committee had sufficient evidence to make the types of judgments that it made-certainly the rather harsh judgment of its being a rather unsatisfactory mode for an MBA degree. The reason I say that is that, interestingly enough, the Deakin model has been exported. It has been adopted in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America. In fact, it has been accepted in papers at various international conferences as a leader in its field in terms of external studies. It seems to me very odd that we are thinking of forgoing something which is extremely useful to a country of our type; that we should be going backwards in regard to a scheme which other countries that, in other aspects of management education are far ahead of us, have seen fit to adopt. It seems analogous to a problem that we have in many areas-when we get ahead we get cold feet and want to draw back. The Deakin mode ought to be given encouragement and a chance to operate. If it does not come good a judgment in that regard can be made in due course, not in the abortive way that is being discussed now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also, I am extremely worried about that aspect of external studies, linked with another on which the Minister, by way of interjection, made a similar point-I refer to the small business operation. I find it very odd that, although the Ralph Committee report, the Government and the Minister in his response, acknowledge that only limited consideration has been given this problem, we are seeking a reorganisation and, in many ways, dismantling of the structure of management education at the very time that the Government also proposes an investigation of that area. I say that because, after all, small business is the business sector of Australia-not just a business sector. We do not seem to realise that in this country. If we were talking about the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd or some such operation we would all be concerned but when we talk about small business we seem to jettison the whole idea of its importance. But managers of small businesses are the very people about whom we need to be concerned because they are the employers of this country. As the Minister has quite rightly said, in almost every case they are not capable of entering upon full-time study. Therefore, they would not be attracted to the New South Wales or Victorian models. But they would seek alternative models, one of which would be external. Such a course would be extremely beneficial to them, particularly if it were linked to some kind of executive weekend model, as has become current in the South African business school, which has an international reputation in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks closely at the needs of small business managers one will be reinforced in one's opinion that the Deakin model ought to be retained as part of the development in that area, as part of one of the innovations or modes by which the objective of the Ralph inquiry might be fulfilled; namely, that as many managers as possible should have access to forms of management education that is best suited to them. I do not think that the Minister's response was antithetical to what I have said. I hope that we will not lose an innovation from which Australia is now gaining some international repute. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the second school at Melbourne would, I believe, be accepted by most people. Some of the funding issues may be of concern, certainly to Melbourne University, but in such an area as this I believe priorities have to be set by the university itself. Therefore, if it wishes to be a part of this scheme it would have to rationalise its own priorities. I believe that is a reasonable imposition to place upon it. I am concerned about one comment in the Minister's report which deals with the Australian Foundation for Management Development. I refer to the possible accrediting of courses in management. If that were done along the lines taken by other professional bodies I would certainly not have any objection to it. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what was in my mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that case, I have no objection. I was about to raise the point that if we were to have any interference with university autonomy it would be a bad move. If it were merely along the lines presently followed by, for example, doctors and accountants in stating their requirements, it would be perfectly acceptable to the universities and I believe management also. I raise another issue to which the Government has not, by and large, addressed itself. At the end of his remarks the Minister said that the majority of the remaining recommendations were the responsibility of other areas. I am not sure that one recommendation falls into that category, yet the Minister did not comment on it. I refer to the Ralph recommendation that no new MBA courses be approved before the end of 1993. I am concerned because it seems that if the Government does not comment on that it may be accepted as being operational. I hope that that is not the case, simply because I think that such arbitrary designations are not very useful in education. In 1973 the concept one had of the future world was a lot different from present actuality. I believe the arbitrary cutting off of reasonable development within various institutions is the sort of thing that institutions ought to be doing themselves, and coming forward with proposals on when an institution makes a proposal. It seems to me that is the appropriate time for a response as to whether or not it will be accepted. But I believe that institutions ought to have the ability to respond to what they perceive as community needs and to be able to present those points of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that regard, Griffith University, an institution in my State, has planned three courses in this area. I do not know how it will fare. They are not intended to come to fruition this year or next but at an appropriate time the university would wish to bring them forward. I mention Griffith University because it was not the Queensland institution named in the report. In fact, that was the University of Queensland. Yet at Griffith University 30 members of staff teach business studies. The Ralph Committee report talked about the establishment of the national school and said that there would need to be a minimum of 25 staff members. The Griffith University was not named in the Ralph report-seemingly it will not even get a guernsey-yet it has a bigger staff than even the Ralph Committee report was proposing for the national school. I reiterate the point made by the Minister, that we need to look at what is happening before we make any move in this area. I hope that we do not have a very one-track view about this. It is possible and very reasonable to look at a range of innovations in terms of business management at the regional level. We could then provide not only undergraduate and part time courses but also, if the Government cannot come into it now, at a later point, post-graduate courses and definitely MBA courses. It would be a multi-campus operation which would disturb nobody. It could be operated by a regional school of management and people currently employed in the area could be employed with minimum disruption. With a rationalisation of the courses we may even promote better management education at the regional level. We will not promote that if we artificially cut off post- graduate study. I make that point because it is in the nature of institutions to be able to attract top quality people; that they can teach not only at the undergraduate level but also at the post-graduate level. If we do not allow research and teaching at the post-graduate level it will be almost impossible for regional schools to attract top quality people. Of necessity they will gravitate to the national school. Therefore, there would be an ultimate downgrading in management education in Australia. We have had in this country a convention in terms of our universities of treating them as being on a par. Certain universities excel in certain areas but, unlike other countries, we do not rate our universities. We try to bring them all up to a high level and to allow them to operate at a post-graduate level so that we can have diffuse education in the country. It would be a retrograde step and against the whole notion of how universities operate in the real world to say: 'You are not going into post-graduate studies or post-graduate research'. The Government responses leave open the prospect of our not closing off those innovative and exciting prospects that Australia has begun and, I hope, will continue. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide the legislative basis for the implementation of the Tertiary Student Loans Scheme which will be introduced from the beginning of 1983. The Bill provides for the Commonwealth to subsidise the interest charged by banks on approved loans and for the Commonwealth to give guarantees to banks that it will repay outstanding debts on approved loans within prescribed limits. The Bill also covers the eligibility conditions applying to loans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tertiary Student Loans Scheme will enable full time tertiary students who are Australian citizens or permanent residents to borrow between $500 and $1,000 per annum from banks to help pay for their education and living expenses while studying. Students will be able to borrow up to $8,000 over the total period of their study. </PARA>
<PARA> Many full time students will be eligible for approved loans by virtue of their entitlement to benefits under various Commonwealth student assistance schemes. These schemes are: The Commonwealth Post-graduate Awards Scheme; the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, known as TEAS; the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme; and the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme. The Tertiary Student Loans Scheme will provide an additional source of support for eligible students receiving benefits under these schemes. Other full time students will qualify for loans providing they satisfy a simple means test, the details of which have already been announced in the Budget context. These details will be prescribed in regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has demonstrated its strong continuing support for student assistance schemes by its decision to increase substantially allowance levels and relax means tests for 1983. The loans scheme will provide another option for students. The interest rate to apply to loans will be the maximum rate permissible for advances by banks of less than $100,000-currently 14.5 per cent per annum-reduced by 5 percentage points by a Commonwealth subsidy. The Commonwealth will provide banks with guarantees amounting to $50m per annum on approved loans but the banks will be expected to take all reasonable steps to obtain repayments from defaulting borrowers before the Commonwealth honours guarantees. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme will be administered by the Commonwealth Department of Education in conjunction with the banks and tertiary institutions, and the detailed terms and conditions for approved loans will be prescribed in regulations. Funds to meet payments by the Commonwealth of interest subsidies and the repayments of any defaulted loans will be provided for through the general appropriation legislation. For this financial year the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1982-83 provides $150,000 for these purposes. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

Had it been carried it would have allowed the same thing as the Minister for Education, Senator Baume, has done today; that is, it would have allowed Ministers to read second reading speeches and people introducing reports from committees also to read speeches. However, the Senate in its wisdom decided to oppose that motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to seek leave to comment on the motion and then to seek leave to continue my remarks later. The reason for that course of action is that the motion moved by Senator Evans yesterday, which was materially different from the motion of which he gave notice the day before, specified in his own list 22 particular documents, but within some of those areas, particularly his first area, are a large number of documents as yet undetermined. Those relate to the Federal Commissioner of Taxation's minutes concerning bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. That is just one example. A large number of documents in that category have already been identified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the Government's position in relation to these documents mentioned in the motion, we are looking at them to determine whether or not they would be documents that would be made available under the Freedom of Information Act. Although that Act is not in existence as such yet, we believe that that would be the proper approach to take to this matter. In pursuance of that approach, a number of officers worked a good deal of yesterday. Some of the documents have been the subject of questions, and I have already given an indication of the problems that I believe exist in relation to some of the documents-I refer to counsels' opinions-which refer to the matter now well known as the Perth file. A brief on that has been delivered to Mr Gleeson, and he is considering it. There is also a request for the report of police investigators into that matter. The police report is one which under the Freedom of Information Act would, in many circumstances-and likely in this one-be exempt. But I am not making final decisions. I am simply indicating the difficulties in respect of most, if not all, of these documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is particularly concerned, regardless of freedom of information, as to the prosecutions that are likely or may well take place, and that there should be no prejudice to prosecutions or to civil proceedings ancillary to these matters. I have also asked the Solicitor-General specifically to look at these opinions again-he has already seen many of them-and to give me his advice as to the likely effect on proceedings by the publication of any or part of these opinions. It may be possible to release part of an opinion, but the mere sanitising in Senator Evans's conception of simply cutting out names is not adequate for the purpose. So there are a number of very major considerations indeed in regard to the Government's response specifically to each of these documents, and that is what is required. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to the documents in the first category, and in one or two other categories. They are documents for which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has ministerial responsibility. For those in my Department, I have ministerial responsibility. I have indicated the problems that I have and the way in which we are tackling them. But for many of the documents the Treasurer has ministerial responsibility. As the Senate is aware, the Treasurer is overseas but is returning on Saturday. It is proposed that he should be consulted about these matters as soon as possible after his return. The Government will then have to give final consideration to what its stands and response will be to Senator Evan's motion. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, this afternoon, for the reasons I have given, we are just not in that position. We are working very urgently and closely on these matters. I assure the Senate that it is not a matter that we are taking in anything but the most serious and earnest spirit of endeavour in order to meet the major questions raised by Senator Evan's motion. As I have said, very senior people, in particular the Solicitor-General, will be giving me some advice on these matters. I believe that very fundamental principles are at stake here. The greatest care should be given to this matter by the Government and the Senate. That may well have to be the subject of debate next week, but as of now the Government is seeking further time, for the reasons I have given. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the motion for the resumption of the debate, let me say quickly just this: There is no skin off the collective nose of those of us on this side of the chamber for the consideration of this matter to be further delayed until next Tuesday at the Government's request. But an extra layer of skin comes off the nose of the Government for every further day of prevarication in this matter. It is the Opposition's intention, as was foreshadowed in yesterday's debate, to build into the motion that I moved in an amended form yesterday some appropriate additional filter mechanism to make clear that we are perfectly prepared to ensure that nothing becomes a matter of public record which might conceivably genuinely prejudice the prosecution of people involved or legal proceedings against people involved in these schemes. We also foreshadowed yesterday that it was our further intention to allow some appropriate time for the Government to meet whatever obligation is contained in a resolution that might ultimately be passed in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One filter mechanism that might be appropriate for consideration is giving a role to the Ombudsman, in his personal capacity as Professor Jack Richardson to finally determine, no doubt in consultation with other relevant people, what aspects of these documents might conceivably or might genuinely prejudice legal proceedings. Today I should have thought that an appropriate period for the Government to honour its obligations on any motion that might be passed by the Senate would be seven days. Next Tuesday, I rather suspect that my perception and our perception of what is an appropriate period might be rather less than that, given the further time that has advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> I make clear finally that we on this side of the chamber are prepared to bend over backwards to be reasonable in this matter, although our patience with the Government's prevarication, and with its manifest intention to go on hiding in the hope that this spectre now haunting it will ultimately somehow go away, is likely to be well and truly exhausted by next Tuesday. I hope that the Government will take that very much on board in its further deliberations on this subject. </PARA>

In referring that matter to the Committee, note was taken of a request from Senator McLaren to examine problems facing one of the four remaining canneries, namely, the Riverland Fruit Products Co-op Ltd, which is currently in receivership. The Committee has considered this request against the background that the canning industry is currently the subject of an inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission to determine whether assistance should be provided to the industry. The IAC's deadline for reporting on this matter is 30 September 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In referring the annual report to the Committee the essential issue was the Auditor-General's qualifications to the Corporation's accounts. It is the Committee's view that an examination of the type sought by Senator McLaren would more appropriately be handled by another Senate standing committee whose basic terms of reference would encompass the industry issues which are at the heart of the problem. Perhaps this could be considered further in the light of the forthcoming IAC report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity in whatever time is available to me to refer to a ministerial statement which the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) put down in another place last Thursday week. I will very briefly outline where it all started. On 25 February of this year, I asked a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this place, the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), as to some allegations pertaining to the embezzlement of a sum of money from the Tehran Embassy some years ago. On 5 March, I received a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). The second paragraph of that letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Department is not aware of any embezzlement from the Australian Embassy in Tehran and a careful check of the post's financial transactions has not revealed any discrepancy. </PARA>
<PARA>Being a fairly reasonable sort of person-at that stage-I accepted to some extent what the Minister had said. However, on 24 March I received a second letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs wherein, in part, he said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At that stage, what had happened began to rankle me a little and caused me to wonder really what was going on in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On page 15 of the Minister's statement which he put down last week he said:</PARA>
<PARA> All persons holding public office must be accountable for their actions. Any allegations or evidence of wrongdoing must be examined and action taken if it is warranted. If, moreover, any person believes that there have been wrongful acts committed, that person, and particularly an officer of the Public Service, has a clear duty to bring forward his or her concerns and, of course, must be entitled to protection against any possibility of vindictive action simply because allegations have been made. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps that is the main reason why this whole matter has somewhat rankled me. It has gone on for six or seven years. The people within the Department who have had the courage to stand on their convictions and their professional morality have been people who, in my view, have been victimised. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn again to the statement the Minister put down last Thursday week. In this statement, the Minister is, in my view, making a vain attempt to defend the indefensible-to protect two of his top officers from the exposure of their actions in the Tehran affair. In particular he attacked my efforts in the last six months to have these matters ventilated in the Parliament. During that time the very senior officers who provide Mr Street and the Government with its foreign affairs policy advice have worked unceasingly to convert chalk into cheese. By means of ministerial and permanent head pressure they have succeeded in fully implicating the Department of Finance and the Australian Federal Police in a disgraceful cover-up. </PARA>
<PARA> Officials paid to protect the taxpayer have, instead, worked to prevent the exposure of an ex-ambassador who has preyed on the public purse for more than two decades. Police officers, sworn to uphold the law, have bullied witnesses to withdraw their evidence against these corrupt Department of Foreign Affairs officers and have falsely reported that no evidence exists against them. At least three Ministers of this Government are knowingly involved in this cover-up which has even extended to withholding from the Parliament important documents relating to the matter. It is a sorry commentary on the state of affairs in Parliament today that most of these documents have had to find their way through the hands of the media who have provided them to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> To avoid any misunderstanding, real or feigned, let me make it abundantly clear that I and the Opposition acknowledge that the vast majority of officers in the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Finance and the Australian Federal Police are conscientious workers and upright citizens who are as strongly opposed as any of us are to corrupt activities of a small number of powerful senior personnel in collusion with each other and some Ministers to defeat the due processes of law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive for us to consider briefly the recent history of this matter. As I explained in detail to the Senate on 29 April, the Parliament's involvement in this affair started on 25 February with my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. As I stated earlier, Mr Street promptly telephoned me to say that his Department had assured him that there was no evidence whatsoever of embezzlement from the Embassy in Tehran. On 5 March, as I stated earlier, he sent me a letter prepared, I understand, by the Secretary to his Department, Mr Peter Henderson, which in part said:</PARA>
<PARA> My Department is not aware of any embezzlement from the Australian Embassy in Tehran and a careful check of the post's financial transactions has not revealed any discrepancy. </PARA>
<PARA>In purveying that letter, in my view Mr Street misled the Parliament. I present for inclusion in Hansard a Foreign Affairs document dated 22 March 1982 which provides evidence of Mr Henderson's handling of that matter. The author of that document was a Mr D. W. Witheford, the head of the Philippines-Thailand-Burma section of the Department of Foreign Affairs. I seek leave to have that document incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>22 March 1982</PARA>
<PARA> Mr R. J. Smith, FAS Management and Foreign Service Division. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I have not heard from you since we spoke on 17 March, I am setting out a record of my various discussions with you and other staff. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. After checking with Parliamentary Liaison (Calver) on 12 March, I telephoned the A/Head, Overseas and General Accounting Section (Brooks) to advise him that I had an input to make into the Foreign Minister's reply to Senator Primmer's question about embezzlement from the Embassy in Tehran. Brooks said that he thought the Minister's reply had already gone and that he would refer my inquiry to the A/AS Administrative Services Branch (Parkes). I therefore checked again with Parliamentary Liaison (Calver) to be told that the Department had not yet put a draft reply to the Minister. He said that my interest in the matter had been noted and that they would inform me if a draft letter came forward without my input. I indicated to both Brooks and Calver that there was every risk that a reply which did not include my input would lead to the Minister's misleading Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. On 17 March, Parkes called me in to talk with him and Brooks. They sought to ascertain what my proposed input was, showing me the Minister's draft reply which stated that the Department was unaware of any embezzlement from the Embassy in Tehran. At my insistence, Parkes checked and confirmed that the Minister had signed the letter to Senator Primmer and dispatched it. I stated that the Minister had been misled and asked from whom had the submission to the Minister gone. Parkes sought to obfuscate, but finally agreed that it would have been from you or Mr Henderson. I therefore said that it now seemed that the Department had knowingly misled the Minister. I asked him (and subsequently you) for copies of the Minister's letter and the Department's covering submission to him (not provided). Parkes again claimed ignorance of any financial problem in Tehran and pressed me to give him all the information I had. I responded that his superiors were well aware of some of the details as had been his predecessor (Johns, now retired). I left him with the assertion that if the Department did not act promptly and honestly to undo the damage, I would feel obliged to seek to inform the Minister myself. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. You subsequently came down to my office and, claiming that neither you nor your staff had any knowledge about embezzlement concerning the Embassy in Tehran , you pressed me to provide any information I had to you urgently. You reminded me that concealment of crime was, itself, a crime. Reminding you that you and other senior officers were well aware of serious irregularities involving a certain senior officer, both at Tehran and previously, I repeated what I had told you in our conversation of 18 November 1981 (a copy of the agreed record of which you hold) viz. that I feared everything would (again) be covered up and retribution (again) visited upon me and other officers involved. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Assuring you that I had no knowledge of how Senator Primmer had received his information, I explained to you that it was by no means a matter of indifference to me that the Department had wilfully sought to lock the Minister-and, indeed, the Parliament-into the false stance that nothing had happened in Tehran. I said that it was clear that you and another very senior officer, also apparently involved, had knowingly misled the Minister with the aim of protecting the malefactor. This was a reckless action since some of the facts were known to not a few Departmental officers, not to mention, apparently, Senator Primmer. I told you that I thought urgent steps should be taken to undo the damage and that I would be reconsidering my position in the affair in the light of our conversation. </PARA>

The relevant statement dated 8 April from Mr Witheford, the head of the Philippines-Thailand-Burma section, to Mr Street has again been excluded from the report prepared by the Department of Finance.

<PARA>PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION FROM SENATOR PRIMMER TEHRAN: ALLEGED EMBEZZLEMENT</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister</PARA>
<PARA> As requested by you on 23 March, I attach an outline of some financial irregularities (involving a particular senior officer) which occurred at Tehran and at related Locations. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. I regret that it was not possible for me to get this material to you before your departure from Canberra on 25 March. There was a combination of reasons for this, including the need to contact a number of serving and retired colleagues, the need to search through considerable documentation and the need to obtain legal advice (explained below). </PARA>
<PARA> 3. To the greatest possible extent I have indicated where relevant documentation can be sought. In this connection I wish to record that the Secretary has refused to make available to me any documents or files relating to this matter. I have, perforce, relied on my own memory and on those of numerous serving and retired colleagues, together with documents which had earlier been available to us in Tehran and Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. It concerns me that there is no possibility of legal action being taken against me for having spoken out. For instance, on 11 March, 1981, the First Assistant Secretary, Management and Foreign Service Division, indicated to me that he would consider making my 'X' file available to others to enable them to take possible legal action against me. The senior officer referred to in paragraph 1 is referred to throughout as ''Jason''. Other officers are referred to by an alphabetical code which is being made available to you separately upon certain conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. I expect that I shall be able to pass on to you some further relevant information during the next few weeks. I am awaiting further details from some officers, both serving and retired. I am awaiting a response from Mr A. P. Renouf to whom I wrote on 1 April. (A copy of that letter is held in your office .) I expect that he will have useful information to offer, including, perhaps, a more detailed exposition of allegations of dishonesty which he recently made against a senior officer. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. I am concerned that these matters may be lightly dismissed by senior officers. This would demonstrate the blatant disregard for the application of regulations etc. which has already been shown. For example, I have, since November, 1980, been seeking access to documents relevant to the whole question. In doing so I have been stalled and blocked by senior officers at every turn. These actions have been contrary to the requirement for appeals to be determined expeditiously. In my assessment reports for 1980 and 1981 my supervisor criticised me for spending too much time on these matters. I am fearful of further pressure on me and the other officers concerned. I request that you grant me an interview to enable me to discuss certain of the above matters with you. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SO7">Senator PRIMMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In incorporating this document in Hansard, I draw the attention of honourable senators in particular to paragraph 4 which, in part, reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It concerns me that there is a possibility of legal action being taken against me--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Mr Witheford-</PARA>
<PARA>for having spoken out. For instance, on 11 March, 1981, the First Assistant Secretary, Management and Foreign Service Division-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr R. J. Smith-</PARA>
<PARA>indicated to me that he would consider making my 'x' file--</PARA>
<PARA>I would not have a clue what an 'x' file is, but I presume that it is an interdepartmental file-</PARA>
<PARA>available to others to enable them to take possible legal action against me. </PARA>
<PARA>As far as I can determine, no action whatsoever has yet been taken to examine that threat, which was obviously conveyed to frighten Mr Witheford into silence. In this connection, I inform honourable senators that both Mr Henderson and Mr Bowden have threatened to take legal action for defamation against me and a number of media organisations and, in fact, have taken out a writ against the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of Mr Bowden's various activities, together with a large sheaf of accounting vouchers and other evidence, were attached to that submission. Subsequently Mr Henderson, in what was presumably intended as a show of innocence, let it be known that the Australian Federal Police would be invited to examine the report of the Department of Finance. However, at least a fortnight prior to the submission of the evidence to Mr Street, Mr Henderson had commenced to implement a bold and shameless cover-up plan. As a first step, he took action to deprive Mr Witheford and his workmates of the higher duties opportunities normally available in the Department. This entailed a loss of pay to the staff involved and has been repeated several times. The unions and the Public Service Board have been unable to prevent these crude acts of retribution . At the same time, there was an abortive attempt to shift Mr Witheford, without even an hour's notice, to a new location in the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> A few days later, on 31 March, Mr Henderson let it be known that a determined program of consultation and influence aimed at the Department of Finance's investigators had begun. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a copy of a note dated 31 March from Mr Henderson to that effect. That note is addressed to Mr Witheford and signed by Mr Henderson. </PARA>

<PARA>Mr D. W. Witheford</PARA>
<PARA>TEHRAN: ALLEGED EMBEZZLEMENT</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your minute of 30 March 1982, addressed to me. Your minute seriously misrepresents the situation. You have not been requested by the Minister to prepare a report as your minute asserts. You have been asked to pass to the Minister's Office any information which you hold concerning alleged financial irregularities in the Australian Embassy in Tehran so that that information can be thoroughly and promptly investigated by officers of the Department of Finance . You have no authority to carry out any investigation in this matter; any investigation will be carried out by appropriately qualified officers from the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. This matter has been further discussed with officers of the Department of Finance who have made it clear that they are most concerned that any information should be submitted for investigation promptly and that, in accordance with the request from the Minister's Office to you on 25 March, submission of that information should not be delayed awaiting the Minister's return. Officers of the Department of Finance consider that you have now had adequate time in which to consider your position and seek any necessary advice and have therefore requested that any information which you hold should be furnished without any further delay. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. If you have knowledge of any matter which bears upon the allegation please convey it forthwith to the Minister's Office so that it may be fully and promptly investigated by the professionally qualified officers of the Department of Finance who are ready to commence any necessary investigation. Further delay can only hinder the prompt and just resolution of these allegations. </PARA>
<PARA>P. G. F. HENDERSON</PARA>
<PARA>Secretary</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SO7">Senator PRIMMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is clear that a sustained effort aimed at the Finance team continued during the months of the investigation. In early May, a number of staff members who had served with Mr Bowden in Tehran and other posts were interviewed. Later that month, before Mr Witheford and a retired senior officer, Mr R. E. Johns, had been interviewed about the allegations, a Press item appeared to the effect that Mr Bowden had been cleared by the Finance team. According to the Press, that leak was subsequently confirmed later that day by a Foreign Affairs spokesman. The conclusions in that leaked interim report seemed to be exactly the same as those contained in the final report before the Senate as of the week before last.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the conclusions of that report were written before the investigation commenced. Apart from the fact that its conclusions had become public before it had interviewed two of the main people involved, the Finance inquiry gave several Foreign Affairs officers reason for concern. This is outlined in the note by Mr Witheford which appears in the appendices to the Finance report. This points towards the following reasons for suspicion as to the bona fides of the Finance investigation: Firstly, several misleading draft records of interviews with witnesses prepared by Finance were heavily biased in Mr Bowden's favour; secondly, a total lack of work on the cover-up allegations; thirdly, the refusal by Foreign Affairs-that is, Mr Henderson-to give witnesses, Mr Witheford and Mr Henne in particular, access to relevant documentation; the apparent 'loss' by Foreign Affairs of important files, of a letter concerning the Tehran scandal received by Mr Renouf, the then departmental head, from Mr Witheford in 1975 and some of the Henderson-Bowden correspondence regarding Tehran; fourthly, the team's apparent lack of interest in pursuing obvious leads ; and, fifthly, occasional instances of hostility by one of the team members apparently designed to daunt interviewees. </PARA>
<PARA> Before considering each of the allegations against Mr Bowden in detail, I want to comment briefly on the involvement in this matter of the Australian Federal Police. There is no doubt-the police tapes of interviews with witnesses will help prove it-that the police sergeants conducting the investigation based on this hopelessly dishonest Finance report had been told to endorse that document. In doing so, they would seem to have been pressured from on high to adopt dirty tactics aimed at forcing Mr Witheford and even his wife to withdraw or modify evidence. As Mr Street said, this disturbing aspect of the affair is now in the hands of the Ombudsman, Professor Richardson, and the Australian Federal Police internal investigation group. We will doubtless be hearing more of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Having treated voluntary witnesses to Mr Bowden's activities in this illegal manner, the police reported back to Mr Henderson in terms which would no doubt have gratified him. Indeed, the advice of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) to Mr Street mirrored the misconduct of his police officers in that he stated that Mr Witheford possesses no evidence and implied, falsely I believe, that other witnesses had withdrawn evidence under Australian Federal Police questioning. We should remember that all the evidence available to Mr Witheford had been sent to Mr Street as long ago as early April and elaborated upon in subsequent interviews with the Department of Finance and the Australian Federal Police fraud squad. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Newman's assertion that 'there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that Mr Bowden acted in an improper manner, let alone criminally', leaves me speechless; but only for a moment. That the police believed it to be both appropriate and necessary to misbehave in the way that they did is clear evidence that the senior police and the Foreign Affairs staff handling the cover up had, for some reason, pressed the panic button. I am confident that this error of judgment will prove to be the undoing of those involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have the time to respond to all Mr Street's points in detail. In any case, these could be dealt with more effectively in a less hurried way by perhaps the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, were this Parliament to deem it wise to put this matter before it. The relevant Estimates committees might also usefully raise some of these matters in their hearings. However, I think it is both necessary and appropriate for me to cover briefly the various known activities in which Mr Bowden engaged, if only to redress the obviously distorted way in which the Finance report purports to clear him. I exposed some of these malpractices in the Senate on 29 April and each of them appears to be well based. My estimate then of $10,000 to $15,000 being embezzled by Mr Bowden would now appear to have been pretty close to the mark. I shall now go into the specific areas where I originally made some allegations. Others were unknown to me at the time but have been brought to my attention since then. </PARA>
<PARA> The first allegation concerns the nanny's fare. Let me make it abundantly clear that Mr Bowden intentionally arranged matters so that the High Commission in London paid the full bill for his nanny's fare. The amount he almost got away with was substantial, equal to several months' livelihood for an unemployed man or woman. Anyone with the time to do so should look at the Finance report, particularly at Mr Johns's notes written at that time, and at the obvious reluctance to take disciplinary action on the part of several very senior people , including the man who told the Department of Finance that he did not now recall the incident. No amount of red herrings can obscure the fact that Mr Bowden was caught redhanded and admitted his guilt by repaying the large sum involved. As the then head of the Finance Branch of the Department of Foreign Affairs wrote on 26 September 1960:</PARA>
<PARA> I now query whether there has been a like transaction previously. </PARA>
<PARA>Leaving aside the Hong Kong irregularity, I now wish to cover the various irregularities or embezzlements-call them what you will-in Tehran. I think it must be clearly understood that Canberra was well aware that there were problems in the Tehran Embassy. Having visited Tehran on a parliamentary delegation in 1973, I am very much aware of the problems which existed at that time in the Tehran Embassy. As a result of formal complaints from the Department of Trade and Resources and informal expressions of concern to Canberra friends by several staff at the Embassy, it was decided to conduct a post-liaison visit in late 1975 to see what was wrong and to fix it up. Who turned out to be the visiting inspector? It was none other than Mr Henderson, the head of the Management and Foreign Service Division, who made only a slight pretence of evenhandedness. He stayed with Mr Bowden throughout the visit and conducted interviews with all Embassy staff, most of whom were courageous enough-or was it foolhardy-to speak frankly to him. Thereafter he conducted frequent private correspondence with Mr Bowden and, at the request of the latter, terminated the postings of the second in command, Mr Witheford, and the Senior Administrative Officer, Mr Henne, both of whom had clashed with Mr Bowden on official and other questions. At that time the Administrative Attache, Mr F. F. Sergi, after a serious clash with Mr Bowden , asked Mr Henderson to bring him home also. However, since Mr Henderson doubted even his expert ability to keep the lid on things if a third man were to be brought back to Canberra, he denied Mr Sergi's request. From 1975 onwards to this very hour, Mr Henderson and a few of his colleagues have worked tirelessly to prevent Mr Bowden's exposure. He would never have been exposed if I had not raised the matter in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the various techniques which Mr Bowden employed. I refer to the payment of children. All staff in the Embassy were entitled to gardening and snow clearing services at Embassy expense. Mr Bowden employed free of charge a large retinue of obviously underemployed servants, including not one, but two gardeners. The Embassy was thus providing more than adequately for any snow clearing that was required. It should be pointed out here that any person who thinks that they can garden in Tehran in the middle of winter should think again . Obviously the gardeners would be underemployed in that capacity during the middle of winter when the place is covered with snow. Nevertheless, Mr Bowden forced Embassy staff to pay him, winter after winter, for money he claimed he had paid to his sons for snow clearing. The first officer to actually refuse to pay Mr Bowden was the Senior Administrative Officer, Mr Henne, who had been ordered back to Canberra by Mr Henderson. Contrary to the misleading assertions in the report from the Department of Finance, Mr Sergi also then refused to sign a snow clearing voucher as the officer incurring the expense. Mr Bowden immediately relieved Mr Sergi of his financial delegation, replacing him with a more flexible officer who paid those and all future snow clearing claims. The evidence for the assertions in my last two sentences is contained in a letter to the Australian Federal Police dated 16 August 1982. I seek the permission of the Senate to have that letter incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>16 August 1982</PARA>
<PARA>Det. Sgt. M. Lucas,</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Federal Police Headquarters,</PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA CITY. </PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> In the course of my conversation with you and Mr Wallace on 13 August I expressed concern that the Finance Report on the Tehran embezzlement allegations had not included some key documents originated by me. (I had already provided you with a copy of my submission of 8 April 1982 to Minister Street.) I now attach copies of my minute of 22 March 1982 to Mr R. J. Smith (copied to Minister Street) and my letter of 9 July 1982 to Mr M. Woolley (with attachment) concerning serious errors in the Department of Finance's handling of this matter . </PARA>
<PARA> My wife and I are most concerned at certain aspects of the separate interviews you conducted with us on 13 August. The only one I raise in this letter is the allegations made by you and Mr Wallace that Messrs. Johns, Henne and F. Sergi, under your questioning, had withdrawn or amended certain of their previous statements (both written and oral) concerning the Tehran and related irregularities. With respect, I do not accept what my wife and I were told in this regard and wish to draw some related allegations to your attention. </PARA>
<PARA> (i) I attach a copy of a letter dated 24 October 1982 to the Chairman, Promotions Appeal Committee. This letter was prepared in consultation with Mr Henne and at his request and a copy is held by ACOA. You will note that it covers the question of corruption involving Australia-based staff at the Embassy . </PARA>
<PARA>(ii) In the Finance Report there is a denial of my allegation that Mr Sergi was relieved of his financial delegation following a clash over a snowclearing payment. I confirm my recollection and have turned up two relevant letters from Mr Sergi. In his letter of 22 February 1976 to me he advised: ''I am no longer officer incurring expense, Harris is both O.I.E. and C.O., i.e. only his signature appears on the voucher.'' In his letter of 23 March 1976 to Mr Henne ( which he asked be shown to me) Mr Sergi stated in part: ''They've fixed it that Harris is both officer incurring expense and certifying officer so I don't have anything to do with accounts in effect. The boss is still claiming snowclearing for his kid and Harris has paid them all.''</PARA>
<PARA> I expect to be in touch with you again very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SO7">Senator PRIMMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has also been alleged that Mr Bowden would obtain money for snow clearing after very light snow falls. Here again, the amount of money embezzled would be enough to cover the living costs of an unemployed Australian for a couple of months. I now deal with the purchase of air tickets. Mr Bowden was a senior officer in the relevant branch of the Public Service Board in 1968 when these income test arrangements were introduced. What I am saying in effect is that Mr Bowden would know the regulation backwards. Accordingly his failure to declare the very substantial incomes of his children was obviously intentional and aimed at getting free air tickets from the taxpayers for his family. We are told by the Department of Finance that the Department of Foreign Affairs-meaning Mr Henderson-can find no evidence that Mr Bowden actually told the Department that his children had no income. Perhaps there are many more files missing than we realised. Again, the red herring in the report of the Department of Finance must be stripped away and Mr Bowden presented with a bill for the thousands of dollars dishonestly spent on these air fares. The Department of Finance, apparently deliberately, is very coy about the income of these children, but it is obvious that they are very wealthy young people. We must insist that all the lurid details of their incomes, including their 'snow job' incomes, be tabled in full. It may well be that tax has been evaded on this Tehran money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to wages paid to servants, this is the only irregularity where apparently genuine new evidence in Mr Bowden's favour has been put forward. The witness concerned is an officer very close to Mr Henderson. I think we need an explanation as to why there is no record of interview with that man and also as to where all the documents kept in a metal box are filed. This is a matter which the Public Accounts Committee could investigate for us. </PARA>
<PARA> I deal with the misuse of cars. I think it is now generally accepted that the misuse of cars did occur, in particular with a guest of Mr Bowden's-by one account, his cousin-for weeks on end. Mr Bowden's statement in appendix 20 of the Finance report that none of his visitors had been authorised to use an official vehicle for as much as a day, let alone for weeks, is, I believe, a barefaced lie. But then a very senior man who had served with Mr Bowden at another post recently stated, with some heat, that he would be happy to pay his own fare to Canberra to tell Mr Street that Mr Bowden is a professional liar. Large chauffered Mercedes do not come cheaply. The actual costs incurred must once again be left to the Public Accounts Committee or perhaps to the relevant Senate Estimates committee. Contrary to the misleading Finance assertion, Sir William McMahon did complain to Mr Bowden who reported the matter to Canberra- presumably to Mr Henderson. Presumably, there is another missing file. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the representation allowance, according to the Department of Finance Mr Bowden may have been unduly secretive about his representation allowance files. It is clear to me that this was because he was padding the expenditure reports which he sent to Canberra where they were processed without a murmur by subordinates of Mr Henderson. According to Appendix cc of the Finance report, he obviously claimed falsely for the costs of extra servants who were a figment of his imagination. Neither the former technique nor the allegation concerning excessive claims for liquor costs have been examined by the Department of Finance, perhaps because they were too hard. Again, that is another matter for possible action by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. If that is the case that Committee must be given full access to all files and witnesses. According to my information Mr Bowden could well have received roughly $20,000 tax free for representation, so the amount falsely vouched could be fairly large. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to further irregularities, I suggest that the Senate address itself to Appendix ee of the Finance report which provides clear evidence about these irregularities. However, the report seeks to obscure the fact that Mr Bowden wilfully submitted false Treasury regulation 132 certificates in order to keep Canberra in the dark about the state of the Embassy's finances. Attempts to justify Mr Bowden's acts by affirming that some other ambassadors were also dishonest in this way, or by trying to blame other officers at the Embassy, should be dismissed, in my view, as unworthy of credence. Mr Bowden routinely submitted false certificates, which is a serious offence, involving a possible gaol sentence under the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the fraudulent conversion of a cheque in Hong Kong. This action resulted in the loss of $8,734.99 of taxpayers' money in 1972-73. While there is a mass of documentation provided about this irregularity, one gains the impression that the Hong Kong and Australian police investigators did not treat the Australian staff of the Australian Commission as potential suspects. Furthermore, the Department of Finance records a number of interviewees as being strongly of the view that Mr Bowden could not have been responsible for the fraud. But why take up the Senate's valuable time in discussing this matter since Mr Street told us in his statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The fraudulent conversion occurred before Mr Bowden's arrival at the post. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words the Minister for Foreign Affairs provides an alibi for his 'loyal and dedicated public servant, who has served successive governments with great distinction for over 30 years'. Mr Street provides Mr Bowden with an alibi; therefore he could not have been involved in defrauding the people of Australia of over $8,700. That alibi is totally false. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has yet again been caught out purveying lies to the Parliament. Let me explain: According to documents tabled by the Minister for Finance that cheque was drawn in Hong Kong on 20 October 1972 and fraudulently converted shortly thereafter. According to Mr Street's Department's statement of service Mr Bowden arrived in Hong Kong on 10 May 1972, if one believes page 25 of the report, or on 6 June 1972 if one prefers to believe page 129. I never cease to be amazed by the elasticity of facts in the Department of Foreign Affairs. According to page 163 of that statement, Mr Curtis was appointed to fill Mr Bowden's position in Canberra on 1 July 1972. Therefore, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr Bowden assumed charge of the Australian High Commission in Hong Kong at least four months and two weeks before that cheque for $8,734.99 was drawn. </PARA>
<PARA> Why would Mr Street have us believe otherwise? Before the trail gets any colder there must be a thorough on-the-spot investigation of this fraud, not by Mr Henderson but by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts with appropriate police assistance. I have in mind proposing that either the Victorian or New South Wales police be invited to participate in this inquiry. (Extension of time granted). In my view both Mr Street and the Minister for Finance stand convicted of having wilfully misled Parliament after six months of investigation of these frauds. The proper course for them to take is clear. Although honourable senators are only too well aware that the threshold of ministerial responsibility accepted by this Government is now lower than the proverbial snake's belly, as I urged four months ago Mr Henderson and Mr Bowden must be suspended immediately, if only to prevent them from designing, engineering and implementing yet another cover-up operation. There must be no more missing files , pressured witnesses and ostracism of honest officers in the Department of Foreign Affairs. The careers of these men who have been harmed by the cover-up of the Tehran affair for the past seven years must be restored without delay. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report the Minister for Foreign Affairs put down the week before last he stated that I-Senator Primmer-must now ask myself a serious question: Have my actions been consistent with the standards expected of a member of this Parliament? I demand that those members of the Government implicated in this affair put that question to themselves. I think any honourable senator will agree that for sure Mr Street has been hoisted on his own petard. </PARA>
<PARA> This has not been an easy matter to bring forward. I believed at the time that I was on to something that was being hidden. I believed honest officers in the Department of Foreign Affairs were being stymied and repressed and having all sorts of malicious rumours spread about them. I believe that many people in Canberra are of the opinion that some of these honest officers are now mentally upset, disturbed and what not. But I have it on good authority from other people who have known them for years that there is nothing wrong with their mental capacity whatsoever. This is part of a giant smear campaign by people at the top to cover up for their buddies, mates and friends at the expense of honest people . I believe I would have been remiss in my duty as a citizen and as a senator of this place, representing the great bulk of the electors in Victoria-as it turned out after the last election-were I not to air this matter as I have done today. I think the ball is back in the court of the Department, the Government and particularly Mr Street. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) A Japanese owned company did purchase such a grazing property near Gympie, Queensland, in early 1980. The company, which already owned two other rural properties near Gympie, sought and obtained foreign investment approval for this transaction on a retrospective basis. The transaction involved a consideration of $81,000 and the land was purchased for development as a cattle raising enterprise in conjunction with the company's other two properties which were purchased previously. Cattle raised on the properties are owned by members of a Japanese club associated with the company.</PARA>
<PARA> The company subsequently sought approval to sub-divide the last acquired property for resale to members of the Japanese club. However, this proposal was rejected by the Government on the basis that it would not be consistent with the Government's foreign investment policy. The Japanese company involved has since advised my Department that, in view of the Government's decision, it does not intend to sell any portions of the land to Japanese or other interests.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am advised that since the Foreign Investment Review Board was established in April 1976, only 3 proposals by Japanese to acquire land in the Barambah electorate have been approved under foreign investment policy. The proposals are those referred to in response to questions (1) and (2). There may have been other small acquisitions of rural land in the area which have not been submitted to the Government for approval, possibly because either they have not fallen within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act or have been exempt from examination under foreign investment policy where they involved a consideration below the $350,000 threshold. (see also answer to (4) below).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Proposals by foreign interests to acquire rural properties which constitute businesses fall within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act and require approval under the Government's foreign investment policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Under its policy, the Government is concerned to ensure that foreign interests do not engage in property acquisitions of a speculative nature or intended purely for capital gain or investment income, without accompanying benefits to the Australian economy. Accordingly, proposals involving the purchase of rural land simply with a view to sub-division and sale to foreign interests are not likely to meet the policy guidelines. Moreover, in its consideration of foreign investment proposals, the Government seeks to ensure that rural properties have been advertised or otherwise offered for sale in a way normal for the industry and that interested Australian purchasers have been given an opportunity to bid for them.</PARA>
<PARA> On 20 January 1982, following a review of the Government's foreign investment policy, I announced that a more restrictive approach would be adopted towards foreign acquisitions of rural properties, primarily by way of strengthening the test of benefits from a proposal before approval is given. Under this approach, subject to possible interested Australian purchasers having been given appropriate opportunities to bid, foreign investment approval is normally restricted to the following types of proposals: those where the purchasers have firm plans to establish residence in Australia; those which offer significant economic benefits; and, where the economic benefits are small, those where there is an effective partnership (usually a 50/50 partnership) between Australian investors and the foreign investors in the ownership and control of the property . Particular attention is paid to the advice of the State or Territory concerned in determining whether or not a proposed acquisition would lead to significant economic benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> In the context of its foreign investment policy review, the Government recognised that, although acquisitions of farms are normally subject to examination by the Foreign Investment Review Board, irrespective of value, it is possible that some foreign interests may be acquiring small rural holdings which are no longer operational farms and which are exempt from examination under the Foreign Takeovers Act or foreign investment policy. However, the Government does not believe that it would be feasible for it to monitor such minor land acquisitions. Further, the capacity of such investors to make significant capital gains may be dependent upon the land being approved for sub-division or re-zoned for urban purposes. As this matter relates essentially to questions of land usage and as the Commonwealth does not have the capacity to deal effectively with it, it has been drawn to the attention of the States.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. As the Teasurer explained in the particular answer to a question without notice from which the quoted statement is taken there were a number of factors which, at the time, suggested that the pressures on interest rates had eased.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Fixed deposits (excluding certificates of deposit) with trading banks increased by $5,300m between December 1980 and December 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Total deposits with trading banks did increase by $3,466m over the same period, implying that other deposits fell by $1,834m. This fall reflected a fall of $2,124m in holdings of Certificates of Deposit during this period.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The rate offered on fixed deposits varies according to the length of maturing. At May 1982, the rate on deposits of 3 to 6 months was 15.25 per cent, that on deposits of 24 to 48 months was 14.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Reserve Bank liabilities to resident Australians (including notes on issue held by the public and by banks, deposits by banks and government instrumentalities with the Reserve Bank and credit balances of Rural Credits Department customers) increased from $8,025m in December, 1980 to $8,649m in December, 1981, an increase of 7.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No. The increasing share of fixed deposits in total trading bank deposits is closely related to the increasing relative attractiveness of fixed deposits to trading bank customers, especially since the deregulation of, and subsequent increases in, fixed deposit interest rates in December, 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) General pressures on interest rates have caused the trading banks to increase interest rates on advances and on fixed deposits. Hence, although it is true that interest rate increases on trading bank advances occurred at the same time as the fixed deposit share of total deposits was increasing, it would hardly be correct to infer that the one caused the other. Indeed, in the period since December 1980 the increases in the interest rates on fixed deposits have, if anything, been greater than those on trading bank advances.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The savings banks are the only other financial institutions which pay a negligible or zero rate of interest on current accounts. They do, however, offer a higher-interest Savings Investment account facility and deposits in these accounts have been increasing much more rapidly than deposits in ordinary accounts in recent months.</PARA>

Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts, adopted at Geneva on 8 June 1977  7.12.77 14. Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, done at London on 17 February 1978  30.5.79 15. Final Act of the World Administrative Radio Conference on the Aeronautical Mobile (R) Service, done at Geneva on 4 March 1978  4.3.78 16. Convention on the Celebration and Recognition of the validity of Marriages, done at The Hague on 14 March 1978 8.7.80 17. International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch- keeping for Seafarers, done at London on 7 July 1978  29.11.79 18. Final Act of the World Administrative Radio Conference, done at Geneva on 5 December 1979  6. 12.79 19. Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 18 December 1979  17.7.80 20. Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects, with annexed protocols, done at Geneva on 10 October 1980  8.4.82</PARA>
<PARA> The reason why these conventions have not been ratified varies from case to case. In the case of No. 1 it was decided not to proceed with ratification because the practical advantages to Australia of becoming a party were outweighed by the considerable constitutional and legal difficulties involved in giving effect to the Convention in Australia. The question of ratification of No . 2 is again being reviewed, but raises problems for Australian legislation. As to the remainder the legislative and administrative requirements for Australia to become a party are still being considered by the Commonwealth and the States.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's general view that ratification of as many multilateral conventions as possible is a desirable objective. Successive Australian Governments have, however, taken the view that no convention should be ratified until an exhaustive examination has shown that law and practice in all Australian jurisdictions is completely in accord with the provisions of the convention. To this end, a full range of consultations take place, at up to and including Ministerial Level, to ensure that compliance is put beyond doubt before ratification is proposed. The federal system in Australia thus means that progress towards ratification will be slower than in most centrally-governed countries.</PARA>

It was also agreed that uniform legislation to give effect to this should be enacted by the Commonwealth and all States and that no person currently enrolled as an elector should be disenfranchised.</PARA>
<PARA> To fulfil its part of the agreement, the Commonwealth enacted the Statute Law ( Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1981, Part IX of which amended the Commonwealth Electoral Act to make Australian citizenship the basis of the franchise. Under the new arrangements, which are to come into effect on a date to be proclaimed, non-Australian citizen British subjects who are on the electoral roll at the date of proclamation will retain their enrolment and voting rights. The Commonwealth hopes to be in a position later this year to announce when this legislation will be proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian Government has also enacted legislation to provide for these changes and I understand that similar legislation is being prepared in other States.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) This question is understood to relate to a suggestion by Senator Rae in his submission to the Senate Select Committee on South-West Tasmania on 5 March 1982 that consideration be given to the development of a nuclear power station in Tasmania. This suggestion was later supported by Senator Hamer.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Zeilder Committee of Inquiry stated that the Tasmanian system is not of sufficient size to warrant installation of nuclear generating units which are typically rated at 500 Mw or more to achieve reasonable economies of scale, this applies only if the Tasmanian system remains seperate from the mainland system. Should an undersea cable link Tasmania to the mainland as part of a strongly integrated electricity grid, this limitation may no longer apply.</PARA>

<PARA> Inspection of the ship's cargo gear by a Commonwealth surveyor revealed that it did not comply with the Navigation (Loading and Unloading-Safety Measures) Regulations in that safe working loads were not marked on certain chains and shackles and there was no evidence that the requisite periodic examinations had been carried out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) In the light of the recently announced Australian Bicentennial Road Development (ABRD) Program, it is necessary to take into account the overall level of Commonwealth road funding. In 1982-83 under the ABRD Program and the five year Roads Grants Program, the Commonwealth will increase its road funding to $914m which is $229m or 33 per cent more than in 1981-82. In 1983-84, when the ABRD Program is fully underway, total roads expenditure by the Commonwealth will be $1,208m, an increase of $523m or 76 per cent over 1981-82. These increases represent a substantial acceleration, in real terms, in the level of road construction activity.</PARA>
<PARA> Individual State and Northern Territory allocations for National Roads under the ABRD Program have not yet been finalised. However, indicative figures suggest that Queensland can expect $80.5m as its allocation for national roads in 1982-83 under both Commonwealth roads programs. This is an increase of $20.6m or 34 per cent over 1981-82. In 1983-84 Queensland can expect a further $108.9m, an increase of $49m or 82 per cent over 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> Works on the Bruce Highway will undoubtedly carry high priority in Queensland's national roads program. National roads programs are currently being developed for Commonwealth approval and details of specific projects will be provided annually to Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) No additional costs were incurred by the Defence Department in production of the first series of Patrol Boat.
