<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the general question of subsidies for western Queensland air services, Trans Australia Airlines is presently unable to continue to meet the substantial losses it is incurring on inland Queensland F27 services. This has caused considerable concern to residents, the Commonwealth and, of course, the State Government of Queensland. I believe this has been a matter of concern to Senator Bjelke-Petersen who asked several questions on this matter during the last session. Of course, those losses are not able to be continued or to be met by cross-subsidisation from other passengers using other routes in Queensland. I understand the Minister for Transport has visited these regions to discuss the problem with residents. The Prime Minister has also discussed the matter with the Premier of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Queensland Government has announced that it would be prepared to contribute $1m for each of the next two years to subsidise part of TAA's losses on operations in western Queensland. The Commonwealth is still currently considering its options on the future of air services and the provision of a subsidy to TAA, I understand, along similar lines to that which the State Government has in mind. I understand that no decision has been taken on that matter. I will need to refer to the Minister the details which Senator Colston seeks in regard to Longreach and Winton to get a specific reply.</PARA>

Did the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Sir Billy Snedden, on television this morning say that there was an arrangement with the Prime Minister that estimates for Parliament would not be altered without consultation between himself and the Leader of the House and between the President and the Leader of the Government in the Senate? Did Sir Billy say that in drawing up its last Budget the Government ignored this arrangement? Did he further say that after this incident the Leader of the House, Mr Sinclair, said the lack of consultation would not occur again?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I watch is the business of the Senate and also the functions that I am now about to describe. It so happens that the project that Mr Landa opened is one that is financed substantially by my Department and this Government. I did not see the show on television but I am very familiar with the Bonnyrigg Village project. It is a co-operative venture between the Commonwealth, the New South Wales Government and the University of New South Wales. Without seeing the project, I am aware that so far over $100,000 has been provided by the Commonwealth through the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council for this specific project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certain claims were referred to. The project involves a series of concepts. There is a solar concept and also a major conservation concept in the building construction and special designs of windows, walls and roofing. Senator Lajovic would know that this Government has provided special tax concessions for insulation of roofing. He will know that this Government has had discussions with the States and local government to try to get a common building code that will conserve energy. He will know that in the speech I made in this chamber some days ago on uranium enrichment, I pointed out that it was believed generally that an energy conservation of 20 per cent to 30 per cent could be achieved by general means, including these kinds of means, throughout the developed world without any loss of living standards.</PARA>
<PARA> This combined project is a village of 15 houses divided into three types of construction-standard New South Wales Housing Commission design, an improved standard public housing design, and new designs incorporating novel passive solar energy techniques. A number of similar projects are being supported by the Commonwealth Government, for example, in Tasmania and in Canberra. I think the important message is that in all aspects of conservation, whether it is in the use of natural energy, insulation, or housing or building design there is a capacity to save at least 30 per cent of energy. I commend that to all Australians.</PARA>

In view of the agreement reportedly reached by the dairy industries of Australia and New Zealand in the development of stabilised trading arrangments, can the Minister confirm that similar agreements will be concluded for vegetables? Can an assurance be given that no new arrangements will be made unless and until vegetable industry representatives of both countries have agreed on all proposals?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has assured the relevant industries on a number of occasions that it will not enter into new trading arrangements with New Zealand except on the basis of equality of trading opportunities, and that it will not allow Australian industries to be adversely affected by unfair competition or, in the case of primary industries, disruption of the domestic marketing and pricing arrangements. The Government has also said that final decisions by the Government on a closer economic relationship will not be taken until there has been full consultation with all interested parties, including the States and industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is implicit in the question asked by the honourable senator that industry involvement is clearly essential to the development of proposals for a closer economic relationship with New Zealand. I agree with that view. Officials have been consulting with industry in this respect. Formal industry to industry discussions have been taking place on wine and dairy products. There has also been contact between Australian and New Zealand vegetable growers. General agreement on the treatment of wine has, I believe, been reached at industry level. The basis on which dairy products will be brought into a closer economic relationship with New Zealand is still under discussion between the two industries. I expect that Australian vegetable growers will wish to talk further with their New Zealand counterparts about the implications of their relationship with the trans-Tasman trade in vegetable products.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me re-emphasise the Government's assurance that no final decisions will be taken on the closer economic relationship before there has been full consultation with the States and the relevant industries.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Social Security aware that youth homelessness is one of the major and growing problems in our society? In particular, is he aware of a report in the Melbourne Age of 5 August 1981 that it was estimated that there were 15,000 young homeless people in Victoria alone? In that context, can the Minister provide any information on the evaluation results of the pilot youth accommodation services program now nearing completion ? Can he advise whether the services provided under the pilot program will be discontinued at the end of the three-year period, that is to say, at the end of this financial year, thus withdrawing much needed support for homeless young people? If this is not intended, what arrangements are being made for a bridging period?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware that this year's funding arrangements have been inadequate to meet escalating wage and operating costs for a number of projects? In particular, the Westernport youth refuge in Victoria is facing closure well before the end of the pilot period unless bridging funds are provided. In view of reports that the Victorian Minister of Community Welfare Services, Mr Jona, is prepared to provide additional assistance to match any Commonwealth funds made available, will the Minister for Social Security give an assurance that he will provide funds to enable this service to continue until the end of the year? In the light of additional Commonwealth funds being the only resource required to continue the services offered under this highly valued and desperately needed program, should the Minister decline to match Mr Jona's offer will he accept responsibility for the closure of such places and for forcing more young Australians to live on the streets?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="472" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem of youth homelessness is one which has emerged over recent years. There were expressions of concern about it about three or four years ago at meetings of the ministerial council which were attended by my predecessor, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. Following those expressions of concern and the discussion among Ministers, it was agreed that the Commonwealth and the States would undertake a pilot project to examine the problem, to fund some purported solutions to the problem and to subject that process to evaluation with a view to having better guidelines for future policy action in that area. That process has occurred and we are now in the final half year of the three-year period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that there is a problem in this area was acknowledged by the Government at the time of the last elections when it was indicated that part of the funding commitment which was made under the Homeless Persons Assistance Program would be expressly directed towards youth homelessness. That was in addition to the commitment which was given to the Youth Support Scheme which was the subject of the honourable senator's question. That Scheme has been subject to evaluation. To date I have received only a preliminary report of that evaluation, but there was further discussion about the program at the Council of Welfare Ministers which took place in New Zealand just prior to Parliament resuming. In light of the then available information, the Council of Welfare Ministers requested the Commonwealth to extend further the funding of the Youth Support Scheme into 1982-83 with a view to providing sufficient time for the results of the evaluation survey to be studied and for governments to take decisions as to the future directions of the program. I have to put before the Government a proposal to get a commitment for funding for next year. I am in the process of doing that.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, I emphasise that this is an area in which I think policy directions are still subject to some uncertainty. There are aspects of the problem which are not fully understood, and the approaches to it are not fully agreed by the people who are involved in the field. Our own Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare is conducting an inquiry in this area. I had a preliminary discussion with members of that Committee when they met in Perth some months ago with a view to getting their early views. They have travelled around Australia and had extensive discussions with people who are concerned with this field. I am sure that their report will be a valuable contribution to our knowledge in this area. I think I can fairly say that they would not be promoting the idea of opening a whole lot of new or additional refuges. They are concerned that the sorts of services provided will take young people back into independent and self-sustaining life and not merely have the effect of providing shelters which perform no useful function other than to keep people out of the cold and the wet. So there are quite substantial policy questions to be addressed by the Government. I propose to address those questions in the context of the evaluation of the three-year scheme which is just coming to a conclusion and in the context of the Senate Committee report which I understand may well be received in the next month or two.</PARA>
<PARA> I move on to the specific problem about the Westernport refuge which was raised by the honourable senator in his question. The body responsible for the refuge has made representations because it says that it cannot continue for the balance of this year on the funding which has been provided. Recently some additional funding was provided by agreement between Mr Jona and myself from the uncommitted funds in that program. There is a whole series of programs right around Australia funded under the Youth Support Scheme. All of them have been provided with budgeted amounts for this financial year. In response to requests from the States the people involved in the Scheme have been asked to live within the Budget figure which has been provided. I saw some representatives from the Westernport refuge yesterday. They put their case to me and I undertook to examine it in light of the representations I had received. Needless to say, I have not yet given it that examination as I saw them only yesterday. The request they make has implications not merely for the Westernport refuge but for all the other centres which also have indicated that they would like additional funding but which have been told that they have to manage within their budgets.</PARA>
<PARA> The problem with respect to the Westernport scheme, in common with the problems of some other schemes, is that there have been substantial award increases and the budgeted amounts for salaries have hence been exceeded. That is a problem often faced in subsidy programs funded by the Commonwealth Government. But the fact is that the funds which were offered have been made available. The people who are being paid are now in receipt of much higher wages than was anticipated at the time the funding was provided. The Westernport scheme, so I have been advised, provides round-the-clock manning of the--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address a question to the Minister for National Development and Energy. I refer to the unusually high rate of power generation required from the Snowy River scheme which has been made necessary to provide power to bolster the flagging electricity supplies in New South Wales.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can appreciate Senator Jessop's very real interest in this matter. The water from the Snowy River plays a very significant part in irrigation not only in Victoria but also in South Australia. I can assure Senator Jessop that the important role of the Snowy in irrigation has not been forgotten and I acknowledge that the year to year vagaries of rainfall make any increases in electricity generation a matter for considerable care. I believe that the Snowy Mountains Council, which is chaired by an officer of my Department, is being particularly careful in this matter. The situation is, as I understand it, that for the operating year ending 30 April 1982 the Snowy scheme is expected to generate about 5,400 gigawatt hours, which is almost 40 per cent greater than envisaged in the operating plan of the commencement of the year. These arrangements include provision for pay-back in the winter of 1982 so that, unless there are unusually wet conditions in the Snowy region in the next few months, up to 15 per cent less electricity will be available from the scheme than would otherwise be obtained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From this Senator Jessop will see that the situation in New South Wales is bad because it has deliberately, in summer, borrowed against its future to prevent a breakdown of supplies in New South Wales. In particular, it made a decision to forgo summer maintenance which could put its generating system in peril. But as to irrigation water, the Snowy Mountains Council and this Government are very conscious of the need for the agreement to be fully implemented, and we will do so.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that Senator Walters posed is important because if in the decades ahead oil supplies should diminish as is predicted and we find more gas the ability to convert natural gas into automotive fuel will be of great importance. The production of methanol from natural gas is a well established technology. It has been undertaken overseas on a commercial scale for many years primarily for use in the chemical industry and, in fact, in the making of fertilisers. The use of methanol as a fuel or for conversion to gasolene is being examined in a number of countries. An automotive vehicle can be run on pure methanol. If this were to be done in Australia there would need to be some adaptation of parts because methanol does not like plastics and would damage plastic parts. But it can be done. I have seen a vehicle in Perth operating on pure methanol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most advanced look at the conversion from natural gas to methanol to gasolene is the New Zealand natural gas to methanol process known as the Maui gas process and also as the Mobil experiment. We are closely monitoring these overseas developments. As honourable senators know, we have commissioned a series of studies to investigate the use of methanol as a gas extender in Australia. The results of the first of these studies on methanol production from coal and natural gas were released in 1981 and are available to honourable senators. Quite apart from the technology and the cost feasibility of the matter one of the other questions concerns whether, in the journey from natural gas to methanol and from methanol to gasolene, there is a very significant consumption of energy and whether the net gain of energy in the end might not be great. All these are very significant problems. Australia looks as though it is finding more significant gas fields. Therefore, the use of methanol and its conversion to gasolene could be of very great significance to us in the future. We are closely studying the situation.</PARA>

It is the right of each government to decide who shall and who shall not enter into work in the country. There are difficulties in particular for Mr John Fraser who is an Australian citizen and wishes to remain in Zimbabwe with his Zimbabwean wife and his daughter.

<PARA>That defines the Western Australian situation. In addition to the safeguards contained in that agreement it has been made clear by the Deputy Prime Minister that the Commonwealth Government will put in place additional safeguards to ensure that Australian diamonds are correctly valued. That I do not take as a reflection on the ability of the Western Australian Government. I shall elaborate on that. The Commonwealth will engage an independent valuer who from time to time will make what might be called check valuations to ensure that the valuations arrived at by the Joint Venturers and the Western Australian valuer are correct. It might be suggested that the Commonwealth will be merely duplicating the actions of the Western Australian Government. However, the Commonwealth believes it essential, when the national interest is so involved, that we make quite certain that our diamonds are marketed at the correct market price. The Deputy Prime Minister has discussed this matter with the Western Australian Minister and there is an acceptance that the proposed arrangements are appropriate in Australia's national interest.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that this Parliament and this Government have a constitutional responsibility with regard to overseas trade and therefore have a responsibility of their own to ensure that what is happening is giving full value to the people of Australia. It must be able of its own accord, whilst being fully co-operative with State governments, to say that it justifies its actions. I will refer to the Minister for Trade and Resources the question concerning examples of export controls having a certain effect. It relates more properly to his journey in life than to mine. I will seek that further information.</PARA>

It follows the two questions asked this week by Senator Crichton-Browne relating to the Argyle diamond deposit. I remind the Minister of his answer on Tuesday to Senator Crichton-Browne in which he said that commercial interests' securing profits and the Western Australian Government's securing royalties would give sufficient protection to Australia's interest in getting the proper value for the diamonds from the Ashton Joint Venture.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two days ago I was asked a question along similar lines to this one in connection with the meaning of the decision of the Repatriation Review Tribunal in the case of Mrs Simpson. On that occasion I said that, in fact, the decision indicated nowhere that there was any link between the unfortunate death of Mr Simpson and his exposure to herbicides. I did say then that, because of the onus of proof in the repatriation legislation, the Repatriation Commission was unable to prove that there was not such a connection. Accordingly, as I have stated on many occasions in the past, it is open for any ex-serviceman to test his eligibility for repatriation compensation through the system. I have encouraged ex-servicemen to do so and I do that now. Accordingly, each ex- serviceman would be required to put forward his case in individual circumstances . I point out that individual circumstances applying to individual cases are quite different from those applying in other cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would be very difficult to assess some kind of general condition as a result of this decision or any of the evidence that was given at that hearing of Mr Simpson's case.

However, I point out that the Repatriation Commission is currently examining, as a matter of some urgency, all those cases which are outstanding and which have some reference to chemical exposure.

When that work is completed later this year some 580 kilometres or up to 63 per cent of the whole distance of the road will remain to be sealed. That sealing is expected to be completed by 1987. The last advice received from the South Australian Minister of Transport was that the 1987 target can be achieved without detriment to other priority works, provided the 1980-81 national roads grant to South Australia is maintained in real terms.

I repeat that essentially the matter would be a State one. Sovereignty over land, its ownership and title, is a State matter. I am not aware of the figures referred to by the honourable senator. I am aware of some concern by a number of people and organisations in Australia that there should not be undue foreign ownership of land. My recollection is that the Treasurer, in conjunction with the Foreign Investment Review Board, was looking at this matter in recent times in terms of whether the Commonwealth had any powers. I will refer that aspect of the question to the Treasurer and seek further information.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I take this opportunity to respond to a question asked earlier by Senator Primmer with regard to the fraud in the Australian Embassy in Washington. I advise the Senate that an investigation has been conducted by officers of the Department of Finance, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Australian Federal Police into a fraud in the Australian Embassy involving $US671,802. The report of the investigating team indicates that the fraud occurred on 7 December 1981 in the Department of Finance's accounting office in the Embassy.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Bureau of Investigation was called in when the fraud was detected on 23 December. As a result of the FBI investigation a warrant was issued in Washington on 28 December for the arrest of Mr J. I. Cowling. Mr Cowling, an Englishman, was a member of the locally engaged staff of the Embassy at the time of the fraud but he resigned and ceased duty on 11 December. There was no suggestion that other losses had occurred. The basic accounting system within the accounting office was considered sound and was adhered to by the staff. Mr Cowling was arrested in Greece on 24 January 1982. Action is in hand for his extradition to the United States of America to stand trial on three charges relating to the fraud. It is expected that the greater part of the loss will be recovered. The FBI has since advised that an accomplice has been arrested and that this accomplice has pleaded guilty as an accessory after the fact. The honourable senator asked a further question with regard to Tehran. I have no record of that matter but I will see whether I can obtain any information.</PARA>

The company undertook to fund capital works programs and to commit itself to future consultations with local Aboriginals. It has been the understanding of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that the local Aboriginal communities welcome the company initiative and the agreements.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to speak very briefly to this matter. Telecom Australia had a very big profit this year. I think it is important that that be put in some perspective. The Telecom report records a 13 per cent growth in business-that is the strongest yet experienced-a productivity gain of 7 per cent, which ought to be kept in mind when considering the efficiency of Telecom, and a total profit of $ 230m, most of which was made on the coastal strip from Adelaide to Brisbane in respect of subscriber trunk dialling calls. This is a matter I draw to the attention of National Country Party senators. They should keep it in mind when looking in the future at the question of cross-subsidisation of country telephone calls. </PARA>
<PARA> The Press, of course, always leads with the profit figure of Telecom which sounds enormous, but I remind the Senate that that profit is ploughed back into services and development of the telephone system. There are, of course, problems with loans, and attention is drawn to them by the report. Telecom is anxious to raise more money in loans, otherwise it will progressively have to rely on internal funding. If that happens as the report says, the rate of achievement in the country upgrading program to which we in the Opposition attach a lot of importance will be dependent on the availability of funds. I ask Government senators to think carefully about upsetting the present scheme of telecommunications in this country which provides an essential cross- subsidisation for the non-profitable routes in country areas. This matter was drawn to the attention of the Government by the McKinsey report on Capital and Policy Requirements for the 1980s. For that reason it is important that Telecom be allowed to develop into new profitable high technology areas such as videotex . That is something which the Government has denied it the right to do. I therefore ask honourable senators to apprise themselves of this report with care because it bears widely on a number of other issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>There is very deep and well merited concern about the loss of economic sovereignty, the losses both actual and potential; for example, through transfer pricing, which can accrue through foreign domination of industry. There is also concern among the community about the threat, either ultimate or actual, posed to our political independence as well as our economic independence. So strong is this concern that even the present Government has been compelled to appear to be doing something to control it, and the main mechanism for exercising that control over foreign investment has been and is the Foreign Investment Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board is probably better than nothing, but in our view it has been and remains inadequate for a number of reasons. First, it can be overruled by a government which is, for whatever reason, of a mind to overrule it, providing the government exercises political discretion about the timing of overruling FIRB decisions or specific foreign investment projects. We had one example of the manipulation of foreign investment procedures before and after the last Federal election. On 24 September 1980 the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced with a great fanfare that the Oaky Creek coal project, because of its proposed equity structure, was unacceptable and breached the foreign investment guidelines. With the election safely out of the way, on 5 December-10 weeks later-the Treasurer announced that the project could go ahead. That is one way in which the existing procedures are inadequate, because a cynical government can overrule them without a great deal of political risk providing it times its actions carefully, as they were timed in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The other inadequacy which I shall mention relates to the foreign purchase of land. The present restrictions provide that any purchase above $350,000 has to be subject to the scrutiny of the FIRB. But that scrutiny can be surreptitiously evaded, as Ralph Willis pointed out in a Press statement on 21 January this year , by foreigners buying land through nominees or from earnings by foreign companies and foreign people retained in Australia, or by dividing a specific and larger parcel of land into sub-parcels of land of less than $350,000 in value. </PARA>
<PARA> Another severe problem is the fact that some State governments are stacked with economic quislings or worse, the prime examples, of course, being the present governments of Western Australia and Queensland. It is very clear that firm Federal discipline is required. The will to discipline irresponsible State governments is something that has been conspicuously absent from the record of the Fraser Government. I will give two examples of grossly irresponsible State government behaviour, behaviour so irresponsible that it verges on State governments acting as agents for foreign economic interests. They both come from Western Australia. The first is the North West Shelf project. In 1974 an ultimatum was issued by the then Premier Court, that no Australian Government equity in the North West Shelf project would be permitted. At that stage, of course, it was still thought that the States may have had constitutional sovereignty below the low water mark. The same Premier who had vetoed any Australian Government equity in the project was quite happy to accept equity in the project by a foreign government, the British Government, through the British Petroleum Co. of Australia, equity which it had and which it still has. </PARA>
<PARA> But there have been even more alarming sequels to that North West Shelf project . It has been apparent for some time, notwithstanding the glib assurances of former Premier Court and a gaggle of other Western Australian and Federal Liberal Ministers, that the Japanese will not buy gas from the North West Shelf in the foreseeable future. It is fortunate, I suppose, that just this day it should have been announced in the Press that the Japanese are unlikely to buy before 1990, and there is no guarantee that they will buy even then. That has been clear for some time. The consequence, of course, of the failure to make any sale to Japan would be that the whole project would have been deferred-something which would have been a tremendous blow to the ego of the former Western Australian Premier and, of course, a severe political blow to the Western Australian Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The response of the Premier, apart from persistent attempts to deceive the public about the potential for Japanese gas sales, was to instruct the State Energy Commission to sign a take or pay contract with the joint venturers which would generate sufficient revenue to get the project off the ground with one production platform. That was done in 1980-conveniently just before the Federal election. It is now quite clear that the Energy Commission cannot cover its costs in the foreseeable future, the costs that it will incur in purchasing that gas and building the pipeline to transport it to Perth. In other words, the potential losses of this project are being underwritten by the captive customers of the State Energy Commission and the most captive customers are those in the household sector. It is being underwritten by the household sector of the gas market through the Western Australian Government. Surely, if losses are to be underwritten by the public, however surreptitiously, in this way the state ought to demand-I use the word 'state' in the general term-to have some equity in the project. Otherwise it is a question of heads the company wins, tails the captive customers lose. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to raise-I will have to be very brief-concerns Camballin farms which have been operating in the Fitzroy region of the Kimberleys in Western Australia. This is a subsidiary of the Texas-owned Australian Land and Cattle Co. It has been fiddling around for seven or eight years with an agricultural project which is typical of north Australian-North American agricultural projects-a lot of high-powered publicity, extravagant predictions and very little action. It was supposed to have planted 22,000 acres of sorghum last year but it in fact planted 7,000 acres, only 2,000 of which were harvested. </PARA>
<PARA> I will have to skip a fair bit of what I intended to say. The point I really want to make is that in December last year, when the dogs in the Kimberley were barking that this company was insolvent because its cheques were bouncing and it had not paid its staff for three years, the Western Australian Government pushed special legislation through the State Parliament to give the company freehold title to 50,000 acres of Fitzroy Flats. The alleged reason-alleged as long as six months earlier-which always had the ring of truth and which was confirmed by the action of the Western Australian Government, is that the Government's intention is to flog off the company to the Arabs once it gets freehold title. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise only because Senator Walsh referred to the North West Shelf project. I feel that, because this project is of very significant importance not only to the people of Western Australia but also to the people of Australia, I should put the position in perspective. I put it to the Senate, with the greatest of good will, that the Australian people have a vested interest in wanting to see such a project get off the ground successfully, not only for Australia but also for the people of the world. Simply denigrating the project is in itself a very bad thing for both Australia and the world at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me put the matter in perspective. The fact of the matter is that on the north-west coast of Australia there is a very significant defined gas field of great future importance. Indeed, as exploration develops the size of the field becomes very prospective indeed. That should be viewed against the background that the world, irrespective of the immediacy of the glut situation, is moving towards a scarcity of oil and an ultimate loss of oil, and towards a desperate situation in petroleum products with the need for gas and gas products to take the place of oil in the future. Therefore for Australia and for the world there is a need to get into place in the future projects such as the North West Shelf. I hope that honourable senators in the future will be looking towards constructive ways of bringing this about instead of destructive ways of denigrating it. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened is that the world, having reacted to the 1973 Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries price hike and the subsequent price hikes, has brought about conservation measures which have been very successful, particularly in Japan and America, and which have resulted in a considerable fall in the consumption of oil and oil products, including gas. There also remains a recession in the world brought about very largely by the fact that oil prices over the years since 1973 have created inflation and have absorbed the foreign exchange capacity of nations and therefore affected their ability to trade in things other than oil. The situation is that temporarily two things are causing a glut in petroleum products but that the absolute certainty is that in the years and decades ahead there will be a grave scarcity. We have the very great success-I hope everyone would commend it-of conservation both here and abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the effects of recession brought about by inflation and the absorption of foreign exchange. I hope that everyone would deplore that situation and would want to work towards ensuring that never again will oil prices or energy prices rise to such a point that they dominate the absorption of foreign exchange to the detriment of trade. Therefore, we need undertakings such as the North West Shelf project so that they can avert future scarcity. At the moment projects such as that on the North West Shelf, like coal and uranium projects, are having a temporary difficulty in that the immediate glut of petroleum, fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas and other gases in the world is causing nations to reassess, for the moment, their contracts to buy. In other words, they are sliding their lead times but they are not abolishing their longer term need; and that is the fundamental in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> One should be sympathising with the problems that the North West Shelf proprietors have, and the Western Australian Government and people have, in their present dilemma. One should be wanting to encourage the establishment of this organisation as fast as reasonably possible. One should also understand that on occasions we will be altering lead times due to the very success of conservation and alternative fuels. The success of conservation and alternatives has altered the lead times of synthetic crude production. It ought to be regarded as a plus and not denigrated. I rose only to put the matter right. In years and decades ahead there will be a vast need for the natural gas that will come from Australia and in particular from Western Australia. There will be a vital need for the project. The project itself is of an order of magnitude of $6 billion. It is creating jobs in Australia; it is creating a great resource for Australia. I hope that I do not hear denigration of project issue again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Foreign Investment Review Board is in many senses a handbook guide to foreign investment in Australia. It is quite easy to look through it and develop a picture of the state of foreign investment in our country today. Incidentally, Australia rates second only to Canada amongst the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries for levels of transnational capital penetration. What are the major features of this report? In the year to June 1981 the Board approved 1 ,172 foreign investment proposals while it rejected only 40. The Board has gone to great pains, it seems to me, to explain the low number of rejections. The main reasons given are the clarity of foreign investment guidelines and the advisory-I emphasise that word-role as opposed to the watchdog role that the FIRB plays in assisting foreign investors to get their applications within the guidelines. In this regard the policy of the FIRB flows from its being given directions from the Government that it should assist foreign investors to understand the foreign investment policy guidelines and to help them formulate proposals on a basis that would be consistent with policy. So Australia's national interest, which I and my party consider important in the Board's deliberations, is somewhat secondary to that objective. According to the report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Each proposal is examined on its merits and against the background of a wide range of economic considerations. </PARA>
<PARA>The most frequently claimed benefits are increased employment, as Senator Sir John Carrick suggested, the introduction of new technology, access to finance and improvement of management efficiency. There seems to be a large gap here, with which the Parliament should concern itself. Considerations of Australian autonomy, the effect of investment in one sector of our economy as against another, the broader balance of our economy, the dominance of the economy by a few large corporations based in a few countries and other aspects of foreign investment do not seem to be in the criteria or getting the consideration of the Board at all. </PARA>
<PARA> In the years 1979 to 1980 it is obvious that there were three main investment countries, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Japan. They continue to be the main sources for foreign investment. There was a noted increase in funds from the European Economic Community, excluding the United Kingdom, particularly West Germany and France. Despite the problems that those countries have with stagnation and slow growth, their funds are coming into our country for the purpose of higher profitability. Not surprisingly, the industries that received the most heavy foreign inflow in 1979-80 were mining and quarrying, oil exploration and production, oil distribution, commerce, finance and property other than banking and insurance, food, drink, tobacco, transport, storage and communications, chemicals and allied products. That is shown on page 25 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the trends in more detail, we find that there has been a surge in resource-based development and real estate investment. This rise has been accompanied by a proportionate drop in manufacturing investment, hence our difficulties with our manufacturing base in this country. Specifically, in 1974- 75 foreign investment in the manufacturing sector accounted for 43 per cent of total foreign investment. Other industries, which included those I have listed, accounted for 45 per cent. In 1979 the figures were 16 per cent and 62 per cent respectively-a marked change. These figures clearly illustrate the process of Australia becoming locked into an international economy. Let us have a close look at finance investment. The Campbell report, which is still being considered by the Government, emphasised deregulation. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A feature of 1980-81 was the number of proposals submitted in which approval was sought for the establishment of new finance companies and merchant banks. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear what the picture will be in the future. I turn to the regional implications of foreign investment. Figures on page 66 of the report show that foreign investment proposals by location indicate an uneven regional development . Basically, it seems that the resource rich States are currently doing very well. The figures on foreign investment by State show that New South Wales and Queensland are doing quite well, with Western Australia and Victoria some way behind. Victoria, because of the sheer size of its manufacturing sector and its significant finance sector, can still attract some investment, although on a per head basis it lags way behind. In the mining and exploration sector the figures are stark. Western Australia accounted for 51.9 per cent of all new exploration outlays. Queensland came next with 14.3 per cent. The regional implications are therefore self-evident.</PARA>
<PARA> If ever there was a case for national government intervention in regional development, this is surely one. We have only to look at the real estate sector, an issue which has attracted some interest in recent times. On the admission of the Treasurer (Mr Howard), detailed figures on foreign investment in Australian real estate are not available. He gave that answer in reply to a question from Ralph Jacobi as late as 13 October last year. The figures in the Foreign Investment Review Board report on this issue are quite damning. Total recorded foreign investment in urban real estate increased by $431.7m in 1980-81. The most significant areas were the development and sale proposals-capital gain finance activity-which should net foreign investors $439.4m in 1980-81 compared with only $81.2m in 1979-80. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be a genuine concern throughout the country about rural areas. The real situation is obscured by the fact that the Government has exempted real estate transactions of less then $350,000 from the need for foreign investment review and investigation. Detailed registration of foreign land ownership is therefore not made. There is a real feeling in property circles, however, that large gains are being made through the speculative purchase and sale of rural land. The overall data for capital inflow indicates that foreign investment inflows in 1980-81 totalled $5,625m which was much higher than the 1979-80 figure of $2,961m. The FIRB notes the concern expressed in many circles about the extent of this inflow and states:</PARA>
<PARA> Foreign investment policy was not designed to be an instrument for external economic policy, or for domestic monetary stabilisation. Attempts to use the policy in this way, apart from their very limited effectiveness, would require large and relatively frequent swings in the policy, leading to a loss of confidence in the policy by foreign investors. This could have potentially serious implications for the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA>This is, in effect, an indictment of the Government's position as stated in the Treasurer's Budget speech and in comments by the head of the Department of the Treasury, Mr Stone, that the public sector must make room for this inflow. The report of the FIRB echoes these sentiments. In relation to resource development it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The additional funds required for the increase in investment in the resource based sector will have to come from higher saving in the domestic economy, from lower investment in other areas of the economy and from greater reliance on capital inflows or from some combination of these three alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is the linchpin of this Government's economic policies. There has to be a diversion from our domestic requirements in order to make way for capital inflow-it has been done in the benign and rather inane belief that this will somehow create growth, development and jobs in the Australian economy-from countries whose own economies are such that if they have capital investment funds they ought to be invested in those countries. This would bring about the necessary and essential regeneration of those domestic economies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Reading the latest annual report of the Foreign Investment Review Board was a constant disappointment. Five years ago Sir Bede Callaghan was asked to inquire into the structure of industry and the employment situation in Tasmania. He produced a worthwhile report that made some points which were relevant to all of Australia. One was the dependence of Tasmania on large mining and manufacturing companies serving the international market. Five years later we find Sir Bede heading the Foreign Investment Review Board and doing his best to steer Australia on to the same course of development that he warned Tasmanians about. I was present at a seminar in Sydney this year organised by the Real Estate Institute. Sir Bede said quite clearly that his aim was to facilitate and aid foreign investment, particularly in resources, in this country. Again, in an address to a Citibank international finance symposium he said that capital will go only where it is welcome and well treated. Sir Bede has certainly put his ideas into practice at the FIRB. Between April 1976 and June 1981 only 1.2 per cent of nearly 7,000 investment proposals put to it were rejected and 3 per cent in the year of the report which is before the Senate today. Last year three out of five investment dollars were used in the acquisition of existing Australian businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party's concern about this aspect of foreign investment is well known. I will deal with particular aspects of the Board's latest report. The first is the continuing decline in the actual amount of capital brought into this country in that more and more companies are using retained earnings or debt capital raised in Australia to finance their operations. Needless to say, they still repatriate huge amounts to their parent companies. Unfortunately, anyone who looks to the FIRB report for details of this activity will be confused. The report uses dubious accounting procedures that try to show that the demand by foreign companies for Australian capital is not as great as it is. My own figures, for the year 1978-79, show that 65 per cent of new money raised by multinationals came from Australian investors. The vast proportion of this is debt, not equity, capital. The difference this makes in terms of control of the capital is obvious. However, the FIRB uses a rather strange method of arithmetic to show that only 47 per cent of the money came from Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to put this use of local capital markets in perspective we need only to look at the situation in 1977-78. In that year, only 18.9 per cent of funds raised by multinationals came from Australia. The next year it jumped to 65 per cent. If these figures are related to the total level of savings in the economy, it can be seen that Australian borrowings by foreign-controlled corporations rose dramatically from 1.4 per cent of savings in 1977-78 to 18.8 per cent in 1978-79. When these effects of the resources boom are combined with this Government's monetary policy the results are dramatic. Credit in other allegedly less profitable sectors has dried up. In the three years from July 1977 to July 1980 overdraft limits increased by 33 per cent overall. Within this general rise -a small one in real terms-some sectors did better than others. Agriculture gained only an 11.4 per cent rise. Finance gained a massive 61.2 per cent rise. Consumer credit has tightened. In fact, there has been a 21 per cent drop in the real value of credit to individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I disagree with the Campbell report on many things, its view of this crowding out of small borrowers is similar to my own. The Campbell report states at page 618:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the committee notes that, within an overall policy framework of monetary restraint, higher rates of capital inflow (channelled into resource development) might entail a lower availability of finance for certain groups in the community , such as small businesses and home buyers. This in turn might create some social tensions. </PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that via the resources boom there has been a dramatic increase in foreign investment which has strained the capital market. To prevent any benefit of the boom spilling over to the rest of the community, the Government clamped down on the money supply, thus throwing the burden of adjusting to the flood of foreign investment on to wage and salary earners, small business people and farmers. The FIRB, through its abdication of responsibility, has fed the Australian people to the financial wolves of multi- national business organisations. Although I am cricical of the Board, of course the Fraser Government must bear the full responsibility for the policy that is being followed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I compliment Senator Childs on a very fine and well-rehearsed speech with which I totally concur. I will be brief because my attitude towards the Foreign Investment Review Board is well known, along with the attitudes of other notorious critics of the Board, such as my friend Senator Tate, who-I paraphrase him-once described the FIRB as follows: 'In this country we seem to have, on behalf of the Government, a colonial mentality towards foreign investment which puts our political sovereignty at risk'. That attitude does seem to exist. I want my friend, Senator Martyr, who I understand will follow me in this debate, to comment on this. We do seem to have a colonial mentality; we seem to relish being taken over; there seems to be an adoration of and an obeisance to foreigners who take over our assets. I liked the expression used by Senator Gietzelt. He said that the Foreign Investment Review Board's report is almost a handbook guide to foreigners to take over Australia. It says, almost: 'This is the best value for any foreigner in taking over something in Australia'. It goes against my grain that taxpayers' money is being used to provide this sort of information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am critical of this report. I do not know how hard-worked the Board is but it took the Board from 30 June 1981 until 17 December-six months later-to place its report on its rather doubtful activities before the Treasurer (Mr Howard). It then took until the end of February for it to be debated in this place. Like Senator Childs I am critical of the FIRB. But I wonder whether the real blame should not be sheeted home to the Treasurer and to the Government because clearly the Board is implementing the Government's policies. I repeat for the record that last year 1,733 proposals were received by the Board and only 40 were rejected. I have spoken before in this chamber about the approval of applications relating to private hospitals. I think it is disgusting that foreigners are coming into Australia and making money out of the terminally ill and are being subsidised under our Medibank scheme. I find it absolutely offensive that this Government is aiding and abetting that sort of activity. I have alerted the Parliament about the incursions of foreign companies into the ownership of land. I was pleased to see some token action on this matter taken recently by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disturbed that foreign investment is now moving into uranium. One concern recently bought 25 per cent-which is the maximum amount allowable-of Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. It is almost sickening to read some sections of the Board's report. On page 3 it states, almost proudly:</PARA>
<PARA> Only a relatively small number of proposals were rejected in 1980-81-about 3 per cent of the total requiring decision. This low figure is a reflection of the fact, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> Some proposals were withdrawn by their proponents once it became clear to them that the proposals were likely to be rejected unless changed to meet the Government's policy requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>That is almost an attempt by the Board to have a clean sheet, to have 100 per cent of applications accepted. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Many proposals which would otherwise have been rejected were approved after modification to make them consistent with policy requirements. A number of the more significant cases were modified to eliminate features in conflict with the policy as a result of discussions between the parties and the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>What a cosy arrangement that is. A foreign company can come into Australia and say: 'We want to take something over'. The Board then says: 'That does not quite meet with the rules, but if you change this or change that we will give a stamp of approval for this and it will be okay'. I find it offensive that Australians- an officer of the Department of the Treasury is a member of the Board-are aiding and abetting people in taking over our assets. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> With other proposals, rather than advising rejection, the Board recommended to the Government that approval be granted, subject to the parties to the proposals meeting certain prescribed conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Board, on some occasions, said: 'Here is someone who does not meet the conditions and who will not change the conditions, but we will fix it up with the Government. We will recommend to the Government that it overlook that he is not conforming to the rules'. When one looks at the terms of reference in the front of the report one wonders sometimes whether the three gentlemen who make up the Board overstep the mark in their manic desire to implement this colonial mentality which they seem to have and which seems to be fostered by the present Liberal-National Country Party Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Investment Review Board has always worried me but for reasons different from those expounded by other speakers this morning. To me the Foreign Investment Review Board has always seemed to be a restricter and a controller rather than a help to free and private enterprise. I am surprised that others in this place this morning have condemned its activities because it seems to me that the thing for which I have mostly criticised the Board, publicly and privately, is the restricting and controlling facet. I would have thought that those honourable senators opposite who have spoken this morning would have been supportive of the Foreign Investment Review Board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any case this morning Senator Walsh was basically concerned with two matters . He alleged foreign domination of our resources and consequent political pressures. He alleged excessive foreign ownership of rural land. I have noticed that Senator Walsh never ceases to attack the Western Australian and Queensland governments. He never ceases to attack the Federal Government too, but that is his job and what he is here for. Indeed, with one or two of his attacks I have not found myself in tremendous disagreement. I think his attack this morning on the Western Australian Government was somewhat unfortunate when he highlighted some of the present problems of the North West Shelf development. The fact is that no one has yet denied that very considerable problems are associated with the full development of the gas resource at the North West Shelf. To me it would have been fairer if Senator Walsh had waited to see what finality of negotiations would eventuate before criticising what is now a highly difficult circumstance. I can understand his opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Something Senator Walsh did not seem to have taken cognisance of was the possible rearrangement of gas marketing which, with some small adjustment, could possibly give extensive profit as well as paying for the subsequent development of the oil resources in the same area. Obviously I cannot speak too much further on this because these are matters of quite intensive negotiation. They are factors which Senator Walsh, if he is aware of them, should have been fair enough to tell the Senate. So it is my worry that foreign investors will be concerned enough not to come to places such as Western Australia where we desperately need them. They will be put off by attacks in this place and in the other House. They will become worried that an attitude will develop in Australia amongst the people. Such an attitude has already started and been fanned during various election campaigns. Somehow or other it appears that the multinational companies and the investors of risk capital are not welcome in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia we are vitally concerned to keep up the flow of foreign investment. I do not accept Senator Childs's figures about the importance of local investment and the way that local investment is harnessed by overseas companies. My own impression is that we cannot get local risk capital in large enough lumps to do what needs to be done. I do not demean spending on gambling, booze, tobacco, holidays and home improvements; people are entitled to do what they like with their own money and I hope that they do it in moderation. But it seems to me that if this is where the money is going it does not leave much for savings and therefore for local investment. I think we have experienced this problem in this country for a long time. As I understand it, the main local investment is in hire purchase and housing which, of course, is entirely different from risk capital which we need for the bigger mineral developments. </PARA>
<PARA> I move from the risk capital aspect which I think Senator Walsh raised in part to some of his thoughts about land sales to foreign owners. I can well understand that people could be concerned about this. But the only complaints that I have heard were from local owners of fairly large rural properties in various parts of Western Australia who were not prepared to pay the going market price for large tracts of rural land. I did not hear any complaints at all from the sellers of those properties. I suppose that that is understandable. The sellers were satisfied with the price they got and, of course, those who were not prepared to pay the price were extremely dissatisfied and proceeded to find reasons to complain and somehow to blame the Government just because they were not able to get a piece of land at the price they felt they ought to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I think governments ought to be very wary of becoming involved in arguments which essentially are about what price is paid. It is not that I am without some understanding of the fact that if this situation is left totally unobserved it might get out of control. What are we really worried about in regard to foreign ownership? Foreign owners cannot take the land away. They cannot take away any of the expertise or other things that we gain in Australia. It seems to me that the tax structure as it is imposes a pretty solid levy on such investors from which all of us gain. </PARA>

I cannot see what Opposition senators are worried about at this stage. There is nothing to be worried about. We are the net gainers of foreign investment and foreign capital particularly in the risk area. I put to the Senate that the time is coming-I hope sooner rather than later-when we ourselves will be exporters of capital. I wonder-if some of us are still around at that stage-how we will react to the complaints that no doubt will arise in other countries about Australian capital and the alleged influence it is having on the conduct of government in those countries. It seems to me that this is one of those storms in a teacup. It seems to me that the reasons I have advanced for being concerned about FIRB as a restricter of foreign capital investment in this country rather than as an encourager have more validity than the worries of the Opposition about an organisation which essentially is its friend and not mine.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a few remarks on the report brought down by the Foreign Investment Review Board. While in some ways I could be critical of the report I believe that to have the report and some action is better than having no action at all. I believe a number of areas in the report could be tightened up and a number of actions taken by the Government. I do not agree with the previous speaker, Senator Martyr, in relation to the amount of land in Australia that we should sell to foreign investors. I believe that Australians should be very jealous of their heritage and of the fact that they should own their country rather than its being a paradise for foreign investors. One of the problems I see is described on page 33 of the report in a section concerning foreign investment in real estate in which the Government has exempted from need for foreign investment approval real estate transactions of less than $350,000. It seems to me that if we talk about $350,000 it is not a small real estate transaction. The transaction becomes bigger and bigger, not necessarily because of the amount of money being paid but because of where the transaction is taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, you would be aware of the purchase in Queensland of land on beach fronts and in rain forest areas where for $350,000 a foreign investor could buy, without any approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board, large tracts of land for future development. I believe no exemptions should be made for foreign investment in Australia. It should be a clearly stated duty of the Board to see that approval is sought and given before any foreign money goes into the purchase of land close to a capital city or where we know that in 10 or 12 years there will be high-rise tourist developments. There should be no exemptions by the Foreign Investment Review Board for the purchase of land that may be developed in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The second problem that I see in relation to investment is the lack of any investment portfolio. There should be a very clear listing of every purchase and it should be available for people in this country to view so that they can see what investment has taken place. We should put a figure on the maximum amount of foreign investment permitted in Australia. In my opinion that figure should be very low. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem that we face is that of nominee companies, and Australians acting as agents for foreign investors. Nominee companies provide one way for investors to invest in Australia without the Foreign Investment Review Board having any close look at the investment. In Queensland a Japanese investor sought to purchase further land close to the establishment that he already had there. He could not get permission from the Foreign Investment Review Board. A $ 2 nominee company was then set up in Melbourne and bought the land. Six months later we found that cattle on the property belonged to the person who purchased the original land and that some of his employees were working there. Surely controls over those types of dealings can be tightened up. We cannot allow the Australian people or Australians to be placed in a position where foreign investors can so easily get willing Australians to act as a nominee company to purchase land in Australia on their behalf. I believe that the activties of the Foreign Investment Review Board should be tightened up to show the people of Australia that the Board has the power to control foreign land purchases and investment in Australia generally. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>It is most unfortunate that today we have before us for debate a document from an extinct organisation. This is one of the many organisations which became the victim of the so-called razor gang. It is most enlightening to look at some of the remarks in this report about the establishment of the Council. I will not quote it all but I need to quote parts of it. Under the heading 'Establishment of Council' the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Industries Assistance Commission's Report, Financing Rural Research (1976), recommended the establishment of a Bureau of Rural Research within the Department of Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations of the Commission were to some extent anticipated in the Green Paper, Rural Policy in Australia (1974) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course that Green Paper was compiled and published by the then Whitlam Government. Despite the fact that it is often said by honourable senators opposite that the Australian Labor Party, whether in government or opposition, has no interest in primary industry, that Green Paper was prepared under the Ministership of Ken Wriedt, who was the then Minister for Primary Industry. It is now often referred to by agricultural people as their bible. Whenever one picks up a document which deals with primary industry one will see that the Green Paper 'Rural Policy in Australia (1974)' is often quoted. It has been a very valuable document. It is also referred to in this report in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . had suggested an advisory group to report to the Ministers for Primary Industry and Science in the Australian Government, and to the State Governments through the Australian Agricultural Council. </PARA>
<PARA>In the last paragraph about the establishment of the Council, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In August 1978, the then Minister for Primary Industry announced Cabinet's decision to establish the Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension as an advisory body reporting to the Minister. The establishment of the Council was thus a Commonwealth initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who have taken a long-standing interest in primary industry can recall the great hullabaloo and all the fine public pronouncements made by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) when he announced the establishment of this Council. It was a great thing for primary producers but it did not last very long. It was very short-lived. I wonder what the thinking of Mr Nixon was when the razor gang included the abolition of this Council in its recommendations. He could not have fought very hard for it, which proves to me that he was not very sincere when in August 1978 he made his grandiose announcements about the establishment of the Council. It was just a political ploy because an election was coming up in 1980. Once again we see that, whilst this Government is prepared to make grandiose statements about what it is going to do to assist primary industry, there is very little depth in those promises as in the promises that it makes on many other things. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very fortunate for primary producers that the current reference of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources is an inquiry into the Commonwealth's role in rural research and extension services and the contributions of those services to the development of the rural sector and the Australian economy. We are well into our public inquiries on that reference. As I said, it is very fortunate for primary industry people in Australia that at least a body is now looking at the Commonwealth's role, despite the fact that the Council has been abolished. I think its abolition was a retrograde step by the Government and I hope that primary producers, at the next election, will remind particularly National Country Party members that they have let them down and have not been prepared to carry out those grandiose promises which they made . </PARA>
<PARA> It would have been nice to have a submission from this Council to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources so that we could question members on the needs of primary industry. But unfortunately members of the Council cannot appear before the Committee with a submission, or represent this body because it no longer exists. As I have said, it is unfortunate that this is the last report of this body to be tabled in the Parliament, but I hope that some of the former members of that Council will see fit to make a private submission to our inquiry so that we can follow through some of the good work that they were doing as members of the Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention briefly that the South Australian Local Government Grants Commission is another organisation which was set up by the Dunstan Labor Government in South Australia. I commend it for the good work that it is doing. I personally know two of the people on the Commission, Dr Ian McPhail and Mr Gordon Johnson. Mr Gordon Johnson is well known in local government circles in South Australia and is a former president and councillor of Pinaroo. Whenever one goes to local government meetings in South Australia one sees both of these gentlemen. They talk to councillors and learn what they can in addition to what they learn in their official capacities and from receiving official submissions. They learn by word of mouth about many of the problems which exist in local government areas in South Australia. I repeat that this organisation was set up by a Labor Government in South Australia. It is one of the few organisations that have not felt the axe of the present Tonkin Liberal Government. Ever since it came into office in 1979, it has set about abolishing, at a very rapid rate, a lot of the organisations which were serving the State well. It will have to be very quick if it wants to abolish any more organisations as it is getting near the end of its term. Labor will be back in government at the first opportunity. My attention was attracted to the following paragraph on page 7 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA> With the winding down of the Monarto Development Commission and the annexation of the Monarto site to the District Council of Murray Bridge, as gazetted on 13 August 1981, no further grant will be made to the Monarto Development Commission . These changes should not affect the level of grants to the District Council of Murray Bridge until the 1983-84 grant cycle. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been quite a lot of discussion in the Murray Bridge District Council as to what will be its responsibilities for land under the jurisdiction of the Monarto Development Commission. A lot of that land has now been sold back to some of the previous landholders. I think the people of South Australia will live to regret the decision of the Tonkin Liberal Government to sell off this very valuable land which will be needed for future development in South Australia. As I said earlier, that Government has been too hasty in winding up a lot of organisations which were set up by the State Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The winding down of the Monarto Development Commission goes a little further than that. The Tonkin Liberal Government has lost control of the economy of the State, just as this Government has lost control of the economy of Australia. The Tonkin Government is selling off all its assets in order to try to balance the books. The Monarto Development Commission is one such asset. Although that Government has been able to boast that its budget has blown out only to a certain degree, when we look at the fine figures we see that it is getting money in by selling off those assets which belong to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> When Labor is elected to govern, either at the end of this year or early next year, the Public Service, the Highways Department, the Engineering and Water Supply Department, and all of these other services where people have been retrenched and equipment has been sold will be run down. The Labor Government will then have to turn around and find money to re-establish all of those organisations. Tonkin will get up shortly and say: 'We have a balanced budget'. But where did he get it? He gave away $30m of taxpayers' money by abolishing gift and succession duties to help his wealthy friends. He has to get the money from somewhere so he is selling off the assets of the State. This report of the South Australian Local Government Grants Commission refers in a roundabout way to the winding down of the Monarto Development Commission. As I have said, that is one way in which Tonkin is finding money to try to balance the books. But he has not fooled the people of South Australia. They are well aware of what he is doing. He will get his just desserts as soon as the people can get to the polls. The sooner that happens the better. South Australia is getting into a desperate financial situation, as is the whole of the Commonwealth of Australia under the jurisdiction of Liberal governments. </PARA>

<PARA>The majority of honourable senators would be aware of my attitude to the Standing Order which provides such little time to debate matters of great importance dealt with in reports presented to Parliament. A period of 90 minutes certainly is not enough for everybody to have a go. For that reason I will be quite brief. I wish to speak to this issue because in the foreword to the report of the Atomic Energy Commission, under the heading 'Advisory Committee', we find this:</PARA>
<PARA> Function: To review periodically the health and safety standards and procedures adopted by the Commission in the operation of its reactors and in the use of radiation, radioactive substances and toxic materials. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to refer mainly to that part which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and in the use of radiation, radioactive substances and toxic materials.</PARA>
<PARA>A town called Capel in the south of Western Australia has been using radioactive substances for land fill. This is creating a health hazard for the people who live there. I asked a question of the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) on Tuesday of this week. The information that he has given me is quite startling. He stated that at Byron Bay-he understood that the situation at Capel was very similiar-one would need to have something like 1,200 hours exposure to get the equivalent radiation of two chest X-rays a year. If we want to put it in perspective we have to look at what that 1,200 hours means. On my calculations that is 50 days. If one is confined to one's home for 24 hours a day that would result in 14 non-elective X-rays a year. In the case of a person who was working and was at home only 14 hours during the day and perhaps only 10 hours on a weekend we come down to six non-elective X- rays each year. In the case of a person who was working, who was in the home for 14 hours a day and who spent his or her entire weekends away-a total of 70 hours a week-we find that for every 170 days that person would have the equivalent of two chest X-rays or four X-rays a year. According to newspaper reports there are many areas in Capel where the level is much higher than that quoted as being satisfactory. A report in the West Australian on Wednesday of this week stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Inside homes where tailings had been used as land fill, the levels ranged from 11 to 223. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, 11 microrems to 223 microrems. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In the yards of 26 other dwellings, the range had been from 30 to 700. In nine vacant lots, the range had been 40 to 1,500. </PARA>
<PARA>Now 1,500 rems-even 40 rems, I dare to suggest-could prove to be quite an undesirable level. We have not yet been convinced-I do not think the people who deal in radioactivity are yet convinced-that it is only high level radiation which is a dangerous substance. A recent report shows that the low level of radiation causes much greater problems in the long term than anything that is considered to be high level immediate radiation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are matters in this annual report to which I want to turn my attention. I will come back to Capel at a later stage, when discussing a different report. On page 62 of the report we find the heading 'Major Overseas Developments of Regulatory Significance'. The report then goes on to list four accidents which are considered to be of such significance as to require tightening the regulations. One of those was the accident which occurred at Three Mile Island in March 1979. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> This . . . has had major repercussions in the nuclear regulatory scene, not only in the USA but world-wide. As a result, during the period under review, significant changes were made in the regulatory requirements for nuclear plant in the USA. These changes included design improvements to reactors similar to those at Three Mile Island, raising the standards of operator competence, and an urgent upgrading of emergency response plans. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1980 I put out from my office the third edition of a collation entitled ' Safety Record of the Nuclear Power Industry: Accidents, leaks, failures and incidents'. I am curious to know why, if we had documentary evidence to show that the first accident occurred in 1950, it has taken 32 years to tighten up the regulatory procedures to prevent, or perhaps preclude, an accident similar to that which occurred at Three Mile Island happening again. It appears to me that if we are, as we are constantly being told, going to enter the nuclear age, we have to ensure, for the safety of people in Australia, that our regulatory procedures are tight from the word go. This is perhaps why I have raised the subject of Capel. If the Atomic Energy Act as it stands provides-the Minister informed me the other day that he was responsible for radioactive substances-for the Minister to have that power, we have to ask why he does not have the power to prevent the use of radioactive materials for land fill, particularly in domestic areas where people will be living, working and going to school. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The clean-up and recovery of the damaged plant is proving a slow and complex task. The objective is the removal from the reactor vessel of the nuclear fuel, most of which was badly damaged during the accident, for safe disposal. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to question what the report means by 'safe disposal'. Have the people concerned gone to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission to see what methods it is planning on using for the 'safe' disposal of the very large quantities of radioactive contamination inside the containment building? I do not believe that scientists can yet say that we have discovered the safe disposal methods for any radioactive waste. In looking at the report we find that one of the other incidents related to Indian Point, Unit No. 2. In the document I have already referred to entitled 'Safety Record of the Nuclear Power Industry: Accidents, leaks, failures and incidents', we note that this is not the first accident that has occurred at the Indian Point unit. In fact, when I was in the United States in 1976 I decided as part of my tourist bit to see George Washington's place of birth. When I went to catch a ferry I was disturbed to find a very large sign on the banks of the Hudson River saying: 'Do not come in contact with this water. It is contaminated'. It did not say what it was contaminated with, but it could have been contaminated by the Indian Point nuclear reactor because of what is said in the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> On 17 October 1980, it was discovered that the floor of the containment building had been flooded with water from the Hudson River, which is the source of cooling water for the plant. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to explain that the water is used for cooling the plant and then put back into the Hudson River. It is no wonder that I saw many fish floating on the top of the Hudson River which had obviously been affected by the pollution. I promised my colleagues that I would not take my full time. I am sorry that my remarks have taken so long. My time has almost expired. In those circumstances and because there are other people who wish to speak on other reports, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand Senator Coleman's concern about the situation in Capel but I wonder, in all the circumstances, whether her concern is reasonable. An article which appeared in the West Australian of Wednesday, 24 February reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Public Health Department's radiological council said that though the background radiation-from tailings from a nearby mining operation used for some years in the town as landfill-was not high enough to warrant drastic action, it had recommended the removal of the tailings where possible. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a quote from the newspaper article to which the honourable senator has referred. It seems to me that the Public Health Department in Western Australia, regardless of which party is in power, can be trusted to look after the essential health and welfare of the people.

<PARA>The honourable senator gets concerned about things without any facts. That is my concern about the honourable senator's assertions about Three Mile Island and quite a number of other matters connected with the uranium industry and the nuclear industry. It is well known that Dr Teller, the world's premier nuclear scientist, said recently that he had nearly suffered a heart attack as a result of pressure to answer all of the unjustified assertions, allegations and lies- the scare tactics that are deliberately instituted by people who, for political or whatever other reasons, are determined to destroy the uranium industry and the nuclear industry. I do not care what motivates Senator Coleman. The honourable senator may have the best of personal reasons for being opposed to nuclear energy. All I ask, not only of the honourable senator but also of a few of her colleagues, is that they stick to the essential facts and do not give us these emotional scare tactics which are not profitable to her argument, which certainly are not objective and which do not help her cause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the question of future water supplies for Australia, for both domestic and industrial purposes, is perhaps one of the most important resources questions before Australia. The Senate has before it the Institute of Freshwater Studies Bill, introduced as a private member's Bill, which aims to set up an institute of freshwater studies. Whilst the Government will oppose it, the opposition will be on the basis that the Bill would use the wrong methodology; not on the basis of opposing the goals. I want to make that perfectly clear. The Government is second to none in its belief that in Australia, the most arid continent on Earth, there should be developed the fullest practical understanding and the best uses of water, whether it be surface or aquifer. My remarks will be directed to methodology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing to be established is that Australia, as everyone knows, is a federation. Entrenched in the Federation has been the development of six States which have a fervent desire that the water development within each State shall primarily be that State's responsibility. Let no one cause any doubt about that. We need the full co-operation of the States. There is in Australia, as honourable senators would know, an Australian Water Resources Council which is a joint Commonwealth-State ministerial body on which there is also representation from the Northern Territory. It has wide-ranging responsibilities in the development of water and in the research into water in Australia. Some time ago it established a specialist working group to undertake inquiries into the need for reform in research into water in Australia. It is acknowledged by all that there is a need to develop more expertise and co-ordination in research into water in Australia. The Australian Water Resources Council-that is, the six State Ministers, the Northern Territory Minister and the Commonwealth Minister- established this body. One of Australia's most prominent freshwater researchers, Professor W. D. Williams of the University of Adelaide, an eminent aquatic biologist, was a member of that group. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is not at the stage of being public as yet and therefore cannot be presented. The report has been formulated and is now passing through the officials' hands to the Ministers. But it is known, and known without qualification, that that group has decided quite emphatically-there was no disagreement on the working group's conclusion-that the establishment of an institute of freshwater studies at this time is not appropriate. </PARA>

I am not quoting in any way, nor am I able to do so, for the simple reason that, although I will have to refer to the document's existence because of what is happening, it is emphatically a private document until it is processed through the officers and the Ministerial Council. But I am able to state, and it is competent upon honourable senators to check with the States, that the States concerned are unanimous on their input into this general matter.

I am not able to produce the document. If I could I would readily make it available. As soon as it is available after the Ministerial Council discussion I will be happy to give it to honourable senators .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that one must start from the basis that one has an Australian Water Resources Council. That body has done a great deal of work over the years. Individual State water departments and commissions have been themselves highly expert in their work. Therefore, one can look with some real reason for guidance from them. What will happen is that in terms of research that body will report, as it has done in very recent days, to officers. That report will go on to the Ministerial Council in several months' time. The Ministerial Council will then, of course, make recommendations. But it is quite clear from the broad discussions which I, as the Commonwealth Minister, have had with the States that in no way do the States believe that there is an appropriate need at this moment for such an institute. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put the matter into perspective. The fact is that some months ago the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced a major statement which did not get a great deal of publicity; it deserved better. He said that the significance of water in both domestic and industrial development was such that within the course of the next year an overview ought to be made of Australia's water needs through to the end of the century. I do not think anyone would deny that. The Prime Minister has communicated with each of the Premiers and asked whether the States would co-operate in a major overview to derive information on what are believed to be the needs for water to the end of the century. There have been dicussions already among the States. The Commonwealth is at this moment in the process of setting up a steering committee. The aim would be that consultants would be employed. the States have indicated that they all have a great mass of information available to them that they would like to put into the study. It is believed that the study should be capable of being concluded within the next year or 18 months. For the first time that will give a national overview. It will help the States, the Commonwealth and also the Australian Water Resources Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has not been marking time. It has been taking progressive moves of its own. It cannot fail to be noticed that the most significant reform that has occurred in modern times in water usage and control in Australia has been the conclusion of the agreement on the River Murray between the three States concerned and the Commonwealth. That agreement is utterly significant. It is approaching its enshrinement in law. The Commonwealth has taken the initiative in doing the homework to get this done. The agreement is such that from the moment it was reached the States and the Commonwealth understood and supported the idea that its terms should operate instantly. As a result in Australia today the River Murray Commission has set into action the various measures necessary for quantity and quality control; in particular, a computer model has been set up to study the river systems and a large number of initiatives have been taken. Of course, the various measures derived from the studies by Maunsell and Partners Pty Ltd are being undertaken. A great deal of progress is being made within the Murray and Darling river systems. There has been a great deal of understanding between the governments. This has been a very good exercise in co-operation within a federation. </PARA>
<PARA> I take it that nobody believes that we should assert real or unreal Commonwealth power to act unilaterally in these matters. One must seek to act, if that is the case, within the Constitution and, therefore, by getting agreement with the States. Along with that the Commonwealth has been looking at its own current approaches to both water needs and water research. The Commonwealth's activities lie in a number of places. First of all, in my own Department, the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics has a very considerable knowledge and expertise in a geological sense in Australia, particularly with relation to knowledge of underground water and of aquafers in general. That is one of the existing resource areas. The Australian Atomic Energy Commission has a body of expert knowledge which is used in the tracing, ageing and measurement of water to ascertain whether it is a perennial source or a non-renewable source. That is being looked at to see how it can be co- ordinated. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, within the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation a multitude of research projects into water are going on. These overlap with other undertakings. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) has been undertaking a survey of the CSIRO to see whether there can be some better co-ordination and drawing together of water research, funds and expertise. Some thought is emerging that there might be two developments: One looking at quantity and quality and salinity control as the broad target and the other looking at underground water. They are matters that are starting to emerge . They are matters that will come together when we have the report and recommendations of the Australian Water Resources Council. It is a disability of the Senate and of anyone who speaks on this matter that one does not have a basic knowledge of how the report on research will emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to honourable senators that it would be utterly premature to reach a decision on the nature and shape of research without waiting for this report. Let us think of that. It would be quite unusual for a Parliament, in the knowledge that an expert body in a federation of the States and the Commonwealth has been at work, reached its conclusion and passed it on to a ministerial council, to say: 'We do not want to know what that expert body says; we can make up our minds regardless'. I put it to the Senate that that is beyond reason. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the working party was constituted about a year ago. It has taken a reasonable time to reach its conclusions. I am perfectly prepared to have this debate adjourned and not to finalise the matter-I notice that Senator McLaren shakes his head but I must make this point-until the time that the Senate has before it all the information that it must have if it is going to make up its mind. Indeed, if the Opposition is going to make up its mind on this matter without knowing what the Australian Water Resources Council, the six States and the Commonwealth will recommend, I say to the Senate that that is in breach of any kind of sanity, any kind of parliamentary process. I note that the Australian Democrats have made a strong stand in public that they will never reach decisions until they have all the information in front of them. I invite the Democrats not to make a decision one way or another today but to defer until the information is available within several months time. If it is decided not to defer then the onus will be on those who make that decision to say in the Senate why they ignore what is regarded throughout Australia, by the States and the Commonwealth, as the significant expert body that can give information on this matter. It is as though one were to set out to bring in the results, as though a commission of inquiry were taking place in the country and one were to decide: 'We will not wait for the report; we will bring in the results beforehand'. I stress that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before we can make a judgment on this matter, particularly in the knowledge that the various States and the Commonwealth have a general understanding about it which is certain to be reflected throughout the report and that they do not believe in establishing an Institute of Freshwater Studies at this stage, we need to know the basis of the evidence given to this committee on inquiry comprising officers and Ministers of the six States, the Territories and the Commonwealth. To me, to do otherwise would be in frustration of all the processes of Parliament. I make that point emphatically. No one who advocates the establishment of this Institute can, in the knowledge that the expert volume of evidence will be released in the next month or two, say in this chamber: ' Nevertheless, I will ignore the evidence for some reason of my own'. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that the River Murray Agreement has been put in position and is making great progress, the States are working very well together in a national water resources program. The Federal-State water research program is perhaps inadequate but the Commonwealth is building up its co-ordination of expertise in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Bureau of Mineral Resources, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and my Department. So much is happening at the moment and so much needs to be known about what is happening in all those areas before one can evaluate whether this institute is necessary or desirable. I ask: How can the Senate evaluate this matter without in the first place having the expert information from the CSIRO as to what its resources for research are and will be and how they will shape? How can anyone do that? It is beyond belief. How can anyone do that knowing that work is going on to try to achieve a sensible co-ordination of the research of the BMR, the AAEC and the CSIRO? How can anyone reach a conclusion without the necessary knowledge?</PARA>
<PARA> Against that background and against the fact that the Commonwealth has set up a Federal and State study in an overview of water resources from now until the end of the century, I say that the Commonwealth does not oppose the goals of finding a better method of research, of collecting data and of understanding water, surface and underground, in this country. On the contrary, considerable moves are presently being made to ensure that more and more is done. Against the knowledge that these inquiries are in existence and are approaching finality, I have to say that the sensible thing to do now is to defer the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat what I said at the beginning of my speech: In no way would the Commonwealth question the general goals to be striven for; that is, the need to undertake research, the need to find out more about water. They are acceptable. The Commonwealth is saying that in its view the way suggested is not the appropriate way and is likely to be found the inappropriate way by the States. Why would one seek to set up an institute if one is likely to find it opposed at all levels of government? Why would one not want to pause, get the reports and then look at them? If we all are genuine in our desires in this matter there is absolutely no justification for our not pausing for several months. Therefore I strongly recommend to the Senate that after there has been an informed debate on this matter the Senate adjourn consideration of the Bill until a subsequent time , until other information is available. As soon as the detailed information is available I will undertake to supply it to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the setting up of an Institute of Freshwater Studies. I believe that in Australia, as in many other countries, water will be in very short supply by the end of this century. Australia is one of the driest continents on earth and South Australia is the driest State in the driest continent on earth. Not only is Australia short of water but many other countries are running into the problem of water shortage. Of course, we are all concerned with problems of water pollution. Much of this has been caused by ignorance in the past. I suppose that all countries in the past have gone ahead without really studying the effects of what they were doing with irrigation. They have opened up new land without full and informed discussions and opened up new projects without scientific evidence being obtained or thought of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that in the past we have destroyed much of our country through ignorance. Because of the type of irrigation we have been using salinity is becoming a big problem in our nation. This is all because of ignorance. One has only to go up the Murray Valley to see the amount of land that has been destroyed by salination of the soil. Much of this has been brought about by flood irrigation. Had there been a study, probably 50 years ago, and had sprinkler or drip irrigation been used instead of flood irrigation, I believe we would not have many of these problems today. Because there was no investigation or study, much of this land became sterile. As I said, this was because of lack of knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is essential not only for South Australia, which is very dry, but also for all States to look to the quantity and quality of their water. I believe that lack of water of good quality will be a restricting factor in Australia's growth. Unless we can provide adequate quantities and quality of water in the future this country will stagnate. There is no doubt about that. I believe we have acted in ignorance in the past, and that must be stopped. Ignorance is no excuse. Today we have facilities to study what we should be doing and what we should not be doing. I believe it is criminal to allow the situation to go on in the way in which it is going. The setting up of an Institute of Freshwater Studies would result in a scientific approach to the problems. Senator Sir John Carrick said in his speech that this Senate would be making the decisions. I do not believe any honourable senator would be capable of making those decisions. I believe it is essential to set up a scientific body to look at the problems we are facing. That is all we are asking for. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the States have not co-ordinated or joined together. The history of this country shows a deplorable record in that regard. I believe water should not be a political football. All political parties should be looking at and endeavouring to overcome this great problem. It is for the good of this nation. To cure the problems that have already evolved will take many years. Through our political system we will have to be sure that ongoing funding is given to such a priority. I believe all parties should be involved. I believe it is only the scientific evidence that politicians will receive in the future that will enable them to act with security. I do not agree that we politicians should just go ahead, because we would not be expert enough in this field. To get experts into an Institute of Freshwater Studies is the logical way to go about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems are not only in the Murray River. They are all over Australia. Many of our underground systems are becoming polluted because they have been ill -used due to ignorance. We cannot go on in the future destroying our natural water resources. We are doing this now unfortunately. Over much of Australia there is a salt layer. Through ignorance we have taken off the deep-rooted vegetation. Nature provided for the trees that naturally grew on our land to go through that salt layer. When we removed the deep-rooted vegetation from the land we substituted shallow-rooted vegetation which has a capacity for bringing that salt to the surface. That is one of the problems that the whole of Australia is facing. All of this has been done because of ignorance. All living plants have a capillary action. If the deep-rooted vegetation is replaced by shallow-rooted vegetation, the salt must come up. Certain areas should probably never have been cleared or irrigated but because of ignorance those things were done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Murray River is actually floating on salt now; there is a layer of salt within a few metres of the bottom. When the river is low the salt comes into the river. This problem cannot be solved by laymen; it has to be solved scientifically. The whole matter should be looked at scientifically. We will run into problems. As I have said, we have destroyed much of our country. We have destroyed the quality of the water, which we cannot afford to do. I do not believe this matter can be left to the States. The Commonwealth Government should look seriously at setting up an Institute of Freshwater Studies. Such an institute could pay for itself because local governments, State governments and the Federal Government could be paid by various bodies for the research done by the institute. It would not be a great expense to the Commonwealth Government. If we look at the problem seriously we see that the nation can expand and become larger, but it is not doing so because of inadequate water supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> We have spent very little on research on water in this country and I think that is to the great shame of all past governments. We have to learn a lesson from our past. Listening to the States, I do not believe that they will ever combine to solve many of these problems. Time is very short. We cannot go on the way we have been doing. With every passing year we destroy more of our underground systems. We destroy our rivers. We destroy the land itself through, as I have said, ignorance. That is unforgivable. We should not allow this. The quicker we can set up an Institute of Freshwater Studies, the sooner this country's future can be secured. We can expand if there is adequate planning. Some years ago there was a study into the possibility of bringing in icebergs. Many people laugh at that. This country should be looking seriously at such propositions. It is not impossible, and we may have to depend on such a solution. We cannot allow things to go on as they have done in the past. We should be looking at many options for increasing our water supply in this country. But we do not spend any money on research. That is quite inadequate; it is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> We are a major exporter of foodstuffs and I believe that in the future we will have to improve our track record. The population of the world is increasing and will be looking for more food supplies. We should be planning for the future to fulfil some of those needs. It is not a question of feeding and developing only ourselves. I believe that we as a nation have a responsibility to others. As I said, I think that the way in which we have treated our land and our water is criminal. We should scientifically study the problems. If politicians are given the facts, they can make sound judgments. If we wait for the States to come to an agreement we will be waiting a long time. Look at our railway systems. They are in a terrible turmoil simply because transportation in this country was left to the States. I plead with the Senate to take the initiative in setting up the Institute of Freshwater Studies and to take a lead in showing the rest of the States that it is economic to do such a thing. I believe that once we have the scientific evidence before us there can be no argument against that course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has the responsibility for the whole of this nation . The quicker we can get on with the job the better it will be. I am not in favour of pushing the matter aside. I think we should make a decision. We in the Senate are supposed to represent the States. I believe that every State in this great country will face real problems before the turn of the century. The shortage of water will be a problem not only for South Australia but also for the other States. We cannot allow the problem to go on in the future. As I said, I hope that this problem will be solved by politicians who desire to do something for their country without taking a political line. We should by serious enough-especially those of us in this chamber-to say that this will be good for the nation. We should not allow the terrible destruction of our water and soil to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be talking amongst ourselves when we get the scientific evidence we should decide as politicians the amount of money that the scheme will cost. Ongoing funding should be guaranteed by all political parties because the matter is of such national importance. I believe that is the way to solve the problem. It should not be used as a political football. It is a great need which should be fulfilled now, not at some time in the future. We are a great nation. If we are to continue to grow we should have the capacity to overcome this problem. I ask that the Senate seriously consider supporting this Bill, which was introduced in the lower House by Mr Jacobi and by Senator McLaren in this chamber. I believe that it is a worthwhile Bill, which every one of us should support. Australia will only benefit from it. I ask each and every senator to consider the Bill seriously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating today the Institute of Freshwater Studies Bill. Politicians have not fared well in the public debate on management of Australia's water resources. Sir Barton Pope, in a recent and widely distributed paper entitled 'Water Resources-A Call to Action' said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Water resources-the nation's most vital resource shortest in supply in the world's driest continent is being destroyed by political unawareness, inaction or party politics . . . We want statesmen planning for the benefit of future generations, not politicians looking to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Jacobi, who sponsored the Bill, also showed little mercy to his own kind when , in his second reading speech, he added:</PARA>
<PARA> It is politicians that have failed to manage properly our water resources, and squabbles of power and empire have put at risk our most precious resource. It is time that parochial and vested interests were swept aside, and that effective, impartial and national approaches were taken to our water resources. </PARA>
<PARA>From a position of the damned and condemned-perhaps not unreasonably so-we are today considering this Bill to establish an Institute of Freshwater Studies. The subject has been of deep concern to all South Australian Liberal senators. There is much in Mr Jacobi's second reading speech with which I am able to concur and at times applaud. The call for a national approach to find solutions to a national problem has my support. The deficiencies of the constitution are used to justify the lack of a national approach. That is, to my mind, a shallow justification. It is difficult to dispute much of what Mr Jacobi said in his speech on the subject of '100 years of thoughtless exploitation of the River Murray system' and the state of jeopardy in which it is now placed. That is not to discredit the recent formalisation of the River Murray Commission's responsibilities in relation to water quality, determined after many years of failure to agree. No better example can be given of the inadequacy of our Federal system to cope with water research and management than the years of bickering over the subject of whether a commission, comprising the three States concerned and the Commonwealth, should have any responsibility for water quality . No better example can be given to justify the need for a national approach to a critical resource not limited by State boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Jacobi called for an urgent and considerable broadening of the Commonwealth' s role in the area of water resource management. He stressed that he did not envisage that the management responsibilities of the States would be pre-empted. What is specifically called for is that the Commonwealth establish a national institute to conduct research into specific matters affecting water management. Within that mire are two separate and distinct subject matters which are often confused in the public debate on this subject: Firstly, who should control and manage the water resources that cross State boundaries? Secondly, who should be responsible for carrying out the basic research upon which the responsible body can make appropriate management decisions? The Jacobi Bill sees the answer to the second question as the Commonwealth and proposes that the Commonwealth fill that responsibility by setting up a national freshwater institute. Neither the Bill nor the second reading speech of the Bill's sponsor provides an answer to the first question other than to recognise the constitutional difficulties, to state that the institute would not pre-empt the State management role and then largely to condemn that role as a failure referring to, in relation to the River Murray-fairly, I think-'the pathetic in-fighting between States bordering the resource, all behind the smoke-screen of ''sovereign rights''.'</PARA>
<PARA> The first question is really the major challenge in this whole subject and, of course, as I have said, it is not directly confronted by this Bill. The second and less complicated question is directly the subject of the proposed legislation. The South Australian Minister of Water Resources, the Honourable Peter Arnold, who has had a lifetime of involvement with the River Murray, better than most, distinguishes the problems I have mentioned. In the South Australian Hansard of 11 November 1981 it is recorded that he indicated his Government's support for the institute proposal, but distinguished between management and research. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Such an institute is not a management institute; it is a research institute . . . No matter what recommendations the institute may make, it will still come back , ultimately to the States and the Commonwealth as to whether those recommendations are implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>He sees the management question as the first and most critical and repeats the often cited problem of the River Murray Commission, that is, its lack of executive power to carry out effectively the work that needs to be done. He sees the institute as an adjunct. His approach, therefore, is that as an adjunct the institute, as in the case of any other body with a charter to provide research in relation to water resources, would have to be supported. It is not a dissimilar view to that of Mr Jacobi. He is putting up the institute as one way of achieving a goal of more comprehensive, better co-ordinated research in freshwater studies in Australia. He concedes, by implication, that the responsibilities and activities of the proposed institute could be incorporated within the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Finally , and fairly, he concedes that the measures proposed in the Bill cannot of themselves solve all of the major water resource problems facing Australia. This is, of course, a recognition that the more difficult question is that of effective management responsibility. On that question Mr Arnold supported the ultimate solution when he said, as was reported in the Advertiser of 24 March 1981, that the South Australian Government would welcome a national body to have authority over the total river system. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We would hand over power to a national body tomorrow if the other States would agree. </PARA>
<PARA>A similar approach to the question of management is taken in a good article by Paul Malone in the Australian Financial Review of 22 July 1981 on the subject of water resources and the difficulties facing Australia. In speaking of the Murray -Darling system, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> State parochialism has damaged the national management of this major resource . . . It is perhaps time to take the responsibility for this resource out of the hands of State Governments and place responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that Mr Jacobi's Bill could also make some contribution to a rational approach to the problem. Again, a similar attitude was expressed by Dr Sam Lake, senior lecturer in the Department of Zoology at Monash University, when, in a paper delivered to the Australian Society of Limnology in May of last year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs a national water resources policy which can assist, and if necessary, over-ride regional or State agencies. Water resource planning in Australia, State by State, is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA>On research, Dr Lake said:</PARA>
<PARA> Proper long term management of water resources and freshwater ecosystems depends on the sound, co-ordinated research . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Later he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Considering the potential resources boom, and the current events problems of salinification, catchment deterioration, pollution and a spread of exotic aquatic plants and animals it is paramount that freshwater research be adequately supported. </PARA>
<PARA>He argued that the research answer lay in a national institute but his reasons were not developed. Presumably, in the context of his speech, he thought that an institute would see research being less fragmented and better financed. Sir Barton Pope, in the article to which I earlier referred, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is to our shame that we have not got a planned centralised committee program of hydrological research and management. </PARA>
<PARA>He is, therefore, melding both management and research. He gave support to the proposed institute but gave no reasons. The message from this selection of quotes-from a politician, a journalist, a researcher and an accredited industrialist -is that the real challenge is the first question of control and management. Good control and management does, however, require good research. The institute concept is then picked up as the only alternative in the offing. There is not an attempt to analyse the proposal constructively but critically or to look in any other direction. But this is a responsibility that this Senate must not now avoid. Mr Jacobi's proposed institute has become a bit like motherhood; no one criticises motherhood. </PARA>
<PARA> An examination of the whole subject of water research was not avoided by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources in 1978 in its report 'Australia 's Water Resources-The Commonwealth's Role'. Whilst it might be said that the Committee ducked the question of control and management, it certainly dealt comprehensively with the subject of research and recommended a national water research policy and program. The Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs a clear national policy on water research which will identify significant areas, establish priorities and give encouragement both to public and private institutions to engage in, and persist with, practical research to provide a better basis for the management of our water resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended that the Commonwealth establish a national research program in accordance with a water research policy to be administered and co- ordinated by a bureau of water resources. The concept of a national water research policy and program was rejected by the Government although the Minister did say that the Commonwealth would encourage research relevant to its broad policy objectives and continue to use its influence within the Australian Water Resources Council to co-ordinate the overall national research effort. In other words, by implication, it expressed satisfaction with its contribution to research, both in quantum and direction. This, therefore, invites an assessment of Commonwealth water research support, an assessment of priorities, because criticism in the area abounds. Take simply, for example, a comment by Dr Lake, to whom I referred earlier. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Although research on freshwater ecological problems is carried out in Australia it is fragmentary and poorly financed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth contributes to water research in a number of ways. First, it does so by its direct financial support of the CSIRO, the universities, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Bureau of Mineral Resources and others. Secondly, it helps to finance State government departments and instrumentalities in research projects through specific grants under the National Water Resources Program. Thirdly, it provides funds through the Water Research Fund, which it established in 1968, which supports the research program developed through the Australian Water Resources Council. Fourthly, it provides financial support to the Water Research Foundation of Australia. In addition to its research funds, it provides funding for the National Resources Assessment Program to co-ordinate information on the nation's surface and underground water resources. </PARA>
<PARA> But the role, therefore, played by the Commonwealth in assessing research priority can be best described as indirect. About one-third of the research, on the estimate of the Senate Standing Committee, to which I earlier referred, is undertaken by the CSIRO. The Government contribution to the direction of that research would be slight, as it would be to that undertaken by various universities. The Australian Water Resources Council, as the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) said, is of course a forum of State Ministers, the Northern Territory Minister and the Minister for National Development and Energy. Thus the Commonwealth's contribution to the direction of funds allocated to the Water Research Fund cannot be great. The Water Research Foundation determines its own priorities and the funds going to research under the National Water Resources Program is limited. Thus the charge is developed that Australia's water research is ad hoc and fragmented. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears to be almost beyond argument that the Federal Government should establish a national research program in accordance with a water research policy . But once determined, the question is how best it can be implemented-through a national institute as is suggested by this Bill, through the CSIRO, through the other existing research vehicles or in some other way. The CSIRO has many strengths. It has an international reputation of high standing as a scientific institution. It has an established administrative infrastructure. It has the strength of offering expertise in so many areas related to the subject of freshwater research-land use, mineral physics, soils, irrigation, plant life, et cetera. On the other hand, it is not equipped and is probably not the body to carry out research in the areas of economic and social evaluation which would have to be incorporated within a comprehensive research program. </PARA>
<PARA> The national institute concept has factors in its favour. Mr Jacobi, in his speech, gave reasons for his support. Firstly, he stressed that research by the institute would view the river system as a whole and that evaluation of benefits and costs could be assessed by the institute from a national viewpoint. I see that as the strongest reason for an institute. Secondly, he said it would be free from governmental interference. I have reservations as to whether that would be the case and, in any event, question the merit. After all, the Government must take the final responsibility for management of Australia's water resources. Thirdly, he said that the institute would examine the environmental and biological aspects of water quality. That may be so, but that does not require an institute. Fourthly, he said that it could play a role in the rapid introduction of improved technology and practices. Again, it may, but not necessarily. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee, however, rejected the idea of an institute of freshwater research. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The physical nature of the Australian continent is such that a wide range of tasks of development and opportunities for research are present. Distances are great and there is a diverse range of climate and topography. If a central research authority were established it would have to have branches located throughout Australia in order to operate effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>More critically, why attempt to take a group of scientists who have a particular interest from a university or the CSIRO and set them up within another institute ? It gains nothing but tends to add a limit to the institute, that is, to the research capacity of its staff scientists. Probably the answer is to leave the scientists in the other institutions and contract their expertise; but then why have an institute? If honourable senators peruse the published list of CSIRO water resource programs in both water management and water technology they will find an immense amount of worthwhile work being done. Similarly the guide to freshwater research in universities indicates the not inconsiderable expertise and interest in the subject throughout our tertiary institutions. The individual contributions of the water authorities within the States are also considerable. It appears to me that rather than setting up a new bureaucracy when the research capacity exists throughout Australia we need better co-ordination and communication. In other words, we should adopt the position of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources which said:</PARA>
<PARA> The need in Australia is for an improved overall assessment and co-ordination of water research through a central agency. </PARA>
<PARA>That must be accepted as a Commonwealth responsibility in the national interest. The Australian Water Resources Council representing the vested interests of each State government is not the appropriate body for overall assessment and co- ordination of water resources in Australia. What then is required is a new body that can, first, offer guidelines for research programs that meet Commonwealth priorities and, secondly, assess submissions for funding for particular projects from researchers and institutions. The body may not be dissimilar to the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council, NERDDC, in the energy field. The water NERDDC would be serviced by the Commonwealth Department of National Development and Energy and could incorporate users, particularly local corporations which put into practice at the most basic level much of the research information, as well as the more obvious Commonwealth and State water authority and research representation. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly the Commonwealth must set the parameters and priorities within which the more detailed guidelines can be produced. My opinion is that the Commonwealth should be advised by a small council of the highest capacity. To again use the analogy of energy it may well be a water National Energy Advisory Committee. It was stated in the Department of the National Development and Energy annual report for 1980-81 that the National Energy Advisory Committee was established to advise on energy matters and to assist in the formulation and development of a national energy policy for Australia. That appears to be just what is needed for water. The same publication also stated that NERDDC was established to advise the Minister on development and co-ordination of the Government's overall effort in energy research development and demonstration and on the allocation of grants for individual projects. Similarly that criterion appears to fit the bill. The national Water Resources Council could then revert to the role for which it was set up, that is, as a forum for Ministers dealing with water resource matters of mutual interest or, in other words, an avenue for communication and liaison. </PARA>
<PARA> At an even more fundamental level the real challenge will come in the question of control and management. It appears to me that the national problems involved in management of a national resource can most effectively be handled by a national authority. This would require a grant of power from the States, or more effectively, constitutional change to allow the Commonwealth to legislate in the area of freshwater management. A national authority could then be set up which could, for the first time, effectively manage a national resource in the national interest. Such a move would take considerable political courage from the States, particularly Victoria and New South Wales. But I have no doubt it would be to the ultimate benefit of such States and the balance of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> While I therefore applaud the spirit of Mr Jacobi's Bill I do not presently believe his proposed institute to be the most efficient or constructive way in which we can co-ordinate and upgrade water research in this country. I look forward in the near future to constructive government proposals coming out of the reviews referred to by the Minister; in the reviews of research work done by the CSIRO and the AWRC which are currently taking place. Even more so I look forward to the day the Federal Government takes a lead and urges upon the States and the people of Australia a national water authority. I will conclude by quoting a few lines from a speech by Dr Wild, Chairman of CSIRO, on 22 November 1981. He said freshwater was:</PARA>
<PARA> Probably the most precious resource in Australia, and the main limiting factor to growth and welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>He added:</PARA>
<PARA> Let us hope that everyone concerned-politicians, water authorities and researchers, will make the early part of the 1980s memorable for fixing a problem long overdue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to put on record both my own support and my party's support for the concept and the content of the Institute of Freshwater Studies Bill 1981 which is before us today. I do so for two main reasons. The first is that I am sick to death-as are most South Australians-of the procrastination and the buck passing that have gone on for so long between State and Federal governments, local government authorities, the River Murray Commission and other organisations interested in the problem and which have contributed greatly to the very poor quality of South Australia's water. The second reason is that as a South Australian, who for something over three decades has had to suffer the results of that procrastination, I do not feel that I can any longer stand by and allow this situation to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will have a glass of water as the honourable senator opposite so generously offered. It is water which is a darn sight better to drink, a lot more palatable, a lot clearer and a lot less tasty-in water that is a good quality-than the stuff that we regularly get out of our taps in South Australia. I digress at this point because of Senator Teague's interjection to point out that there are occasions in South Australia when it is almost impossible to take a shower because the water smells so bad. We have put up with this for far too long. The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick), who expressed the Government's opposition to the Bill, mentioned the need for perspective. I respectfully suggest to the Minister that South Australians have the most accurate perspective to offer when it comes to River Murray water and its quality and quantity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A lot has been said since last October when the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) tabled a statement relating to the new River Murray Waters Agreement. The three-State-Commonwealth government agreement was going to be the first of a number of significant changes in the approach to the problem of the River Murray Waters. I suggest, and I said this last October, that the agreement is meaningless. It is significant only in that it finally, belatedly recognises officially that something must be done about the quality control of River Murray water. I made the point last October that all the States involved and the Commonwealth Government had for years been derelict in their duty in regard to finding a solution to the problem faced by South Australians as far as water supply and the quality of that water supply is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Minister can still stand up and say that there is still no need for the sort of move proposed by the Bill at this stage. One wonders how much longer we in South Australia have to wait before the Minister and this Government approve of the stage that we have reached and see it as an appropriate point for doing something. How many more reports do South Australians have to sit back and watch be commissioned before something is done and not just talked about? The Minister is being nothing more than sanctimonious in his attitude to the very real concern that South Australians feel about the issue. I remind honourable senators that the Senate is a States House. Despite what the Minister says, the Senate is more than competent to press for action to be taken on a matter such as this and to press for it to be taken now as a matter of considerable urgency. For South Australia's sake we cannot afford to pussy-foot around any longer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister referred repeatedly to expert information coming but the references that he made are a smokescreen. Indeed a smokescreen is all that the plethora of inquiries, committees and reports that have popped up with nauseating regularity over the last few decades are. They are a means by which the Commonwealth Government, a State government or some other authority can stall making a decision which might prove unpopular in some areas. Calling for reports or referrals to committees is a great and traditional means for procrastination. I share the Australian Labor Party's belief that the time for that is past. We are not the only people who believe this. People who live along the River Murray within the South Australian border, people who drink and use River Murray water, all agree that the time for procrastination is past. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to do something positive. At worst, the setting up of the Institute can do no harm, which is more than can be said for some government initiatives. At best it will provide the opportunity for the development of a permanent data collecting agency, for a central forward planning body, for an impartial evaluation system, for in essence an organisation solely designed to co-ordinate the research into Australia's most precious resource. Even the Minister has to admit that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization does not have the charter, resources, time or staff to concentrate solely on the problems of water quality in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Other countries recognise the need for a unique institute whose charter allows it-indeed expects it-to concentrate on water research. There is no need for Australia not to follow that example. The River Murray Commission cannot achieve such a mammoth task. It has no powers now and it certainly does not have the resources to do so. A multigovernmental body certainly will not. There is too much at stake to leave the matter to the vagaries of the State versus State, party versus party or State versus Commonwealth Government politics. A new approach is very clearly required. The dismal failure of previous approaches is a clear indication of this. I point out to Senator Hill, who said that the idea of an Institute of Freshwater Studies was not approved of by the Senate committee, that Senate committees are not infallible and that the knowledge and experiences of people who are very close to the problem certainly warrant some consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Murray is dying. It must be the one river in this country on which one can walk. If that is not the case now it is rapidly approaching that stage. If we do not do something to halt this South Australia is going to die. That the Minister can sit back and ask us in South Australia to wait for the results of yet another interminable report is an indictment of the present Government's attitude to the needs and rights of smaller States. Despite the Minister's little homily about the Australian Democrats waiting until the latest inquiry is completed before making a decision, I can assure him that we believe that enough information has been gathered over the years and enough knowledge has been garnered. We believe that the problems are self-evident, that the half-hearted solutions of the past have just as evidently failed and no more information is required to prove to any thinking person that South Australia's water problems need urgent and positive action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We may well be all agreed on it but what we are clearly not agreed on is that the time is now, if it was not a decade ago, to do something definite about it. Putting it off again and again is no solution. I cannot understand how any South Australian senator can listen to his Minister say; 'The time is not yet upon us'. It is. Although instigators of this Bill admit quite openly that it is not going to turn the River Murray into a crystal clear stream by next week, it will go some way towards a permanent solution to the problems that we face in South Australia. Even though it will not be an overnight solution its instigation could well halt the present deterioration of the quality of River Murray water and turn the tide-if that expression can be used for a stream of water which barely moves let alone turns-so that the one and a half million South Australians who are to a great degree dependent on that water for drinking and irrigation purposes can once again have access to water which is the worst in Australia if not in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator obviously has not travelled the River Murray as much as I have. I admit that I walked across the River Murray mouth when the river closed last year but subsequently I went back and 27 feet of water was running through the mouth. This is a problem which has been with us for centuries and it behoves us all to have a national look at the whole question of not only the River Murray system but every other river system in Australia. I believe there is certainly a need for a more co-ordinated effort with respect to research into fresh water in Australia. I do not think the Bill goes far enough. People should remember that, of the water that falls on this continent each year, 50 per cent runs into the ocean and is wasted. Of the rest about 90 per cent evaporates. So only a very small amount of water is retained on the Australian continent for our use. Of that, one per cent is used for domestic purposes, industrial and municipal consumption and 7 per cent is used for the irrigation of about one million hectares of crops and for watering stock . I will seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a letter I wrote last year, one which attracted the attention of the editor of the Australian Financial Review. In it I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently, researchers at a Melbourne university provided a graphic example of the problems to be faced when they carried out a study of proposed coal liquefaction plants to be built in the La Trobe Valley. Noting that these plants required large amounts of water, they estimated that, to supply the demand, the entire annual mean flow of the Upper La Trobe rivers would be required by the year 2010. Further, it would result in a 50% reduction in the annual flow into Lake Wellington by the year 2020 and would require the total flow of all East Gippsland rivers by the year 2039. </PARA>

It is quite important that we assess the amount of artesian water available to us and the average water table that should be maintained in order that we do not mine that very important resource. I was talking to someone from the American Embassy over lunch. That person said that America is experiencing problems similar to those which apply in our country.

<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> At a time when more and more newspaper space is being devoted to details of new or prospective resource developments, I think it is timely to point out that the availability of adequate water supplies will have a major bearing on the success of these projects.</PARA>
<PARA> Many, if not all, of the developments require the availability of reasonably large amounts of water if they are to proceed. At the same time, however, many of these projects are situated in areas where water is either scarce or committed elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently, researchers at a Melbourne university provided a graphic example of the problems to be faced when they carried out a study of proposed coal liquefaction plants to be built in the La Trobe Valley. Noting that these plants required large amounts of water, they estimated that, to supply the demand, the entire annual mean flow of the Upper La Trobe rivers would be required by the year 2010. Further, it would result in a 50% reduction in the annual flow into Lake Wellington by the year 2020 and, would require the total flow of all East Gippsland rivers by the year 2039.</PARA>
<PARA> Not only would these demands have serious effects upon the surrounding environment but problems would also arise because of the competition for water between the existing agricultural users and the proposed plants.</PARA>
<PARA> Not all the problems associated with the availability of water are in the future. Recently, attention has been focused on farmers in the Narrabri area of NSW who draw extensively for water from a small artesian basin. It is expected that next season, those farmers on the outskirts of the basin will experience water shortages as a direct result of indiscriminate use of artesian water.</PARA>
<PARA> As the years progress it is reasonable to expect that more of these problems will arise unless governments act now to adopt a co-ordinated approach to the conservation and management of Australia's water resources.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that what is required is a national programme which would identify objectives and co-ordinate government efforts in their attainment. Obviously, in reaching any goals the financial assistance of the Federal Government is vital and active participation by industry should be encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA> Unless governments act now to implement such a plan of action, development in Australia will undergo a decline from the beginning of the next century, and could cease altogether towards the end of that era,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Sir Barton Pope said was quite correct; we have to deal with the question of artesian water as well. In my view a national water authority ought to be established. I agree that the wheels of government grind exceedingly slowly. I believe it is urgent for the Government to recognise that unless we take action now the development of Australia's resources beyond the year 2050 will considerably slow down, if not cease altogether. I took the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Sir John Carrick, up to the northern part of South Australia late last year to have a look at the potential of the mineral projects at Roxby Downs in the Olympic Dam area and also at Stoney Point. One of the first questions I ask these mining companies and the people wishing to develop such resources is: 'How much water do you require?' Quite often I think developers go in without having that thought foremost in their minds. I assure honourable senators that an incredible amount of water will be required to develop that resource for South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am encouraged also at the concept of a national approach. I envisage an Institute of Freshwater Studies to be included under the umbrella of such an authority. I envisage also that not only do we require scientific information and expertise but also we require engineering expertise. Perhaps the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority could well be the engineering institute within such an organisation that I am describing. Only with massive engineering ability and massive scientific advice will we be able to do something about diverting the 50 per cent of our water that currently is being wasted each year into the oceans surrounding our continent. I strongly support the concept of the Bill that is before us but I do not think it goes far enough. It suggests:</PARA>
<PARA> In making recommendations with respect to the functions of the Institute, the Interim Council shall give consideration to the need for-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) information and research necessary to provide for the efficient management by the Commonwealth and the relevant States of the interstate river systems, with particular reference to be given to the River Murray and its tributaries;</PARA>
<PARA>I think the word 'management' is the key word there. This Institute would not perform that important function. I believe that that is an inadequacy in this measure. In addition, I thought that one of the prime functions of this Institute of Freshwater Studies would be, as a matter of priority, to examine ways and means in which the Commonwealth and the States could co-operate to establish a national authority to manage Australia's freshwater reserves.</PARA>
<PARA> I am encouraged also by the support that has been forthcoming from no less than 12 councils in the River Murray area for the concept of a national approach to this problem. I indicate that district 5 or 7 of the River Murray league is also right behind that concept. The Premier of South Australia and the Minister of Water Resources are behind the proposition of a national approach to this matter . To my knowledge it is the first time that any State government has come forward and risen above the parochial attitude that quite often arises. I have always said that water knows no State boundary and should know no political boundaries either. Therefore, we all have to work together in an effort to try to convince all the States and the Commonwealth that what we are doing is not only in the national interest but also in the interest of future State development. Without water the States cannot develop either.</PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Chambers of Commerce and Industry sent me a letter in December last year. This letter, which is signed by John L. Harrower, Managing Director of that organisation, states:</PARA>
<PARA> I have read with interest your letter . . .</PARA>

Agreement was reached in principle in 1970. It was not until 11 years later, after considerable argument, that all the States agreed that these amendments should be made. Thankfully the River Murray Commission now has some say in water quality matters, but it still does not have the teeth required to insist that its recommendations be given effect. The Minister said that he was going to recommend that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation establish two further institutes or whatever within that organisation to deal with water. He said that his Department will expand its activities with respect to water resource interests and informed us also that the Ministerial Council which deals with national water resources has met and is currently examining the whole question. We hope that it is and that we will see a report from it in due course. I think the Minister said he would provide information for the benefit of the Senate and the Parliament so that we could contribute even further to the debate that is of such vital significance to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this amendment I am not forgoing my right, as the person who introduced the Institute of Freshwater Studies Bill, to reply to the second reading debate. I say from the outset that the Opposition will not entertain the amendment moved by Senator Jessop. It is just another delaying tactic. Senator Jessop submitted in his speech that the wheels of government grind exceedingly slow. He is now trying to engage in a further delaying tactic by referring this Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, of which I am a member. We have already conducted an inquiry into the Commonwealth's role in Australia's water resources. We made a recommendation to the Senate four years ago as to what the Government ought to do. The Government waited three years after receiving our recommendations before it set up a working party under the auspices of the Australian Water Resources Council. So the Government did not act upon the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That leads me to believe that no matter what recommendation we might make if we were to look at this Bill, the Government again would not act upon it. It is quite obvious that the Government does not want to take any action.

I say from the outset that Senator Jessop has not put forward a valid argument as to why we should accept the amendment he has moved. The amendment reads:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment. The importance and urgency of finding a solution to the water problems of South Australia requires the kind of total and national approach that has been outlined in this chamber by Senator Hill and Senator Jessop from South Australia. They have taken up the spirit of the Institute of Freshwater Studies Bill introduced in the other place by Mr Jacobi. All honourable senators from South Australia recognise the urgency and importance of finding a proper solution to this very vexing problem of water in our State. We are not so blinded by a concentration on the problem in South Australia that we do not see it as a national problem which needs to be approached in national terms as, indeed, the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Sir John Carrick outlined. This amendment is appropriate because it will ensure that the matters that have been raised in this debate-I refer to the urgency and importance that has been declared by everyone who has spoken-will gain all the more direction if looked at by the appropriate body in this chamber; that is the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not good enough that we have only a narrow Institute of Freshwater Studies. We should approach this matter with the full advice of water resources Ministers from each State in concert, under the auspices of the Australian Water Resources Council, and with the full advice of those bodies referred to by the Minister, Senator Hill and Senator Jessop, such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and universities where research is being undertaken. It is important that we have a national co-ordinated approach. Just to pass this Bill in the Senate without implementing the correct procedures in order to gain the best solution would be shortsighted.

At the moment our Committee is engaged in a major review of rural research and extension services in Australia.

Committee members are required over the next few weeks to make a choice between those five or six important matters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> in reply-I take it that I am now in order in closing the second reading debate on the Institute of Freshwater Studies Bill. Every person and every organisation in Australia concerned with our water needs and the many associated problems is indebted to Mr Ralph Jacobi, the Federal member for Hawker, for the in-depth research he has done, for the work he has put into the drafting of this Bill and for introducing it into the Parliament for consideration. Senator Carrick, when he opened for the Government , told us without any preamble that the Government would oppose the Bill. One of the reasons he gave was that the Bill was of the wrong methodology. He then went on to state that the Australian Water Resources Commission study group was unanimous in its opposition to an institute of freshwater studies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I took a point of order and asked how Senator Sir John Carrick could refer to that report when it is not yet a public document. Of course he claimed that it was a private document. But that did not prevent Senator Sir John Carrick trying to bolster his argument by telling the Senate that that working party had come to a unanimous decision. I will have a few words to say about that later when I quote from a couple of State government decisions becaue I am not yet convinced that it was a unanimous decision. I have not seen the report. If it was a unanimous decision some members of that working party must be at odds with their State Ministers. I have some evidence to show that they do not support that view . Why did he say that it was a private document? Why did he refer to it? As I said, it was only to bolster his argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has created intense constructive discussion about and inquiry into water needs in this country. It has the support of the Murray Valley League, which is a well recognised organisation with representatives along the length of the Murray from Albury to Goolwa in South Australia. It has the support of local councils right along the Murray, particularly in South Australia, which are concerned about the water needs of their residents and ratepayers. It has the support of irrigation organisations which are also concerned that Australia's water resources be protected. It has the support of the South Australian Parliament. This now brings me to the point on which I disagree with Senator Sir John Carrick. He said that the decision of the working party of the AWRC was unanimous. I have not seen a list of the people who were on that committee, but he said there was a voice from every State. I shall read a letter which I received from the Premier of South Australia dated 18 November 1981. It is addressed to Senator G. T. McLaren, 6 Third Street, Murray Bridge, South Australia and it reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator McLaren,</PARA>
<PARA>I inform you that on Wednesday, 11 November, the South Australian House of Assembly passed the following resolution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Senator Hill is going against that decision and of course he will have to answer to Mr Tonkin for that. That is his problem. That knocks Senator Carrick's argument into a cocked hat. He stated, and it is on the record , that the representatives of the States on the AWRC working party are unanimous in their decision. They are not in unanimous agreement with the Minister of Water Resources in South Australia because he supports Mr Jacobi's Bill. Again, I am reminded that Mr Bannon, the Opposition Leader in South Australia received support from Mr Wran, the Premier of New South Wales, for the setting up of an institute of freshwater studies. Of course, the two States that have been most involved in this water war in recent times are South Australia and New South Wales. Many hot words have been said. On one occasion New South Wales was accused by Mr Arnold of stealing South Australia's water. I do not want to go into that matter because I have mentioned it on many occasions. That claim was not correct. We now have two Ministers of two governments, one a Liberal government and one a Labor government, agreeing with the contents and the purport of Mr Jacobi's Bill to set up this institute of freshwater studies. I do not know what Victoria's decision is because nothing has been published. I am sure that after the election takes place we will have Victoria's support as well . The Save the Murray Campaign was set up primarily by former Senator Davidson. He was the inaugural chairman of the Save the Murray Campaign committee. He got that organisation off the ground. That is another organisation that supports Ralph Jacobi's Bill. The executive officer of the Save the Murray Campaign Committee, Mr Daryl Hicks, has reaffirmed by public statements and correspondence the Committee's full support for the Bill. I received a letter from him just recently. No doubt honourable senators who sit opposite also have both of those pieces of correspondence stating that that organisation supports Mr Jacobi's Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is said that they have not looked at alternatives. I will quote from a submission to the AWRC working group by the executive director of the Murray Valley League, Mr Proud. I have a copy here. I attended a regional meeting just the other day. I am a member of the Murray Valley League and I get copies of its minutes. I attend the meetings whenever possible. Part of the submission by Mr Proud on behalf of the Murray Valley League states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The league sees the attractive aspect in Mr Jacobi's proposals that they tiptoe daintily and apparently safely through the constitutional minefield. Bearing in mind the history of interstate squabbling over the Murray River, the league believes that recalcitrant States would be reluctant to be seen to oppose propositions from a prestigious research institute. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what this institute will be. The submission further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The league also believes that the proposed resource developments will also need water in considerable quantities and that a research institute to provide overall management guidelines would be economically justified on this ground alone. </PARA>
<PARA>I have no doubt that the Murray Valley League sought legal advice on the contents of Mr Jacobi's Bill; otherwise it would not have said that the Bill tiptoes daintily and apparently safely through the constitutional minefield. That was one of the arguments used today by Senator Carrick; we could not get around the Constitution to set up this institute of freshwater studies. Mr Jacobi had very good legal advice in drawing up the Bill. He is congratulated by the Murray Valley League. The institute would be able to tiptoe gently through the minefields we are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am talking about the Murray Valley League I will mention some of the councils that support the proposition. I have been at many meetings of the Murray Valley League when this Bill has been debated. I have the minutes of a meeting held at Strathalbyn on 30 October last. There was correspondence from the District Councils of Strathalbyn, Ridley, Murray Bridge and Mannum supporting Mr Jacobi's Bill. I had the pleasure last year of attending a meeting of the League at Mannum where Mr Jacobi had been invited along as a guest speaker to explain his Bill. I understand that he has been to many areas in the Riverland speaking to public bodies. They have all given him full support after he has explained the Bill and answered many questions to their satisfaction. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in his electorate talk of 22 November 1981, stated that water should receive a top priority. He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an investigation and study will be undertaken by the Department of National Development and Energy, in collaboration with relevant water authorities and other organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>By way of interjection I asked Senator Carrick when this working party had been set up. He told me that it was some 12 months ago. Yet the Prime Minister, in his statement, said that an investigation and study would be undertaken by the Department. He made that statement on 22 November. Whilst I do not dispute the fact that the working group may have been set up 12 months ago, apparently, if we can believe what the Prime Minister said, it did not commence work until after the introduction of Mr Jacobi's Bill in the other place on 4 June last year and the introduction of that Bill into the Senate on 9 June. This announcement comes six months after Mr Jacobi introduced an identical Bill to the one now before us. The Prime Minister, in his electoral talk on Sunday 22 November, went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes we need an updated assessment of all Australian water resources, including underground as well as surface water, in terms of both quality and quantity. We need estimates of current water usage, we need to know the trends in expenditure on water resource development, and we need to examine the implications of future demands. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the very thing which Mr Jacobi's Bill will do when this Institute of Freshwater Studies is set up. It will do all the things which the Prime Minister said need to be done. It will do all the things which the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources in its report in 1978 said ought to be done. There we have it. I can vouch for the authority of the Senate Standing Committee of which I am a member and Deputy Chairman but I will not vouch for anybody else . That is the point. Mr Jacobi's Bill does all the things which the Prime Minister, the Committee of which I am a member, local councils and other people who have looked at the Bill have said that it will do. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Jacobi is of the opinion that the Government can treat the Bill in any one of four different ways. Of course, when he made those remarks he was not aware that it could be treated in any one of five different ways. We had the fifth different way outlined to the Senate a while ago when the Government tried to shove the Bill off--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pigeon-holed.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And pigeon-hole it, but we have dealt with that. The first way the Government could deal with the Bill would be to do nothing with it after it passed the Senate. The Bill would go over to the other place. It would appear twice on the Notice Paper because Mr Jacobi already has the Bill on the Notice Paper. The second reading debate has occurred. The Bill will go from this place to the other House by message when we pass the Bill very shortly. So, it would be twice on the Notice Paper. The second way is for the Government to shuffle the pack and rearrange either the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Bureau of Mineral Resources or the Department of National Development and Energy to set up the Institute. This would mean, in effect, very little additional costs and little or no increase in staff. The third way would be to create a separate division of the CSIRO to implement the purpose of the Bill. Some reference has been made today to the CSIRO and what it would do. Of course, the CSIRO would not have the full backing of the Parliament in what it would be doing. Again, the aims of the Bill would be thrown off into a side stream. There would be a shelving of something which ought to be dealt with by a specific body such as this Bill envisages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fourth way the Bill could be treated is: Due to the urgency of coming to grips with our water problem-all honourable senators who have spoken in this debate today are agreed on that point-an interim council as provided in the Bill could be set up. The council would make a thorough investigation into water priority throughout Australia and then recommend what would be the best type of structure to meet Australia's pressing water needs, both in the short term and in the long term. We have every confidence that any impartial council that inquires into Australia's water needs would ultimately have to consider some central collection centre being established where all the information data and statistics collected could be assessed, collated and distributed to all interested parties. We recognise and acknowledge also the critical need for regional research and input. We particularly emphasise also the need for full co -operation and assistance from the States to ensure that water is looked at as a national priority and research is co-ordinated. These are the things that we are saying. They are what Mr Jacobi said in his second reading speech and what I am saying today here in the Senate with his concurrence. These are the things which have to be done. Mr Jacobi's Bill does all of these things. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick in his speech of opposition to this Institute said that the Opposition should not be hasty in making up its mind what we ought to be doing with our water resources. Of course, he tried to draw a smoke-screen across the whole issue. The Senate is not making up its mind. The expertise to make up our minds on how our water resources ought to be developed and used is not in this chamber. What we are saying by way of this Bill is that we should be setting up an Institute of Freshwater Studies to examine and report on the whole gamut of the problem. The Senate can make up its mind after having looked at what the Institute of Freshwater Studies recommends. I do not think Senator Carrick was very serious in what he was trying to do. He could not possibly seriously suggest that the working party which we have had no public report from yet and which has been in operation, he says, for 12 months-according to the Minister it may have been set up 12 months ago; I do not know how long it has been carrying out its work-has all the answers in the short space of 12 months, if in fact it has been working that long. That is what he said. I cannot really believe that he was serious when he said that. He went on to say that so much is happening and so much needs to happen. Of course so much is happening. A lot of what is happening involves disputes between the States and all types of various experts on our water problem. Mr Jacobi's Bill will overcome that. As I said previously, the Senate is not evaluating the problem that we have. We will be guided by the Institute. Its task is to do the evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill quoted Mr Jacobi's second reading speech where he said that it was politicians who were to blame for the problem we have today. What stronger argument is there for the establishment of this Institute? Of course, that statement by Mr Jacobi is fully supported by Senator Hill-it is the politicians who have not been able to come to grips with the problem and who have caused all of the dissention. What stronger argument can we have for the establishment of this Institute than the passing of this Bill today? As I said previously when I was speaking on the amendment which sought to refer this Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, it is nearly four years since that Committee reported to the Senate. Apart from recommending the setting up of this working party it took the Government three years to take action. If the Bill went to the Committee again-it will not because the vote against that has been taken-we might find ourselves faced with another stalemate for goodness knows how many years. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to take the time of the Senate any longer because we have other pressing business. I again commend Mr Jacobi for the work that he has done on his Bill. I know that many long days and nights and months of work have been put in by Mr Jacobi in drawing up this Bill. I am very pleased that the Australian Democrats are giving the Bill their full support. I hope that the Bill will pass the Senate. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, pursuant to Standing Order 358, there be laid upon the Table a document containing specific details of the Government's proposed amendments to industrial legislation referred to in the Ministerial statement given to the Senate on 16 February 1982, such details having been supplied by the Minister for Industrial Relations to interest groups but not to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the motion is to ensure that an intelligent public debate takes place on the very vital matter of amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and perhaps to other pieces of legislation and statute. Thus far we have received from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) a statement which is really fit only for presentation to the East Kew women's branch of the Liberal Party. The Minister's statement of 16 February did not do justice to the very important subject with which it purported to deal. It did not give adequate detail upon which an intelligent debate could take place and so raised the question as to whether the Government was not just using industrial relations as a political football for the Lowe by-election and for the Victorian State election. A number of comments in the statement immediately raise a number of very important questions. I do not propose to go into those today because I understand from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), who represents the Minister for Industrial Relations, that the Government is now prepared to provide a document which includes some of those things which we are now seeking. I suspect, however, that the document which will be provided to us will be as significant in what it does not say as it will be in what it does say . I give some examples of the type of information that I at least, with 20 years or more of experience in the field of industrial relations, would like to see emanate from the Government. The Minister, on page 18 of the circulated statement stated:</PARA>
<PARA> During this session I intend to introduce a number of legislative initiatives which I discussed with the National Labour Consultative Council on 4 February and which will be the subject of further discussion at a special meeting of that Council to be held in March. </PARA>
<PARA>Incidentally, I understand that that meeting will be held on the Monday after the Lowe by-election. The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been accused of seeking confrontation with the union movement because of these legislative proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>He then said:</PARA>
<PARA> Far from being confrontationist, the three legislative proposals are a responsible and reasonable response, both immediate and longer term, to meet a level of industrial disruption which all Australians recognise as totally unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>There are two things to be said about that matter relevant to the motion that is now before the Senate. First of all, after the words 'far from being confrontationist' one would have expected the Minister to say 'negotiations are now proceeding with the interested parties through the NLCC to ensure that there is some unanimity of view on these matters'. After all, on page 22 of the circulated document the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I expect that legislative action will be taken on the basis of that report--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Searby report-</PARA>
<PARA>later this year to bring about a substantial restructuring and simplification of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, with the ACTU and the Confederation of Australian Industry, is currently examining the report . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Naturally, this is the way in which things occur with the National Labour Consultative Council. I understand that previously the Government has taken matters to it for consultation, the recommendations have gone to the Minister, the Minister has taken them to Cabinet and has perhaps made a statement in this Parliament, there has been a broad debate on the subject and, after that debate, there has been or should have been the introduction of legislation having regard to views other than those stated by the NLCC. But on this occasion the Minister has stated to the NLCC that he will introduce legislation in this session. In effect, therefore, there has been no consultation. At the same time, to reinforce that entrenched confrontationist viewpoint the Minister has come into this Parliament and made a statement of intent to the Parliament indicating that in this session these proposals, which are not agreed upon en bloc by either the unions or employers, will be implemented by the Government. That is not a consultative procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the Government cannot therefore say that it withholds information from the Parliament because that information happens to be in the possession of interest groups who are allegedly in consultation with the Government, They are not-unless I am wrong. I hope that I am wrong. I hope that the Minister for Social Security will be able to tell me that I am wrong, that consultations are actually taking place and that there is a possibility that the Government will retreat from its intention as stated in the document circulated by the Minister on 16 February. I will be the first one to apologise to the Minister for Social Security, who is at the table, and indeed to the Minister for Industrial Relations, if I have misunderstood him. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good. I thank Senator Button. I imagine that that will open the way for the Minister to state that genuine negotiations are going on and that in those circumstances particular documents that are essential for confidential negotiations at that level need not necessarily be tabled. Let me say that at no time have I asked for those sorts of documents to be tabled in the Parliament. I wish to make that perfectly clear. In the first place, it is clear that the consultation processes of the NLCC ought to be of a confidential character. that is the essence of genuine negotiations into which the parties go with reasonable, open minds. As I understand the situation, on this occasion the Government has gone in with a closed mind. I hope that the result of this debate will be to afford the Government an opportunity again to open its mind to suggestions from the NLCC, from a broad range of unions and employer organisations and, indeed, from the Parliament when the debate continues after we have received some further elaboration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come to the second point that I want to make about page 18 of the circulated statement. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the three legislative proposals are . . . to meet a level of industrial disruption which all Australians recognise as totally unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to list very briefly what those three legislative proposals will be- the stand-down proposal, the withdrawal of preference proposal and the union structure proposal. I certainly would like to see a detailed document elaborating on the Minister's information and setting out just how many disputes have occurred as a result of the preference clauses that are currently in awards granted by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether the documentation that, I understand, we are to be presented with will include support for the allegation or the suggestion by the Minister that this legislative proposal will affect favourably the level of industrial disputation. Of course, I would like to see a document including some elaboration of the powers of the various State tribunals in regard to preference . What protection, what right of appeal, has the Government in mind to prevent stand-downs of an unreasonable character? What protection will there be for workers who would otherwise be gainfully employed? That protection is there at the moment; the employer must take the matter to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The statement proposes a complete change of onus of proof and we ought to have further information in regard to that aspect. Furthermore, so far as union structure is concerned, we would like to know precisely what the Government means by enterprise unions. There is a list of about 15 different things which I would like to put to the Minister. I will not read them out at this stage, because, as I understand it, the Minister has some sort of document and I do not want to pre-empt what might or might not be in that document. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me say this: Whilst the consultative procedures of the NLCC ought to be confidential in character, there is no legislative sanction which places confidentiality on documents provided to the NLCC, as there is in some other legislation. Nevertheless, I have not asked for those documents. All I am asking for by this motion is a document containing specific details of the Government's proposed amendments to industrial legislation which were referred to in the Minister's statement read to the Senate on 16 February and such details as were supplied by the Minister for Industrial Relations to interested groups but not to the Parliament. It was stated in the Press that those documents were in fact supplied to the Australian Council of Trade Unions and to the chambers of commerce. I believe that the Government has made a rod for its own back, on the one hand, by suggesting that these matters are privy to the NLCC and, on the other hand, by providing this Parliament with a document which is totally inadequate for genuine and intelligent debate on this very important matter. I say again to the Minister for Social Security that if he now says that the Minister for Industrial Relations is in genuine negotiation with the NLCC on these matters, I will be the first to apologise. But also I insist that we, as parliamentarians, deserve better treatment than we have been given. We deserve specific details so that the debate on the Minister's original statement and the further document can ensue when next we are in session. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion which has been moved by Senator Harradine. I do not think there is much that I really want to add to what he had to say, particularly in view of the undertaking that has been given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). I support Senator Harradine's motion mainly because the statement which was tabled by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) reminded me very much of that expression: 'Where there is smoke, there is fire'. There is an awful lot of smoke in that statement, but I could not distinguish where the fire was; and that is what the Parliament is entitled to know. For example, I hope that any further statement which is brought down will at least explain to members of this Parliament how the proposed organisation of unions into, first of all, enterprise unions-whatever that may mean-and/or industry unions relates to the very vague statement on proposed wages policy. There is, in my view, a very profound conflict in the statement in relation to those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, as Senator Harradine pointed out, I would like to know what is meant by the expression 'enterprise union'. There are a number of other matters in that document which are very important and which ought to be explained to the Parliament so that thoughtful debate can take place. I share Senator Harradine's view about the National Labour Consultative Council's deliberations and the respect which should be accorded them. I hope that he and I are both wrong in suspecting that the bringing down of the statement at the time it was brought down was something in the nature of a political stunt, which has not been unknown in the industrial relations area in the life of this Government. If we can be reassured on that matter I am sure that we can have a much more intelligent debate about the issues. I commend Senator Harradine for his initiative in this matter and hope that the response meets what is intended by that initiative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may shorten the debate-on the other hand, it may not-if I speak at this stage and indicate the Government's attitude to this motion. The Opposition Whip is looking concerned. It is not my motion and my speaking at this stage has no effect on the order of speakers in the debate or anything else. I must say that I was relieved when the text of the motion was actually produced in the Senate after the original statement made by Senator Harradine on 17 February. I can indicate to the Senate that the Government does not oppose the motion that he has moved, but I would like to explain why there was some concern about the original statement of intention which preceded the notice of motion. On 17 February Senator Harradine said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . I intend to move the adjournment of the debate and tomorrow I will seek a suspension of Standing Orders to demand from the Minister the documentation which has been provided to the National Labour Consultative Council on this matter but which he has not had the courtesy of providing to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The wording of the motion and Senator Harradine's comments here today make it quite clear that he has had second and better thoughts, which I welcome, on the procedures that might be followed, because the motion seeks not the specific documentation but a document containing specific details of the Government's proposed amendments to industrial legislation. The concern which the Government had, and which, I must say, is shared by both employers and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, relates to documentation provided to the National Labour Consultative Council in the course of the consultations which are provided for under that Act. Section 5 (1) of that Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Council is to provide, in the public interest, a regular and organised means by which representatives of the Government of the Commonwealth of employers and of employees may consult together on industrial relations matters, and manpower matters, of national concern. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress that the body, as it is statutorily established, is a body which is to permit consultation between those three key groups in this area-the Commonwealth Government, the employers and the trade union movement representing employees. What I can say to the Senate in response to the points which have been raised by Senator Harradine is that what is occurring with the National Labour Consultative Council at the moment is the process of consultation which is required by the National Labour Consultative Council Act. On a number of occasions Senator Harradine asked whether the Government was in negotiation with the National Labour Consultative Council. I think the proper answer is no. The Government is in consultation with the other members of that Council. Section 5 (2) (c) of the Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> subject to the rights of members to report to the organizations by which they are nominated and to the right of the Council to make announcements that the members agree are in the public interest, the views of members expressed at meetings of the Council will be kept confidential. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Harradine distinguished between views expressed at Council meetings and documents which might be provided. I respectfully suggest to the Senate that it is certainly within the spirit-I would argue that it is within the letter-of that provision that documents provided in the course of consultation would be regarded as part of the consultation and should be given the same confidential status as the expression of views at meetings. In that regard I am advised by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), who has had discussions with both the trade union movement, through the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and the employer representatives on the National Labour Consultative Council, that those two groups are concerned to preserve the confidentiality of National Labour Consultative Council matters and documents although, in this case, both the employers and the employees' representatives are agreeable to the parts of the paper which was provided to the National Labour Consultative Council by the Government, relating to the three areas of amendment referred to in Mr Viner's statement, which I put down in this place, being released to the Senate. I propose, therefore, on the carriage of this motion-it certainly will be carried in the light of the support it has received around the chamber-to table a paper which picks up those parts of the written communications from the Commonwealth to the National Labour Consultative Council which relate to the Government's proposals to legislate as to voluntary unionism, the removal of preference to unionists, the standing down of employees and industry and enterprise unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to prolong the debate on this matter unnecessarily but, to my mind, a somewhat curious concern has been expressed by both Senator Harradine and Senator Button, on behalf of the Opposition, about the fact that the Parliament was asked to debate the broad statements of intention contained in the statement put down by Mr Viner and by me in this chamber before the full detail was made available to permit a debate on that detail. I think that there are many instances in this chamber of there being useful debate on questions of broad principle prior to the Senate engaging its attention on the detailed implementation of that principle. In the present case, rather than the Government producing legislation without warning, it has given an indication of its intentions and, at roughly the same time, it has engaged in the process of consultation which is envisaged by the National Labour Consultative Council Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the Minister will consider the precise form of the legislation in light of the consultations which will occur in March, as has been indicated by previous speakers. None of this can take from the fact that the key thing is that the Government will, of course, have to bring its legislation into the Parliament, firstly into the House of Representatives and ultimately into this chamber where honourable senators will have ample opportunity to debate in their usual way the detail of the legislation with the very great freedom which we enjoy in this place for that sort of debate on detail, whether at the second reading stage or in the Committee of the Whole. I simply proffer the view to the Senate in response to the complaints which have been made by Senator Harradine and Senator Button that a forecast of intention of this sort is no bad thing. It permits a degree of public debate and a degree of debate in this chamber on the principles which are involved before one gets down to the equally difficult task , having formulated the principles one wishes to apply, of saying how those principles shall actually be put into execution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had a similar experience recently. I made a statement of intention at the time of the last Budget. I have to confess that putting the intention into legislative form has proved more difficult than I thought at the time the statement was made. I think I am being assisted in the shaping of that legislation by the views which have been put to me over the months since the Budget, sometimes with considerable force. In my case-I give this as a parallel example-as recently as last Wednesday I met with the Australian Pensioners' Federation which put some views which further illuminated for me the approaches which might be taken in this area. I suggest to honourable senators that debate on fairly broad statements can be quite productive and can lead to assisting the Government in the shaping of its legislation. I am not saying that in the future we will not follow a similar course-an announcement of intention which will permit debate both here and elsewhere which will promote better legislation. </PARA>

For that reason, the Government will be able to support the motion and comply with it quickly. I merely wish to respond to one other point which Senator Harradine raised. He wanted to know whether we would provide details of how many industrial disputes had arisen out of preference clauses. That was merely one of the points he raised about which he was curious. I simply say that some aspects of the legislation may well relate, not merely to what industrial disputes have occurred or might be prevented in the future but also to the freedom of individual Australians to obtain employment without being the victims of some trade union action which is against their personal beliefs or wishes. Some questions may relate to the freedom of individuals to go about their business without interference, quite apart from the cessation or reduction of industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> I put down one final caution with respect to the statement that I table. As I understand, it contains the points made to the National Labour Consultative Council with respect to the three areas of amendment which are proposed. It is, of course, not a final statement of all the specific details. If we were able to provide such a final statement of specific details we would be able to produce a draft Bill. Just as importantly, to be able to produce a final statement of specific details would simply establish the point that Senator Harradine has been making, namely that no genuine process of consultation was proceeding. So I cannot say that this document is a final statement. It is a statement which picks up the points which have been made for the purposes of the consultation which has occurred. The final form may differ flowing from that consultation and from the Government consideration which is given to the measures following that consultation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats very briefly to support Senator Harradine's motion. I am delighted to hear that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) is proposing to table documents setting out the details of the Government's proposals in the industrial relations area. In my speech on Mr Viner's original ministerial statement I protested that I had not received a copy of the statement until Tuesday, 17 February, although it apparently had been widely circulated the previous week. But it has also come to my notice that supplementary material was available that was circulated to newspapers, members of the National Labour Consultative Council and various other interested bodies. This supplementary material does, apparently, outline in some detail the Government's intention. I think that if that material was available at least the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine, who obviously has a very deep interest in industrial relations, should have been given a copy of it. There were very detailed reports of the Government's intention in various newspapers following the Government's announcement. We were not informed of those details. Therefore, we were not able to make informed statements on our party's attitude to the proposals of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney suggested that it is beneficial to discuss these matters in broad detail. I am afraid I cannot agree with him. How are we intelligently to debate basic new concepts which the Government now proposes? How can we debate intelligently the question of union amalgamation when we are confronted with a concept of enterprise unions without any definition of what the Government means by an enterprise union? It is necessary for us to have these details. Senator Evans has indicated the very doubtful constitutional basis on which compulsory stand-down legislation could be drafted. It seems to me that this has to be addressed before we raise such a bogy before the whole industrial relations scene in this country. Obviously the Government knew that its proposals would be highly contentious and that they would worry the trade union movement, as they worry the Australian Democrats. We hope that there will be a better climate for industrial relations in this country-one of co-operation. The Government's approach does not engender that atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to say any more about the matter except to comment that I was amused to find out the other day that apparently this chamber has the power, ultimately, to order the Black Rod to take a senator who wilfully disobeys the Senate into custody under Standing Order 444. So, one lives and learns. We are looking forward to reading the papers which set out the details. Hopefully they will allow us to be much better informed in our opinions on and attitudes to the Government's proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with Senator Harradine in being rather concerned about the lack of detail in the statement of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner). I am pleased to hear from the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, that the Government will bring down a detailed statement. I doubt that it will be as detailed as Senator Harradine or Senator Siddons imagined because, in the first place, I felt the statement was a piece of kite flying from the very beginning. Senator Chaney said that it is good to discuss the broad principle. It is the broad principle embodied in this statement that worried me, because I could not see any. I can assure Senator Siddons that he did not miss much by getting the statement late.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a 23-page statement on wages and industrial relations. I sincerely hope that the detailed statement of the Minister has something about industrial relations in it and does not confine itself solely to wages. The 23-page document contains the words 'wage' or 'wages' some 60 times. There are no less than 29 attacks on wage earners and the unions who sought those wage increases. No reference is made to the huge profits that have been made in the past, and which are still being made, by large companies and banks. The statement expresses the Government's concern over working days lost through industrial disputes. But it is obvious that it has not looked into the total figure of lost production in many fields other than wages. The so-called 'broad principle' referred to by Senator Chaney shows the Government's attitude towards unions. </PARA>
<PARA> One gets the impression from reading the statement that all industrial disputes are confined to wages and that that is the one and only factor that has any bearing on industrial relations. So the broad principle is confined to that one factor. Therefore, one can assume from the statement only that the intention of the Government as a broad principle is to screw down on wage earners as hard as it is humanely possible. It reveals also that the obsession that this Government is accused of havng with union bashing is, indeed, a fact. Despite the disgust that employers show from time to time towards the Government because of its interference in what should be the employer-employee negotiations, it keeps on and on insisting that all the ills of the nation over which it presides can be heaped on the back of the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I assure the Senate that there is a lot more in the field of industrial relations which requires attention than was contained in the ill-informed view that was expressed in the broad statement of principle. It is time that the Government had a good look at some of the causes behind the strained industrial relations. I hope that the detailed statement to be presented by the Minister looks into industrial relations and thoroughly considers the causes before considering the cures. Fore example, I have never heard any Government member point out that time lost in industrial disputes can be broken up into a number of areas and that the area concerning wages accounts for only 27 per cent of industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaving aside industrial disputes, let us consider another far more important aspect of industrial relations and the loss of production in that area. As I have pointed out to the Senate before, time lost because of industrial accidents is about two to three times more than the time lost because of industrial disputes. Here is a whole huge field in which the Government should be doing something more constructive if it is genuinely concerned about the loss of production and the welfare of the people that put it into office. In discussing the broad principles of industrial relations I would like to see something in the detailed statement dealing more with the whole of the field of industrial relations. Has the Government any idea of the pain and disruptions caused by industrial accidents or illness? Has it any insight into the financial and social loss associated with time off work because of injury? Does it have any idea of the inadequacies of data collection relating to the extent and nature of industrial accidents in Australia? Using existing data, it is not possible to know how many people are injured at work each year or how badly they are hurt. It is impossible to isolate the causes of accidents and to compare them across industries and occupations to monitor changing patterns of risks for workers. Research into prevention is hampered by the lack of information. The community is left ignorant of the costs in human and economic terms. Surely this is part of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government must accept responsibility in this field. A national occupational health safety office should be established and the national responsibilities involved in this area vested in certain authorities. I hope that the detailed report on industrial relations concerns a means of co- ordination between State and federal authorities in the field of health, safety and welfare. I hope that the Government legislates for union elected health and safety representatives and health and safety committees both at the shop floor and the industrial level. I hope that the detailed report on industrial relations-a most important field-will lead to legislation to provide effective penalties, enforcement of powers, national research facilities and the right of union representatives and officers to carry out work place inspections and to have access to information held by employees and government agencies. I hope all those things come into the detailed statement that the Minister intends to table . I hope there is training at public expense of sufficient nursing, medical and ancillaries. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WK7">Senator MCINTOSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The title of the ministerial statement is 'wage determination and industrial relations'. Surely these matters are all part of industrial relations. The Minister said that we should be debating the broad principle, and surely the matters I am talking about come within the ambit of that broad principle. The Minister has completely avoided that principle. There is also another area in which the Government could play a useful and constructive role instead of the destructive role which it has embarked on. It should examine the causes of tradesmen not working at their trades. I am sure the Government would rather talk about the predicted shortfalls in skills and in the training of more people than help those people who are already trained and experienced. This matter comes under industrial relations. I feel it has been sadly neglected. I do not see anything about this in the broad principle of statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Government realise that an extra 6,000 tradesmen would be available each year if the drop-out rate of apprentices was reduced from one-third to one- fifth of its present rate? The report on the fitting and machining trade course of the New South Wales Department of Technical and Further Education included a section on wastage rates. TAFE sent out a questionnaire to 250 ex-fitting and machining apprentices in an attempt to ascertain the career paths of these tradesmen. Eighty-two of the questionnaires were returned. But out of these 82 people, 45 per cent were no longer employed in the trade for which they were trained. Some 97 per cent of those were under 30 years of age. That was a very small sample. On its own, the result would need to be treated with some caution, I agree. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the result is supported by a further survey conducted by TAFE this time covering stage III fitting and machining apprentices in New South Wales. At that time, 1977, approximately 1,400 of these stage III students were in New South Wales technical colleges. As the survey was conducted in the classroom it was possible to obtain a complete coverage. When asked about their future career plans 45 per cent claimed that they intended to leave the trade within the next few years thereby accurately reflecting the actual behaviour of the ex-students sampled. The most frequent reason given by ex-students for leaving the trade was lack of financial return. Lack of opportunities for promotion and loss of interest in their trade were amongst some other reasons. Of course, the main point was the lack of financial return. We are dealing with wages here but the Government's intention in the so-called broad principle of the Minister seems to be to further reduce wages.</PARA>
<PARA> The 1976 census showed that 300,000 males with tradesmen's certificates were working in non-tradesmen's jobs. Some 20,000 were working as bus, car or truck drivers. The last thing this Government is interested in is the cause of strained industrial relations. It is the very last thing the Government seems to be interested in if we take this document as a broad statement of principle. As I said it concentrated all the way through on wages. The ministerial statement mentioned wages 60 times. I will not go over that again. But the Governments seems to be concentrating on that aspect more than anything else. If the Government were really genuinely concerned about industrial relations and training of tradesmen it should look at why the country is losing so many tradesmen. The Government mentioned wages no less than 60 times. It made no less than 29 attacks on wage earners and the unions which sought increases. Is this the broad principle the Government is talking about that we should be debating? That seems to be the whole gist of the Minister's statement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that returns for one's labour, working conditions and unfulfilled expectations all go together when talking about industrial relations. People are not fools. They want to see the wealth of this wealthy nation shared by all. They want to be able to enjoy the environment in which they work as well as live . They are aware of the unequal distribution of our resources. They are aware of the Government's inability to tackle the problems in society where 10 per cent of people own almost 60 per cent of the total wealth of this country. The richest 2,000 members of our society have as much as the poorest 2.5 million adult Australians. In this country 2.5 million humans exist on the poverty line. Nearly 60 per cent of all wage and salary earners receive less than the average weekly earnings before tax. Government senators have the temerity to hide behind an excuse for their failure to grapple with those problems. They blame it all on the unions. The broad principle statement that we had to debate was, to repeat what I said at the beginning, nothing but a bit of kite-flying. I sincerely hope that when the document of details comes down it includes matters concerning the whole spectrum of industrial relations and does not confine itself to wages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very good. I hope that vote takes place today. In conclusion I say that this strikes me as an exercise by the Government to persuade the Senate to buy a pig in a poke. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his Budget Speech made mention of the fact, as he saw it, that it is clear that there is an advantage in making some change in the mix of direct and indirect taxes to increase the potential for desirable reductions in direct taxes, particularly personal income tax, as economic and budgetary conditions permit. As far back as 26 August I challenged the Treasurer to spell out the Government's hinted proposals for future income tax relief. I said then that the Government must come clean on its personal tax proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate cannot be asked to buy a pig in a poke. What I did then and what the Senate has done by returning these Bills to the House of Representatives has been to give the Treasurer the opportunity to clarify his vague proposals contained in the Budget papers to ease direct or personal taxes. He has not done that. He has not addressed public attention to how, when and where these taxes would be applied. It is just not on to ask the Senate to adopt these sales tax measures with some vague promise of some vague proposals for reductions in direct taxes. As has been said in the debate, the $53m that the Government will get from these measures this financial year will be simply a drop in the bucket in easing direct taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of the pig in a poke proposal that is before us is the fact that the Government has brought back, in its own words, 'for constitutional reasons' the Bills as I understand them in precisely the same form as they came before us last year. Of course what that means is that the Government wishes to have the double dissolution gun loaded. I think that the Government would be very unwise to go to the people over the Senate's rejection of these proposals. In my view the Government is not acting genuinely when it brings down legislation such as this, which has a particular date of operation, and then suggests that if it is passed it will bring in another Bill which will have another operative date. That seems an extraordinary way for a responsible Government to act. The newly established Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, in its second report, that of 24 February 1982, states that these Bills have provisions which are retrospective in operation to 1 January 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Because they impose a financial obligation on individuals, under principle 1 (a ) (i) of the Committee's terms of reference they might be regarded as trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties. However, the Treasurer's second reading speech indicates that the date 1 January 1982 has been included to comply with the requirements of section 57 of the Constitution-1 January being the prospective date of commencement specified in the Bills previously introduced into the Parliament but not passed by the Senate. The Treasurer has indicated in his speech that a further Bill will be introduced to change this date to 29 March 1982 'as soon as these Bills have been passed by both Houses', thus eliminating the retrospective date. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest to members of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills that if they genuinely subscribe to the principle that they refer to in that statement they should, as a matter of principle, vote against a piece of tax legislation of this character which has a retrospective date. If the Senate passed this legislation and rejected the foreshadowed legislation which amended the retrospective date it would be impossible to implement the retrospective aspect of the present legislation. I suggest that the Senate proceed quickly to a vote on these Bills. Consistent with my previous opposition, I will be voting against the Bills and I hope that the Senate rejects them in toto. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be no secret by now that the Opposition, too, consistent with its initial position, opposes the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981 [No. 2] (1982) on their merits. We do so for both general and quite specific reasons. The general reasons are, of course, that we regard any indirect taxes as almost inevitably being more regressive in their operation than properly formulated progressive direct taxes. As a result we always have a preference for revenue raising by direct taxes. More specifically we oppose the particular items in these Bills for reasons which have been enumerated and set out by speaker after speaker. We oppose the new tax on books and newspapers because of the unprecedented character of this tax on knowledge, properly so described, in the Australian and indeed whole Anglo-Saxon environment. We oppose it because of the potentially devastating impact, even the comparatively small impost, in percentage terms, it will have on marginally viable publishing enterprises, small book publishers and especially publishers of small magazines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We oppose the new taxes on clothing, footwear and drapery because they deal with matters that are unequivocally among the necessities of life on any definition of that now rather overused expression. We oppose the taxes on wrapping and packaging material because of the small but undoubtedly cumulative effect they will have on the price of food, another obvious necessity. We oppose the new tax on building materials because of the significant marginal impact a new tax of 2 1/2 per cent will have on the already escalating price of new houses and indeed on building activity generally in an industry which is staggering on its feet at the moment as a result of the obviously desolate condition of the general economy. We have objections which, as I say, speaker after speaker in this debate and debates before it have enumerated to everyone of the items in issue in these Bills just as we opposed-unlike our colleagues the Australian Democrats-the more general tax increases and even more broad- ranging ones in Bills Nos 1 to 9 and in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1981 which were passed in the last parliamentary year, of course, with the Australian Democrats' support. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that most of the items in the present list of matters in Bills Nos 1A to 9A come within the description of necessities, including books, about which Senator Lewis for, in his case, quite understandable reasons was so doubtful. But of course-this needs to be reiterated-we similarly took the view that a great many of the other matters in the previous packages of Bills also came within that description. It is a matter of regret that the conversion of the Australian Democrats, the shaft of light which overtook them on the road to the ballot box, apparently left some scales that cover still their eyes in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> In Bills Nos 1 to 9, for example, there was an increase from 27 1/2 per cent to 30 per cent on items such as pens, deodorants, razors and shavers, and radios and television. Can it be said these days that those items are luxuries, or are they indeed part of the necessities of life? Perhaps radio and television might be thought to be marginal cases but how can they be regarded otherwise than as necessities, particularly for elderly peope living by themselves? Again there was an increase from 2 1/2 per cent to 5 per cent on furnishings, crockery, glass, cutlery, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, radiators, jugs, mattresses, pillows, light fittings and candles. What else are they but necessities of life on any view of it? In the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1981 there is an increase from zero up to 17 1/2 per cent through to 30 per cent on items such as pet foods, insecticides, windscreens and other car accessories and, indeed, oil for people's motor cars. Are these luxuries or, indeed, these days, necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad, as we all are on this side of the chamber, that the Australian Democrats have finally seen the light about Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos. 1A to 9A) 1981 [No. 2] (1982) that are now before us. But we can only wish, with the rest of the community, that that shaft of light had struck home a little bit sooner. Even though the case against these Bills-like all the other Bills before them in this sales tax package-on the merits of the Bills is, I suggest, overwhelming, the decision to oppose them was not by any means a reflex one on our part as has been claimed by some, particularly again the Australian Democrats whose reflexes these days must be getting a little bit dull through overuse. Rather it was a carefully considered decision on our part because important questions of principle are undoubtedly involved when any money Bill or any Budget Bill-the present Bills satisfy both those descriptions-is in issue. </PARA>
<PARA> We, unlike our opponents on the other side of this chamber, are concerned with constitutional propriety. We do not regard it as appropriate that this chamber should have the power of life or death-including financial life or death-over the properly elected government of the day. We want to secure a change in the role of this House, and in the way it perceives its role, to make it a constructive rather than a destructive influence in the parliamentary and political life of this nation. At the same time, operating, as we do, in a political and constitutional environment where our views of the role of this place do not seem to be shared on all sides of this House and where there is a community expectation that we will resist those measures which are manifestly damaging to the people and for which the Government lacks any credible mandate, we do not want to abdicate completely the powers that the present Constitution gives us to oppose Bills when it is manifestly in the larger community interest to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, taking all those considerations into account, the Australian Labor Party had no doubt as to where its duty lay. There could be no justification in principle for rejecting or blocking any Bill on which the survival of a government depends-in other words, the kind of supply or appropriation Bills that were in issue in 1974-75. To do that for any reason, except perhaps as an absolute last resort device for explicitly securing constitutional reform, if that reform cannot be achieved by any other means, is to go straight back to the crude opportunistic path that was trodden by our opponents in 1974 and 1975 to the manifest disadvantage of this country's democratic constitutional arrangements. We will not be a part of it. But by the same token, with lesser Bills, whether they be money Bills or non-money Bills, those Bills which cannot be described as crucial in any way to the survival of the Government, we have consistently taken the view that we have an obligation to look at their merits. If the Bills in question are manifestly unmeritorious and if they lack any kind of clear, electoral mandate from the people, then we have an obligation, as long as the Senate operates as it does and retains the powers that it has at the moment, to defeat them. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the principles which we have consistently applied in the case of these Bills, despite all the numerous, tiresome and repetitive claims by speakers on the other side of the chamber that the Labor Party, its spokesmen and I in particular, have adopted as unprincipled a course as they did in 1975 and 1975. These are the principles which we have consistently applied in the course of reacting to these Bills because all the criteria that I have just mentioned have been amply satisfied in relation to them. So far as their merit or lack of it is concerned, I have said sufficient to demonstrate the basis on which that argument stands. So far as the question of a mandate is concerned, it has been said by speaker after speaker that, of course, it is the case that the Government can claim no mandate for this from the people. The situation is that the implementation of this measure is a product of deliberate Government deceit, with explicit statements being made throughout the course of the last election campaign that the government had no intention to introduce any broad-based indirect taxes of the kind that are in issue here and with the matter being the subject of a 'no comment' by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) just four days after the election date suggesting that the idea of implementing taxes such as this was very much in the Government's mind during the run-up to the election and was in the forefront of its thinking as a priority for implementation very soon afterwards. So there is a lack of a mandate on any view. But worse than that, there is a course of deceit associated with the introduction of these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> More particularly, because this tends to be rather the issue on which the debate has focused, these Bills are simply not crucial to the survival of this Government in office in the way that it would be necessary for them to be if, as a matter of principle, it would be wrong for us to be opposing them. These sales tax Bills as a whole-that is not just Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A-9A) but Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1-9) 1981 and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classification) Amendment Bills which preceded them-represent some $553m worth of anticipated revenue out of a Budget of over $40,000m this financial year; just one eightieth of the total. Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A-9A) with which we are dealing right now represent much less than that-$132m anticipated initially for this financial year; $330m in a full year. Large as these sums may appear when looked at solely by themselves, in the total budgetary context they do not amount to much more than petty cash. With a deficit now running at something like $800m and likely to blow out beyond $1,000m this financial year, it is clear that $132m is not a sum of life or death significance to this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> With tax revenue from personal exertion increasing this year by a minimum, on the most conservative estimates, of around $3,000m, and a much more likely figure, according to Eric Risstrom, of something like $5,500m, it is clear that it is just plain dishonest to imply-as the Treasurer John Howard has-that any failure of the Government to grant further tax relief this year is on our heads, the heads of those who oppose the implementation of this sales tax legislation. The rejection of these Bills, and the reduction of the revenue that the Government can accordingly expect, may undoubtedly have made life more difficult for the Government this financial year but it has not threatened the capacity of the Fraser Government to govern. It has not threatened the capacity of this Government to survive in office for just as long as it wants to until the 1983 election. All that the rejection of this legislation means is that the Government will have to rethink its revenue sources and, in particular, it will have to take a much harder line than it has so far, despite all the trumpeted flim-flam of the Treasurer, Mr Howard, against the phenomenon of tax avoidance which rages unabated in our community.</PARA>
<PARA> The principled character of the opposition from the ALP, which I have been at pains to endeavour to explain-built, as it is, around these concepts of survival as distinct from non-survival Bills and around the concepts of mandate and merit , such that we will in summary only contemplate opposing non-survival Bills for which the Government has no mandate and which are manifestly unmeritorious- stands, I fear, in rather stark contrast to the principled position of our bedfellows on this occasion, the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats-I regret that none of them is here in the chamber; I did, in fact, give them some advance warning that I would be saying these things , not too unkindly but more in a spirit of sorrow than anger-have found themselves obliged to admit that they have abandoned 'constitutional purity', to use their words, and succumbed to the blandishments of electoral opportunism. They have been forced through their leader to explain rather bashfully that they were tempted, that for a time they maintained their constitutional purity and resisted that temptation rather like a set of political Cliff Richardses; but now they have succumbed to the siren call of the ballot box. They have rolled over and they have given in. It is not really a mortal sin, they claim, because, after all, a lot of people will be better off as a result, but it is, they acknowledge regretfully and a little shamefacedly, a venial sin which they rather hope will be quickly forgiven and forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> The most extraordinary thing about this whole convoluted process from our colleagues, the Australian Democrats-I will not weary the Senate with quotation and counter-quotation from the statutory declarations, mother's dying oaths, platform speeches, media columns and pages of Hansard, in the course of which, as I have said previously, they have adopted rather more positions than the ferris wheel at the Melbourne Show-is that it is all so unnecessary. The Australian Democrats perceived dilemma between constitutional purity on the one hand and crude opportunistic expediency on the other should not have been a dilemma at all. It became a dilemma only because of the Australian Democrats total conceptual confusion on matters of constitutional law and constitutional principle-a confusion which I suspect continues rather to this day. There was an utter inability to appreciate relevant differences between money Bills and Budget Bills, and Supply Bills and Appropriation Bills. Most of that language appears in the Constitution and all of it means something, but the meaning of most of it seems to this day to remain something of a mystery to the Democrats who, as a result, have been quite unable to articulate any kind of principled theory of the proper role of the Senate in a stable parliamentary democracy. There is a way in which to maintain constitutional purity while still opposing these Bills. The Labor Party without shame or apology has, I believe, shown that way, the relevant principles being those that I have been at pains to spell out again today as I, in common with other spokesmen on our side, have spelt out time and time again previously. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me finish by saying just a little about the implications perhaps for the future of the Senate acting in this way today or whenever it is that these votes are taken. There is no doubt that in respect of these Bills or others with which we have recently dealt or will deal in the near future, the conditions for a double dissolution will sooner or later be created. Indeed, if the literal terms of the Constitution mean anything at all-the literal language of the Constitution has in the past demonstrated its appeal to our political opponents- given that the literal text of the Constitution fails to say anything at all about advice in respect of a double dissolution actually being given to the Governor-General by the government of the day or the Prime Minister of the day, it may be that the Opposition will ask the Governor-General for a double dissolution when the conditions are satisfied. As I say, that would merely be based on a literal reading of the Constitution and have nothing to do with the conventions that have supposedly grown up around it. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems unlikely, that scenario apart, that there will be any double dissolution called by the Government this side of 30 June for the reason, if no other-I put political considerations to one side-that, by virtue of the operation of section 13 of the Constitution, to have a double dissolution before 30 June would once again for the future throw half Senate elections and House of Representatives elections completely out of kilter. The reason is-this will be well known to honourable senators-that in the event of a double dissolution their term commences from the preceding 1 July. If there were a double dissolution in the first half of this year, the half Senate would be due again before the middle of 1984 whereas the House of Representatives, of course, would not be due until 1985. So it seems unlikely that anything like that will happen before July. </PARA>
<PARA> In common with my party colleagues, I want to make the point-putting all that technical detail to one side-that if the Government wants to test its popularity at any time on this or any other issue with the electorate we will be only too happy to take it on. In an economic environment where interest rates are escalating weekly to intolerable levels, where inflation is rocketing back into double figures with the consumer price index for the last quarter taking it up to 11.3 per cent, where unemployment is back to its 1980 peak after appearing to level out for a time last year, where new job creations are falling sharply despite all the Government's crowing last year about the underlying rate of job creation and all its predictions to the contrary, where the Budget deficit is ballooning out to $800m to $1,000m when it was supposed to be $500m less than last year, and where the overall growth rate is clearly not going to do anything like reach the targeted figure of 3.5 per cent-taking all this and adding to it the iniquitous package of sales tax measures which the Senate is, I believe, about to reject-it is easy to see why it is that we in the Opposition are only too delighted to contemplate a double dissolution election at any time the Government dares to call one on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating an attempt by this Government to expand indirect taxation by applying a cruel tax to many essential household items. Indirect taxation is regarded by many of this country 's top economists as a very regressive tax in that it hits hardest the people who can least afford it. The low income earners, the unemployed and pensioners all have to pay the same amount of particular indirect taxes as the very wealthy in the community; in other words, a much higher proportion of their income. The study by Neil Warren of the University of New South Wales clearly shows this to be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These Bills now before us-the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981 [No . 2] 1982-are seeking to increase this inequality and place an even greater burden on the poor and underprivileged sections of the Australian community. This Government is trying to extract a further $330m of revenue from taxpayers on top of the huge increases in pay-as-you-earn tax collections expected this year. Let us look at how the proposed increases in these taxes will affect people this financial year. While a wage earner receiving $14,500 can expect to gain a pay rise of around 13.5 per cent this year, his tax will go up by a massive 17 per cent. At the same time, a person earning $10,000 can expect to pay 20 per cent more in tax, while a person living near the poverty line will be paying a huge increase in tax of 33 per cent. So clearly, the proposed sales tax increases will make the poor get poorer while the rich get richer as they continue their tax evasion practices. This Government has the audacity to quibble about $330m a year in lost revenue, while tax evasion is costing the ordinary Australian taxpayers $7,000m each year. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has rightly pointed out, tax evasion practices by the wealthiest 10 per cent of the population and by industry are costing the average Australian household $30 per week. That $30 could be used to help pay rocketing home mortgage repayments, higher health charges and all the other everyday living costs that have spiralled over the last 12 months under the Fraser Government. This Government is interested in raking in as much taxation revenue as it can just to hold down the growth in the money supply, which it says will reduce inflation. However, it has added to inflationary pressures by increasing sales taxes, and in doing so has become the highest taxing government in Australia's history. Since Mr Fraser came to power, pay-as-you-earn taxes have increased from 41.7 per cent of total tax revenue to 45.7 per cent. At the same time, taxes collected from the business and property sectors have decreased from 13.1 per cent to 9.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the taxation figures for other Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development countries we find that Australia has a higher proportion of total tax revenue coming from indirect taxes than the OECD average . Australia's taxation rate is higher than that in many countries, including Canada, the United States of America, West Germany and Japan. We also have a higher proportion of tax revenue coming from income taxes than the OECD average. Yet, when we look at company taxes, we see that the OECD is higher than Australia's figure. So it is quite clear that a case exists for lowering the tax burden on Australia's wage and salary earners. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget period the Government's total taxation revenue is expected to increase by $5,569m and of this total amount $3,134m will come from wage and salary earners. Next year wage and salary earners will be paying at least a further $5,000m. Yet this Government is trying to squeeze even more money from the Australian people without providing any offsetting reduction in income taxes . It is all very well for Mr Howard to say that these sales taxes are the beginning of an attempt to broaden the indirect tax base, but how can any so- called restructuring of taxation occur without any corresponding reduction in income tax collections? How can Mr Howard justify increasing sales taxes without providing income tax relief for Australia's lower and middle income earners? Most of all, how can he justify forcing pensioners, the unemployed and the poverty stricken to pay this cruel tax on essential items when they are already struggling to pay their rent, electricity and gas bills?</PARA>
<PARA> The decision by this Government to impose sales taxes on essential items, and indeed its decision to increase a whole range of sales taxes, is just part of its crippling economic strategy. As a result of the Howard Budget, unemployment is at least 6.3 per cent and rising. Interest rates are out of control and are set to rise again shortly. Surely the clearest indication that the Government's policies are not working is that inflation is rising again. This Government is following the same type of monetary policies as Mrs Thatcher is following in Britain-policies which have taken that country's unemployment total to nearly four million. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to another reason for opposing the imposition of taxes on essential items: namely, the crippling effect they will have on sections of the Australian economy. For instance, the sales tax on building materials will drive yet another nail into the coffin of the building industry in Australia and will add hundreds of dollars to the cost of the average home. Dwelling approvals in Australia are already at their lowest level for years, as a direct result of the Fraser Government's economic policies. High interest rates have already hit many young home buyers, and have even forced some people to sell off their homes as mortgage repayments have gone beyond their means. With another one percentage point rise in interest rates just around the corner, hundreds more Australians will be forced to give up that great Australian dream. The last thing the building industry wants now is a tax induced price rise on building materials. This is particularly so in South Australia, where the building industry has been ailing not only because of Fraser Government interest rates but also because of a totally incompetent State Government under Mr Tonkin. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it incredible that members of this Government have the nerve to criticise the Opposition for stopping the Government ripping off another $330m from Australian taxpayers. Yet they are from the same parties that blocked a whole Budget in 1975. It is my view, and the view of the Australian Labor Party, that the Australian people have had enough of this Government's restrictive economic policies. They are sick of crippling income taxes, forever increasing interest rates and this Government's pathetic attempt to impose even more taxes by way of these sales taxes on essential items. These Bills must be opposed in the interests of the Australian community, especially the poor and the needy and everyone else who is struggling for survival under the cruel and harsh economic policies of the Fraser Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Government's revised emphasis taxation policies. At this stage of the debate I will be brief because I think most of the points involved have already been well covered. The information that comes to us from bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development indicates that Australia is not highly taxed overall but that our personal income tax rates are high. As we all know, once tax rates start to get higher, incentive declines and evasion becomes more desirable. It brings out the worst in decent people and even encourages some to become crooks. It places undue burdens on people's fundamental honesty and produces a whole range of undesirable sidelines in their behaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that a tax on goods is quite a fair tax to the extent that people with little money pay little tax and people with much money pay much tax. Under the scales of sales tax, the less necessary goods are, the more the rate of tax on them rises. That is an important point to remember. The rate of tax paid by people with more money works out to be a considerable amount higher than for those on lower ranges. I am against tax-all taxes-in any form. I should like to know who is not against taxes. While there is a move for certain sections of the community to pay less tax, I am not sure whether I am clear from the arguments as to who is supposed to pay the extra tax or in what form that is to come. If the groups that were specifically mentioned by the previous speaker, Senator Foreman, were to pay less tax where would we go? Would we look to the farmers? I think if we looked at them we would find that their incomes had a fairly nasty battering in the last year or two. So, I do not think we are likely to get much joy from having another run at the farmers at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Do we look to the miners? We are told of the enormous wealth of these nasty, multinational mining companies. But the figures I have seen in the last few days indicate that no miner of any consequence in Australia is making enormous profits that we can have a rattle at. Is it small business that we are looking to? Will we have another clean-up around small business? Are we looking to the manufacturers who are trying at the moment to cope with wage rises of, in the main, $30 or $40 a week? I do not think we will get much more out of them this year. Yet, we want to give tax cuts. Everybody would like to see tax cuts. At the same time we are looking for areas where we will provide more money. </PARA>
<PARA> I was going through a few copies of Hansard a little while ago just to see the areas where honourable senators opposite have suggested that we ought to be providing more money. I found reference to where more money was needed for housing, interest subsidies, Canberra development, the construction industry, setting up another Medibank, education of all sorts, all the items that were covered under the Review of Commonwealth Functions, buying South West Tasmania, assistance for small business, roads, more Public Service staff, more unemployment benefits, more migrant education payments, bigger and better pensions, school-to-work transition programs and the revision of apprenticeship schemes. If we are to start to look for money for all those things it has to come from somewhere. Do we revert to the old system and say, as Jim Cairns would say: 'We will run it off the printing press'? That is the only alternative. If we are not going to raise the money we have to print it. We have to have it before we can spend it. That is fairly fundamental. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do not get the money somebody will be short. Is it that we will cut the States short? Is it that we will cut local governments short? Will we start to go over the list of budgetary items that came out in the last Budget and say: ' Well, perhaps we had better rethink how much we are paying each child under the family allowance scheme'? Do we cut back assistance for Aboriginals, health, defence, education, employment and training schemes? All these items have had allocations made to them. We just need to have a look at these now and say: ' Well, if we do not have the money, what will we do?' Do we cut back assistance for industry? Do we cut back funding for research, culture or education? I have already mentioned housing. We have to start to look at the actual areas where money can be provided. Revenue either comes from taxes or from money not spent. It has to be one way or the other. When I look at that list of things that I mentioned on which the honourable senators opposite would like to spend money, I see that we can find that money only by a printing press job. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans made the same old comments and endeavoured to justify them by saying that the matter is not crucial, is not a matter of survival and is not vital. What he has not told us even yet is how big the matter needs to be before he considers it to be crucial or vital. Does he have a limit? By whose standards do we determine the size that is necessary? How many times can we do something before it becomes vital? It sounds to me like the rather crude expression of ' being a little bit pregnant'. I am not sure at what stage one ceases to be in one condition and starts to be in another. I do not think Senator Evans does either, nor has he taken the trouble to try to explain it. Having seen the notes of some of the comments he has made at lectures to Labor lawyers and at various other places I can see that he certainly is not very sure himself. I do not really see that there is any reason he would be able to explain it to us any better than he can explain it to others. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, for me it is a matter of yes or no. Senator Evans's proposition has an enormous grey area. I think before we can start to take his proposition in any way seriously we need to have some limits put on it by him as to exactly what is involved. I do not see that there is any difference in principle whether it is big money or little money. I have always had a rule in my family that I never let my children refer to any amount of money with the word 'only' in front of it . It is money; it does not matter whether it is 2c or $2. One does not say 'only '. Exactly the same thing applies here. Money may buy an aircraft carrier or provide assistance to an unmarried mother, but it is still money. </PARA>
<PARA> I learnt this another way. I remember that once when I was fairly young I was engaged in a business dealing when a gentleman made an offer-a six figure offer- for a particular property in which I was involved. I went to the owner and said to him: 'Look, it's very close. It's within $5,000 of the price. I think it's pretty good'. He said: 'Boy, remember it's $5,000, and $5,000 is exactly the same amount of money to me as it is to you'. That is the sort of attitude that we need to take. It is not a matter of saying: 'Oh, it is only a little bit, it doesn't matter if the Budget only runs over by a little bit'. It runs over by an amount of money, and every dollar is a dollar that has to come from somewhere. It is exactly the same whoever and wherever the money comes from. I am somewhat appalled at the total disregard for any discussion on the management of the Budget, the size of the deficit and whether it should exist-nobody seems to worry. Some say: 'Oh, it's only a little bit and it doesn't matter'. Well, it does matter. The deficit has to be taken into account. There is no way it can just be simply ignored on the basis that it will go away or we will pick it up next year. Every dollar that is not raised has to come from somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I comment on the one phrase used many times by the previous speaker, Senator Foreman, that it is a cruel tax. Let us just look at this in some sort of perspective. If inflation is running at, say, 10 per cent, an item that costs $ 10 will go up by $1. A sales tax of 2 1/2 per cent will add 25c. Some of the things that have gone up by $10, $20, $50 or something like that at this stage would incur a tax of, say, 50c. As I heard said last night it would be half a cent on a newspaper. We have had a massive canvassing program from newspaper publishers around Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> I would not be doing the right thing if I did not make some comment about our friends in the minority party. Much has been said about their situation, and I have heard all the quotations that have been used but when I pause for a minute to ask myself 'What does it show?' I am a little like Senator Evans. I can really only feel sorry for them. But I do not want to go over all the bits and pieces. It is a pity for this place that things have happened the way they have. I think it is probably most unfortunate for the Australian Democrats. This is the first real test that the party has had to face in this chamber. The result is now for history to determine. I believe the likelihood is that when Senator Mason faces St Peter he will be quoted the bottom line that he has referred to over and over again. I am equally sure that he will find that every newspaper in Australia will remember that term, certainly at the next election, and, depending on the results of that election, perhaps the one after that. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly have no difficulties or doubts in supporting the legislation before the chamber. I have no doubts as to the correctness of an indirect tax as a means of spreading the taxation burden reasonably through the community. I certainly believe that the present rate of personal income tax is too high and I would like to see various changes made to it. I would like to see a reversion to the States being responsible for raising more of the money that they spend. I believe that they should be encouraged to undertake a greater responsibility in these matters than they now have. Many speakers have gone over the details of the bits and pieces of the Bill. I certainly support the Government legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes available to me I will confine myself to some of the remarks made by Senator Archer, who has just resumed his seat. I saw that he was getting his riding instructions to sit down. Early in the piece he made a vague reference to small business and criticised the Australian Labor Party, or the Opposition generally, for creating problems in that area. He might like to be reminded that more small businesses, and fairly large businesses, have gone bankrupt since December 1975 under the two governments with which Senator Archer has been associated than had gone bankrupt in the previous 20 years. It is largely as a result of the activities of this Government that so many bankruptcies are occurring not only in my State of Queensland but also in many other places. I am appalled. In my electoral office we help some of our less fortunate constituents who are trying to run a small business, sometimes not with the best of managerial expertise, in restructuring their businesses, consolidating loans and generally trying to put them back on the track. Most times we are able to succeed but of course some have gone so far into the red that it is just not possible to pull them out of the problems in which they find themselves as a direct result of the activities of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Archer proceeded to read out a number of things that are included in the Australian Labor Party policies which were enunciated prior to the last Federal election, many of which, of course, we will continue to use. In offering his criticism, he asked: 'How are you going to get the money?' The thing that amazes me is that this Government has all sorts of devious ways of trying to get money. I had a constituent ring me the other day, apparently over some small account with a particular department. The department had discovered that some two years ago that person had sent in a cheque 10c short of the amount that was required. The matter was not raised at the time but following the activities of the razor gang and with razor gang No. 2 now looking around and digging up old accounts, he got a bill for 10c, with a 24c stamp on it. That is a remarkable example of expertise in bookkeeping. It is no wonder that this country is going bankrupt. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not keep the Senate long. The 34th annual report of the Australian Egg Board is signed by Mr Ray Fuge, Chairman of the Australian Egg Board, a very distinguished person of many years standing in the South Australian poultry industry. It gives a comprehensive report on the operation of the Board and on the production and export of eggs from Australia. The matter that I want to raise tonight is the lack of any proper regulations in the Australian Capital Territory to ensure that Australian Capital Territory residents get good quality eggs. Last Saturday I visited a shop-I will not name it-in one of the suburbs of Canberra. Much to my horror stacked up layer after layer were fillers with two and a half dozen eggs on each. On examination I found that the majority of these eggs were second quality eggs. They were being fobbed off to the public here in the Australian Capital Territory. I made inquiries today of the Department of the Capital Territory and I was informed that there are no proper regulations governing the retail sale of eggs in the Australian Capital Territory. I make a plea tonight that something be done about this because recently the Australian Agricultural Council granted a huge extension of the quota applying in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> There are only two poultry farming organisations in the Territory. One organisation has a near monopoly. The other is a very small enterprise. It is the organisation with a virtual monopoly which is selling these eggs. Such eggs would not be allowed to be sold in any of the States in Australia, which have very rigid and strict regulations for quality and inspection of eggs. There is no inspection of eggs which are offered for sale to the residents of the Australian Capital Territory. I hope that the Government will quickly take some action to ensure that regulations covering the sale of eggs to consumers in the Australian Capital Territory are introduced and that those regulations are in conformity with the regulations and standards which govern the retail sale of eggs in every State in Australia. There are often complaints that eggs that go through the various State egg boards are of poor quality. I deny that because eggs that go through the egg boards are properly handled, properly inspected and properly cared for. That is not so with regard to eggs that are sold in retail outlets in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> With those few remarks I again make a plea that some action be taken by the Department of the Capital Territory to ensure as quickly as possible that all eggs offered for sale in the Australian Capital Territory are governed by proper regulations and conform with proper health standards. I was informed that the only time eggs offered for retail sale in the Australian Capital Territory are inspected is when the Department gets a complaint from a customer. Very few customers know that they have the right to complain about the quality of eggs. Once one breaks an egg, of course, one cannot put it back in the shell and take it back to the person one bought it from; it is in the pan or the saucepan and it has gone. I make the plea that some regulations be introduced to govern the quality of eggs that are offered for sale in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources outlined earlier, this is one of the most significant reports produced by this Senate for many years. I think it is somewhat disappointing that this parliamentary debate has lagged so far behind the tabling of the report. To some extent its contents have been overtaken by subsequent events, particularly the very severe recession in the aluminium industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think some features of the Press reporting of the report were quite disappointing. I quote one such report:</PARA>
<PARA> Alcoa Reacts Angrily to the Senate Committee Report. </PARA>
<PARA>Another one was:</PARA>
<PARA> Senators call for a resource/rental tax of the Aluminium Industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think those headlines necessarily reflected the balanced approach which the report itself tried to provide. On the other hand, we must acknowledge that there was some very good and useful reporting. I would particularly like to compliment Alan Thornhill of Australian Associated Press on his cool analysis of the aluminium industry which I believe provided readers with a succinct and reasonable appraisal of the Committee's work. </PARA>
<PARA> In retrospect I think that maybe the Committee should have placed a little more emphasis on the fact that the industry is by and large export oriented. Perhaps it should have developed a little more deeply some of the problems that the industry has to cope with in an export oriented world, including fluctuating world prices, exchange movements and the need for government to determine consistent policies, particularly with respect to taxation. Such matters as depreciation and the rate at which fixed assets are amortised into the general costing streams I believe should not only have relevance to the Australian environment but should also be related to what other countries adopt as acceptable methods of utilising their asset costs into the general stream of expenses. I do not think it is entirely relevant for export oriented industries merely to be compared with, say, manufacturers in the normal sense which cater purely for the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the big problems is that the mining industry is faced with a proliferation of taxation systems, which is a matter to which the Committee directed attention. We believe there needs to be a co-ordinated approach in this area. Our report drew attention to the competition between the States to get smelters set up. Some concern was expressed by consumers, particularly of electricity, that they may have been subsidising the cost of electricity to those companies. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Thomas, pointed out in an interview that certain local authorities, he believed, were negotiating totally blind without any guidance. To some extent local authorities have not had a lot of expertise in this area. There were difficulties not only for the aluminium companies because of a lack of precedent but also for the local authorities. We pointed out certain problems of an overconcentration of aluminium smelters in a particular area, particularly when there is a downturn in economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> When this inquiry was first embarked upon there was a general euphoria about the benefits that the aluminium industry would provide for Australia. Some of us had certain feelings of disquiet about this enthusiasm. Other authorities had mentioned the problems of diamond price fluctuations in prices over the years. I refer to the Industries Assistance Commission report on this matter. There was in certain areas concern about the world over-supply of aluminium. This subsequently manifested itself in places such as Japan which had high costs of energy input. Fortunately, in Australia we have not seen the sorry spectacle of an aluminium smelter closing. This has happened overseas. It is true that a number of development projects in Australia have been severely curtailed. In Scotland people saw the sorry spectacle of the closure of an aluminium smelter at Invergordon, which in the 1960s was supposed to be the showplace of what were called the new energy related industries. This closure in an isolated place in Scotland brought about the dismissal of 900 employees. The British Government in recent times came to the conclusion that the British taxpayer could not afford the burdensome cost of keeping the smelter operating in view of the increased energy costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Committee too expressed concern about an over-concentration of smelters in certain areas such as the Hunter Valley and south-west Western Australia. An economic downturn could have dramatic and economic social effects in those regions. There is a current oversupply of aluminium. In Japan one group of smelters is operating at 64 per cent capacity. In the United Kingdom there are severe restrictions on output. The same situation pertains in the United States of America. I wish to respond to some of the criticisms that were directed to the report. Some were not necessarily criticisms of the Committee's report because they failed to distinguish between the Committee's role and the Government's responsibility. I think this was pretty important. At the same time , our report did not attempt to be a completely exhaustive portrayal of all aspects of the aluminium industry. It did not attempt to identify individual culprits in socially dubious activities such as transfer pricing and tax avoidance et cetera. However, we mentioned that the aluminium industries provided opportunities for a fertile ground for these kinds of practices and we identified certain companies' practices. In other areas we painted with a very broad brush and some companies subsequently felt that they were inevitably caught within the net and were therefore presumed to be culprits. It was not the purpose of the inquiry to carry out an inquisition into who was avoiding tax and who was not. </PARA>
<PARA> The report brought a very interesting response from ordinary people around Australia. I had one response from a young man, Warwick Smith, in Launceston. He believed:</PARA>
<PARA> The report illustrates the importance of a senate committee system. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a tribute to the Committee. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> A detailed consideration of many problems and aspects of national life would escape focus and review without the present system of committees . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I believe this is an acknowledgement from one person in Australia of the importance of our committee system. Somebody mentioned last night the need for a feedback. This sort of feedback is important to show that we are contributing something to our national responsibilities. Therefore, I seek leave to have page one of Mr Smith's letter incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<TITLE>Re: Committee on National Resources.</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for the copy of the Committee's report on the development of the Bauxite and Aluminium industries.</PARA>
<PARA> I dare say you have had much expert feedback on the report as the topic is one that requires a degree of specialisation, however, from a layman's viewpoint I would make some comments.</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The report illustrates yet again the importance of a separate committee system. A detailed consideration of many problems and aspects of national life would escape focus and review without the present system of committees; if anything they should be expanded.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. (Page 54). The final recommendation re standing in the courts is of particular interest. The Australian Law Reform Commission recently produced a report on class actions which is also related in some regard to the question of standing. Should both concepts i.e. class actions and liberalised standing, be introduced into the Australian Legal System it would, I believe, be to the community benefit. The topic requires much more discussion but the Committee has highlighted a failing in the present Australian Legal System.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. (Page 33) While I acknowledge the Government's recent announcement with regard to the ''tightening'' of foreign investment guidelines in Australia the issue is, though seemingly dormant, potentially an explosive one. '' Australianism'' is growing in this country and is supported by all political parties in various ways. Foreign investment in Australia becomes emotive where it seems that the investment is such as to deprive Australians of the benefits of that investment. By urging increased equity participation by Australian owned companies and projects and establishing the financial climate for increased partnership arrangements between Australian companies and foreign investors, the Committee is giving voice to what many believe is the minimum acceptable for foreign investment. The recommendation to publish lists of Australian and foreign equity in mineral ventures is laudable. However, I feel more pressure should be exerted towards achieving ''Caltex'' type arrangements. The increased institutional investment in resource projects is one growing source of funds. An immediate adoption of the budget announcement to remove double taxation of dividends and thus entice the small investor into the share market may well be another.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comments on the report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources entitled 'The Development of the Bauxite, Alumina and Aluminium Industries'. This report is of particular interest to me for a number of reasons. In the first place, I was a member of the Committee and involved in the investigation that went on prior to the writing of the report. I had the same contribution as others in the writing of the report. The second reason why it is of particular interest to me is that I am one of the two senators who represent the Northern Territory in this place. There is a mining and refining project at Gove. I am particularly interested in the relationship between the company and the Aborigines at Yirrkala. This parochial situation exists because of the situation in the Northern Territory. Another aspect which was of particular interest to us during the inquiry was the local government involvement in the bauxite, alumina and aluminium industries, particularly as it related to the establishment of refineries and the infrastructure needed by a large group such as a refinery. As part of this we were looking at the impact of the industry on the community. The last general interest that I had in this project was the way in which Australian people would benefit from the exploitation of Australia's resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We visited Gove. Those who were on the plane will remember that the Gove Peninsula, with its twin communities of Yirrkala and Nhulunbuy, is a delightful place. Although it is on a main route between Darwin and Cairns and is part of the Northern Territory it is isolated. It is interesting to note that the people living there, the people in the company, talk not of going on holidays but of getting out. A person will say: 'I am getting out in November', meaning he is going on holidays. Normally he is going back home although home might be overseas. It was interesting to note what could perhaps be called the siege mentality of people who live in an isolated area such as Gove, with all its amenities. I do not want to speak much about the place but it is delightful. Each of the homes is air conditioned. There is every sport imaginable. It has most of the pastimes a person would want such as archery, shooting, racing, sailing and fishing. In fact, it is very difficult to think of pursuits that we carry on in our leisure time that are not available there. The town is a beautiful place. Over $1m was spent on putting down turf. It is to all appearances one of the most beautiful spots in the Northern Territory, yet because of the sort of mentality to which I have referred people talk about getting out. </PARA>
<PARA> People in the Northern Territory, prior to the inquiry and certainly since, have some ideas about the company and its operations. I am not saying that the ideas which they put forward are necessarily true, but they are pretty generally held. It may be of interest, as background, to go through some of these. Before I discuss them, I tell honourable senators that I know the area fairly well. I visited Yirrkala before the mining company moved into Nhulunbuy. I went there many times in my former occupation. I have been a frequent visitor since. So I have watched the growth of the company and the impact of mining on the Aboriginal people in the area and the general impact of the mine on the economy of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of these generally held views of the people of the Northern Territory. The first one is that the company paid no taxes for years and that it got away with this by transfer pricing. I wonder whether this is true. Let us have a look at what the report says. Page 26 says:</PARA>
<PARA> The second example involves two subsidiaries of Alusuisse, Swiss Aluminium Australia, which owns 70 per cent of the Gove Joint Venture and ISAL, an aluminium smelter in Iceland. It has been suggested that the price of alumina ex Gove has 'increased at sea' before arrival in Iceland and that freight rates have been manipulated with the object of minimising taxable income in both Australia and Iceland. This matter is currently under investigation by the Australian Taxation Office and Icelandic authorities. On the evidence available to the Committee it does appear that the costing of alumina traded between Australia and Iceland has been carried out with the object of maximizing profit to the parent company at the expense of taxation and other charges paid in both Australia and Iceland. However, further comment on this matter should, properly, be deferred until investigation of it is completed. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend to go ahead because the situation, as suggested, is being investigated. But I do see a need for government to make sure that the companies do not cheat the Australian people. I use that word carefully because it is suggested by most of us that if a company from overseas, or a company from within Australia, for that matter, is exploiting an Australian resource, the people from all over Australia should profit from it. For years, Australia has had a frightened fawn approach to overseas companies. This is a fair comment to make. The real attitude of most State governments-or some of them-was to give overseas companies anything they asked for, to set up the infrastructure they required and hope that something good would come out of it. Queensland is a fairly good example. In Queensland we see that in some places there are railways to a hole in the ground as the only contribution left after the mining company has gone and taken the profits of the mining venture with it. I do not think I have to persuade people on either side of this chamber that this sort of situation must change. We must see the Australian people getting a fair return for the resources which belong to Australia and to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that we all accept that companies are in the business of getting the best possible deal for their shareholders and the greatest possible profit. We must see also that local government and State and Federal governments get the best deal for Australia. I will dwell on this point. We discussed it with a number of the local government groups, many of which still have the traditional frightened fawn approach that if they ask the companies for something they might not come and the local government would miss out. It is quite clear that we need skilled negotiators at all levels. It was interesting to see that in some cases there were skilled negotiators. But we certainly must overcome this frightened fawn approach. We must make sure that we appreciate that the company is out to get the best possible deal, particularly a company coming from outside. We like to feel that Australia is one of the affluent countries, and so it is. We like to feel that it is one of the developed countries, and so it is partially. It certainly is one of the lucky countries. But many overseas developers look at us simply as a source of raw material. They look at us no differently from the way in which they look at some of what we regard as Third World countries. They are out to make deals with the local people which will give the greatest possible return to their company. We have an obligation to make sure that we do the best for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember that representatives of the Australian Mining Industry Council came to visit the Australian Labor Party Caucus committee on national resources. Among the many comments made to us was one which I thought was particularly significant. That Council said that government should make clear to any company- we are talking about exploitation of resources-exactly what it wants. The company could then decide whether it thought it was worth while coming in to exploit the resources. The major complaint that the Council had was that companies made certain arrangements but they were changed afterwards. This was felt to be unfair. I think that that is a proposition that most honourable senators would go along with. Of course, we have to buy in the skill that we may not have to make sure that we can negotiate fully to get the greatest return for the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The second general feeling of people from the Northern Territory that I am talking about is that the Aboriginal people are not given jobs, that they are not getting a fair deal in that regard. Those honourable senators who read the newspapers at the time of the development of both Gove and Groote Eylandt might remember that a suggestion was made that the Aboriginal people ought to be given jobs and that they ought to be included at appropriate levels of the work force. Company policy at Gove-this is recorded in our report-is that everybody has the same chance irrespective of whether he is black or white. If we take that to the extreme, all graduates, black or white, would be considered in the same way. We all know that this is nonsense. There are not a great many Aboriginal graduates from the universities. Aborigines need to be given an opportunity. They need to be given special conditions of work because they do not approach work in the same way as we approach it, they do not have the same ethics. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that Aboriginal people have contracted to cut lawns and to collect garbage. I think we want to see a bit more than that. There are very few in the actual work force in the mine or in the plant. This is in contrast with the situation in the Groote Eylandt Mining Co. I have an advantage over my fellow members of the Committee in that I know that situation well. We did not examine it so I am interpolating my own views on this matter. But certainly, the situation at GEMCO on Groote Eylandt is that every encouragement is given to Aboriginal people to take part. Not only encouragement is given; assistance is also given in the way of special training. I am very pleased to report-I think I may have done this in the chamber before-the wonderful co-operation that exists between the Department of Education in the Northern Territory and the Groote Eylandt Mining Company in preparing the young men to take what are quite prestigious positions as drivers of the heavy machinery and trucks. Aboriginal people seem to have an aptitude for driving heavy machinery. They learn it very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to say that the general view of the people in the Territory that Aboriginal people are not assisted is a reasonable one. I had some personal experience of this in my former occupation when I went to a company with a man who was responsible for encouraging the employment of Aboriginal people by major companies in the Northern Territory. A group of four of us visited a company- this is going back to the late 1960s-and we were far from welcome. The people there made it quite clear that they were not at all interested in the propositions we put forward. On the other side of the coin, there are some people in the Northern Territory who say that the Aboriginal people have too much to say in the control of the mine. This is a value judgment-one that I personally do not support-but the general feeling among the community is that the royalties which are paid, either directly or through the Government, are very little compensation for what has happened to the community since the mining moved in. I refer to the disruptions to life, the drunkenness and the prostitution. This all seems to be part of what happens when a mining group moves in close to an Aboriginal community. I am not saying that it is necessarily so but certainly this has happened in most mining areas of Australia . </PARA>
<PARA> After the report had been laid on the table by our Chairman, some additional comments were made. Quite a number of the comments concerned a phrase which we used on page 1 of the report relating to the need for a secure and predictable framework. This goes beyond the on-site infrastructure that we talk about later on and beyond simply local government which is basically that sort of infrastructure although it is assisted by the State. It goes beyond the State and Commonwealth organisations but looks as well at the total economic climate and the attitude of government towards the establishment of the mining community . I will read from a letter written to the Committee by the aluminium firm Alcoa of Australia Ltd. The letter states on page 2:</PARA>
<PARA> Your Committee's report comments on Alcoa's power supply and pricing problems in Victoria. This comment itself qualifies the alleged political and economic stability of Australia and shows that the further processing of Australian national resources is not the dominant objective of government policy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a criticism directed not at the report but at the Federal Government. I will repeat the state- ment:</PARA>
<PARA> The further processing of Australian national resources is not the dominant objective of government policy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 3 of the letter Alcoa, in talking of the Federal and State economic policies, said:</PARA>
<PARA> There continues to be a lack of co-ordination between Federal and State Government, and between Government and Government instrumenalities, to ensure that Australia's national development policies are carried out. Unless the Federal and State Government economic policies are consistent in their application to new projects and Government instrumentalities have the financial capability to implement these policies, then the successful achievement of national objectives will not take place. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter states on page 4:</PARA>
<PARA> In reviewing the Federal, State and semi-government policies, it is clear that funding is often arranged on a year-by-year basis. While this policy may be relevant at a Federal level, it is contrary to sound financial practice for an instrumentality when funding long-term investment in a power station. </PARA>
<PARA>They are a number of criticisms of Federal Government policy towards the development of the bauxite, alumina and aluminium industries. A general point has been made that the industry has slumped since the publication of our report. I am glad to say that this was not actually blamed on the Committee, but the fact was simply noted that there had been a slump since the Committee produced its report. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the implication is that the recommendations of the Committee no longer apply. I quite clearly reject that proposition. Good management-that is the key of our report; I am sure we could say that-is more important in slump conditions obviously than it is in boom conditions. Almost anyone can handle a boom condition. That is why we have a proliferation of projects in boom conditions. I make the point strongly that good management is needed when the industry is marginal. That is all I have to say on this matter except to add that I support my fellow members of the Committee on calling on the Government to implement the recommendations of the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not my intention to speak tonight to the report of the Standing Committee on National Resources on the development of the bauxite, alumina and aluminium industries. But as I discovered that there seemed to be some sort of difference between the view of the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Thomas, and at least one other honourable senator, Senator Tate, that the recommendations were in conflict in respect of the proposal for a resource tax, I thought that I ought to burden the Senate for a few minutes. Page 28 of the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee believes that any review of the current taxation applying to resources based industries should include consideration of the use of a resource rent tax or other variable tax on profit. </PARA>
<PARA>To me that reeks of the perhaps insidious wording that could have been incorporated by one of the sophisticated lawyers from the other side concerning the proposition that there ought to be a review of the taxation arrangements and that they, inherently, ought to include a resource tax. On that matter I have a very strong view, so I am moved to make some observations. It seems to me there has been quite a bit of academic debate about the justification for a resource rental tax. As I understand it the situation the Australian Labor Party would seek to have a resource rental tax because it believes a very significant amount of excess taxation is being kept unto the mining companies. This is money which it believes should quite properly be returned to its alleged rightful owners, the other taxpayers in Australia. It has been argued that minerals are owned by the Crown and therefore the inherent right of the Crown to provide a licence to the mining companies to exploit those minerals gives the Crown a special privilege to demand an economic rent. I would have thought that if that formula and proposal is to be presented in respect of mineral exploitation the same thing ought to apply to farmers given a monopoly over the price of land which the Crown owns by right. Also it would apply to such monopolies as airline companies, banks, television stations--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps it may be a bit more sophisticated than Senator Grimes normally hears from his side. With respect, Senator Grimes should try to hear it from our side. It seems to me there is a belief in the community that the mining industry has a capacity to continue to pay and pay enormous amounts of taxation at levels that are not applicable to other sections of industry. I remind the Senate that on present available figures each commercial discovery of minerals costs approximately $50m. For each 1,000 prospects 100 are examined, 10 are drilled and one is brought to production. Drawing on a survey of 117 companies prepared by Coopers and Lybrand Services we see that $2,306m was invested in fixed assets and exploration expenditure in 1980-81. The effective after-tax return on average funds employed was 8.5 per cent. The Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes no figures enabling worthwhile inter-industry profit comparisons to be made. However, in 1976 the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on the petroleum and mining industry found that the average annual return on funds for 27 of the larger mining companies ranged between 11 per cent and 16 per cent for the period 1967-68 to 1973-74. It concluded that there was little difference between the return by the mining companies and the return by the manufacturing companies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was between 1967-68 and 1973-74. It is not easy to find statistics that give a relative comparison on these matters. The management consultant firm, P.A. Consulting Services Pty Ltd, recently published details of median returns on shareholders' funds for the period 1979-80. I make no apology for boring honourable senators with statistics because it seems to me that this is what the argument is all about. The returns on shareholders funds for that period were: Mining, 7.2 per cent; manufacturing, 11.9 per cent; primary production and distribution, 11.4 per cent; building and construction, 8.1 per cent; finance, 9.9 per cent; utilities, 6.7 per cent; retail-wholesale, 7.7 per cent; and vehicle distribution, 4 per cent. That is an average return of 8.36 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly there is little reason to believe that a mining company has some unique resource capacity to pay the punitive taxes which are suggested by the ALP. But sadly there seems to be a belief in the community, at least amongst those of a certain political persuasion, that if we confiscate certain illusory profits made by the mining companies we will have an abundance of wealth to redistribute amongst unidentified people who constitute another group. There is a gloomy view that one must take if one is to be realistic about the prospects of a resource tax solving the problems of government deficits. 'The Australian Mineral Industry Annual Review' of 1979 published by the Bureau of Mineral Resources provides the following statistics of mining profits, including those for oil and gas: Taxable income, $1301.7m; net tax, $588.3m; and net profit, $713m. This represents the theoretical maximum additional revenue which the Government would attract if a 100 per cent resource tax were imposed on profits. </PARA>
<PARA> A further survey, conducted by Cooper and Lybrand, referred to earlier, shows that for the year 1980-81 the total net profit for the whole group surveyed from a total revenue of $5,000m was $442m. In the context of the Federal Government's Budget of $41 billion it seems inconceivable that anyone could put the proposition that a resource tax will, in any way, affect or mitigate that deficit to a position where it is likely to have any beneficial influence upon public sector finances. If we reduce by 50 per cent the profit of mining companies for that one year it will represent 0.5 per cent of total revenue in the Federal Government's Budget. Perhaps the IAC best summed up the proposal of a resource rental tax when it concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission does not recommend the imposition of a super tax on the mining sector for several reasons. First, the effects on resource allocation of discriminatory taxation of the mining sector as a whole, or of individual industries within the sector, are unlikely to be desirable and would in all probability divert resources away from their most efficient uses. The mining sector in Australia is generally low cost and efficient, and resources should not be discouraged from moving into it. Second, the Commission accepts the view of witnesses that, because of the uncertainty in mining operations, some high returns will be necessary to offset the many losses made by mining companies: to the extent that the potential for high returns is reduced by a super tax, investment in the sector will be reduced. Third, the assessment of what constitutes excessive profits is a subjective judgment which the Commission is not qualified to make. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us remember that the Australian Constitution clearly leaves the ownership and control of minerals firmly in the hands of the States, not by accident but by design and perhaps contrary to the view of the centralists who make up at least half the numbers in this chamber. It is certainly a realistic proposition to put that if the Federal Government were so misguided as to seek to introduce a resource rental tax, which it would extract from the mining industry, the State governments' response would be very obvious. Of course they would raise the level of their royalties to the point where there was no income tax to be paid to the Federal Government. The net result of that would be that we would certainly not have a resource tax. We would have mitigation against the income tax paid by the mining companies. I have no doubt that the ALP has very carefully thought that through. What it would do is delete royalties as a tax deduction against net profits. That would lead to a bloodbath between the States and the Federal Government which would certainly be won by the State governments . It would leave the situation wide open and there would be no profits for anybody to take from the mining companies. I am sure there is no prospect of State governments--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not mind engaging in dialogue with honourable senators on the other side except when occasions arise when one hears diatribes spewing from their vulgar mouths one can hardly feel motivated to engage in discussion. One thing has to be made quite clear. There is no prospect of the State governments giving away their prospects, their chances or their legitimate right to raise taxes through royalties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the last 12 months the amount of taxes paid by mining and exploration companies has increased to 60 per cent from 55.9 per cent and from 55.4 per cent the previous year. So the average mining company is paying more than 60 per cent of its gross profits in taxation. While we are all so enthusiastic about examining ways of extracting another pint of blood from the mining companies we ought to look at their profit record for the last 12 months. Alcoa of Australia Ltd had a 60 per cent drop in profits; Australian Mining and Smelting Ltd, a 100 per cent drop; Comalco Ltd, a 62 per cent drop; CRA Ltd, 93 per cent; Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd, 70 per cent; Mount Isa Mines Holdings Ltd, 48 per cent; North Broken Hill Holdings Ltd, 33 per cent; Peko-Wallsend Ltd 92 per cent, before the recent further write-off of its capital costs in a couple of mines; Renison Ltd, a 35 per cent drop; Western Mining Corporation Ltd, a one per cent profit; and EZ Industries Ltd, a 43 per cent drop for a six-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> If somebody can extract further profit from those mining companies and if he is sure it will not send the mining companies bankrupt I would like to know how he can do it. If he can find a way of changing the course of history in respect of taxation which will materially affect this community beyond perhaps one bottle of beer per family per year which is the 100 per cent value which could be extracted from the mining companies by way of a resource rent tax, I would like to know how he will do it. But the panacea rests on the other side with the two honourable senators whose seats are now vacant but who were so virulent a moment ago in their criticism of statistics. I would very much like to hear a substantive argument to the contrary. But of course the silence is deafening. A resource rental tax would be a diabolical and disastrous imposition upon the Australian community at present. It is a misguided belief to think that taxation can be raised for that purpose to change the budgetary position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The cumulative impact of this report by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources is, I believe, quite devastating for governments in Australia. What we have is an indictment of the national government for its passivity, and its reaction politics in the face of developers who want to use our great natural resources, whether minerals or energy. We were astounded at the way in which competitive bidding between State governments led to deals being done merely to ensure the presence of one of more stages of this industry within their borders-deals which were not to the overall benefit of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee was strongly of the view that the pace of development ought to be harnessed to serve national goals and social strategies. We were not saying in an overly centralistic, dictorial way that entrepreneurial choices should be dictated by a central government. But the Committee felt strongly, I believe, that the national government had a responsibility to harness the pace and development of this industry so that social dislocation did not occur, to put it negatively, and, to put it positively, so that the greatest national benefit could accrue to the Australian people from development. On the whole the Committee welcomed this development because of the creation of national wealth generated by an export-oriented industry. The bauxite, then the alumina, is upgraded by smelting it to aluminium. As I will point out later, this so increases the worth of that export product that the national benefit is immeasurably enhanced. Whilst we welcome this industry we were shocked by the lack of political competence and will power at the national level to become involved even in the necessary surveillance of important factors governing it. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess that the prime example was that of electricity tariffs. From evidence given to the Committee by Mr Monaghan of the Department of National Development and Energy, it became quite apparent not only that the Federal Government was not demanding knowledge of electricity tariffs charged by State electricity commissions to the smelters but also that it had not even made a formal request. This staggered me and, I am sure, other members of the Committee. It was the point at which I lost faith in the national Government's ability to harness this development for Australia's interests. It staggered me that State governments or electricity commissions could charge consumers a tariff which was unknown to the national Government, with all the repercussions that that may have on the profitability of the industry and the tax which the national Government might eventually be able to obtain. </PARA>
<PARA> We looked in vain for an overall, national policy. We made this clear on page 10 of our report where we said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned at the overall lack of clear policy on development at the Commonwealth level. </PARA>
<PARA>We provided chapter after chapter as evidence of that concern. I will just highlight some of those matters. I will start with the energy question. We considered it extremely important that all factors of production within Australia be brought into play-energy, natural resources and employment. We were not at all in favour of the coal and bauxite being exported separately overseas in order to be married in some overseas country. It is much better for them to be brought into co-ordination for refining into alumina and then smelting into aluminium. I can give some figures to show how important it is to our economy. When we looked at the Tomago alumimium smelter we noted that its annual export income is expected to be $330m at 1980 prices. This is 2.7 times the income which would be produced by exporting equivalent quantities of coal and alumina and more than seven times the export value of equivalent quantities of bauxite and coal. So to get that sevenfold increase in value for the Australian economy we considered it very important that our coal resources-those great energy resources with which we are blessed-be used in order to convert the bauxite to alumina and then to aluminium. </PARA>
<PARA> We make it very clear in our report that tariffs ought to be charged for electricity which enable the generating authority to recover the full costs of producing and transporting that energy. The generating authority ought also to get a realistic return for consumers funds which are invested by it. We found that sometimes commissions were looking to no more than 3 per cent per annum return on the capital invested in generating and transmitting capacity. We thought that a figure approaching 7 per cent would be much more realistic. In fact we thought that, in order to make very clear to the companies involved the true costs if their industry, perhaps they ought to look to providing electricity generating facilities themselves. Whilst it is true that even the largest smelters may not justify the construction of such an activity, in association with other industries in the same area it may well be that this would be a very realistic way of bringing home to manufacturers of aluminium, or other major products of the type, the true cost of producing that product. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to turn quickly to taxation. The Committee did call on the Commonwealth Government to review, once again, the possibility of imposing what is loosely called a 'resources rental tax' or some other variable tax on profits . The Committee noted that Mr Stone, the Secretary to the Treasury, in a suitably qualified answer, said that he thought it might be an area where it could probably be considered. I will read what the Senate Committee said in order to have it accurately on the record:</PARA>
<PARA> Where an industry's profitability provides a return on its investment significantly greater than that necessary to call forth the investment in the first place then there are valid reasons for considering a higher rate of tax on that 'excess' return on investment. This is particularly the case where, in the provision of services such as electricity to industry, there is some justification for believing that the full value of the resources used to provide that service are not being recovered from the purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA>Two or three points need to be made in relation to the remarks made by Senator Crichton-Browne on this tax. State governments are already levying a resource tax. They are already taking advantage of the fact that the national Government has withdrawn or abdicated from its responsibility to ensure that the wealth generated by a high level of profits above a trigger level return to the Australian community via the national Treasury. As we were completing this report we found it intolerable that, for example, the Northern Territory Government was considering levying a profits-related royalty of some 35 per cent on pre-tax net profits on various projects under way in the Northern Territory. That has been put on the back burner. But in relation to the Ashton Joint Venturers-Senator Crichton-Browne made the point in his question to Senator Carrick this morning-the Western Australian Government has established, by agreement with the Ashton Joint Venturers, a tax regime which will allow that Government to levy a 22 1/2 per cent profits-related tax once profits reach a trigger level of $20m per annum. That is a resources tax. It is a tax on profits from these highly profitable industries which are using our-'our' in the sense of 'our nation's'-great natural resources. State government after State government, in disguised ways such as special levies on the transport by rail of these products, is perceiving that where we have a highly profitable industry there is an opportunity to recover greater taxes than would simply be generated by normal company tax or simple royalty levies.</PARA>
<PARA> Rather than have State governments entering into an alliance with these great project developers, we are saying that the national Government has a responsibility to move into that area to secure revenue. This is only a further sharing of profits between the community and the company when a trigger point is reached. It is important to emphasise that point. However, I concede one point to Senator Crichton-Browne. A resources rent tax ought to be confined to a project by project assessment. It ought not to be levied in a way which, to my mind anyway, would be to the detriment of the national Treasury. It ought not be looked at company by company. The company would swallow up the profits, just as Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd swallows up the profits derived from Bass Strait. The profits are swallowed up in subsidising the steel division from time to time. The resources rent tax would have to be looked at project by project. The highly profitable nature of the project over a period would attract a further special sharing by the national Treasury. It is a truly progressive tax geared to capacity to pay. To that extent I think it actually has the support of most of the Australian people. </PARA>

In such a situation it is felt that the community should share in such generation of profits beyond those which would normally be required to call forth investment decisions on those types of projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of ownership. It is very important that this Senate Committee, perhaps for the first time in this Parliament, pointed out on page 32 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA> Foreign ownership, particularly where the Australian branch is only part of a highly mobile transnational operation, carries with it a number of risks. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very important that a Senate committee has noted that risks are attached to the inviting into this country of transnational corporations to conduct part of their business. The risks, of course, are not insuperable and it should not be supposed that such transnational companies will engage in fraudulent or misleading practices such as would reduce the wealth circulating in the Australian community. There is no doubt that those who are responsive and responsible to shareholders involved in the exploration, production and further processing of these mineral and energy resources have their primary responsibility to those shareholders, although their interests may not coincide with Australia's national interest. It is as simple a proposition as that. The pace at which an industry may wish to exploit our resources may be faster than that which would best serve or coincide with the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that this industry with its international aspects is good for Australia. In fact, the only way that Australia can benefit from its great bauxite deposits is to become involved with these great international, highly integrated and vertically integrated corporations. We recognise that we will not have access to markets for our aluminium and bauxite unless we enter into a constructive partnership with these corporations. We are firmly of the view that participation by foreign investors in this industry is to be welcomed. Nevertheless, we believe that foreign investment guidelines need to be set in a way which encourages increasing Australian participation in those projects. This is not entirely to do with sharing in profits by way of dividends. The Committee found-it did so certainly to my surprise-that the wealth generated by way of dividends is, in fact, only a very small part of the wealth generated for the benefit of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> We looked at the operations by Alcoa of Australia in 1980 and found that it made the following payments within Australia-I think Senator Crichton-Browne will be interested in this: Taxes and royalties, $100m; dividends, $23m; interest and other expenses, $7m and materials, wages and services, $566m. That is where the benefit to Australia lies. That is why we ought to be welcoming these great developments. In my view we should not-I think I differ with Senator Watson and perhaps with members of my party on this aspect-be overly obsessed with Australian ownership if it is thought of as a means of sharing in dividends and profits because profits and dividends are only a fractionally small part of the wealth which these great industries contribute to Australia's national well- being. We are saying that, nevertheless, the tax regime, insofar as taxation can help distribute some of those benefits away from the corporation itself or those who are lucky enough to be employed by it directly, ought to be a fair one of the nature that we have described. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of employment, the main conclusion reached by the Committee was that we ought to scotch the use of multipliers as a political argument in this country. We reached that conclusion on the basis that in their formulation one has difficulty-there is also obvious difficulty on the part of commentators-to draw any socially useful conclusions. At least that is what we found. A great variety of multipliers were presented to us. A fairly small base of jobs is created by the various stages of the industry. They peak during the construction phase, but of course construction workers move from project to project. In Western Australia in particular we had evidence that projects were being marshalled in such a way that they came on stream during the 1980s so as to allow construction workers to move from project to project. So even direct employment is difficult to assess. As I say, it may merely be that construction workers in particular move from project to project. Nevertheless, direct jobs are created once the project is fully established. There is some multiplier effect, but the Committee found the experts to be so divided as to what that multiplier number ought to be-it is a factor so evidently tempting to political manipulation-that it felt that it was better to concentrate on the sort of wealth generated overall in the economy, as I indicated a moment ago from the Alcoa figures for 1980, and to imagine that as having an effect throughout the economy in the purchase of goods and services than to try to look at multipliers from the small base of direct employment that is created. </PARA>
<PARA> On industrial infrastructure financing, the Committee was firmly of the view that where it can be shown that certain industrial infrastructure, transport, port facilities and so on are directly attributable to the operations of a particular project that project should pay that price. Where the facilities are shared between various projects and the general community, there ought to be a sharing of the costs between the community and the various projects involved. On the whole-this is particularly so where one has an expert-oriented profitable industry-the true costs of setting up the operation ought to be known at the beginning by its shareholders. The returns that flow to it are then true returns , and the community is not subsidising shareholders or consumers of the final product. </PARA>
<PARA> As to social infrastructure, we found remarkably and distressingly that at the very time that the Committee was meeting the razor gang was recommending the abolition of various regional assistance schemes established by the Commonwealth Government. We looked at the Hunter Valley and the Gladstone area. Since the report came down, I note that the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, has promised special funds for the Gladstone area in order to help build up the social infrastructure needed to service the families that have moved to Gladstone in pursuit of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Commonwealth Government's enthusiastic promotion of these industries in various regions of Australia leads to an obligation on the Commonwealth Government to provide some of the social infrastructure that is lacking in these rapidly expanding areas. The Commonwealth's positive regional adjustment policies, which included a range of schemes, have been undone by the acceptance of the razor gang's report by the Government. We believe that is the reason for some of the social disruption which has occurred to those who have already settled in the area and that the social needs of those who are moving into the area will not be adequately met. I think it is important that the social and industrial infrastructures be perceived as proper costs generated by the welcoming of these industries into an area. Finally, we dealt with the question of the environment. The Senate Committee-Senator Crichton-Browne will be pleased with this-was totally opposed to the use by Western Australian conservation interests of the courts of a foreign nation in order to pursue their protests at the degradation, as they alleged, of the Darling Ranges by bauxite mining operations there. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We opposed the use of foreign courts by these groups in order to achieve their ends. Having said that, the Committee was very conscious of the fact that many of these conservationists felt the need to go outside Australia because the legal and political processes within Australia were indeed inadequate. Therefore, looking at the legal inadequacies of their avenues of protest, the Committee recommended very strongly that, when the Law Reform Commission brings down its report on locus standi, as soon as possible steps be taken to liberalise the access of conservation groups to the courts so that they have a legal jurisdiction within Australia in which to make their point. I refer now to the political limbo they felt they were in. For example, in the Hunter Valley there is a question about the impact of fluoride emissions on vines. In the Darling Ranges there is grave doubt-I certainly have grave doubts after hearing some of the evidence, particularly from the proposals of the Worsley joint venturers-about the impact of the bauxite mining in those ranges on the salinity of Perth's water supply. Those projects are going ahead without those fears being allayed and without the full and complete scientific studies having been completed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact it may be that in a sense they cannot be completed; it is only when the project has its disastrous impact, or beneficial impact as the case may be, that the proof may be there. For example, we found that the Worsley joint venturers made statements of hope about what they could do to prevent increasing the salinity risks to Perth's water supply, but the Commonwealth Department in its assessment of that project developer's report merely stated that it doubted that those hopes could be realised. The difficulty was that those Commonwealth department reports were not generally available. The Committee certainly recommended that Commonwealth Department of Home Affairs and Environment reports on these projects ought to be publicly available. </PARA>
<PARA> In that way, if the legal and political framework of decision making in relation to environmental concerns in this country could be liberalised, we would have access of interested parties to these forums, whether they are in the legal jurisdiction or the political jurisdiction. Also, with reports of the departments involved readily available to the community, we would have a situation in which conservationists, provided they are not obsessively or almost religiously devoted in a single-minded way to their cause, will have to accept that they have had a fair go within the Australian system. They will then have no cause to go overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee therefore concluded overall, I believe after a very exhaustive and worthwhile examination of this industry-I do not think I am being party political here-that the national Government had totally abdicated its proper and necessary role to harness the pace and the scope of the development of these industries within Australia in order to secure certain national and social goals . The national Government, we believed, in the end had abdicated its role and the States were competitively bidding in alliance with these great project developers. We believe that alliance cannot secure overall national goals. For that reason we hope that this report will be of benefit to the Australian community and will alert the national Government to its responsibilities. We look forward to that national Government's response. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to confine my remarks to one point; that is, Gladstone which is the heart of the development of alumina in Queensland. I think the previous speaker, Senator Tate, talked about industrial and social infrastructures. It appears to me that whilst the industrial infrastructure might have been served to some point in Gladstone, the social infrastructure certainly was not. If one looks at what has happened because of the industry developing in that area one will see that there is a problem of housing the people and the workers in the area. It is a really grave problem. I think the problem is probably recognised by the State Government. I noticed with some interest that former Senator Maunsell, who was a member of the Committee, has been replaced by Senator Bjelke-Petersen. I hope that that has a definite influence on what happens in Gladstone in Queensland. I hope the honourable senator has some influence on the Premier of that State in relation to the problems that exist for the social infrastructure of Gladstone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be fascinating to see what the result is. We have a very fine industry and a very fine development in that area. But because of that development and because of the speed of the development of the industry we found that housing and the other social requirements could not keep pace. I suppose I am not telling the Committee members anything, but if they go to Queensland and inspect the housing problems there they will find two or maybe three caravans in the yard of a home. Families are living in caravans in the backyards of houses within the community there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that if those people continue to live in those caravans in the backyards of dwellings in Gladstone there will be further problems in regard to family security and the education of children. A number of extra children in the community have to attend the school in the area. I think that is fairly clearly pointed out in one of the statements by the Committee. I know Senator Thomas was not being critical but I think he pointed out very well that the impression gained by the Committee was that the local authorities are not given sufficient support or sufficient information by the State or by the Commonwealth when negotiating with large corporations. Thus they often fail to negotiate effectively in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is a truism. The Committee put a report down with a very relevant recommendation in relation to what is happening in Gladstone. The local authority cannot ever expect to receive the sort of income that it should receive by way of rates because three families live on one block of land. Rates are being paid on only one block; two families are not paying them. A strain is put on the supply of electricity and other services; for example, garbage and sewerage. The State Government is faced with a severe problem with education. These problems are multiplying. They are increasing at a greater rate than this Government, the State Government or, for that matter, the local authorities are able to handle. Unless this Government or the State Government intends to take some action on this report over and above the action on a normal basis from day to day concerning returns such as rates we will have increasing numbers of social problems in Gladstone. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the schooling difficulties and other problems in relation to teenagers there will be more problems in Gladstone. We can look at crime and other problems that will develop in the area. This occurs, firstly, because of the pushing together of members of the community and, secondly, because the community does not have available to it the normal social facilities that are available to a normal community. The community receives a high rate of pay. There is nowhere where those families can spend the extra money that they have received because of their employment in the alumina plant. Further problems will develop in that area unless the Government takes some note of the points put down in the report of the Committee. </PARA>

I will be very brief. It has been an excellent debate. I thank those honourable senators who have contributed. In particular, I thank Senator Jones because he was not a member of the Committee. His comments were very valid. I would like to say how much I appreciated the comments of Senator Crichton-Browne. He identified many of the problems that we came up with during the inquiry. There is no doubt that the States have a constitutional right to the resources. During the inquiry the Senate Committee was very conscious of this prior right. I hope and am confident that the recommendations that the Committee made to the Senate take account of these rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I personally-I think my views are shared by the rest of the Committee-was totally horrified with most of the Press responses to the tabling of our report. Some of the responses, as Senator Watson has identified, were fair and well balanced but a major portion of the reports was totally distorted. I personally have had a constant supply of letters from people all over Australia, and particularly from some of the companies involved in the industry, responding to Press reports of our report instead of responding to the report itself. That really is sad. I thought that as a politician I would be immune to this sort of treatment, but I guess that I have learnt all over again. It is sad, considering the work that the Committee put into this report which took a great deal of time and a lot of effort, that the report itself should be treated in such a dilatory way. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Senate Committee did not advocate a resources rental tax. It did not say that royalties were too low. It did not criticise any of the companies involved in the industry. The Committee's members, as other commentators have said tonight, were critical of some of the Commonwealth departments and some of their activities. We looked at the aluminium industry on the basis that it is good for Australia. It is a good industry. It is the ideal type of industry that Australia needs for the use of our relatively cheap energy and for the use of a high degree of technology which Australia is generating. In fact-I do not think this has been said tonight before-Australia is exporting trained people in this industry to other countries. We hear so often about the criticism that Australia needs to import its technology. Australia, as far as the aluminium industry is concerned, is exporting trained people to contribute in other countries. I think we should be very proud of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> We conducted the inquiry on the basis that the aluminium industry is a great industry for Australia. It follows the guidelines that the Government has set for the sorts of industry that we should encourage in Australia. I make particular comment on the fact that it is an economic industry; it does not need any particular support from anybody in the way of protection or any other support. It competes on the world market. We believe that the aluminium industry is exactly the sort of industry that should be encouraged in Australia. It is also an industry that should share the benefits to all Australians as much as possible, and Senator Tate made some mention of that. </PARA>
<PARA> During our inquiry we recognised also that no section of the community should be particularly disadvantaged. I pay credit to Senator Jones for mentioning the point about Gladstone. I remind Senator Jones that the problems that are created in Gladstone are not necessarily created by the aluminium industry. It just so happens that the huge expansion in Gladstone-we cite the figures in the report- coincided with a huge series of resource developments in the town. This coincided with the Bowen Basin development and the building of the new power station. The shale oil deposits looked at that stage to be on stream. There was a new cement works. A whole series of developments created an unusual situation in Gladstone. As Senator Tate said, the Queensland Government has recognised this point by making quite a generous allocation of funds to that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I commend the report to the Senate. I trust that the Government will take this report seriously. We certainly put a great deal of effort into it. We hope that it will be considered in all seriousness by the Government. As far as the Government's consideration of this report is concerned-I think this comment could be applied to all committee reports-I hope that those departmental officers who prepared the submissions for our report are not the same people who consider the report and advise the departments when they respond to our report. It seems rather difficult for officers to have an opinion different from the one that they presented during our inquiry. I thank those other senators on the Committee who contributed to this very valuable debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government's response to the Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment on Australian Marine Science reached us in the closing hours of the last session and at that stage it was not possible to deal with it. I am glad now to see that it has come up at this relatively early stage this session so that we can discuss it. The nature of the Government's response was such that I believe that it is a matter of some consequence not only for the Committee but also for the Senate and possibly even beyond that. Senator Jessop, as Chairman of the Committee, to my mind had priority to comment on this matter but since I was to speak in continuation, having taken the report in his absence, he has done me the courtesy of allowing me to precede him tonight. I know that he will be making comments later. He will, very properly I think, be commenting in detail on aspects of the Government's response whereas it is my desire to speak of it in general terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all I shall speak of the report on marine science, which I thought was an exhaustive report. Many responsible and informed points of view on this subject were taken into account. I am sure that all Senate standing committees take their inquiries seriously but I think this inquiry was one that our Committee felt to be of such importance that it had to be given a great deal of time, a great deal of thought and, indeed, a great deal of travel. Because of this I think that evidence was taken from more people than is sometimes the case in this sort of inquiry and that we were exposed to a much broader point of view than is sometimes the case. Part of the reason for the importance of the inquiry and, indeed, its timing was the extension of Australia's influence to the 200- mile zone and all the implications that arise from that. The report of the Committee was a unanimous one, supported by Committee members representing three parties in this chamber. It was a unanimous report which was arrived at not without a great deal of work and some agonising. I think that it has a particular value because of that. To my mind-perhaps I should not say it, being one of those who contributed; although I think it has to be said-it is a report of considerable integrity and considerable accuracy. Beyond that, having heard the evidence in most places as we travelled around Australia, I feel that this report is also a very fair representation of informed community point of view in relation to marine science and has a great value because of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's reaction to the report has been so casual and negative as to be insulting not only to the Committee and the Senate but also to those many expert and informed people who gave large amounts of their valuable time to contribute to this process. I feel that this has once again brought the Senate to a crunch point where it must consider actively what its function is, why we have committees and why they go to this enormous amount of work and expense if the Government is going to take their recommendations and treat them with a casualness and a degree of negative thinking which I find almost indescribable. That is really what has happened in this case. The Senate committee system is of great potential value as a means of advising government on what the community wants and thinks. I would have thought that that was its major function. I believe that as far as is humanely possible this report certainly did so in relation to marine science. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that this matter in general terms must be considered by the Senate. The Senate must at some stage inquire into the matter-it has been raised here previously by members and chairmen of committees-of virtual Executive contempt for the recommendations of the committees of the Senate. Who is responsible for this? Is it the Executive or is it the bureaucracy? From wherever it comes, I believe that it is a situation which is so grave, so basically important and so damaging to the community as to deserve much more consideration than it has had so far in this place and perhaps also in the other place. As I have said, we are not considering our own protocol here. We are not considering our own time or our own trouble; we are considering the sincere, careful work of those people who make submissions and give evidence. They represent, through their submissions to the committees, the community at large. By being in contempt of the recommendations contained in the reports of these committees-I speak of our own committee and probably of others-which are made in a sincere attempt to represent the community point of view as accurately as possible, the Government is indeed thumbing its nose at the community at large and, where a report is on a specialised matter, as most of our reports are, it is thumbing its nose at informed and specialised opinion in the country. That, I believe, is a very serious indictment. I make it in the full knowledge that it is such, and I invite further discussion of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to refer to the response of the Government to the Report on Australian Marine Science which was presented by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment last year. The response was made on 26 November 1981. This is the second report that the Committee has presented. Having regard to the fact that the Government had assumed responsibility for 200-nautical mile sea limit which encompasses an area of ocean of about 4.75 million square kilometres rich in resources and recognising the urgency, we felt that it was important that we present an early report demonstrating the Committee's view that substantial finance was required to exploit those resources and to ensure that a co-ordinated research program was developed at the earliest possible time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset, in responding to the Government's comments on the Committee's report, I must express extreme disappointment at the small number of recommendations that have been adopted by the Government. I have been quite impressed with the number of recommendations that have been adopted in the past from reports that have been presented by our Committee. But in this case the Committee put forward 45 recommendations, seven of which the Government chose to recognise as acceptable. These seven recommendations refer to priorities for marine science research. The Government did not accept any of the Committee's recommendations for increasing co-ordination in a fragmented and diverse field of scientific disciplines, nor did it accept recommendations put forward to assist the establishment of a marine science program for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mason has quite properly said-I am sure that Senator Mulvihill, who is the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, would agree-that the inquiry was exhaustive. We went out of our way to involve sections of the community in the scientific field, those involved with museums, conservation groups and those who have an interest in marine science and the value it has for Australia. I think it is disappointing that when we have gone out of our way to present informed, properly considered recommendations the Government has not seen fit to accept more of them. The Committee developed its recommendations after two years of inquiring into the needs of marine science-a relatively new and growing field of scientific endeavour in Australia. Because vast distances and organisational machinations serve only to disperse and fragment marine science in this country rather than to consolidate its efforts, the Committee proposed the development of an Australian Marine Science Council. This council would be an umbrella organisation utilising as much as possible existing research and service agencies in an attempt to co-ordinate diverse marine science activities. This structure is consistent with proposals put forward by the Interim Council of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, which reported to Parliament in 1970 on the need for an Australian Marine Science Council to co-ordinate marine science efforts. This proposal was never implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Twelve years later the Government again rejects the formation of an Australian Marine Science Council based upon the proposal of the interim council, the structure and functions of the National Health and Medical Research Council and submissions put to the Committee by several highly experienced witnesses. The Committee's blueprint for an Australian Marine Science Council includes the preferred structure for co-ordinating the use of research vessels and other national facilities and information services. The Council's structure is based on the need for national and regional levels of co-ordination with input to a central policy-making council from regional and marine sciences committees and an advisory committee. These committees would comprise representatives of the marine science community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in its response to the establishment of an Australian Marine Science Council, has listed its recent initiatives for developing a cohesive marine science program. However, these initiatives add nothing towards promoting co-ordination between existing research and service sectors. Instead the new initiatives only add to the research and technology strengths of existing agencies. The Committee is gravely concerned that its report, which clearly points towards providing a mechanism for co-ordinating marine science in this country; has been cast aside in preference for further piecemeal development. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to say too much more except to suggest that it would be folly for any government, of whichever persuasion, to fail to take note of the recommendations gathered as a result of public inquiries by a committee that examined the evidence of interested groups throughout Australia, the committee having considered the evidence delivered at those public inquiries, having distilled the evidence, having been quite fair and reasonable in assessing the needs within the community with respect of marine science and having brought forward a constructive proposal which can mean the formulation of a progressive policy with respect to marine science. I will certainly pursue, with the encouragement of the Committee, the course that I believe is necessary to be pursued by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I went to Tasmania to look at the site proposed for the establishment of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's Division of Fisheries and Oceanography. That division will be functional, I understand, by June this year. I can assure the Government that my Committee will be following that development with interest. I would imagine that we would not resile from our responsibility to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of this area of scientific activity. We will undoubtedly follow up in due course the two reports that we have presented and present another one. I hope that the Government in the meantime will re-examine the recommendations that we have presented for its benefit. People sometimes are rather cynical about members of parliament and their ability to come to grips with scientific matters. But I can assure honourable senators that our Committee would probably know as much about this subject as the Government-I think more-and probably as much as the bureaucrats who dictate the terms that the Government chooses frequently to follow. I just present my feeling that this is an area of scientific development which needs to be dealt with urgently. I implore the Government to re-examine the recommendations that we have made because, if it adopts them, it will not detract from its credibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to jump on every report but I wish to raise one parochial issue during the discussion of this report. Before I raise that I must say that, after listening to the remarks of Senator Jessop and Senator Mason, some honourable senators must be somewhat amazed at the Government's inaction and non-provision of finance in relation to some recommendations made by some Senate standing committees. It seems to me that this is a problem for standing committees. It is very easy for the Senate to move to set up a standing committee. The standing committee does a lot of work enthusiastically-not on a party political basis-and brings down fruitful and energetic reports, and then we find that the recommendations are completely ignored by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. But this is one of the shames of the parliamentary system. I wish to make a comment in relation to this report by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. The Committee stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Marine science includes those basic sciences concerned with the biological, chemical, geographical and physical composition of this marine environment, together with their interaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Marine science equally includes those applied sciences concerned with development and protection of this environment. </PARA>
<PARA>With those words in mind, I remind the Senate of the problems caused by the deadly box jellyfish in Queensland north of Mackay. I suppose it is like trying to get a point of view over to someone who is not listening or who has turned off his hearing-aid, but it seems to me that there certainly has not been enough money applied to looking at the problems caused by this box jellyfish. Because of the sort of tourist development which is taking place in Queensland north of Mackay and which will in turn return revenue to this Government and to the State Government, I honestly believe that there is some need for this Government to take note of the report brought down by the Committee with a view to spending an amount of money on the inspection and the classification of the sorts of problems that develop out of the deadly box jellyfish. In Queensland we are running into the tourist season when large numbers of tourists and a large amount of trade goes into the State, and again people will suffer from the problems caused by the deadly box jellyfish. </PARA>
<PARA> Because I am not a member of the Committee, that is the only matter I wish to speak on tonight. Because of that problem alone, I think the Government should start to take notice of some of these reports, of the amount of money that is put into them and of the amount of time put by honourable senators into the gathering of information to bring them down. We find that a report comes to the Senate, five or six senators say one or two words on it, it is put away and the Government forgets all about it. That is the shame of the system that has been developed in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some comment on the very important 1981 report of the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry. The report was brought down by the secretariat of the Department of Housing and Construction. It analyses the state of the building industry and the problems facing it. It makes comments upon the problems of accommodation in Australia. In making such an objective report to the Federal Government, the national Parliament, the industry and the community generally, it does a great service to the Parliament and the country. It is a very important report because of the way in which it analyses the problems facing the industry and housing generally in Australia. It gives us an opportunity to understand the picture of housing and the industry in 1982. It has been made abundantly clear over recent times that the industry is in a state of complete disarray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to acknowledge that housing has emerged as a major social problem and a major issue in the minds of the Australian people. It is a major problem for the national Government and for each of the State governments. The industry is feeling the effects of changes that are taking place in the Australian economy and Federal Government policies. The report provides an activity forecast for the remaining portion of 1980-81 since its preparation and 1981-82. It makes the estimate for the triennium 1981-82 to 1983-84 and gives projections of dwelling requirements to the end of the century. It analyses the factors influencing the structure, efficiency and output of the industry. It makes a very important point that this Government consistently ignores. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> A major issue facing the Industry during the 1980s will be the impact of the resources 'boom'. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is exactly what the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement in Australia have been saying. It is exactly what has been said by those associated with the housing industry at a number of seminars and conferences that have been held in the last year or two. It is not without some significance that this report from a government department and prepared by a group that has been appointed by the Government to carry out a survey and to advise it of the depths of the problems facing the housing industry in this country should make this and other conclusions to which I will refer. The scope of the report is described as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Short-term forecasts of industry activity for 1980-81 and 1981-82 . . . estimates of the demand for new housing . . . and the industry's capacity to supply it . . . over the triennium 1981-82 to 1983-84 an assessment of housing requirements to the end of the century. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very timely document, given the fact that every newspaper in our country has in the last couple of weeks featured a number of articles and made a number of editorial comments on this matter. I, together with my colleague, Mr Uren, and the leader of my party, Mr Hayden, have consistently said in the last couple of years that housing was moving into an acute crisis area and that the responsibility had to rest with the Australian Government to take energetic steps to recognise this fact and so to organise our economy that housing would move back to a position where market forces-if that is to be the philosophy of this Government-would not continue to depress the state of the industry. This very day there has been a meeting of the States specifically to discuss the housing crisis. No longer can it be said that only the Labor Party, the housing industry, the building unions and the homeless people are concerned about this issue. In fact, the State Premiers themselves have met to discuss the current housing crisis. Yet this Government consistently fails to accept the fact that a crisis exists in this sector of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> What the report says has a lot of relevance to the Parliament itself. Page 19 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Considerable uncertainties surround prospects for the housing industry for the remainder of 1980-81 and 1981-82. At the time of preparing this Report it was difficult to assess the effects of recent changes in interest rates on the supply and cost of housing finance, and thus demand for owner-occupied housing. Pressures exist for further adjustments. Furthermore, the direction of change in general economic and financial conditions and the increase in dwelling prices will also affect housing demand. </PARA>
<PARA>The report suggests that at least until the end of 1984 the capacity of housing will outstretch the demand. I do not think we need to be convinced of that. It is pretty clear on the basis of the prices of housing and the upward trend in rental accommodation that there is a market influence. The report states that it is estimated that capacity will average 144,000 dwellings a year while demand will be 141,000. </PARA>
<PARA> If we can assume that those figures are correct estimations-I think we can-it is clear that the Federal Government is doing nothing to overcome the backlog or the problems of housing accommodation in our country. I put it to the Senate that these figures show a degree of fine tuning which greatly calls into question our housing future. They do not give any hope that there will be any rectifying of the housing shortage. In fact recent figures suggest that the housing stocks situation will not be as favourably balanced as the report suggests. I am trying to rely on the report in the belief that the report comes from a Government department and it might have some impact upon Government thinking. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table drawn from figures supplied by the Real Estate Institute of Australia which show that in the rental market housing stock is in decline. These statistics were supplied by the legislative research section of the Parliamentary Library. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The table shows that at November 1981 rental vacancy rates had fallen to half the November 1979 figure. They had fallen to half the figures suggested by the Real Estate Institute of Australia as a suitable level of rental housing fluidity. I refer to the rental market. The report before us tonight refers to a tight balance in the home buyers market , a balance that will increasingly be destabilised by rising interest rates and tighter liquidity in the finance market. No one disagrees that that is the situation that exists in the nation today. There is a shortage of credit and housing funds and, as a result, an increase in interest rates. They have been rising slowly but surely over the last couple of years. There are a number of projections that they will continue to rise during 1982. The figures that have been incorporated point to an impossible squeeze on the housing front. The report refers to the problems of housing in regional areas. It correctly points to the pressure that rapid resource development will place on housing. In particular, the report refers to the Hunter Valley resource development in my State. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the major influences shaping the Australian economy during the 1980s will be the capital investment surge, particularly in resource related projects. This resource boom has direct and indirect implications for the housing industry at both the regional and national level. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The most obvious effect will be a rapid increase in housing demand in those regions where there are resource developments. In most cases the existing housing stock will be inadequate to accommodate the population growth associated with the resource projects. </PARA>
<PARA>So again what the Labor Party has been saying about resource development, about housing and about the pressures that will be exerted on other sectors of our economy are borne out in this report. Of course, anyone who knows of or who has seen the conditions that caravan park dwellers are forced to live in in the Latrobe Valley, Gladstone and the Hunter Valley resource development areas will know that this sort of accommodation is not good enough. I point out the stresses and strains it places upon local communities and local government in trying to provide reasonable community facilities in those areas as a result of unprecedented and unplanned growth taking place because of a direct stimulus by Federal and State governments. The housing policy of this Government and the policies of the mining companies must be brought into line. They must accept responsibility for solving these problems which will be a feature of the housing problems in these regions during the 1980s. Another section of the report deals with finance and its availability generally. In summary, the report closes on a gloomy but terse note. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> The council notes that in a climate of intense competition for available finance and increasing building costs, further pressures are likely on home ownership rates and hence the rental market . . . Governments--</PARA>
<PARA>This is particularly so of Federal governments-</PARA>
<PARA>should carefully examine housing programs to ensure that they are able to respond flexibly and appropriately to this emerging situation. </PARA>
<PARA> This report ought to be seriously considered by this Government because such reports are prepared by government agencies and placed before the Parliament for the Parliament's consideration. Governments have an obligation to take into account in the preparation of their Budgets the way these problems will influence the course of events in the economy. They must seriously consider the implications and the advice of such organisations as the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry. The Government invariably just takes notes of the paper and does not do anything to digest it or understand it, or apply the important evidence that is available to it. I conclude by referring to another section of the report which, without equivocation, endorses what the Australian Labor Party has been saying about the intense competition for funds that is taking place in Australia today for the savings of the average Australian and how these savings are being directed away from the housing industry. The report, at page 9, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The surge in resource investment is likely to make large demands on capital markets. While much of the capital required will come from overseas some will be drawn from household savings and it would not be possible or appropriate for the housing sector to be isolated from these developments. </PARA>
<PARA>I am led to believe that considerable proportions of the funds that are necessary for the resource development in our country are drawn from the domestic savings market, from our own funds in our own country. They are being siphoned off by the large international corporations that are carrying out the resource development. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Housing finance institutions are already facing considerable competition from semi-government authorities borrowing to finance resource-related and other infrastructure. In these circumstances, it is important that the Government maintains an appropriate balance between external and domestic policies, and in turn between fiscal and monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Senator Walsh, Senator Childs, Senator Chipp and I commented upon this in debate on the report of the Foreign Invesment Review Board. Of course the report refers to the need for the Government to have an appropriate balance between external and domestic policies and between fiscal and monetary policies. Yet obviously this Government completely ignores the evidence that is at hand. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> From the housing industry's viewpoint the worst situation would be one in which governments, unwilling or unable to control the budget deficit or the external account, relied unduly on monetary policy while artificially restraining the loan or deposit interest rates that might be offered by housing finance institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Council notes that in a climate of intense competition for available finance and increasing building costs, further pressures are likely on home ownership rates and hence the rental market. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we are aware that the percentage of home ownership in Australia in the period in which the Fraser Government has been in office has dropped from 74 per cent to about 71 per cent. We are aware of the tremendous increase, as a result of that drop, in the cost of ownership and the cost of rental accommodation which is making an impact on all of the social welfare problems that exist within our country. We have been pointing out that these are related to the un- planned development of resources which have been initiated by the Federal Government and in many cases encouraged by the State governments. There has been no central planning concept at all that would take into consideration sufficient funds for housing in a way that will not prevent the development of the resources that are necessary for our growth and which will at the same time make available to the housing industry such adequate funds to enable our people to be properly housed at a cost that makes it possible for the average Australian to be accommodated in a home and a region of his choice. </PARA>
<PARA> One only hopes that this report will have some influence upon the way in which the 1982 Budget is framed. If it does not, it is clear that this Government will cease to have the confidence of the Australian people because it has ignored all of the important evidence that is available to it on the sort of housing problems and plight that face Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to direct a few observations to General Business Order of the Day No. 181 which relates to the Industrial Relations Bureau. I am continuing my discussion of 19 November. I always make it a practice if I raise a matter relative to a Minister in another place-with all due respect to the Senate Minister concerned-to send that Minister an extract of what I said in this chamber. The Industrial Relations Bureau produces a mass of statistics of breaches, most of which are not diabolical or sinister. They often concern the area of small industry people who are not aware of the full impact of the industrial relations award.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to a large amount of unclaimed money lodged with the Bureau I suggested that we could utilise the ethnic Press to publicise details of the money, the people involved and, if necessary, the firm from which people could obtain that money. I make this suggestion because some years ago I was in Port Hedland, an area in which there is a fair amount of nomadic labour. People work there for a while and then move on thus creating a difficulty in tracing them. I suggested to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) that this matter ought to be taken up. It did not involve a momentous decision. It was not like the earlier matter concerning the marine science authority which may have necessitated the authorisation of big expenditure. I am still waiting for a positive response from the Minister. To me it is such a small matter and one in which we could get the ethnic Press involved. It would be a very fruitful exercise for all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I raise concerns the fragmentation of industrial relations which is under the umbrella of the Commonwealth Government. We have a Department of Industrial Relations report which gives the command post, as it were, the hierarchy, of the Ministry. However, with the Industrial Relations Bureau there is no question of inspectors looking at award breaches. No doubt there are areas of State factory welfare boards which overlap in regard to industrial safety. I express the view that this should somehow be all put back under the one body. The IRB should become just a segment in the written report of the Department of Industrial Relations. It is remarkable to me how from time to time we get a pack of legislation to correct some imbalance or recurring industrial sore, but there is very little background information in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I illustrate this by saying that last year during the Estimates I tried to track down the Commonwealth functions in the field of industrial safety. I remember one memorable night last year during the Estimates when, I think, Senator Baume, came in with a sort of cry of 'Eureka' because he had found the information. It was late at night and I admired his diligence. He said that responsibility for industrial safety at the Commonwealth level had been transferred from the Minister for Science and Technology to the Minister for Industrial Relations. While I applaud that decision we have not got very much information on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that when the IRB troubleshooters are in the field honourable senators would be surprised at the number of disputes that emanate from a resistance by the employee to industrial safety. Of course, as fast as we solve one problem we get another. In the 1950s there was the problem in heavy industry of ear defenders which were in their early days of development. Some of these were of bakelite composition and others were of rubber. While the worker would get protection from deafness there was a fair amount of irritation. Some people's inner ears got inflamed. These were matters on which not enough industrial safety work was done. Of course, in recent times we have seen the concept of the earmuffler at airports and at engineering establishments where people wear them when operating small or large presses. Some people argue that these mufflers give them a sort of mental isolation which makes them a bit morbid and melancholy. That is another field. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that when these areas are lumped together into the IRB or the Department of Industrial Relations we may not get the dynamic response that is necessary. We can ask the officers of these bureaus what their priorities are. We could ask them what the minimum or even maximum time is under the New South Wales metal trades award for a visit to a particular establishment. These officers might say: 'Oh, well, we get enough priority calls; others might wait a little while'. We can take the situation a little further. These officers go into highly unionised plants where there is no need for them to be at all. I think we would have a great deal more confidence if these statistics we get could be fleshed out a bit. I hope that on the next occasion we will not have matters relating to the Department of Industrial Relations in one booklet and matters relating to the IRB in another. I hope we will have them all under the one canvas as it were, so that when we deal with them we will be able to have, if necessary, an all enveloping criticism or in other cases give credit where it is due. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question about it: When we look at the tremendous technological changes, the redundancies and all the rest of it we see that it is not just a matter of taking a chance. Recently I asked about the Rowntree chocolate factory which is in the confectionary field. That firm proudly said that the men over 55 years got a golden handshake. I said that that was true because there was not a big work force, but I asked what happened to those aged between 20 years and 40 years. I asked whether the firm followed through to see what industry these people went to because this could be a barometer for some other industries which might have redundancies. I will not weary the Senate now but I took as a yardstick the anticipated membership of the trade unions in the textile and rubber industries and showed how these memberships had gone down dramatically. We do not get those facts in Australia. I think that Scandinavian countries have tham. For some reason or another it is possible to get such figures from International Labour Organisation reports in some of these fields. It is much easier to get an assessment of the integration of industry in European Economic Community countries than it is in our own. I leave those thoughts with honourable senators in the hope that this will be the last occasion on which we will have the fragmentary treatment of industrial reports. In effect, if we can get them all under the one umbrella we can be much broader in our analysis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take up the point referred to by Senator Mulvihill concerning the fact that industrial relations matters are divided in a very artificial way. The role of the Department of Industrial Relations is set out in the report under the heading of 'Functions'. It includes industrial legislation, particularly the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the provision of an effective federal industrial relations framework, an attempt to deal constructively with disputation that goes beyond the established processes, the improvement of the general industrial relations climate, and tripartite consultation to engender good employer-employee relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last week a paper was presented by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) stating that he proposed to take new initiatives which, in my view, would affect industrial relations adversely. Honourable senators will recall that the three salient aspects of that paper were the proposals to encourage the establishment of industrial and plant unions, to abolish preference to unionists and to give employers powers automatically to stand down employees in industrial disputes. As I have said previously, this came after a statement that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made in January in which he said that there was a need for reconciliation with the trade union movement and the various people involved in industrial relations. Of course that soft sell that I have referred to before has been changed by the Minister's recent statement to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The current initiative by the Government is only the most recent of a whole range of initiatives that have been taken to muddy the water of industrial relations. The fact that the Government has chosen to divide the industrial relations area into two sections only makes it more complex. It is necessary to comment on both aspects of the industrial relations area if one is to examine the actions that have been taken by this Government. It is worth looking at the initiatives that historically have been taken in industrial relations by this Government since it took office. The Liberal Government came to power in November 1975 and 16 amendments have been made to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act since. About one-third of these amendments have been of major industrial significance. One of the areas in which this Government has been particularly regressive is Public Service employment. I remind the Senate of the basic principle in the Constitution concerning the powers that we have in industrial relations. Of course I am referring to placitum (xxxv.) of section 51 of the Constitution. That has been the hallmark of industrial relations. The Constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA> Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is currently tinkering with this concept as he tries to by-pass ' the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes'. The constitutional concept is the basis of trade union and employer understanding of industrial relations and it is the basis for dealing with industrial disputes in this country. It is worth while remembering that the Government introduced the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act in 1977 which suspended and, where it was in the public interest, dismissed Commonwealth Government employees who took industrial action. We have had a series of measures which were all designed to curtail the activities of trade unions and trade union members and to weaken the trade union movement. It has all been part of the Government's strategy to prevent unions from gaining the advantages that they are entitled to for their employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Bureau has been used by the Government as an arm in preventing people from gaining the advantages that they should have. Unfortunately this has meant that the issues of the day have not been addressed. To look at the real issues it is necessary to get industrial disputes into their correct perspective. To do that we must look at the figures for the estimated cost of strikes on employment, absenteeism, injuries and fatalities. I cite the 1980 figures to show the estimated value of the loss of production. Industrial disputes caused a loss of $297m; injuries and fatalities caused a loss of $448m; unemployment caused a loss of $7,912m; and absenteeism caused a loss of $4,917m. When honourable senators consider those figures they will realise that the actual percentage of lost production caused by industrial disputes was 2.1 per cent. The percentage of production loss caused by injuries and fatalities was 3. 3 per cent. Unemployment-something the Government has done little about- accounted for a staggering 58.2 per cent. Of course I have not dealt with the hidden costs of unemployment. Absenteeism was responsible for 36.2 per cent of lost production. The significance of these figures is that the costs of industrial disputes are very small. </PARA>
<PARA> We are able to look at figures, some of which are amazing, which reveal the cause of industrial disputes. It is not the metal workers, whom Senator Walters is always referring to, who cause the majority of industrial disputes. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 42 per cent of industrial disputes are management caused disputes. Another significant figure is that physical working conditions caused 21.4 per cent of disputes. Not enough attention is given to the physical conditions in which people in industry work. Unfortunately the physical conditions in industry, manufacturing industry in particular, are not looked at enough by statisticians and departments, and are not sufficiently dealt with by inspectors of the Bureau. After the Second World War many old buildings were replaced by saw-tooth, so-called modern buildings which are even more decrepit and unsatisfactory to work in. Many buildings are absolutely unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> I have seen people forced into taking industrial action because, for example, the temperature has gone over 30 degrees. Because of the inadequacy of the law people in many parts of Australia are forced to stop work in order to get relief from the heat in factories. The irony is that in many cases the people who stop work are not paid but they are prepared to take the decision to stop work because of the inability of inspectors to ensure that working conditions and factories are satisfactory for because State and Federal regulations are not adequate to cover the problem of working conditions in the plant. </PARA>
<PARA> When we realise that over 60 per cent of industrial disputes are caused by mangement provocation, the inadequacies of location or the environment of a factory we start to get industrial relations figures into a proper perspective. Managerial responsibility for industrial disputes must be taken into consideration together with the failure of this Government to do anything about industrial democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make no apology tonight for taking some time to debate a ministerial statement made by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee, on the subject of the deportations of Messrs Pochi and Barbaro. Regrettably, there was no time, for one reason or another, including the non-co-operation of the Government, to debate this matter today. It is an extremely important matter, one which has excited a considerable amount of public attention. It is at least important that this chamber be given the courtesy of me putting my views to it-since I have certainly put them elsewhere- and, as a result, enable perhaps some short debate on the matter this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I begin with the proposition, which seems to have universal assent, that the Minister, Mr Ian Macphee, is a decent, civilised and honourable chap. It is a perception which I certainly personally share. But because Mr Macphee is such a person-he is relatively unique in that respect among members of the present Government-because he has said that he has wrestled with his conscience and mulled over these cases for scores of hours, because he has taken fully into account the implications for the families concerned and because, after doing all those things, he has ultimately, no doubt in good faith, come down in the way that he has, it should not mean that that is all there is to be said on the subject of whether these deportations are justified. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to deport someone is a grave one at the best of times. The decision to deport two people, each with over 20 years membership of the Australian community, each with fully assimilated families and each with only minor criminal records, is a very grave one. The decision to deport someone who is in this position and who, at the same time, has a very strong opinion, on the merits, from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, supported by long and reasoned opinions of respected judges, is, to the extent that the deportation involves the overturning of such a decision, an even graver decision still. It is so grave that, in my view and in the view of the Opposition, it should be made by the Minister only when the strongest possible probative evidence is available to him of involvement by the person in an activity which is totally incompatible with that person's continued membership of the Australian community. It is so grave a decision that it should be made only when the Minister is more than merely personally satisfied. It should not be made when he is merely left-as Mr Macphee put it in his comments to the House-with a reasonable suspicion that something is amiss. </PARA>
<PARA> For decisions of this gravity to be justified the Minister must believe that what he is asserting is established beyond reasonable doubt. He must believe it in a way that he can communicate it, and communicate it in a way that is capable of acceptance by those who, without any axe to grind, are simply anxious to see that justice is done. The trouble with the Minister's statement on this matter and his reply to the debate in the House of Representatives is that when we look at those contributions and study the language very carefully they simply do not satisfy these criteria. In particular, in neither case is there anything added to what was before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Something should be added if the Minister and the Government want us to accept that the right decision was made and that no injustice has been perpetrated. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me briefly take each case in turn, beginning with Barbaro, a case which was decided in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Barbaro's favour in March 1981 , long after the report of Mr Justice Woodward. Incidentally, it was not the Mr Justice Woodward of the Federal Court, of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation fame, of the Aboriginal land rights inquiry fame, and now the meat inquiry fame. It was a rather different Mr Justice Woodward from New South Wales , with a rather different reputation. The report from that Mr Justice Woodward was very much available to Mr Justice Fisher of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and very much taken into account by him when reaching the conclusions that he did, that Barbaro was but a big player in the Griffith marihuana exercise and not deserving of anything like the gravity of treatment that was involved in a ministerial decision to deport him. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that nothing at all has been added by the Minister to the information. Nothing at all was before the Minister other than the information that was before Mr Justice Fisher when he made his decision. There is no doubt that the Minister was doing no more, in reviewing the Barbaro case, than substituting his own judgment, his own intuition for that of the learned judge. Of course, the Minister is entitled to do that, as a matter of law; but we are entitled, as a matter of policy, I believe, to ask for something more than that.</PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty about the Barbaro case is that there is nothing in the Woodward report, and nothing certainly, it appears, in the other material available to the Minister, that suggests that Barbaro was other than the most marginal figure in the Riverina marihuana-growing operation. Certainly he was arrested on one of the plantations at Euston when he was engaged in cultivating a patch of marihuana, but that seems to be as far as his involvement went, apart from the unfortunate association of names and relationships of a family kind with other members of the Calabrian families who had come from southern Italy and settled in various parts of Australia. There is no suggestion that he had any financial involvement or that he was involved in laundering any significant sums of money. There is no suggestion other than the baldest assertion, unaccompanied in the Woodward report by any evidence whatsoever, or any discussion of any other information whatsoever, that he was a member of the so-called secret society of Calabrians, the honoured society, of which Mr Justice Woodward, and the media now, through the Minister, have made so much. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no suggestion whatever in the Woodward inquiry, and certainly not in the treatment accorded that inquiry in Mr Justice Fisher's decision, that Barbaro was in any way involved directly or indirectly in the events leading up to or involved in the tragic disappearance of Donald Mackay. There is nothing on the record and nothing in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal proceedings, or in the Woodward commission which, as I say, analysed very carefully those proceedings, which suggests that Barbaro has had any continuing involvement whatsoever with the people or activity that got him into trouble with the law in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his statement in the Parliament, said that he would be naive if he did not expect them to be continuing members of that particular marihuana cultivating and marketing organisation. But we are entitled to ask the Minister, in turn, what is the foundation for that statement? Is there any evidence whatsoever of continuing involvement by this fellow? Where is that evidence? If the Minister has it, why does he not bring it forward? Why does he not at least make a declaration that he has it without giving the details if that in turn is based on informer evidence of a kind that cannot be made public? If he does have such evidence, if there is any suggestion at all of continuing involvement by that fellow in this particular crowd and this peculiarly sordid activity, there can be no justification for pursuing this debate one second longer. The man should be out of the country. But that evidence is not there. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put on the record, because I think they ought to be there for people to see for themselves, some of the relevant passages from the judgment of Mr Justice Fisher in that AAT case, the Barbaro case. Having discussed it with the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), I seek leave accordingly to incorporate the relevant passage of the decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Very careful and critical scrutiny must be given and much significance must attach in this matter to the nature of the crime because of the contention and the suspicion that the applicant was a member of a secret criminal organization. In fact it was alleged that he was a member of a cell of that organization which not only engaged in large scale production and trafficking in cannabis but was probably responsible for the death of Mr Donald McKay at Griffith in New South Wales. Furthermore the Report of the Woodward Royal Commission made an express finding that the applicant was such a member. The question is whether after the relatively exhaustive enquiry on this topic before me and also after hearing from the applicant his story (which advantage the Royal Commissioner did not have) I am sufficiently satisfied to assess the applicant as such a member or as involved to the extent alleged. If so, and I am satisfied his involvement is more than that of a farm labourer, the scales are weighted heavily in favour of deportation. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence the suspicion that he was so involved is based on four circumstances , namely his presence at Willra Station, his association with persons convicted of drug offences, the findings of the Woodward Royal Commission and the opinion of Police Officers. These circumstances are of course to an extent mutually dependent. A further matter relied upon was the inference, if any, to be drawn from the circumstances in which the applicant's bail was paid but I have already dealt with that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of his presence on Willra Station the applicant was, at first glance , only there as a labourer and with no involvement in the organisational or entrepreneurial activities. This was the finding of the Woodward Royal Commission. However, the contention before me was that, the plantation being so large and conducted under the auspices of a criminal organization, he would only be working there if he was a trusted member of the organization. To my mind this conclusion does not necessarily follow and there are alternative explanations. Equally if not more plausible, which receive support from the evidence. There was no evidence which even suggests he was to receive or has received any reward or benefit apart from his wages or that he had any contact or connection with the organizers other than as a labourer. More likely it is that persons in Salisbury (that is persons whom Dean Travers referred to as ''headmen'') had connections with the organizers and recruited for work at Willra. The applicant was generally known at the time to be a good but currently impecunious worker who had migrated from Calabria. His unguarded admissions when first questioned lend support to this as the more likely explanation. However subsequent to his release on bail, the applicant spent some four weeks with the co-accused on Willra Station and this circumstance could lend some support to the contention of more extensive involvement. However on the applicant's story he had not left Adelaide intending to pick marihuana and those who had involved him at least owed it to him in his impecunious circumstances to provide accommodation whilst he was liable to report daily. This is an equally if not more acceptable explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> Much evidence was put before me tending to establish that he is still associating with persons involved in marihuana dealings. However the crucial evidence is that he is not related to nor is he associating with persons involved in the Griffith organization. The uncontradicted evidence is that he does not know any of those persons and his trip to Euston was his first outside of South Australia. The persons with whom he mainly associates are members of the Italian community in Salisbury but the evidence is that he and his family do not restrict themselves to this community. There were three persons named who had lived in Salisbury and who had involvements in illegal marihuana activities, his brother-in-law Michael Sergi, his nephew Pietro Sergi and Rocco Carbone, the husband of a niece. The involvement of each was in South Australia and there is no evidence at all that they have any links either by marriage or friendship with the Griffith organization. The two Sergis were working as labourers on a farm at Keith and each fined $500 and released on a bond. Rocco Carbone has been charged but the matter has not yet been heard. Nor was there any suggestion that , in so far as there is in the words of Dean Travers ''a Mafia type organization in Salisbury'', the applicant or any of the persons with whom he associates are members of that organization. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of the hearing before me I can accept all the findings of the Woodward Royal Commission in respect of the activities of the Griffith organization and the production and distribution of illicit drugs in New South Wales and Willra in particular. Furthermore there was before me no evidence which bears on the finding of links between the New South Wales organization and marihuana growing in South Australia and the Salisbury area in particular. However insofar as the Royal Commission made a finding as to the involvement of the applicant in this organization, this finding must be considered in the light of the evidence before me and the fact that the applicant was not before the Commission. I am not prepared on this evidence to proceed on the basis that his involvement was as a ''trusted member of the Griffith organization''. I must in fairness accept that he was a farm labourer and not infer more because of the fact that he is a Calabrian born in Plati. The fact that he may have lived next door to Saverio Barbaro's sister in Berri does not warrant the inference that he knew Saverio Barbaro prior to his visit to Euston and through him had links with Griffith. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of police officers gave evidence that in their opinion the applicant was more deeply involved at Willra and in effect was still involved in marihuana activities. These police officers have had much experience in the task of trying to stamp out these illegal activities and their opinions are entitled to careful consideration. However none of them could give me any firm basis for his opinion but relied upon information supplied by other persons including informers paid on results and the drawing of inferences from the applicant's associates in Salisbury. In my view whilst I give anxious consideration to these opinions, there is too much chance of an injustice being perpetrated if I attach much weight to them. I did in a number of instances indicate my wish for more concrete evidence if I was to give these opinions any weight, but none was forthcoming. When I put my concern to counsel for the Minister he acknowledged that it was proper for any doubts to be resolved in favour of the applicant and his family. When hearsay evidence is in question, the comments of Lord Justice Lane in R. v Hull Prison Board of Visitors [1973] 3 All E.R. 545 at pages 552-3 are in point. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, after considering the four circumstances, separately and together, I am satisfied that the involvement of the applicant was probably merely that of a farm labourer and that this is the nature of his crime which I should accept for the purpose of this review. </PARA>

When I put my concern to counsel for the Minister he acknowledged that it was proper for any doubts to be resolved in favour of the applicant and his family. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of thing that goes right through the Barbaro judgment in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. There is nothing more than that on the Minister 's desk now, nor has there been anything more on his desk when he has been dealing with this particular case, looking at it, reviewing it and agonising over it, as he says, for the last few months. There is nothing more than the material that was available for that judge to produce that very meticulous decision. I keep saying that I think we are entitled to ask for more than that. </PARA>
<PARA> The case of Pochi-that has been the one given more prominent media attention associated with this particular matter-in some ways is a harder case and in some ways an easier case for the Minister to justify. It is harder to justify because of the threshold consideration that it is only as a result of bureaucratic bungling, as Mr Justice Deane quite explicitly put it in the Federal Court stage of this particular case, thereby referring to an unhappy course of events which is described in detail by Mr Justice Brennan at the AAT stage of the hearings, that Mr Pochi is not on fact today an Australian citizen and unable to be deported. There is an obvious element of unfairness right at the threshold before we even get to look at the merits of this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, it is much easier for the Minister to justify, at least at first sight, the action he has taken in respect of Pochi because of not only the horticultural role that was obviously played by Pochi in the Griffith organisation but also the financial role. A very great amount of detailed attention is paid to that financial role in the AAT decision of Mr Justice Brennan where he chooses ultimately, on balance, to put it to one side and say, even despite this, that the fellow ought not to be deported. Very great, loving and elaborate detail is also given to the financial information in the Woodward report. It is a matter of very considerable interest that in the time that I have had to compare the findings of the Woodward report on these matters in relation to Pochi and the detailed information contained in the AAT judgement, in no single respect have I been able to find any significant difference of detail in the two. </PARA>
<PARA> What does that add up to in the case of Pochi? In the first place I suggest that, as with Barbaro, it still is possible to conclude, although no doubt with a little more difficulty, that Pochi was not other than an extremely marginal figure in the Riverina marihuana growing operation led by the Sergi and Trimboli families. I do not think there is any doubt that Pochi was involved and was seeking in some ways to get a piece of the action in 1974 and 1975. It is a matter of some regret, I suppose, for the continuing credibility of the Pochi family that they are still denying that when there is so much evidence suggestive to that effect on the record. But there just does not seem to be anywhere, when one looks meticulously at what came out before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and when one looks even more meticulously at the 40 or 50 pages of typewritten material in volume 2 of the Woodward report, to justify any more substantial conclusion than that he was a marginal figure.</PARA>
<PARA> He is referred to by Mr Justice Woodward at some passage of his report as being a more significant figure in the so-called secret organisation than four other named individuals. But that leads one to conclude that he is a less significant figure than the 13 or 14 other named individuals who elsewhere in the Woodward report are described as constituting the core of that organisation and who are physically based around the Griffith area. It is just very difficult, based on the bald assertions that are contained in these documents at the Woodward level, to conclude more than that it was a matter of inference based on the family ties -Mr Pochi, through his wife, with the Sergis-and of course, his involvement in the wine business through which it appears some money did in fact pass in 1974 and 1975. The evidence simply just does not go beyond that. I do not think there is any doubt that he was involved. Equally, I do not think any impartial observer could be left with any doubt that his involvement was only marginal, indirect and of a kind that was very distant from the action. </PARA>
<PARA> As to his possible involvement in the Mackay disappearance, which if there was a skerrick of evidence of that kind would be material of the most devastating kind for his credibility and the credibility of those who worry about what has happened, there is absolutely nothing in any of the Woodward material which even begins to draw any linkages of Pochi himself with what happened. The most that is said about the responsibility of the Griffith principles, the centrepiece of the organisation, for the Mackay death is set out on page 608 of volume 2 of the Woodward report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The likelihood is that it-</PARA>
<PARA>Meaning the disappearance and presumed death of Donald Mackay-</PARA>
<PARA>was effected by or on behalf of an organisation of persons to whom his continued existence and his attitude in relation to the drug menace in Griffith, was an embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the conclusion. As I have said, it does not link Pochi with that in any other way than through the assertion that Pochi was a significant member of the organisation, which is not backed up in all the mass of detail contained in these reports by any more substantial evidence than that which was before Mr Justice Brennan of the AAT and which was meticulously considered by him. It is a very interesting question that if it is remotely believed by the Minister that Pochi may know something about the dissappearance and presumed death of Mackay, even though it also has to be borne in mind that he was in gaol at the time Mackay actually disappeared, why on earth is Pochi not being regarded as a witness of quite indispensable relevance to the forthcoming coronial inquiry into the presumed death of Donald Mackay? Why is it not that, indeed, his presence is being actively sought by the Government in order to get at once and for all the truth of that tragic matter? I suggest that the reality is that nobody seriously believes that Pochi himself had anything to do with it or that he was in any way but the most marginal way I have retailed connected with those who may well have had something to do with it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is said by the Minister in respect of Pochi as it was with respect to Barbaro that it would be naive to believe that he had anything other than a continuing involvement with this organisation, through which he was connected by a family relationship. But, again, where is the evidence for that? There was none whatsoever advanced by the Minister. There was none forthcoming in 1979 before Mr Justice Brennan. There was nothing in the Woodward report which came out in October 1979 to suggest any continuing involvement after the date of Pochi's original arrest back in 1975. There was nothing in the behaviour and circumstances of Pochi and his family, which have been the subject of quite elaborate and extensive affirmations and certifications by various members of this Commonwealth Parliament on both sides of politics and by members of the Canberra community who knew him well. The suggestion that Pochi continues to be some dark and sinister figure of significance in this obviously dark and sinister organisation just does not add up. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot more could be said about the individual cases but I do not want to burden the Senate with any more detail than that. What I think though has to be said, and said once again, about the Pochi case in particular is that there is a very misleading aspect of it contained in the Minister's statement. Coming from a man who claims the kind of credibility and integrity that Ian Macphee does, it is something that I find particularly disturbing; this is the way in which the references to the Woodward report have been strewn around this rather brief and cursory ministerial statement in such a way as to create a devastating set of atmospherics for anyone seeking to get at the truth and for anyone who seeks to argue that the case against these fellows is less than substantial. An emotional environment is created by those references which makes it very difficult to try to rationally pick apart and articulate why it is that one is still left with a lingering sense of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is that when one-I suppose I have really made these points- closely examines the Woodward report one simply does not find in it the kind of material directly linking the general assertions about what was going on in Griffith with the activities of these individuals. Of all those things I guess the worst single thing about the ministerial statement is the bald assertion in it that Mr Justice Brennan did not have the Woodward Commission report before him when he made the findings he did. That part of the statement conveying the clear implication-the intended implication-to any reader or listener that if Mr Justice Brennan only had these two massive volumes of material before him he could not have done other than find that Pochi was simply not a person of the character, the reputation, the antecedents and the likely future behaviour to justify a continuing place in the Australian community. But of course, as has been said, and must be said again for the record tonight, Mr Justice Brennan, did, as I have been saying, have the relevant part of the Woodward findings before him. So much is absolutely clear from that part of his judgment when he deals with the evidence given in camera to him by a police officer. Page 270 of the Australian Law Reports report of the case in 1979 states:</PARA>
<PARA> In order to strengthen the case against the applicant, the respondent-</PARA>
<PARA>the Minister, that is-</PARA>
<PARA>called Detective Senior Constable R. A. Jenkins to give evidence. Detective Jenkins is an experienced officer of the New South Wales police force who served with the New South Wales Drug Squad from 1970 to 1977 and who performed duty with the New South Wales Commission into Drugs-</PARA>
<PARA>the Woodward Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>for some 15 months. </PARA>
<PARA> He gave me certain information in a hearing from which the public and the applicant were excluded. Though the applicant's legal advisers were present at this hearing, they were prohibited from disclosing to the applicant the evidence then given. </PARA>
<PARA>Then, after some pages of procedural analysis, is the conclusion as to what was that in camera evidence from the man who was a member of the Woodward team for 15 months. Page 274 is in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> In the present case, the public interest in protecting the sources of information used to combat crime was paramount, and it was necessary to ensure confidentiality of the evidence which referred to information of that kind given to Detective Jenkins. In a court of law, the evidence would not have been given at all: . . . Accordingly, the applicant and the public (but not the applicant's counsel and solicitors) were excluded while Detective Jenkins gave some of his evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> But the evidence given in camera before me did not live up to expectations in that it lacked the cogency which would support a finding of fact against the applicant. In part that evidence was hearsay, and hearsay inevitably lacks the cogency inherent in evidence given by a person who has personal knowledge of the facts to which he deposes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is to be noted that Mr Justice Brennan said that only in part was the evidence hearsay. There tends to be a disposition on the part of some people, lawyers and non-lawyers alike, to say that Mr Justice Brennan was being too technical in excluding ordinarily inadmissible evidence, that he was not sufficiently taking into account evidence that might have been technically inadmissible but nonetheless extremely probative. </PARA>
<PARA> That point has been taken but it is to be noted that Mr Justice Brennan said that only in part was the evidence of a hearsay kind. Obviously, there was more substantial evidence which would have been admissible which he did nonetheless take into account. It is very difficult to find, as Senator Durack would know as he put him on the High Court, a judge who is a more meticulous, cautious, rigorous or fairminded man than Mr Justice Brennan. He had before him all the evidence that was before the Woodward Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking. That the Woodward Commission had no more evidence about Pochi than was before Brennan appears clearly, from looking at what Woodward said, analysing evidence and what is said in the AAT case before Mr Justice Brennan. It is also clear from some throw-away lines from Mr Justice Woodward that, in effect, the evidence in question was co-extensive before both bodies. It did not vary significantly. I do not understand the Minister to believe any differencly from that. I do not understand him to be denying that the evidence before Woodward was in fact any different from that before Mr Justice Brennan. He chose his words very carefully indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that there is that, although the Woodward Commission report, I think it has to be said, is not an intellectually distinguished document. It is a wilderness of single instances. It bears a close resemblance to a bowl of spaghetti with some hundreds and thousands tipped in as well. In terms of the interconnection of the various bits and pieces, it is full of assertions that, I think, are unbacked by evidence, or assertions that such evidence exists but cannot be put on the public record. It is not an impressive document and I say no more about it than that. It is certainly a massive accumulation of a lot of evidence which, in fact, rather unequivocally states that an awful lot of people have an awful lot to answer for. I thoroughly acknowledge that and he may well be right in the conclusions he draws about the responsibility of this particular interlocking group of families and the key members of them for what was going on in Griffith, of course, and more particularly for the death of Donald Mackay. He may well be right about that. All I am saying is that there is not much in any of that which really helps establish the Minister's case that he wants to make, that is, that Pochi and Barbaro were key figures, central figures, paid-up figures, continuing members of this particular organisation. That has to be the key question for us in this Parliament, or for anyone else in this community who is concerned to see that justice is done, to confront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a lot of other things-probably about two or three minutes worth-that can be said about the nature of these men, their individual character, the closeness of their families and the support they have had from their respective communities. Much can be said about the meticulous attention that was paid to their characters by the respective judges of the AAT. But the real question has to be reduced to that which I have been posing throughout everything I have said : What was the extent of their involvement in this activity? Was it essentially a one-off activity which ended after they were caught and for which they paid the price through our courts in the mid-1970s? Was it more extensive than that? Has it continued through to the present day such as to make these people dangerous to the extent that they are and remain continuing members of our community? That is the question that has to be answered. The question that we have to confront, if we take any of this matter seriously, is this: Has the Minister produced good enough reasons for second guessing the tribunals in the way that he has. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear that I do not object, and the Australian Labor Party does not object, to the general policy under this legislation of giving the Minister some additional discretion to make these hard decisions, responsible as he is to Parliament and running the gauntlet as he has today of criticism, such as that that has been mounted in the House of Representatives yesterday and here tonight . There may be cases when the Minister, after the AAT proceedings were all over and some rosy view of the character of the individual in question had been formed, where the Minister does get some additional evidence from sources which will not stand up to the technical rigours of admissibility criteria of courts of law. It may be that the Minister does get evidence coming into his office from people whose credibility is undoubted, evidence which is plausible, evidence which is probative and evidence which convinces the Minister beyond any shadow of doubt that the AAT missed something and that these are fellows who have to go. It is for that kind of reason, because of the importance of these matters, that the ultimate discretion is vested in the Minister. </PARA>

That is not the point. The point is that, having done all that, having no doubt satisfied himself-I have no doubt about the good faith of Mr Macphee; I am sure he has satisfied himself-the question is whether he can satisfy anyone else that he has done the right thing. I believe the only way he can do that and the only way we, as a result, can have confidence in the fairness and justness of this system, the only way we can have confidence in the continuing existence of these institutional relationships where the ultimate discretion is vested in the Executive rather than in the courts, is if we can be satisfied that the Minister did, in fact, have further and better information, further and better reasons, than those which were fully considered, those which were meticulously dealt with by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. If he cannot produce those reasons we are entitled to remain unsatisfied. If he does not want to produce the detailed information which might exist in support of those reasons I, for one, would be satisfied by an unequivocal declaration by the Minister that he does have further and better evidence, further and better information, available to him which he cannot disclose on the public record but which has been crucial to his making up his mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No such declaration has been forthcoming from Mr Macphee. In fact, everything he said, if one analyses his statement carefully and analyses carefully what he said in the House of Representatives, is no more that the AAT Mr Justice Brennan and Mr Justice Fisher took this view of these particular facts: I, after wrestling with it, looking at it and taking into account the Woodward stuff, have taken a different view. I submit very seriously to the Senate, because no cheap, political points are to be scored obviously on a matter like this-most of the political points run the other way-that that is what is the matter with the ministerial statement that was put before us today. That is why it is that these men should not be deported until the Minister produces further and better reasons of that kind or at the very least some declaration that he does have further and better reasons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My postscript will be very limited. Anyone who had been probing the citizenship delays and bungling would know that the two applications that Mr Pochi made made him a victim of circumstances. Senator Evans mentioned that the law was changed about avoiding double penalties . I make a further observation. The population in Australia is composed of various components. When the matter of people who were involved in social security malpractices came up we made quite a fuss about people from one overseas country. But plenty of rorts were going on here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We can apply this to another situation. At this time we are concerned with two Anglo-Saxons, both of whom committed serious crimes. One person was concerned with drugs. The Attorney-General, Senator Durack, is in the chamber. I wonder whether he was aware of this situation when he visited New Zealand. There is a fair clue to be found, but I will not mention the two cases in detail. There is some problem because the Government wants to deport one person who was convicted of a serious crime. I agree with the Government I know there is difficulty about whether New Zealand will accept that person. These people were born in the United Kingdom, lived in New Zealand and came here. The other person is a New Zealand national. I round this off by saying that we should prove to Australia at large that we are all equal. If a person is an Anglo-Saxon we might hold the deportation order and if he is not we might apply that order more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had a high respect for the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee, as a Minister and as a man. But I seriously wonder about what will happen in the cases that I am talking about. What will happen if we take the plunge in the cases of the two people who have been mentioned tonight and the two whom I am thinking about and deport them? One could say that a person, whether he be a Latin or an Anglo-Saxon, is treated the same. There is a delay in the decision on whether New Zealand will take one or both of the people in the cases I am talking about. Surely this matter could be cleared up. But leaving aside the argument that Senator Evans has raised, all people whether they happen to be born in Britain, New Zealand or Italy should be treated the same when deportation decisions are being made. Leaving aside the matter of drugs I think the Minister ought to look twice at the varied components of our population. It may be that the two people I am thinking of will leave shortly too. One of them may appeal and I think the other appeal is over. One of them has drug connections. I make the point that we should adopt and evenhanded system in respect of deportations. I just add that postscript to the very lucid exposition produced by Senator Evans tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to add a degree of bipartisanship in the Senate to the question of the deportation of a person who has been an Australian resident-I suppose one could say nearly an Australian citizen-with an Australian family for a very considerable period. I have not the slightest doubt that everyone in this chamber would want to see either deported or in gaol any person whom it can be shown has been involved in one of the most despicable activities that can be engaged in by man-the drug trade. But there are processes and I find it very difficult to understand-unless either the processes can demonstrate through the legal system that the person ought to be gaoled or alternatively that the person is a visitor who has misbehaved while he is here- why he should be subjected to what might appear to be a somewhat arbitrary treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not go so far as advocating some of the suggestions made by Senator Evans but I just would like to suggest that it concerns me that a person who has a family in this country and who but for a bureaucratic bungle would be an Australian citizen and therefore not subject to deportation but subject to the due process of law, should appear to be subject to what might be regarded as an arbitrary whim unless there is demonstrable evidence to substantiate the very severe action which has been taken. I say that out of concern not for a person who has been convicted of an offence, which as I said I would regard as a rather despicable trade, but rather for a person who has been accepted by a community as a resident citizen who has an Australian family. I just join in expressing a concern that due process in a free country should appear demonstrably to have taken place. </PARA>

I do not propose to reassert at this hour the case that the Minister gave for the decision he made. He has given, I believe, a very clear account of his reasons to the Parliament. It appears, however, that Senator Evans is critical of the reasons behind the decision. That is a matter for the record. I am pleased that he has not suggested that the Minister perhaps came to a conclusion which, on the evidence, was not justified. Senator Evans has acknowledged that the Minister approached the matter with a good deal of care and anxiety and even anguish and that he has made a decision in a perfectly bona fide way. As I see it, the Minister made a decision which it was well within his power to make. I do not understand Senator Evans to have said that it was not within the Minister's powers to do that. </PARA>

The Minister, in making such a decision, should not be bound by the sort of legal strait-jacket which at times I have the feeling Senator Evans would like to impose upon him. The Minister has to look at all the facts and circumstances and to exercise a judgment in relation to all those matters. Again, I think Senator Evans acknowledged that the Minister could take into account matters which, for one reason or another, may not have been given weight by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That would not necessarily be confined to what lawyers regard as fresh evidence, although I thought that Senator Evans, from the view he expressed, would so confine such matters. Maybe I misunderstood him, but I thought he felt the Minister was restricted in that way. I do not believe that that is so. It is a matter of his powers.</PARA></TALK.START>

Of course, the Minister must exercise the discretion in the way that is well known. Judicially he may be corrected if he does not do so. But he does have that very wide discretion which is not necessarily exercised in the same way as a judge would exercise it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, in this case the Minister believed that the findings of the Woodward Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking had supplied him with a background to the activities of those people which, in at least one case, had been denied the judge who dealt with the matter. That perhaps provided the Minister with a setting which was not available to the judge, even though the evidence that was before the Woodward Commission in relation to that person may have been before the judge as well. But the Woodward Commission investigated the issue on a broader scale. I think it would be fair to say that it did provide a setting in which the activities of certain people, such as the two people concerned, could be judged. However, I think that the issue is different again from the perspective Senator Evans sought to put on it. The Minister has a very firm policy in relation to the deportation of serious drug offenders. That policy is that, unless there are very special circumstances, he will find in favour of deportation. </PARA>

Those who are convicted of drug trafficking must know, and should take account of the fact, that they are most likely to be deported. We could argue that there may be special circumstances and so on, but in the end these are matters which are assigned by this Parliament to the Minister. No one has suggested that the Minister has done anything other than act in a bona fide, careful and thoughtful manner, even though opinions may differ as to the decision he should have made.

<PARA> Senator Mulvihill's point, although perhaps inspired by the statement of the Minister, deals with another matter altogether. With such knowledge that I have from dealing with questions of parole for a large number of these people who are deported, I would not have any reason to believe that there is any discrimination on the basis of the origins of people in relation to their deportation. The matter is decided on the nature of the offence and on all the circumstances. Of course, people who come into the country for a brief period only have very little case against deportation. I see no evidence to suggest that any greater sympathy is given to people of Anglo-Saxon origin. Certainly a great number of people from New Zealand are deported to New Zealand. I am not aware of the particular cases that Senator Mulvihill mentioned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer gave an answer to a similar question in the House of Representatives on 9 September 1981 (Hansard, page 1133 ). The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Government, by its decision announced on 30 April 1981, formally accepted the Review of Commonwealth Functions decision that the differential between the interest rate on commercial borrowings by the Australian Wheat Board and that applicable to borrowings from the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank should be reduced by one percentage point.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Treasurer formally conveyed the Government's decision to the Governor of the Reserve Bank on 27 May 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Reserve Bank has the statutory responsibility to determine Rural Credits Department interest rates, although the practice has been for the Treasurer of the day to be consulted. The Treasurer's communication of the Government's decision to the Governor was part of that consultative process. It did not, therefore, require a formal reply.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Reserve Bank decided to increase Rural Credits Department interest rates on loans of more than $100,000 by one per cent per annum as from 22 June 1981. This was a general increase which was not restricted in its application to the Australian Wheat Board.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Insurance Commissioner has expressed his concern over developments in provisions for outstanding claims in the liability classes of business. He has expressed the expectation that some companies will be required to increase such provisions in the face of deficiencies perceived. The situation of individual companies will, of course, be kept under review in the context of the provisions of the Insurance Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The general purpose of the Insurance Act is to establish a system for the financial supervision of general insurance companies with a view to maintaining overall financial soundness and stability in the industry. The Act does not, however, purport to guarantee that an insurer will not fail. No system , however detailed and costly, could provide such a guarantee. Such a course would in any case tend to bring with it undesirable consequences in terms of lessened competition within the industry including in the provision of services and, in some degree, in the proper functioning of the economy generally. With regard to workers' compensation insurance and compulsory third party (motor vehicle) insurance it is relevant that the States and Territories have important responsibilities in these areas.</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Treasurer aware of weekend press reports in the Brisbane Sunday Sun ( dated 8 November 1981) that the Soviet Government is poised to participate directly in Queensland's resources boom as a joint partner with private enterprise in a feasibility study into a $1.2 billion coking project at Mackay, which is intended to convert coal from the Central Queensland Gregory South Mine into coke for export. Is there a participation by the French Socialist Government in the proposed mining, milling and export of uranium at Ben Lomond, in North Queensland.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is understood that the Queensland Government has had discussions with a consortium comprising Kennecott Copper Corporation of the USA and two Australian companies, New Hope Collieries Pty Ltd and Minerals and Energy Development NL, about the possible construction of a coke plant at Mackay based on coal from the Gregory South coal deposit. The project is at a very early planning stage and a feasibility study has been commenced. Soviet technology is being considered for use in the proposed plant but there has been no proposal for the Soviet Government to become a joint venture partner or take up an equity position in the venture.</PARA>
<PARA> The Ben Lomond uranium deposit in North Queensland is owned by Minatome Australia Pty Ltd, which is owned 50 per cent each by two Franch companies, the Total group of companies and the Pechiney Ugine Kuhlmann group. The French Government has equity and voting power in Compagnie Francaise des Petroles, the holding company of the Total group of companies. At the end of 1979, the French Government held 96 per cent of the B shares and had 40 per cent of total voting rights in the company. Pechiney Ugine Kuhlmann is a private group of companies, and the French Government is at present understood to be involved in negotiations to nationalise the group. The Ben Lomond project is still at the feasibility study stage and Minatome Australia Pty Ltd is aware that it will need to meet the Government's foreign investment policy requirements before the project proceeds to development. Under the Government's policy, new projects for the mining and production of uranium are expected, as a general rule, to have 75 per cent Australian equity and to be Australian controlled.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Considerable information on the levels and flows of foreign investment in enterprises in Australia is already available to the Government through the existing data collections of the Australian Bureau of Statistics and through the Foreign Investment Review Board. To supplement that information, the Treasurer has, as announced on 20 January 1982, asked the Bureau to reintroduce surveys measuring more specifically the extent of foreign ownership and control in sectors of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) If Australia is to take advantage of the benefits of foreign investment, a balance needs to be struck between, on the one hand, protecting the legitimate interests of Australians in participating in national economic development and, on the other hand, allowing businesses having foreign interests adequate scope and flexibility to make investment and other decisions that are essential if that development is to proceed.</PARA>

<PARA> I undertook to refer the matter to the Treasurer, who has provided the following response to the question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is already making a substantial contribution to the Games in a number of ways, including a grant of $10m towards the cost of capital facilities; and additional $2.7m for extra accommodation at the Games Village; $20.6m to enable the ABC to act as host broadcaster; a grant of $1.5m in lieu of revenue from the marketing of commemorative coins; at least $2m in administrative and other support by Commonwealth Departments; $0.7m for pre- event training for the Games and for the staging of trial Games in 1981; $0.6m for the Commonwealth Games Arts Festival; and $1.2m assistance for upgrading some sports facilities. Against the background that gifts to assist the financing of international sporting or athletic events have never before been allowed tax deductibility, the Government decided, some time ago, that gifts to the Foundation should not be deductible.
