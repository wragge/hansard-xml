<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> Concerned about the high and increasing rate of divorce and family breakdown,</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the developing trend toward granting exclusive television coverage rights to commercial networks in preference to the Australian Broadcasting Commission is needlessly depriving many Australian taxpayers in country and remote areas of the opportunity to witness major sporting and other important events.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> Governmental deregulation of interest rates and the resultant competition for investors' funds is against the national interest. It is inflationary and penetrates every sphere of the economy. It is an intolerable burden on first home buyers and individuals or families already in possession of a mortgage. Constantly increasing interest rates have a staggering effect on the future budgetary planning of these people. Those most affected are, of course, the poor , but recent increases have hit even the middle income earner. Ordinary Australians should not be forced to pay for the excessive profits announced regularly by financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should pass an Act amending the Banking Act 1959, providing that increases in the rate of interest be limited to 1 per cent per annum, and that any increases above that amount be made subject to the approval of both Houses of Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the members of the Women's Services of the 1939-45 War not at present considered eligible for Defence Service Home Loans should qualify as 'Australian Soldiers' under the Defence Service Homes Act. They volunteered for service with the Naval, Military and Air Forces, serving wherever they were sent in whatever capacity they were required and yet are refused Defence Service Home Loans.</PARA>
<PARA> They took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies which meant to fight His Majesty's enemies, and although not used in actual combat in war zones, they were available for that use and had a sufficiently grave need arisen would have been used, to serve with distinction as have women of other lands.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Acts and Regulations of the period, the women of the Military Forces had enlisted for service anywhere, some of the Naval women to sail in any waters, others with service on warships optional, while the women of the Airforce could have been sent to Papua New Guinea or other territories under the control or care of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Ex-servicemen of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force who volunteered in the 1939-45 War but were not sent to War Zones are granted home loans. Not to grant eligibility to all Ex- servicewomen of 1939-45 War is unjust and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that you favourably consider amending the Defence Service Homes Act by repealing Sub-section 4 (2A) (b) (c) (d) of the Principal Act as amended by No. 137 of 1978, and grant eligibility to all members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, and the Voluntary Aid Detachment of 1939-45 War.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address a question to the Minister for National Development and Energy. I refer to a report in the Daily Telegraph of 4 March on holdups in the construction of the Split Rock Dam. I note that this dam is of considerable significance to the Namoi valley, an area of great production and great potential.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="636" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In short, the article in the Daily Telegraph is inaccurate. The background is that on 15 September of last year I announced the allocation for approved projects under the Budget appropriation of some $34.9m under the National Water Resources Program. That was an increase of about 20 per cent. Amongst the allocations for New South Wales under that program was an amount of $1.5m for Split Rock Dam. This was to be provided by the Commonwealth on a dollar for dollar basis with expenditure by the New South Wales Government and it followed the provision by the Commonwealth of an amount of $0.5m for the preliminary work on the dam in 1981-82. I understand the New South Wales Government has now accepted the offer, but I also understand that expenditure on the dam this year will be only around $560,000. On a dollar for dollar basis this means that New South Wales will be drawing only $280,000 of the $1.5m which the Commonwealth has made available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also understand that the work which has been carried out has been on some designs and investigations and upon the improvement of an access road. It appears, therefore, that the New South Wales Government has given a low priority to the dam; it has done so in the past. I am advised that the New South Wales Government has, nevertheless, requested a long term commitment by the Commonwealth to meet a major contract for the construction of the dam. This request is being considered in the light of the next Budget. It is not true, as the article alleges, that a new funding proposal by the New South Wales Government has been rejected by the Commonwealth and that this could bring work on the dam to a stop. The situation is, as I have outlined, that almost $1.2 m is available to New South Wales, which it appears the New South Wales Government , for whatever reason, will not be utilising. Progress on the dam is in the hands of that Government. Commonwealth funds are available which the New South Wales Government is not utilising.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Special benefit is available to a person under the age of 16 years only in circumstances of hardship. Normally a child of that age is in the care and custody of his or her parents and is the responsibility of those parents, who continue to receive assistance by way of family allowance for the child. Unfortunately there are circumstances where children are not able to rely on that, although happily that is a minority situation in Australia. In circumstances where a child is left without support, it may involve the intervention of State community welfare departments, which have, of course, the primary responsibility for the protection of children who do not have the protection of their natural parents. In limited circumstances special benefit is granted by the Commonwealth to provide income support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In general, social security benefits are not available as an educational benefit. As the Senate would know, educational benefits are provided in limited circumstances to secondary students through the secondary allowance scheme. Again, that is a benefit which is directed to the primary situation where children are at home. At a later stage of education, students can receive a Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance, which is paid at a different rate according to whether the student is independent or living at home. I would have to check the practice of the past, but my understanding is that, in general , special benefit would not be seen as an appropriate form of support for a child at school.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations aware of the disruption to schooling in the Australian Capital Territory presently being caused by rolling strikes being organised by the Australian Capital Territory Teachers Federation? Has the Federation claim been referred to arbitration? What is the present position of negotiations between the Public Service Board and the Teachers Federation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="637" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think most people have heard reports about the rolling strikes which are being conducted by some teachers in the Australian Capital Territory. I think most people would have been cheered by the reports this morning that a large number of teachers appear to have ignored the request that they take strike action and have continued to remain on duty and available to the children whom they were employed to teach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have some information on the dispute from the Minister for Industrial Relations. The Public Service Board has a salary claim before it on behalf of teachers employed in the Commonwealth Teaching Service. The Commonwealth is, of course, generally a minor employer of teachers, the major employers being the large State education departments which employ the majority of teachers around Australia. The Board considers that it should follow standards established for teachers by the States rather than be a pace-setter in this area. I think, in light of the relative importance of the Commonwealth as an employer in this field, that is clearly an appropriate approach. The Board informed the Teachers Federation in February that Commonwealth teacher rates were at that stage broadly in line with State rates but that reviews of teacher rates were known to be in progress in the three eastern States. The Board undertook to respond to the claim as soon as the results of the reviews in those States were known.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter came before Justice Cohen in the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on 1 March 1982. Justice Cohen agreed that the Board did not have material on which to base an offer which would resolve the claim. After hearing arrangements she determined that teachers would have a guaranteed date of operation of new rates which resulted from the claim and set that date at 11 March 1982. Justice Cohen also asked that members of the Federation be realistic and indicated that stop work meetings would not achieve an earlier resolution of the problem. Notwithstanding those comments by Justice Cohen and the assured date of effect for any increases which might subsequently be awarded, the Federation has embarked on a program of rolling stoppages which are disrupting schools in the Australian Capital Territory and inflicting considerable hardship on parents and students. I repeat, however, that those teachers are fortunately inflicting less hardship than is apparently the Federation's objective and intention. The Board has reaffirmed that it will make an offer when the current reviews of State teacher rates are known. The Queensland decision was announced last Friday. The Victorian decision is understood to be imminent. In New South Wales the case is part heard.</PARA>
<PARA> I think most Australians and most honourable senators would find the actions of the teachers both unwarranted and unprofessional. They are inflicting hardship on innocent members of the Australian Capital Territory community in circumstances where their rights have, in fact, been fully protected by the arbitral authority by guaranteeing rises from a set date, as I previously mentioned. I join with others in urging the teachers to cease industrial action and to await the outcome of the New South Wales and Victorian reviews. The teachers have the alternative of proceeding with their case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on 19 March when the claim is due to be resumed before Justice Cohen. I think it would be common ground that this sort of rolling strike action, or indeed any strike action which is likely to prejudice the education of children, is highly undesirable and should not be entered into by people with a professional responsibility.</PARA>

Is it a fact that most nations, including some of Australia's near neighbours, have the ability to fire missiles in salvos ? Is it not a fact that a determined missile attack from the sea or the air would sink Invincible if she were armed to the extent of Government announce- ments so far?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator TOWNLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Health to an article which appeared recently in the Australian Financial Review and which was headed 'US Cancer Report Staggers Smokers' in which the United States Surgeon- General said that cigarette smoking was clearly identified as the chief preventable cause of death from cancer in our society and added that 30 per cent of all cancers-not just chest cancers-were attributable to smoking. His superior also urged non-smokers to avoid inhaling secondhand cigarette smoke even though the link there is still a matter of some scientific debate. Therefore, I ask: As the United States Surgeon-General is not likely to issue such a statement unless it is strongly backed by scientific evidence, will the Federal Government have the Department of Health examine that report as soon as possible and, if it is agreed with, give it great publicity, ban smoking in aircraft and in public buildings, particularly those which are airconditioned and in which much of the air is recirculated so that people are forced to breathe in smoke which they might not otherwise want, and recommend to the States that they enact such laws as necessary to protect non-smokers from having to put up with the most dangerous pastime that smoking obviously is?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will come as no surprise to honourable senators to know that I have some interest in the matter raised by Senator Townley. Senator Townley may or may not be aware that the United States Surgeon-General has issued not one report but some four or five reports and has said the same thing over 10 or 15 years. What he has said accords generally with what Senator Townley has set out-that the evidence seems to be that a whole range of cancers and other illnesses are associated with cigarette smoking. I think the evidence on that is fairly firm now and fairly widely accepted. Senator Townley asked about the effect of inhaling side stream smoke from other people. I think there is some evidence, but it is not as strong; the case is not as dramatic or the public health issue is not as immediate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I assure Senator Townley that the reports produced by the Surgeon-General are always examined by the Government and that they are regarded as significant reports in the same way as the reports of the Royal College of Physicians are regarded as significant. Senator Townley would be aware that, following a report from a committee of this Senate, the Government announced a policy which set out as an objective a reduction in cigarette smoking in Australia. So, Government policy is clear. There is already a policy relating to government offices about which Senator Townley asked specifically. It has already been possible to work out in a co-operative way with Public Service unions and, in terms of Public Service policy, a set of arrangements which govern smoking in offices where Commonwealth employment occurs.</PARA>
<PARA> The arrangement in relation to aeroplanes is clearly quite unsatisfactory in terms of the number of non-smoking seats and the way in which the seats are arranged. I hope that the airlines continue to take a responsible view of this matter. As regards action in relation to the States, all we can do is make known to various State authorities Senator Townley's concerns on this very important matter.</PARA>

<PARA> The need for restraint on public sector expenditure has obliged the Government to continue the waiting period for loans to buy a home which was instituted by the Labor Government as a period of 14 months in 1975.

At present I can see little prospect of being able to reduce that period further so as to allow reserve personnel to be eligible for this kind of loan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Archer prefaced his question by a comment on the industrial strife last year in Australian ports. I think late last year my colleague, Mr Viner, released figures showing that there was a very serious state of industrial disputation during that year. In the latter part of 1981, in New South Wales in particular, there was a great deal of difficulty with numerous ships waiting outside ports, sometimes for weeks at a time. There was a bit of a flurry in this chamber when the decision was taken by the London based strike club to review its premium rates on Australian shipping strike insurance, which was seen to be an indication of a serious position for Australian importers, exporters and the community, which, ultimately, bears the cost of these strikes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter came up at the Premiers Conference in Canberra on 19 February. There was agreement that urgent steps should be taken by the Commonwealth, the States, employers and unions to look at the waterfront and maritime industries. They were to examine things such as demarcation disputes to try to get some order and predictability into the waterfront. There was a meeting of Commonwealth and State Labour Ministers on 4 March 1982 which, as required by the Premiers Conference, looked at these matters. Discussions are to be held as a matter of urgency with all parties in the maritime area. We received a further warning last week at the Australian-German trade symposium that we would need to improve our performance in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> Against that background, it is of course very disappointing to hear that Australian ports are again the subject of industrial disruption. As I understand it, the dispute is over a relatively small item. It concerns pay relativities between various classifications and the differences are relatively minor. The result at the moment is further delay, further cost, and that means a cost to everybody. It is the hope of the Government that this matter can be speedily resolved so that further damage is not dealt to our already tarnished international trading reputation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the precise figures but I am very happy to get them. The fact of the matter is that under the National Water Resources Program it is assumed that, in the first place, the primary and dominant responsibility for water matters rests with the States and that this project is a supplementary one. A global amount is determined, in the budgetary sense, by the Commonwealth. It is then broken up into a notional amount for each State, depending on population and demography. The States are then invited to submit their priorities as to how they would like the programs introduced and financed on the basis that their priorities would be met on a dollar for dollar basis. My instinct is that the States generally over the years of this program, having accepted the dollar for dollar basis, backed it and, in fact, spent the money. It is only in more recent times that there has been a tendency not to take up the money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would be very happy to have a table prepared and incorporated in Hansard showing the amount offered, the amount accepted and the amount spent by each State. We should bear in mind that New South Wales, being a larger State, would tend to get a larger share than, say, Tasmania. However, I think it is true to say that Queensland has done very well in recent times. I will look at that matter. In previous years there have been determinations that there would be no commitment on other than a year by year basis. I rely on memory in saying that this matter arose at the tail end of the 1980 elections and there was pressure to get the dam started. The Commonwealth, which had no money for that program and which had not had any high priority request at all from New South Wales for the Split Rock Dam, authorised, I think through me-this is subject to checking- $500,000 towards a starting program. That was the start of the Split Rock Dam project back in 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> The next step was in relation to the money that was offered and accepted under the National Water Resources Program, as is normally the case on a year by year basis. As I understand it, the State has now asked for a significant amount of money-some $5m. Again, that is subject to checking. In itself, that is an unusually large sum in terms of the National Water Resources Program. That is bearing in mind we are talking about dividing some $34m among six States, so we are looking at around $5m for any one State. That would be unusual. The state of the matter at the moment is that an approach has been made and will be considered when we get the quantum, when we break this up, ask the States for their priorities and then determine how much money we can allocate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter to which Senator Jessop referred has been a matter of public knowledge for some time. I think it is approximately 12 months since Senator Grimes presented the second draft of this paper in this place. Since then it has been a public document. Certainly for almost 12 months there has been no motive on the part of this Government to suppress any document of that kind. In fact I would have thought that all interest in the matter would have fallen away since it became a public document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent times, as has been referred to by Mr Alcorta in Darwin, there has been reference to a further document of which I was not aware but of which I became aware a few days ago. That document is merely a third draft of all those that have gone before and, I understand, substantially is no different from those which have been previously presented publicly. The second draft, to which I referred, was also made public by the Department of Veterans' Affairs by presentation to the Senate Committee on Science and the Environment some three months ago. Again, substantially there is no issue of concern there.</PARA>
<PARA> I deal now with the question why initially there was no presentation of that document. I correct Senator Jessop who said that that document was a report. Rather it was a collection of various items which have appeared in medical and other journals from time to time and was the property of one Mr John Evans, scientific adviser to the Vietnam Veterans' Association. It was never the property of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Dr Keith Fleming, who presently holds a very senior position in the Public Service of the Northern Territory and who moved there I think in May of last year, left of his own volition. Certainly there was no pressure or whatever might have been implied by Senator Jessop's question in that regard.</PARA>

Although Keith Fleming assisted by putting together the various articles presented to the Department by Mr John Evans, he had no ownership of that collation of documents. Consequently, it is not his material. As I understand the position, its ownership does not vest in any way with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The only owner of this material that I can identify is Mr Evans himself. It remains for Mr Evans to make any public statement about the ownership of the material. I do not think he has done that over the 12 months period since it was first presented in this place, so I assume that he agrees with my conclusion. Senator Jessop asked me whether I am prepared to table the document. If that action will clear the air once and for all, I am quite prepared to do so. I table the report.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans referred to me a record of an A.M. discussion in relation to this matter. My attention was thereby drawn to it. There is some element of a Blue Hills saga about this matter, but perhaps as Senator Evans has raised it more details should be referred to. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration provisionally accepted for inclusion in one of its proposed space shuttle flights an experiment by Dr Dintenfass of Sydney Hospital. The objective of the experiment is to observe the aggregation of human red blood cells in conditions approaching zero gravity. The acceptance by NASA of the experiment is , however, provisional upon the Commonwealth entering into an agreement with NASA in relation to the experiment. The proposed terms of an agreement were first forwarded by NASA to the Department of Science and Technology in March 1978. I do not propose to set out all the details of the proposal but I will make them available to honourable senators who are interested. The terms of the proposed agreement have been prepared from time to time, and the final agreement has still not yet been determined, although negotiations have been going on since March 1978.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present problem is that NASA sought an undertaking from the Commonwealth in relation to sharing in meeting claims for damage caused to persons and property, being damage for which there is a liability in international law under the principles of the convention on international liability for damage caused by space objects. The terms of the undertaking were not limited to the consequences of Dr Dintenfass's actions. So it is not a question of whether the Commonwealth might be liable for what is clearly most improbable damage being caused by any of Dr Dintenfass's experiments; it is simply that we were asked to accept a share of liability in relation to damage that may be caused by the space shuttle carrying the experiment.</PARA>

I read out verbatim and did not paraphrase what the Prime Minister had said. In fact, the news item was completely the reverse of what the Prime Minister had said. That led to the comment that there was a difference between us. What the Prime Minister said and what I said are in parallel. The Prime Minister, as I understand it, has given an answer today in another place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me remind Senator Tate that yesterday I repeated precisely what is the situation and what is the policy; that is, we have a policy of import parity pricing and that that pricing varies in the ordinary context each 1 July and 1 January. The Government looks at the movement of the Saudi Arabian light crude price and the exchange rate and makes the adjustment. It has done so over the years that import parity pricing has operated. Indeed, the Government has adjusted the price downwards twice due to exchange rate movements. That is the policy. I have said so before. I have not qualified that in any way at all.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will await the meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries on 19 March when it will be looking at both the reduction in the volume of oil throughout the world and any adjustment of price and the Government will look at the Saudi decision in that regard. We have been very fortunate in choosing Saudi light crude oil as a world bench mark. In fact, it has been much cheaper over the years than most other oils purchasable in the world. Therefore, we have had a very good benefit from that supply. There is no difference at all in what is being said by any Minister of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware of the precise purchases in recent months and the precise prices paid. That information can be secured, of course, and I will be happy to secure it. I want to make it very clear, though, that if the implication is that one should buy on spot markets instead of buying from countries on long term contract that will assure oil year in and year out, all I can say is that that course is absolutely perilous. The International Energy Agency in June last year drew the attention of all countries-it was unanimously agreed-to the fact that spot markets should not be operated upon. Australia needs to get some 33 per cent of its oil from overseas. It naturally wants to have secure markets. Australia has established very good relations with Saudi Arabia from which it gets a great bulk of its oil supplies. It would be to the nth degree perilous if one started playing around with spot markets.</PARA>

That information has now been provided to me by way of a letter dated 8 March. I seek leave to have the letter incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>MINISTER FOR ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS CANBERRA, A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Crichton-Browne,</PARA>
<PARA> On 27 October 1981 you asked a question without notice about matters contained in the World Council of Churches report 'Justice for Aboriginal Australians'. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the matters concerned the Western Australian Government's administration of Aboriginal affairs, I sought information from the Hon. W. R. Hassell, M.L.A., Minister for Community Welfare in Western Australia. Mr Hassell has now provided me with details in response to your questions. </PARA>
<PARA> You asked me to respond to the World Council of Churches report's claim that the Western Australian Government spent only $373,000 on Aboriginal health services in 1980 and that the staff providing those services are predominantly white. You also asked whether it is a fact that $6m was provided for community and health services alone in 1980, that it was predominantly directed towards Aborigines and that one-third of the staff are Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hassell has informed me that in addition to funds provided by the Commonwealth, the State Government also makes significant contributions from its own funds. In 1979, the last year for which figures are available, the Western Australian Government spent more than $15.5 million on health care for Aborigines, in addition to funds provided by the Commonwealth. The need to train Aboriginal people in health care skills is clearly recognized, and in 1981 of a total of 261 nursing staff attached to the Community Health and Child Services branch of the Medical Department, 80 were Aboriginal health workers, 81 were Aboriginal camp nurses, and four were trained Aboriginal nurses. </PARA>
<PARA> You asked whether I was aware that the World Council of Churches report claimed that Western Australian funding for schools for Aborigines is very inadequate and that there is no consultation mechanism with Aborigines. You also asked whether it is a fact that there are 23 special and exclusive Aboriginal schools and an Aboriginal access program that fosters adult education, that last year the Western Australian Govern ment spent approximately $13m over and above the $ 25m which was provided by the Commonwealth, and that at the same time there is through the Aboriginal Affairs and Planning Authority a substantial mechanism for co-operation and consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hassell has informed me that the Western Australian Education Department provides special programs for Aborigines in all age groups from pre-school to tertiary level. In 1980-81 it has been estimated that the State spent almost $14 .5m providing these programs. </PARA>
<PARA> You asked whether I was conscious of the fact that the World Council of Churches report claims that Aborigines in Western Australia have no land rights at all. You also asked whether it is a fact that the State's Aborigines have 21 million hectares of reserves, with tenure that is superior to freehold tenure. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hassell has replied that 19.2 million hectares of reserve land are vested in the Aboriginal Lands Trust and a further 2.5 million hectares are held by Aborigines under various forms of leasehold or freehold. It is also his belief that land reserved under the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act offers a form of tenure more secure than freehold as the consent of State Parliament is required if the status of the land is to be altered. </PARA>
<PARA> You asked whether I was aware that the World Council of Churches report claims that Western Australian police have no training with regard to Aboriginal matters and suggests the creation of a liaison committee. You also asked whether it is a fact that the Western Australian police force has an active force of Aboriginal police aides improving police-Aboriginal relations and that the Western Australian Government already has a special committee to further these relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hassell has responded that your comments with regard to arrangements for consultation and co-ordination and action taken to improve Aboriginal-police relations require no elaboration. </PARA>
<PARA> You asked whether 'inasmuch as the World Council of Churches report is a litany of untruths and distortions of fact' I would undertake to inform the Senate as to the precise position concerning that report in regard to these details. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have no objection should you wish to have this letter incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make one more reference to something I mentioned on 25 February 1982, as reported at page 527 of Senate Hansard, which I believe will establish continuity between my two contributions to this debate. I referred to a statement that Senator Archer had made, and said :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He might like to be reminded that more small businesses, and fairly large businesses, have gone bankrupt since 1975 under the two governments with which Senator Archer has been associated than had gone bankrupt in the previous 20 years. It is largely as a result of the activities of this Government that so many bankruptcies are occurring not only in my State of Queensland but also in many other places. </PARA>
<PARA>The continuing attempt of the Government to impose these new sales taxes has created a wide division in the community. In my estimation, the Government has deliberately set out to divide the community further. In particular I refer to some of the activities of the Government in a number of areas. First of all the Government came in on a promise in 1975 to control inflation. It has been impossible for the Government to do so because it created the very areas in which inflation will increase. It also came in on a promise to reduce unemployment. Unemployment escalated and has now become a great social stigma on this country particularly with unemployed school leavers. Youngsters who left school four years ago still do not have a job. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government then turned itself to another field where it has used every possible opportunity to create a war. In particular I refer to the opposition of the Australian Labor Party to the establishment and export of the Sinai peacekeeping force. People will travel with that group and be involved in an organisation that does not come under the umbrella of the United Nations. It will create a small stir in the economy because of the purchase and manufacture of equipment and supplies and matters connected with travel but it will not be of any lasting benefit and could create a situation where this country will get involved in a much larger conflict as happened when we first sent people to Vietnam as advisers. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost every week since 1 January this year some senior member of the Government has come out and backed the United States of America in its attempt to blame Russia for a whole series of problems in Poland. This country ought to be helping resolve the problems of Poland and not causing further conflict by coming out behind America. Why we have to do this all the time I will never know . Mr Anthony, the Acting Prime Minister at the time went on record supporting the principle of the intervention in El Salvador. We are paying out money through the underground but that money would be much better spent in Australia so that the imposition of sales taxes would not be necessary at all.</PARA>
<PARA> The complaints about loss of revenue do not really stand up to public scrutiny. After all, the amount that will be lost in a full year is so small that it is virtually tea and bikkies money or petty cash in the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). While on the one hand the Government is complaining about loss of revenue on the other there are no problems in spending money by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I witness the recent decision to have the Prime Minister's portrait hung in King's Hall at a cost of about $6,000. I witness also the sound proofing of the dining room at the Lodge at a cost of something like $2,500. I have never been privileged to sit in the dining room at the Lodge but I am told that it is a quite impressive place. The mere fact that sound proofing has to be carried out is rather ridiculous unless of course Malcolm has an argument with his wife or, alternatively, if the Governor-General says that the Prime Minister has not enough evidence for a double dissolution and his wife starts to throw her $8,000 set of dinner plates around. That was bought shortly after the Prime Minister said: 'Life was not meant to be easy'. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the Prime Minister gave a speech of gloom about the economy. It appears, from the imports of today, that we seem to be taking in all of the financial problems of other countries. I realise that we cannot insulate ourselves against them but we do not have to co-operate and bring them in in large quantities, which is what this Government has done. There were complaints about the Australian Labor Party, when in office, obtaining money not through the usual laundered method but trying to obtain it directly. This Government has brought in more laundered Arab money by way of loans than the Labor Party ever proposed borrowing. The Government is still doing it, and it is doing it surreptitiously so that the public will not find out. The speech of the Prime Minister yesterday probably peeled another 3,000 votes off the Liberal Party candidate in Lowe. Heavens above, he is having enough of a battle now, what with the statement of Sir Phillip Lynch and other acts of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Prime Minister tried to make some amends. He might get an extra 10 votes from the Greek residents of Lowe. I will quote shortly from his lunch time speech at the parliamentary luncheon in honour of President Karamanlis. One of the effects of yesterday's speech was to reduce the Australian dollar to its lowest point for 23 months-almost two years. In fact the American dollar at the moment is picking up. It was probably the most valueless paper around for some considerable time. We are being forced into this situation by the activities of the Government. The Prime Minister, when speaking at the luncheon for the Greek President, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has . . . decided that in addition to giving you personally something which recognises your attachment to the game of golf, we will, as a mark of recognition of your visit to Australia, introduce an ongoing program of awards to allow young Australians to study or obtain practical experience in Greece. </PARA>
<PARA> Each year, awards will be granted to approximately eight young people-</PARA>
<PARA>He is not sure how many-</PARA>
<PARA>with a wide range of skills and interest. For example, the awards will allow young Greek Australians to gain further knowledge of Greek culture and society, and thereby foster the maintenance and development of Greek cultural heritage within Australia's multicultural society. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly awards may be given to migrant education teachers, ethnic community workers, student teachers, high school students or professionals working with Greek Australians, to allow them to study or work in Greece for a period of up to a year. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> We will be announcing details of the scheme shortly and I believe it will not only strengthen the links between Greece and Australia but also add a further strand to the advancement of multiculturalism in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Prime Minister's colleagues keep close scrutiny on his activities. He has no idea how the program will operate. There are no firm plans . The program will not be working by Christmas of this year. Unless there are continual reminders it will not happen. The awards situation is a bit like what happened when the Prime Minister was flying from the south to Darwin in 1975 as part of the infamous election campaign of that year. I am told on reliable authority that the Prime Minister said to one of his aides on the aeroplane: ' What will we give the so and sos in the Northern Territory?'. One of his aides said: 'Make them a new State'. He said: 'Good; that's it'. One of the Prime Minister's first announcements in Darwin-apart from what he said at a meeting he attended where he was not very well received-was to give the people of the Northern Territory a new territory with State-like powers. Apparently it gave him such a shock that he disappeared and went to his bed for two days while his wife carried on the campaign. Some people in the Northern Territory are still shocked by the results of what happened, particularly because they found out that they had to do most of the paying for the new State. </PARA>
<PARA> A report came into the chamber yesterday on the sale of the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. The recommendation was made on the casting vote of the Chairman. It was apparently a deliberate attempt to reduce the Liberal Party vote in the Victorian election. Honourable senators will be aware from the debate that took place in the chamber and the debates which will follow that the representative of my party and the representative of the Australian Democrats put in minority reports. There were two Western Australian members of the Liberal Party who, with the aid of the casting vote of one, the Chairman, were able to put the Ordnance Factory up for sale. The fact that a lot of workers will be displaced does not really matter I suppose! I was interested to hear the federal member who represents that area whistling like a small boy in the dark on a radio program still backing the Government. He is a very brave man. His seat will go too. </PARA>
<PARA> I had cause recently to look at the internal workings of a government department. The matter I refer to is connected with the infamous activities of the razor gang. The amalgamation of colleges of advanced education and universities has cost this country probably hundreds of thousands of dollars in the short term and undoubtedly it will cost more in the long term. Because the razor gang said the amalgamations had to be done they went ahead. It did not matter what the academics, the students or the councils thought; the amalgamations went ahead. The government department to which I refer-I will be giving it a very good airing in this chamber before the session finishes-is another area where the razor gang nominees were able to say to the departmental head that one section of the department would go. They had not looked at the establishment. They had not looked at the ramifications of the decision. They had not looked at the very skilled way in which that section was being run. They made the decision before they looked at anything. That decision is being implemented at a cost to the taxpayers of this country of many thousands of dollars. The section of the department is in the process of being abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> I received a phone call the other day to say that we would lose the television studios at Townsville and Rockhampton. I could not believe it. The Liberal Party complained about the centralism of the Australian Labor Party Government while it was in office. The centralism now being practised under the guise of so- called federalism is much worse than anything we ever dreamed of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I will reply to the point of order in spite of the fact that you have ruled that way. I am endeavouring to build up my case by showing that this Government is careless with money in many areas and acts like a skinflint in other areas. Members of the Government are acting like skinflints and sitting down and crying because they will not pick up a few million dollars in sales tax from that section of the community which can least afford it. Part of this action is caused by the corruption of the Government to which I have referred in this chamber before. After the announcement of the sales tax in the Budget many people in the retail section selling school books, clothes and other things that come under the ambit of the nine amending Bills immediately applied the sales tax. Some of them are still charging it. If the Government were as demanding in the avoidance of corruption within its own ranks and the knocking off of people's money as it is opposed to other things, particularly trade unions, it would have people from the Taxation Office policing this area to see that the sales tax is not charged. On 16 February when the Parliament reconvened some people in the community thought that the Bills would be passed that day. A shop in my region immediately put up a notice in its front window-it is a big business-saying that all stationery, et cetera, would go up as from that day. The shop added the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on the understanding that the Government would pass the Bills that day. As far as I know, it is still charging the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax and it will make a big rake-off. Let us see whether the Government cares. That is another part of the corruption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We saw another clear indication of corruption yesterday with regard to the laundering of money by the New South Wales Liberal Party. I understood that the Government and members of the Liberal Party were opposed to corruption. They will get their donations but, to avoid the provisions of the electoral funding Act which the people of New South Wales have approved, they will transport their money to Queensland and then bring it back as laundered money. There will be some very substantial donations in the $5m that the New South Wales Liberal Party plans to raise. Some of those donations will come from the illegal sale of marihuana and hard drugs. That has been happening in the past. To send the money interstate and bring it back is a way of laundering it which will enable the Liberal Party with its so-called opposition to drugs to keep its eyes closed for a long time. It will never get caught up. The Government is less than honest in trying to force this series of nine amending Bills on to the Australian people and hit at the people at the bottom of the income scale. It does not deserve to have the Bills carried. I hope that every honourable senator on this side of the chamber and a few defectors from the other side will, in the final vote, make sure that the Government does not get any of these amending Bills through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make what is probably an unusual contribution to this debate on sales tax. Firstly, I wish to criticise the Government. I then wish to criticise the Opposition and the Australian Democrats . I am not suggesting that I am the only person who is right, but I think legitimate criticisms can be made and are appropriate in relation to the whole of the debate. The Government has, I believe, failed to do adequately what it set out to do. The justification of the Government for the sales tax legislation was to effect a real redistribution between direct and indirect taxation in Australia. The imposition of a 2 1/2 per cent sales tax will not do that. In my belief it should not be done little by little. The Government should grasp the nettle and say: 'We will effectively redistribute the balance. To do that, we will propose the introduction of a sales tax or some other form of taxation of an amount which will enable a withdrawal of a specific amount of personal taxation'. I regard it as unfortunate that that has not happened. I believe the Opposition has failed to adhere to its supposed principles in relation to the Senate. I will develop that point a little further in due course.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly not easy. I accept Senator Mason's contribution. I have some sympathy with a number of the problems he has experienced. Unfortunately, we have seen a demonstration that such a principle is not easy to put into practice. Eventually-the Government has the same problem -political flexibility and personal advantage can outweigh the best of principles. I believe that today is a sad day in the life of the Parliament. I do not find any joy in making the comments I will now proceed to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point concerns the distinction between equity and efficiency in the taxation system and political expediency. Some years ago I was involved in campaigning for the establishment of a taxation inquiry which eventually led to what became known as the Asprey Committee. This Committee investigated taxation. Unfortunately, one of the things that I repeatedly talked about happened. The Committee approached the matter with a form of tunnel vision. It was circumscribed by its own expertise. It looked at the existing system and played with variations of it instead of looking at the basic principles of a taxation system-equity and efficiency. That is that this debate today and over the past few weeks ought to have been all about. It ought to have been about equity and efficiency. It ought to have been about the cost of the collection of taxation and the fairness or otherwise of the distribution of the load of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> I was impelled to refer to evidence that was given by Professor Johns and Mr Sheehan to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations in May 1973. I think the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) might well recall the evidence that was given, she being a member of the Committee at the time if I am not mistaken. On 1 May 1972 and 14 May 1973 those academics were endeavouring to make the point to the Committee looking at the matter of probate and the second and relatively minor aspect was social redistribution but that first aspect should be economic efficiency. Economic efficiency is far more important. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the matter of sales tax, I believe that it is ludicrous for us to consider sales tax at 2 1/2 per cent. A 2 1/2 per cent sales tax is equivalent to three months inflation, on the lowest possible base of inflation that we can anticipate for this year. We hear plaintive cries about how dreadful it is that the children of the less well off in the community will have to go bare foot to school. Will this happen for the sake of 50c? A sales tax of 2 1/2 per cent on a pair of school shoes amounts to 50c or less. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted by the contributions from both sides. I do not mind because I think the point is valid. It does not matter whether the amount is more or less, so long as the amount is only a little either way. The point is we are talking about the equivalent of three months inflation. Talking of three months inflation brings us to what is the real matter of concern to the people of Australia. Are we going to control inflation in this country? Are we going to get a fair distribution of the wealth of this country? Are we going to have an equitable and efficient tax system for whatever the needs of the country without carrying on with the nonsense and political vote getting which are so easy by pretending concern for somebody and by saying, 'We'll save you from the 50c a year extra for your kids' school shoes'? That is why I find it more than lamentable that we have had a debate on what is not the subject of debate . We have had a debate about platitudes. We have had a debate about a government's desire not to interfere, to do effectively what it ought to be doing. We have had a debate about how we can readjust principles to ensure some justification for doing what we promised we would never do. That is why I regard this debate as one of hollowness and shallowness and this day as very regrettable and sad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe the Labor Party Opposition and the Democrats have totally failed the test by putting their own expedient interests ahead of the national interest. The situation is that if we could control inflation more effectively than we have we would far exceed anything that might happen as a result of this minor tax measure. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate will no doubt remember that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) explained why we had had a relatively high figure for the consumer price index published for the last three month period- they were deliberate measures by the Government on a once only basis. Of course, we then have the flow-through effects of the increased sales tax. I would have thought that the same explanation could reasonably be given now. If the first was justifiable, so too is the second justifiable so long as everybody is told in advance what is to be done. What we have got is a situation in which a little has been done and there is a fear-broad spread in the community-that it will increase further. There is a fear that a 2 1/2 per cent sales tax really is not what it is all about but that the tax will increase to 5 per cent, 7 1/2 per cent or 10 per cent. That is my criticism first of all of the Government. I think it ought to have decided on a fair redistribution between the direct and indirect taxation levels and then applied that. In other words, the Government should have introduced the whole measure for what was required by way of sales tax if we could not have a value- added tax or any other from of taxation that was suggested and discussed over a period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having decided what was necessary to redress the imbalance, which I think most people in the country agree exists, we should then have directly reduced, by the same amount, the percentages of income tax. Had we done that I do not believe there could have been an objection from any responsible party in this country. I do not think there could have been an objection from any responsible citizen in this country. It is my regret that this is not what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I will move to some other matters in relation to sales tax. As I said earlier, I do not find this an enjoyable debate. I believe the sales tax should have been either significantly higher or not introduced at all. The real misfortune has been undebated. I refer to the rationalisation of many sales taxes which have been increased not by 2 1/2 per cent but by anything up to 25 per cent. I believe there has been no recognition in this debate of the extent to which the so-called rationalisation has, in fact, meant a huge restructuring of the tax system. What has been attacked by the Democrats and the Labor Party is not the real point at all. As I said earlier 2 1/2 per cent sales tax is equivalent to three months inflation. I really cannot believe that honourable senators are doing other than posturing in saying that they want to go to the barricades about a tax increase the equivalent of three months inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the nonsense talked has been in relation to public expenditure which would increase the cost to revenue by far more than 2 1/2 per cent. Repeatedly we have had suggestions by the Democrats and the Labor Party Opposition as to how we ought to spend the taxpayers' money far more fluidly and fluently than we do at the moment. In the name of concern for individuals in the community we have had the suggestion that almost every aspect of welfare expenditure should be higher. But an attack is then made by the Labor Party and the Democrats upon any of the measures whereby such increases could come about. I do not want to get into the debate about the Invincible. I do not want to get into the debate about some other aspects of Government expenditure because particular elements of those measures can always be debated in considerable detail. One fundamental fact-I hope that Senator Mason who will follow me in the debate will deal with it-is that we cannot spend money unless we get money. Any government has to raise the money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government did not budget for a domestic surplus but it budgeted for a much smaller deficit than we are going to have thanks to Ronald Reagan and Reaganomics. Perhaps I misunderstood the interjection but the fact is that the management of the Australian financial system has been thrown out of gear by two things. The first is the impact of the largest economy in the world- that is, the United States economy-and the way it is being managed and the second is the unjustified, unwarranted and unprincipled intervention of the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party, contrary totally to everything that they said that they would adhere to as to whether a government could govern this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the really important questions that we have to face are the balance of power between the two Houses-the balance of power in respect of whichever party happens to be the elected government of the day-and the responsibility of an upper House to be a House of review and not a government in exile. I well recall writing a review for the Australian newspaper at a time when I was an occasional writer for that newspaper on a book on Don Chipp and the Australian Democrats. I said at that time that the problem that the Australian Democrats, Don Chipp and whoever else came in would face was whether they would be members of a House of review or whether they would attempt to be a government in exile. I still believe that everything that they have done since they have been here has demonstrated the validity of the point that I was making -a minor party in an upper House cannot be a government in exile. What they are trying to do in relation to this legislation, for the sake probably of their own personal popularity in the electorate, is to be a government in exile. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but quite often it is also unlikely when one does not put a simplistic view and one tries to look a little beyond it. I thank Senator Robertson for his interjection. To continue, I find it somewhat regrettable that there are such dramatic examples of a total aboutface by members of a political party whose pressage, so far as their arrival on the scene as a force in the land is concerned, was that they were going to 'keep the bastards honest'. What they have done is fail to keep themselves honest. That I think is regrettable, not as a political point-scoring exercise, but as an aspect of government, of the parliament and of the political development of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a great deal of sympathy for the idea that Executives ought to be kept honest. I have already indicated that I have a great deal of criticism about some of the things that Executives do not do. But I wonder how we can learn, how we can feel that we have advanced democracy in Australia, and how we can feel that we have advanced the balance between a House of review and an arrogant Executive which is what most executives are by nature. I am not saying this in any way offensively to any honourable senator but the natural propensity of an Executive is to be arrogant and the natural function of a House of review in a checks and balances system is that it should endeavour to offset that arrogance. The net result has been that we find expediency and convenience lead to a situation where people, having had pressure applied to them, say: 'We made a mistake. We will review it because we want to make sure that we come back next time'. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that we have not adequately-I hope Senator Mason will do so adequately -addressed ourselves to the real question. The real question is: Who will pick up the tab? If we disallow any area of a government's taxation, I think, as part of our disallowance of it, we have to say by what means of efficiency, and by what means of increasing other areas of revenue or decreasing areas of expenditure we will offset what we have as a House of review intervened in, interfered with and redressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I had considerable personal problems in 1974 and 1975 in relation to what the Opposition of the day did in the Senate. But I thought eventually that there was justification for what was done in 1975. I simply refer to my speech in this chamber on 22 October 1975 and the contretemps which was then taking place. Having referred to my speech I will not quote from it. It is there expressing my views if anybody wishes to see whether I am now taking a different view from the one I took then. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder what the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party, who are hell bent on chucking out a small government taxation measure, will do about tax avoidance . Have we not a problem where a large percentage of the community is being kept one way and another by a relatively small percentage of the community? Have we not a major problem of obtaining efficiency in taxation collection? I suggest that one of the most efficient ways is by a sales tax. If the sales tax is small enough how do honourable senators find such incredible objection to it except that it is a means of gaining popular support to say: 'We do not want to see something which is infinitesimal in relation to real costs and the subsequent explosion of those costs being passed on'. </PARA>
<PARA> The cynical attitude which has been adopted by those who are opposing this measure is unfortunate. They will not spend their time to develop some real thoughts about the things that are really concerning us. Let me use as an example of the sort of concern that I have the superannuation problem of Trans Australia Airlines. Trans Australia Airlines has run up a bill of $180m in eight years. That company has capital and reserves of $31m and, in the whole of its 36 years of operation, it has never made a profit which amounts to $180m; it has never made a profit and paid tax which amounts to $180m; but it has a liability at the moment which the taxpayer will have to pick up of $180m. Is not that a matter of real concern when one projects that sort of loss cost or unfunded liability because of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme applying to the largest percentage of TAA's employees? Would not the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party be more honest to the future of Australia if they were to address themselves to the problem of what will happen if we continue to have an unfunded superannuation scheme which, at the moment, is probably unfunded to the degree of something in excess of $2 billion and is going up by dramatic amounts? For example, TAA's scheme went up by $40m last year. Would not we be better as a country and as a House of review if we paid a little more attention to letting the government of the day get on with the measures that it believes are necessary to enable it to raise the revenue for the expenditures which governments are always being called upon to provide-whichever government it might be-rather than trying for some petty purpose to disallow some pinpricking area of it without responsibility, without saying: 'What are we to do to cover it? What are we to do to ensure that there is adequate provision to provide for pensions, other aspects of welfare, government services generally, defence and all the other things?'</PARA>
<PARA> I find it disappointing that we appear to be reaching a stage in Australia where the cartoon in the Australian on Monday of this week was so true. The cartoon was a picture of a number of aged members of the community at a maternity hospital saying: 'How soon can the new born babe enter the workforce so that he can contribute towards our keep?'. I would have thought the problem of the aging, the problem of providing a balance between those in the community who are working and those who are not, the problem of providing for the real needs of the weaker-I do not mean that in a patronising sense-members of our society, the problem of ensuring that there is not a disincentive and the problem of ensuring that people pay their taxation contributions fairly are matters which ought to be the subject of debate in this chamber, rather than the question of how the Democrats can justify changing their view. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not quote again what Senator Mason said last year. I think he has heard it said enough times. But he was fairly positive last year and his party has found itself in the position of having to change its view. I simply ask: Can the Senator Evanses and the Senator Masons of this world come back to something which is a little closer to the real problems of Australia than the pettiness of debating something which amounts to once-only three months inflation and stop pretending that it will make a real difference to the way in which the country operates? I shall refer very briefly to what some people have said. Senator Evans, the shadow Attorney-General, in August last year said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I, in conjunction with many others, have since the events of 1974 and 1975 used fairly interchangeably the expression 'blocking of Supply', 'blocking of money Bills' and 'blocking of Budgets'. I acknowledge that. There are ample quotes that can be produced of my saying that, as a matter of principle, it is inappropriate for the Senate not only to block Supply but also to block money Bills or Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the incredible things that has happened in this country is that since 1975 all the Democrats have sworn allegiance to the principle that they will not block Supply, but they have not defined it. The Labor Party has complained bitterly about what blocking of Supply meant to the government of the day in 1975 but prior to that there had been in excess of 5,000 individual votes by Labor Party senators to block Supply in its broadest sense. I wish to conclude this debate by saying that I think the quotation from Senator Evans that I have just given and the much quoted quotations from Senator Mason all amount to a degree of unfortunate humbug which has misdirected the real debate which ought to have taken place. We should have been debating where we are going in this country; the real problems of an ageing society; the problems of an imbalance in the taxation system a system which does not provide equity to the taxpayers, which does not provide adequately for the needy in the community, which permits massive tax avoidance as a practice to take place in the community and which could be regarded by any person only as being distorted and in need of review. Rather than having that review take place we have had a shallow, superficial vote-catching debate about what amounts to three months inflation. I regret that the Government, if it wanted to redress the imbalance between direct and indirect taxation, did not actively go ahead to introduce sufficient sales tax to enable that redress to take place. I think it is regrettable that it did not pass it on directly to the taxpayer by way of reduction in personal income tax, but I regard as far more regrettable the vote-buying public stances which have been taken by others, avoiding the real questions and show-ponying the situation . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Rae shed a good volume of crocodile tears in his speech. I am sure that he will forgive me if I say that my heart is not truly rent by them. It is as if he were saying that changes of mind have never happened or are inconceivable in his own party. Of course, changes of mind may well be necessary as circumstances change in a fast changing world and, indeed, if all parties to an agreement-which politics is or should be -do not carry out what they said they would do. That, of course, was exactly the case with the change in the Australian Democrats' policy on these iniquitous, unjust and dangerous Bills which proposed to impose taxes on the basic necessities of life for everybody-clothing, footwear and shelter. Since I will be the last Democrat speaker in this debate I make it plain at this stage that the Democrats' policy approves of sales tax on luxuries and goods of that type. When the Bills were brought forward for the greater mass of sales tax we voted for them. Indeed, we resisted the blandishments of the members of the Australian Labor Party, who wanted us to vote against the total sales tax package. Let it be quite clear that our argument concerns the sales tax on necessities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish at this stage to deal with the statutory declarations which were signed by the Democrat senators during their campaign before the last Federal election and which have been mentioned from time to time during this debate. In no way would a Democrat vote against the sales tax on necessities offend or go against those statutory declarations. The statutory declarations pledge the Democrat senators not to vote against Supply. Point number one is that we are not debating a Supply Bill. The declarations also pledge the Democrat senators not to vote against taxing measures in such a way as would make it impossible for the Government to govern. These taxes on necessities represent well under one per cent-I repeat, well under one per cent-of total Budget revenue. I suggest that anyone who says that our voting against the Bills would make it impossible for the Government to govern is either a fool or a rogue or both. Let us lay that assertion to rest for ever. </PARA>
<PARA> I indict the Government for the repetitive way in which it has carried out this debate. There has been a considerable attempt at political point scoring rather than getting the business of the Senate completed. On my rough figures it costs some $14,000 an hour of taxpayers' money to run the Senate. I think that should be an argument of great weight in favour of our getting on with our business expeditiously. So far in this session we have completed virtually nothing at the cost I have just mentioned. Looking back over the lengthy debate that has taken place so far, I think Government members have been making very heavy weather of it, trying to show that black is white and that wrong is right. We have had in the debate such gems as Senator Messner trying to say that sales taxes on necessities are not sales taxes on necessities, and getting into trouble for appearing to say that children should not wear shoes to school. Indeed, Senator Messner has implied quite clearly that it is not necessary to wear clothes. Clothing, I would have thought, is definitely a necessity. I think there has been a great degree of double talk and double think in this debate, which is to be greatly deplored. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis attempted a similar line with even more disastrous consequences, which I will not recall to mind at this stage. Senator Missen made unctuous noises about how bad it was in principle for the Senate to vote against money Bills, conveniently forgetting his own vote in 1975, recorded in Hansard, against Appropriation Bill (No. 1)-the major supply Bill. Senator Watson seemed to see the whole issue as an anti-Fraser one which is, of course, complete nonsense. I prophesy that most Government senators and members are very pleased indeed that these sales taxes will not go ahead. I can imagine them when they are back in their electorates talking with constituents or with the Party faithful who may say: 'Now look, what is going on? Why are you pushing these sales taxes on necessities? The taxes are new, they are unfair, they produce peanuts in terms of money, they are costly to collect and we are getting massive electoral flak over them'. As all members of this place and the other place know full well, those things are all true. I presume that the Government member or senator would then cast an uneasy eye over his or her shoulder, move in closer and say: 'Well, privately, I know that you are right about that, but we had to go along with it'. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all here as members of Parliament and are pledged to do the best we can for the people who put us here. As Senator Chipp has said, we made an error in judgment in assuming that Government members would do the decent thing-would listen to the massive pressure from their electorates and would insist that the Government give income tax cuts. Senator Peter Rae mentioned that matter only a few minutes ago. We like to give people the benefit of the doubt. We like to feel that this will be a reasonable place in which to work and in which things will get done, but we are learning very fast. We know that members of the Government are prepared, presumably, to vote against their consciences and what they know the public wants. That is demonstrably the case here and that, I suggest, has changed the ground rules a great deal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with that matter in a moment. In this debate we have heard a remarkable amount of breast beating and tub-thumping from the Government about how wicked the Australian Democrats are even to contemplate denying the Government the right to rip off not only the poor but also the greatest proportion of Australian families with this ingenious new flat tax, which of course it is, on the necessities of life. While we are back on this subject of changing minds or breaking undertakings I will stress again: What about the assurances from the Government last year that the new sales taxes were intended to broaden the tax base and that they would be compensated for by income tax cuts? I can see that now only as rather like the assurance of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) during the 1980 Federal election campaign in Launceston that all future amounts derived from the crude oil levy would be passed back to the Australian people in the form of tax cuts or increased family allowances. We applauded that proposal when we heard it in the first place because we thought it was a marvellous and fair idea and because we thought in the past that to do otherwise was wrong. Here again the Government regarded the crude oil levy merely as a flat tax on everybody and did not use it for proper purposes such as reasonable research into energy replacement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Harradine, other Democrat senators and I have raised that matter several times over the last year or so, so there is no shortage of examples of the Government changing its mind and breaking its promises. I mention those two examples because they have a very direct link with these sales tax Bills. They have of course been an influence, and a significant influence, on the Democrats' decision to oppose the Bills. They certainly profoundly influenced my personal decision. Of course the key point is that the Bills need not be opposed at all; they could be passed here in the Senate today. All the Government has to do is to remove from the Bills the proposed taxes on building materials for new houses, on shoes and clothing and on the means of information and books, and we will pass the Bills with great pleasure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a flash; there would be no argument and no debate. We have always made that clear, but the Government is so pig-headed that while screaming out that it cannot do without the $300m a year revenue from these Bills it will not bend its pride to gain itself close to $100m a year-I think it is $95m a year-which would accrue if the Bills were passed without the necessities of life included in them. So we conclude that the argument is not really a sincere one at all and that the Government is not really interested in the revenue from the Bills. Certainly, Mr Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers' Association does not think that the money involved is very important. 'Mere petty cash' he called the proceeds of these Bills. So they are, amounting to well under one per cent of the total Budget revenue. I take Senator Peter Rae's point: Would the Democrats justify how the money could be saved? I will do that immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government does not need the money. If it really feels it does need the money it could consider not going ahead with the purchase of the proposed naval white elephant, the aircraft carrier Invincible, whose value to us and whose ability in warfare is quite unproven at this stage and for which the Government has not brought forward any argument at all, but these taxes on necessities would have to run for five years to pay for that ship when she has aircraft in her, and fairly inadequate aircraft too. So let us have an end to all this specious nonsense about these new sales tax Bills and saying that the Government will go broke over them. Of course it will not. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us now look at the Bills themselves and their consequences, which ought to be the sheer nub of this debate. The Bills propose to introduce a new and sinister element into the financial affairs of every Australian. If the Democrats did not believe that we would not be taking the action we are taking. We have thought most carefully about this matter and we dislike intensely, just as the community dislikes intensely, the new principle which the Government dreamed up from somewhere, which is simply to levy a flat tax on people for things they must have, regardless of their ability to pay. I repeat that because it is worth repeating: The new principle being introduced by the Government is simply to levy a flat tax on people-by a 'flat tax' I mean the same amount for everybody-for things they must have, regardless of their ability to pay. That includes the very poor or the people without jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Rae would not know what it is like for a family on the dole to have to stay alive. He thinks that 75c on a pair of shoes is nothing. I can take him to families to whom that is an almost insuperable obstacle if they have three children, in which case it will cost another $2 or $3 to get their children to school. They do not have that money. They are thinking in margins of cents now. Senator Peter Rae, like all of us here, does not have to think that way; we are rich in comparison, but those people do have those kinds of problems . I can assure him that if he goes around some of the schools in western Sydney he will find plenty of children going to school in thongs, and that is getting quite common. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest it is not a different problem. It is very much the nub and the basis of it because the tax is initially quite small, and seems quite small. I interjected because I thought Senator Peter Rae was being a little less honest and a little more forgetful than he usually is when he said it was only 2 1/2 per cent. It is 2 1/2 per cent on the wholesale price. The book people have said already that because of the enormous costs of collecting this tax it could be up to 10 per cent on some things. So it is a very different matter if it should be 10 per cent. The Democrats are worried enough about that. We might have thought it would be okay but, as eminent authorities in this country have stated, there is a real problem about this tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Peter Rae said, 2 1/2 per cent is hardly worth collecting. We found that a most sinister development, and of course it is a most sinister development. I think the Australian Taxpayers' Association said that this 2 1/2 per cent will barely, if at all, cover the costs of collecting the tax. What is the most logical deduction one can make from that? It is that the Government proposes to increase it year after year. Why would it have introduced it otherwise? This is the thin end of the wedge: The proposal is to tighten the screws year by year to provide extra money for the Government's pet projects, such as the elitist Casey military university here, the new and permanent Parliament House and other costly projects of little intrinsic value to the people. I think that is the key point. That is what really worried the Australian Democrats: Our conviction-we think it is a reasonable conviction-that this was not just one small tax but a new principle in Australian taxing, and an unfair one, which indeed the Government intended to raise over the years. Indeed , if that were the case it would mean that the new taxes would represent an arrogant and, I think, most impudent attempt to take even more money from those on low or little incomes and redistribute that money to the very rich. As Senator Rae said, people already defraud the tax system by a variety of legal, ingenious and immoral schemes. None of us want to see that happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a little concerned that the Government wrings its hands over these tax avoidance schemes, but in many cases at least it appears-I say 'appears'-that the door is shut only after the horse has bolted. That is something I think we have to look at carefully. Having benefited these rich people, or the rich people having benefited themselves, through tax loopholes to the tune of millions on millions of dollars, there is of course a need for money to replace it. The Government decided to compensate for that loss by imposing this new flat tax on the poor and battling families of this country. I say, on the logic I have presented, that the Government intended not only to introduce it but also to see that it went up year by year. We felt that we had to grasp the nettle. There is no way that we could say we would let it go this year and then allow the Government to raise it again next year. The nettle will have to be grasped now. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats, through exercising our delaying powers, made it possible for the Australian people and major interest groups to react to these new Bills, and they have done so in no uncertain fashion. A recent Gallup poll which was taken in all Federal electorates showed 89 per cent of Australians opposed these new Bills and only 7 per cent approved of them. This result has been confirmed by a tremendous surge of community interest which has come to the Democrats in particular since we have been, we might say, in the eye of the storm here. The Government has been told in no uncertain manner that people understand well enough the unusual, unfair and discriminatory nature of these proposed new taxes and see them as quite different from any present form of taxation. That seems to me to be the key point. Nobody likes taxes. Senator Peter Rae made that point, and I agree with him. All reasonable people, however, know that taxation is necessary, but it is how they are taxed that is important. It is the realisation that these Bills we are debating would cause increased hardship and poverty to all those but the very wealthy that has led, I think, to the public reaction. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all members of Parliament, elected to take some notice of the people who put us here. I appeal to those members of the Government who will presently, I assume, vote for these Bills. They are going willingly, knowingly and directly against the interests and wishes of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. That is a very serious matter. In doing so they have proposed some most ingeniously dishonest arguments. I cannot leave this debate without saying a few words about them. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that if the Government is prevented from increasing the cost of housing-that is, by not allowing sales tax to be imposed on building materials for a new house-by some mystery that will count against the interests of home buyers. It was no less a person than the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick, who with every appearance of integrity uttered that whopper. It is a whopper. It is quite ridiculous. It has also been said that because the Government cannot get $300m in sales tax-we have said we will give it $100m; it only comes down to $200m on the actual necessities-it will not be able to give it back in the form of income tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> I am quite sure that the people of Australia are not so stupid that they would much rather not have the tax collected with all the attendant costs of doing so than have the Government take it from them and say: 'We have taken $200m from you, but the Australian Democrats have let it go so here is $200m back'. How stupid and inane is that sort of logic? The fatuous assumption that the Government is entitled to take money with one hand and give it back with the other is something that ordinary Australians ought to take with a grain of salt. It would be worth a good laugh, but what is not a laughing matter is the Government's considered statement that it will take and not give back. That, of course, is at the heart of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The lion's share comes from the tax on clothing and shoes. I want to deal with that. Senator Peter Rae mentioned that people will be taxed only 75c or 50c on a pair of shoes. I think it might be rather more than that but, whatever it is, $ 104m in a full year will come from the tax on clothing and shoes. That $104m is literally being wrung from the purses of people who cannot afford it. A sum of $ 96m would come out of the tax on building materials for new houses. Heaven knows what that cost will be by the time people finish paying off their mortgages. Do honourable senators know what the final cost will be to people with interest and so on? They will pay four to five times that by the time they finish paying off their mortgages. That $500 on every new house will be several thousand dollars that people will have to pay back over the period of their mortgages. Of course they would feel that. The tax also is dishonest. In my view it is dishonest for the reason that, whoever introduced the sales tax, the sales tax ingredient of a price should be listed in that price. In other words, it is not good enough that people should rather uneasily watch retail prices go up and up without realising that a considerable part of it is the sales tax ingredient. I hope that with all commodities we will get to the stage where the sales tax is stated as an element of cost so that people will notice what they are paying and where. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply- This is the second time that the Senate has considered these Sales Tax Amendment Bills. I think it is fair to say that the issues have been extensively canvassed . If Senator Mason, who has just spoken, is right in saying that it costs $14, 000 per hour to run the sitting of the Senate, I wonder how those who have been listening to him for the past several minutes feel about the cost of the sort of speech that he has made and the complete misunderstanding of Government and the financing of Government responsibilities he appears to have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, let me comment on a number of technical questions on which comments were made by honourable senators during their contributions to the debate. It has been pointed out before, but it is worth saying again, that sales tax is a wholesale tax. It is a tax that is collected on a sale value which is, in the general run of cases, the amount for which the goods are sold at the last wholesale sale. The tax is charged by the wholesaler on the price which he charges his retail customers for the goods. The wholesaler accounts for the tax to the Taxation Office. As we have been talking about shoes, particularly children's shoes, perhaps by way of example I should say that a pair of shoes which is sold wholesale for $20 and retailed for $35 would, if these Bills become law, have a sales tax component of 50c in the retail price. When Senator Peter Rae and Senator Mason were speaking they concentrated on such issues. I think that the matter ought to be put into perspective. We had Senator Mason saying one minute that it is just a matter of peanuts and talking the next minute about the poverty of the whole of the Australian population. I think that the inconsistencies are rather remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been continued criticism of the Bills on the basis that they represent an indirect tax on foodstuffs through the proposals to tax certain wrapping materials. Senator Jones repeated this assertion in the first reading debate. That is not the case. I have previously given the Senate the example of a packet of breakfast cereal which is made up of a cardboard carton, a wax liner and the contents. Because of overriding exemptions in the sales tax law, such wax liners and cardboard cartons would remain exempt from tax as containers for exempt goods. I give that as just another example of some of the misunderstanding that has surrounded the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say something about the extensive campaign which has been directed against the proposal to tax books. There has been extensive debate and campaign on that issue. There have been hysterical advertisements along the lines: Where in the world is there a government that would tax knowledge? It has been asserted that this is the only government in the world that would do such a dreadful thing. In any proposal to broaden the tax bases, such as is contained in the present Bill, a wide base will be achieved and inequitable effects avoided only if the tax is imposed across the broad spectrum of goods commonly purchased. </PARA>
<PARA> A reasonable case can be made against the application of sales tax to books, as with its application to other categories of goods, when considered in isolation. It can be argued in each such case that the revenue resulting from the tax on that category of goods would be a relatively small amount. But the collection of tax, whether it be personal tax, sales tax or any other form of government impost, is made up of small amounts. It is made up of the aggregate of all the commodities in the areas in which that tax is applied. If one looks at a particular area one might say that it is peanuts, but if the Government were to forgo all the peanuts which it collects in taxes it would not have the revenue to pursue the very extensive role that Government is expected to play in this country. The inclusion of all such goods in any form of tax means that the Government can achieve a significant revenue base and apply a modest rate of tax at the same time. That is what has been attempted in these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back to the argument about the taxing of knowledge-the taxing of books. I remind those who have made an issue of this matter that most Western Euopean countries already impose a value added tax on books and many of the States in the United States of America impose sales taxes. To suggest that this is the first time that a tax on a book, a publication, a newspaper or anything of that sort is to be introduced in the free world is absolutely absurd. If the Democrat senators have convinced themselves on that issue they have--</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; At the time the sitting of the Senate was suspended we were discussing the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981 [ No. 2] (1982). In the few minutes that I had spoken I pointed out some of the matters raised by honourable senators during the debate that had to be clarified . I now say that Government senators have carefully documented in their speeches the inconsistency, hypocrisy and the broken pledges of the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats on this matter. There have been a lot of speeches and I do not intend to go through all of those matters again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor party and the Democrat senators have explained why all their previous statements on the role of the Senate and money Bills did not, in fact, mean what every intelligent voter assumed they meant. Senator Evans in particular has made a series of speeches which would provide a fascinating study to any students of politics or any of those who are interested in constitutional matters. Little did Government senators think that one day, after all of Senator Evans's years of raging on the Australian Broadcasting Commission system, the lecture circuit and elsewhere that we would have the same Senator Evans lecturing us on the necessity for the Senate to reject a money Bill. Honourable senators will recall how he referred to the Democrats as political Cliff Richardses. I suppose that if we are going to draw analogies we could look at the twists and turns in his own explanations to show how quickly he can turn from a self-styled legal authority into, perhaps, a constitutional Chubby Checker. Senator Evans's contribution to constitutional reform can perhaps be viewed in that light in the future because if things do not mean what he said they mean, then I wonder how people can evaluate what is said in the course of debate on constitutional reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrat and ALP senators have argued on the one hand that the effects of these Bills are so catastrophic that they would justify the use of the Senate to reject a money Bill. When one listened to the speeches it was obvious that that argument could not be sustained as a reason for rejecting a money Bill. So we have the Democrats proposing to amend the Bills, suggesting that if we take out this and that, then they will pass them. That, of course, is something that it is not within their constitutional power to do as senators. I think we ought to remind them that if they are going to reject the Bills, then they can do so but it is the Government that draws up the Bills. If the Democrats do not choose to pass the Bills, let them reject the Bills, as they obviously intend to do. Senator Evans was reduced to phrases like 'small but undoubtedly cumulative effect', 'significant marginal effect' and so on. Phrases such as these make one wonder how sincerely he holds a principle. If a principle can be compromised for significant marginal impact we wonder what the real principle that is supposed to be upheld really means. </PARA>
<PARA> I think at the same time it was said that the Budget effects were unimportant. No one should underestimate the consequences of the failure to pass these Bills. The passage of these Bills would have increased the revenue of the Australian Government by about $330m in a full year. That is not insignificant, whatever figures Senator Mason likes to put out. An amount of $330m in a full year of government revenue is a substantial amount of revenue. There can be no doubt that the action by the ALP and the Democrats who have planned a strategy attacks an important part of the Budget that was presented. It makes it more difficult to lighten the personal tax load. I do not think that anyone here would argue that there is not widespread community support for reducing personal income tax. The action of Opposition senators must inevitably increase the pressure to reduce government services or make it less possible to reduce personal income tax. I think State governments would have little to thank Opposition senators for in this case because by rejecting these tax Bills, State revenues will be reduced by some $27m next year. On a full year basis the total cost to the States will be around $70m. Bearing in mind the claims of the States on the public purse no one would argue that $70m is insignificant as far as the States' revenues are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats themselves have recognised that the refusal to pass money Bills introduces considerable new uncertainties into the governmen of this country. A number of speakers have talked on this subject; some of them have made specific statements. Senator Mason has been, perhaps, the most eloquent on this matter. He stated a number of things last August. I do not intend to go through all of them because a number of honourable senators have drawn attention to them. But last August he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the consequences of the Senate meddling in or unilaterally rewriting a Budget seem to us too horrifying to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mason asked a rhetorical question in that Budget debate speech:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Can we mess around with the Budget a little and if so, how much?</PARA>
<PARA>He then stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, to reject Bills which would cost the Government a billion dollars would be going too far. . . It really comes back to a matter of degree, does it not? Clearly the Senate has the right to alter the Budget a little. It has an equal right to alter it a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where the logic of that assertion led. Senator Mason said on national radio the next day, I think, that the Democrats would not attempt to block the sales tax Bills in February. We will just wait to see when we take the vote. </PARA>

The electoral backlash which was not important last September when considering the value of principle is now used as a justification for a change of heart.

The Democrats and the ALP seem to be determined to frustrate and set back the course of personal income tax relief. Every attempt by this Government to bring about personal income tax relief has been fought by the ALP and the Democrats. I do not think anyone in the chamber needs reminding how reductions in Government expenditure have been ceaselessly attacked by the ALP and the Democrats. Indeed, Senator Button believes that one is able to build a career of pleading for lobby groups for increases in Government services. One way to run the work that one does in this place is to respond to every lobby group that comes to one. Another way is to have some sort of policy and to stick with it. If the public sector's share of community resources cannot be held back, there is no way in which total taxation, whatever form it might be in-whether it is what Senator Mason or what a government wants- can be reduced. For instance, the ALP's spending program-if we are talking about promises, there are plenty of them there-cannot be financed in any other way except by increased taxation-higher taxation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government has said repeatedly that a broadening of the indirect tax base would enhance the capacity to give personal tax relief at the appropriate time. That was one of the steps we were taking in the Budget of last year to put us in a position to pay our way with the Government programs that we have and to provide an opportunity to give personal tax relief. This matter was referred by Senator Peter Rae when he spoke earlier today. As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) pointed out, the ALP and the Democrats are pursuing a course of preserving a taxation system which places too heavy a burden on personal income tax. The Treasurer has stated in many of the things that he has said as part of his responsibility that people who call for personal tax relief have some responsibility to say where the money is to come from-by an expansion of the deficit or by reduction in expenditure or by some change in the taxation mix. That is the way we are going to have personal tax cuts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If changes in the taxation mix are to be rejected by the Opposition, that removes one of the ways in which the Government can give personal tax relief. We are left either with inflating the deficit, adding to the deficit, or with having to reduce Government expenditure. Certainly the reduction in Government expenditure is criticised by the Opposition at every opportunity, however irrelevant a program might have become. The Democrats and the Labor Party presumably are not calling for further spending cuts. However, by this action they are inhibiting the capacity of the Government to give personal taxation relief. Maybe throughout these long months of talking about sales tax amendments there is some irony that would be obvious to many observers. Yesterday the Opposition brought forward a matter of public importance attacking the Government for breaking promises. Yet it is all too easily said in the summarised quote from Senator Button, when he said: 'The issue is primarily one of credibility'. It is not the credibility of the Government which is at stake in these Budget Bills which are before the Senate. It is the credibility of the ALP-on the string of promises it has made, on the commitments that it makes and on the constitutional statements that it makes-and also the credibility of the Democrats, on the promises that were made by them. </PARA>
<PARA> These sales tax Bills are an integral part of the Budget of last August. They have had several months of political somersaults and obstructions in this place. They are before us again now. I think we ought to test them at the vote. I do not think the handling of them has done any credit to the Opposition in this Senate.

I said that Senator Evans had drawn my attention to the fact that part of what I quoted from a speech made by him-that is, Senator Evans-on 20 August 1981 in the Senate did not do justice to him in that I should have quoted further. Therefore, I drew attention to page 148 of Senate Hansard of 20 August 1981. As well as the part which I quoted, I go on to say that Senator Evans said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not making a long speech; I am simply explaining what is crucial. It is crucial to the explanation and it is crucial to the distinction that needs to be made and understood that whenever I or anyone else has used those kinds of expressions in all the debates that have taken place since 1974 and 1975 we have been using them in the context of the events of 1974 and 1975 when what was in issue was a particular category of Bills-namely, in 1974 the Supply Bills and in 1975 Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) which were on any view crucial to the continued survival, the continued existence of the Government of the day. That was the context in which that discussion has always taken place; that is the context in which I and others have used those expressions. The relevant issue then as now is whether or not the money Bills, the Budget Bills-whatever sort of Bills are in question-are relevant to the survival of a government. That is what has been in issue; that is the issue that remains a crucial one not only for this Parliament but also this nation to resolve as a matter of constitutional reform. </PARA>
<PARA>I think I have now quoted sufficient, and I adhere to what I said earlier. At Senator Evans's request and as a matter of fairness I quoted the total context. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I last spoke on this matter I completely dissociated myself from the report of the Select Committee on Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories that the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, should either be sold or closed. As honourable senators will be aware, the decision to sell or close the Bendigo Ordnance Factory was taken by the infamous razor gang, otherwise known as the Review of Commonwealth Functions, which reported on 30 April 1981. The Government then restated its philosophical belief that ' activities of a commercial kind were generally best performed in the private sector'. This, to put it bluntly, is a lousy argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Few reasonable people would not argue that some things are better done by private industry. The Government has completely failed to demonstrate that ordnance manufacture is necessarily one of them. If ordnance manufacture in Australia were a field of engineering which appealed to Australian entrepreneurs I suggest they would have entered it long ago. There were opportunities during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War for private companies to enter the field of ordnance manufacture. They did not, and they did not do so for very good reasons. They believed that it would not be profitable. Nothing that I have heard or read leads me to believe that Australian entrepreneurs have changed their opinion. The chance of private enterprise running the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, profitably without defence orders is absolutely zero. It is just not on . Without defence orders no one can operate the factory profitably. With them the Government can run it just as efficiently as private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may think that Government involvement in ordnance manufacture in Australia is unique. In fact, the reverse is the case. Of course there are private arms manufacturers around the world, but most of these have been in business for many years. Their knowledge is highly specialised and they export around the world. I refer to companies such as Bofors, Oerlikon and Vickers. These are well known. It must be recognised that in almost every country with an arms industry there is a close relationship between the manufacturer and the government if not outright government participation. This is only natural. Individuals do not, as a rule, buy 155 millimetre howitzers. Governments are generally the only customers and therefore there tends to be an incestuous relationship between governments and private contractors. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for government involvement is very clear. Arms manufacture is too important to be left to the vagaries of private enterprise. Nations have strategic interests, and the most important is survival. Many countries perceive that this interest is served by having a great degree of control over the weapons which arm their forces. In the lifetime of most honourable senators, Australia has been placed in a situation where supplies have been cut off from traditional manufacturers. If it had not been in the interests of our allies during the last world war Australia would have been left for dead. If private industry cannot or will not enter the ordnance business-I have made the point that private industry will not enter the ordnance business without firm contracts from the Government-the Government must. To do otherwise would be an abrogation of the Government's basic responsibility to the defence of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority report found that the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo possessed few industrial processes necessary to defence production and that most tasks performed at Bendigo could equally be undertaken at other government factories or by industry generally. This is demonstrably misleading. Firstly, the OFB has a number of industrial processes necessary to defence production. For example, officials of the Western Gear Corporation in the United States described the factory as having a greater capacity to manufacture gears for naval ships than the rest of Australian industry combined. A number of other technical processes undertaken at the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo are unique. Given time and capital, anything that is being done at Bendigo could be done elsewhere. This is not disputed. But why should taxpayers bear the burden of shifting what is already at Bendigo to Maribrynong, Sydney or elsewhere when Bendigo is performing satisfactorily?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are not talking about the taxpayers' burden at the moment?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indeed. Even more important than the cost of shifting the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo to some other location, for reasons that have not been established, is the fact that a factory cannot operate without skilled people. Factories are not just machinery. They are essentially made up of the technicians, skilled people and professional engineers who run them. Machinery without these skills is so much junk. If the skills that are presently and demonstrably at Bendigo were dispersed, for reasons that have not been established, I suggest it would be nothing short of a scandal. The factory has repeatedly demonstrated that it can match overseas production and quality. It has a very good industrial relations record. It has a staff as efficient as staff ceilings and low orders have allowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ordnance factory was described in the majority report as being unimportant and not vital to present defence requirements. If that be true now, surely it was equally true in the 1960s when Bendigo was subject to two government inquiries. No decision was made during the 1960s to sell the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. If it was not sold then it is surely a million times more important that it be maintained now when the dangers of a third world war have increased tremendously. The Government cannot guarantee or even reasonably predict that Australia will not be involved in a defence emergency within the next five years . I challenge the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) to state otherwise. The Ordnance Factory contains a number of facilities and skills which would be absolutely essential in war time and which could not be re-established in Australia in any reasonable time, certainly not in a period of under five years. If an emergency arose, Australia would be absolutely dependent on foreign governments for such essential things as shafting and gearing for ships and heavy guns for the army and for other vital equipment. The supply of many of these vital arms for our defence forces has proved very unreliable in peace time . I will illustrate that with a couple of specific examples. Only the fates can predict how less reliable these supply lines would be in an emergency or in war time when our allies were under great stress themselves. To rebuild the factory at Bendigo from scratch-there is evidence to support this-would cost about $200m and take, as I have said, at least five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the relocation argument. The majority report claims that the defence works at Bendigo could be relocated in a comparatively short time in other munitions factories. Yet the Committee received no evidence that Maribyrnong, the only other factory mentioned in this context, could, without any problems, accommodate the extra plant and machinery if it were transferred from Bendigo. Maribyrnong already has space problems, it has difficulty in recruiting and keeping trained staff and it is built on reclaimed land which probably would be insufficiently stable to house some of the heavy equipment from the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. In any case, the expense of moving certain equipment cannot be justified and was not justified according to the Department of Industry and Commerce. The majority report concluded that commercial work would have to pay its way or, alternatively, more defence orders would have to be placed with the factory. With the second contention I can only agree. More orders should be placed with the factory. But the nature of the commercial work undertaken precludes the first option. Considerable evidence was presented that the factory is a regional centre of engineering excellence. I believe that it is appropriate for a government factory to undertake research for the benefit of commercial companies along similar lines to that undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Few Australian companies can afford to do very much applied research and it is not unreasonable that this should be undertaken at government factories. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I turn to the social question. The Committee found that the Government had no social responsibility to maintain the factory in its present form. This may or may not be true but the Government undoubtedly has a social responsibility to plan the development of industry in the Bendigo region to absorb those people who would be displaced if the factory were closed. Local organisations and individuals who gave evidence to the Committee almost unanimously agreed that the closure of the factory would have a grave social effect on the area. It was suggested that unemployment could well rise by 50 per cent within a few months. The city and the surrounding area already have a very serious unemployment problem with up to 30 per cent of people unemployed in places such as Castlemaine. The area is amongst the worst in the country for unemployment. Without the prospects of stable employment at the factory, many more young people would undoubtedly drift to the city. The local housing market is already badly depressed and it will be savaged if hundreds more people are forced to leave the area. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority report concluded that commercial ideas and philosophies introduced in the factory would have a great potential to enhance Bendigo's future and Australian defence capabilities if private industry took over. Although in principle I agree with the idea that private entrepreneurs are often more imaginative and make better use of resources, this is not necessarily the case. The most important question is: What would be the future of the Ordnance Factory , Bendigo, if it were sold to private industry? The fact of the matter is that engineering shops all over Australia are underutilised at present. The Government's disastrous economic policies mean there is considerable overcapacity in general heavy engineering right through the country. This is unlikely to be changed in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> In this environment I can see no point why any large engineering company would want to buy the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. The unique equipment is too specialised to be profitable and the non-unique equipment already exists in more than adequate quantities around the country. The equipment that is an exception to this would, I submit, be much more likely to be stripped and sold to individuals once the factory was turned over to private enterprise. The vague assurances that such important and critical items of defence would not be disposed of were given by the Department of Industry and Commerce during evidence but that evidence was totally unconvincing and unsatisfactory. The only way to prevent asset stripping if the factory were sold to private enterprise would be for the Government to retain ownership of it and then to lease the equipment. This option was specifically ignored by my colleagues even though it is in fact widely practised in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the factory should retain certain defence contracts presently unique to its operations such as the 105 millimetre light gun project. The irony and the inconsistency of this contention surely has not escaped people who think about the matter and surely will not escape this Senate . On the one hand it is contended that the factory has no unique equipment and on the other hand the problems of maintaining a capacity to build 105 millimetre light guns is admitted. If I so vehemently oppose the sale or closure of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory what then, in the Democrats view, is the future for it? Undoubtedly the factory possesses a combination of equipment and skills which make it a vital asset to this country and unique to Australia. It is the only factory in Australia which without modification can manufacture and maintain heavy navy guns which are now required for the follow-on destroyer program. It should not be sold because of the risk of asset stripping and the dispersal of staff. Its sale would undoubtedly complicate such projects as the manufacture of the 105 millimetre guns. Above all, it should not be sold because, in fact, it is a resource of national importance. I therefore recommend that the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, should remain as a Government owned and operated concern. </PARA>
<PARA> It is evident that the organisation of the munitions supply division as part of the Department of Industry and Commerce has been a disaster. The division should be reorganised, preferably on similar lines to those of Royal Ordnance Factories in Britain. It should be removed from the control of the Department of Industry and Commerce and given the status of a publicly owned corporation operating as far as possible on commercial lines but in close liaison with the Defence Department. It is also abundantly evident that insufficient work has been done to promote the sale of Australian arms and military equipment overseas. A defence sales organisation has not been set up for the purpose but undoubtedly there is a lot of scope for such an organisation to promote the sale of Australian produced arms in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, it must be recommended that the procurement procedures of the Department of Defence be streamlined. Evidence showed that the time allowed for contractors to manufacture goods and equipment for defence was frequently less than 25 per cent of the period of the whole procurement program. For long lead times such as Bendigo requires for the manufacture of important naval ordnance, that sort of time scale is just not good enough. It seems foolish for Australia to get out of manufacture simply because the defence bureaucracy cannot set its house in order. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party, Senator Button circulated an amendment. Paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) contain amendments previously circulated by me on behalf of the Democrats. We support the amendments of the Opposition. I will speak briefly to four of the clauses in the amendment. In relation to clause (b) the amendment states:</PARA>

<PARA> (b) its failure to provide modern guns and missiles for the ships of the Royal Australian Navy;</PARA>
<PARA>Only one of the ships of the Royal Australian Navy has a modern short range missile or gun capable of engaging a surface skimming surface-to-surface missile . The Bendigo Ordnance Factory could build such a gun. </PARA>

The factory has quoted competitively, with satisfactory delivery times compared with overseas suppliers of this sort of weapon. This is an important point. These surface skimming missiles are now the predominant weapon in naval warfare. Their impact has been as great as the development of the long range naval gun or the self- propelled torpedo was at the turn of this century. The Soviet Navy has practised their use and deployment for 20 years. The Western navies are only beginning to come to grips with their intricacies. The Soviets have created a large and complex communications system to co-ordinate the use of anti-ship missiles fired from aircraft, surface ships or submarines. It is very likely that in the first few minutes of the next war the Soviets will attempt a high seas Pearl Harbour. The 5 inch guns of the Perth class guided missile destroyers and the 4.5 inch guns of the River class escorts were designed well before this threat in naval warfare materialised. The efficiency of the fire-control systems for these guns against small targets on the horizon line is open to very grave doubt. Also it is understood that our ships do not have shells with modern proximity fuses which can be fired at ultra low level targets. Thus for the time being our ships -the front line of our Navy-do not have modern guns capable of defending themselves against surface skimming missiles. The one manufacturing capability we have in this country to produce such guns has been recommended by the Government to be sold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Will the new frigates-the River class escorts-be equipped with Harpoon missiles from the date of commissioning? The Minister for Defence has declined to answer a question on notice which sought to find out how many Harpoon missiles the Australian defence forces currently have. The position was made clear by Rear Admiral Sir Anthony Synnot, Chief of Defence Force Staff, when he told a Press Conference last year that Harpoons were not being procured for specific platforms but were being pooled and issued for training purposes as demanded. An examination of the Budget Papers would lead one to the conclusion that we probably have not purchased more than about 30 Harpoon missiles. The Chilean and Royal navies have converted ships which are similar to our own River class to carry surface to surface missiles; we have no such plans in Australia. The River class frigates perhaps should be renamed the 'sitting duck' class. Recently, we purchased a new aircraft carrier. We purchased this aircraft carrier without any aircraft. This can only be described as analogous to purshasing a battleship without guns. It is a fact that that ship, without its short take-off and landing aircraft, will be virtually useless in an all-out war situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by stressing the fact that, as set out in the amendments, there are serious and grave problems associated with our armed forces and particularly our naval defence. A problem has already become apparent in our attempt to buy important arms equipment overseas. I could instance the problem that we have already experienced with 155 millimetre howitzer. That equipment was purchased from the United States of America. The order was given to that country when the equipment was capable of being produced competitively by the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. That order was placed in the United States essentially because the delivery time was somewhat better than that quoted by the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. After the order was placed, great pressure was placed on the manufacturing capability of the United States in an attempt to build up its defence equipment. It gives me no pleasure to tell the Senate that right now the delivery time that was quoted by the Ordnance Factory towards the end of this year will now be exceeded by a delivery time from the United States at least three years hence. In other words, it will be another three years before we can get heavy artillery for the Army from our closest ally as there is already a strain on its defence manufacturing capabilities and a need to build up its requirements quickly. If this sort of problem can arise now before there is any immediate world emergency or threat of a war, how much greater will the problem be when such a situation arises?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in support of the motion that the Senate take note of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories on its inquiring into the future of the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. Senator Siddons has raised a number of issues which one feels spontaneously inclined to challenge. But I think it is probably appropriate that I refer myself to the remarks that I intended to make and, inasmuch as the debate will be continued, perhaps deal with those issues at that later stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps I should refer to those matters which were before the Committee at the time when it contemplated the various aspects of its terms of reference. All the members of the Committee directed their attention towards three main areas of concern: Australia's defence procurement needs as they affected the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, the economic considerations as they affected the factory, and the social and economic effects our determinations may have had on the Bendigo region. Primarily, in my view at least-I think it was a consensus of the Committee-there were three headings at which we could look: The first was the sale of the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, as a going concern; secondly, the retention of the factory in the hands of the Government; and, thirdly, ultimately its eventual closure. Naturally, inasmuch as the factory undertakes not only defence work but also commercial work, there are a number of variations to these options. However, these were the broad headings under which we chose to work. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that there were many substantial matters upon which the Committee unanimously agreed, not the least being that the factory could not continue to proceed as it presently stands and operates under the existing arrangements. There was one real conflict between the four members of the Committee. I am pleased to be able to say at this point that there was harmony, good will and a co-operative sense of determination in arriving at our final determinations. Regrettably, towards the very end of the inquiry, two members of the Committee took off at tangents-at least in my view-and found themselves subject to variations other than the substantial facts before them. But perhaps what was in conflict was the interpretation of the facts that were presented to the Committee in evidence. I think it is also true to say that there was no lack of good will in seeking to find common ground, not only on the substantial evidence that was before us in terms of the general course that the Committee should take, but also to ensure that consideration should be given to all matters and accommodated in a proper and reasonable way. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn first to defence. The major issues really are whether the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, plays an integral and vital part in the defence procurement process within Australia or, perhaps as Senator Siddons has said, whether it should in the future. In other words, is it excess to need or does it have a unique capacity that is vital to Australia's future needs? Will that unique capacity be reduced or lost by the factory being sold to private enterprise or finally and ultimately, if necessary, closed down and its rare and unique capacity being transferred to other government ordinance factories such as the Ordnance Factory, Maribyrnong? As the conclusions contained in the Committee's report demonstrate, it was my view and the view of the Chairman, Senator Martyr, that the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, is not an integral and vital part of Australia's defence procurement process and that that so modest part of the factory which would appear for the moment to be undertaking unique work in Australia can be readily relocated in other Australian ordnance factories or duplicated at the very least within the private enterprise sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, it ought to be clearly understood that only two activities that that factory presently undertakes would be in some respects difficult to transfer. The first, of course, relates to the 4.5 inch naval gun mountings and the second is the turning of ships' propeller shafts. In the case of the 4.5 inch naval gun mountings the difficulty in transferring the activity lies in the building space , the height, the lifting requirements for the mountings and other considerations which are not readily available elsewhere for the time being. However, as evidence before the Committee has clearly demonstrated, these guns are fitted to destroyers which will end their lives in the late 1980s or the early 1990s. The only real difficulty in respect of the lathe which turns the propeller shafts is the cost of relocation. It cost $1.7m to introduce and bed down and it has been installed in the factory only recently. However, it perhaps ought to be recalled that the moment the factory appeared to be up for sale, following the announcement by the Government, there were inquiries from the private sector as to whether that piece of equipment was to be included in the terms of reference of the sales. All other present activities could be transferred into the private sector or to other Government ordnance factories. In my view to that extent Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, is not vital or unique to the defence needs of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued in evidence that the factory has the capacity to manufacture a number of items that are currently being purchased or ordered from overseas for our defence forces. I do not question that there are certain components of such defence orders that the factory could and is competent to manufacture. However, I question two matters: Firstly, whether those components can be produced and procured at a competitive price and, secondly, whether they can be manufactured within a reasonable time frame as set down by the defence forces. I should perhaps be on record as saying that I am not so patriotic as to say that I concur with the proposition that we have out on the field a gun of some sort which is antiquated and highly expensive but which has upon it as its only claim to fame a stamp which simply reads: 'Made in Bendigo'. Of course, having built the machine in Australia, we cannot afford to manufacture the ammunition that is required to make it an effective component for our defence forces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can do it in Australia eventually. We can do anything in Australia eventually, all being equal and with the will of God. Taking the second issue first, on a number of occasions the factory has found that even if it has been able to compete with overseas suppliers at the right price it has not been able to provide the equipment in the time required. In defence of the factory and as an excuse for the factory operating at less than 50 per cent, and only 39 per cent of that 50 per cent being on defence work, the Professional Engineers and Officers Association claims that the actual manufacturing process constitutes only between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the defence procurement process. It has sought to validate its claim by producing a picture plan of the steps which are involved from the identification by the defence forces of the need for a new ordnance to the completion of delivery to the service of the first of these pieces of equipment. A typical piece of equipment is illustrated in the Association's document, which is incorporated in our report, but no time scale is given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the time frame and the evidence would certainly seem to make a valid point about the complexity and the length of the decision-making process, about which I make no comment, it is certainly misleading and decidedly inaccurate to suggest that only 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the procurement time is spent on manufacture. Perhaps the most contemporary, reasonable and proper example that I can give is the recent decision to manufacture in Australia the new 105 millimetre howitzer gun which was initiated in about 1972. Selection of the weapon was announced recently and the Australian prototype manufacturing phase is expected to lead to an announced decision to approve the first production phase in 1984. The production which ensues could provide the Ordnance Factory, Maribyrnong, and a commercially owned ordnance factory at Bendigo with 1.85 million man hours of work load over the period to 1996. Thus from the point of view of initiation of early inquiries production time would, in the example I have examined, represent about 50 per cent of the total and 80 per cent if taken from the point of selection of the weapon. I think it goes to demonstrate that some of the evidence which was provided to the Committee was far from accurate and precise. </PARA>
<PARA> Successive governments have been seeking to divide defence purchases between local manufacturers and overseas purchasers, taking into consideration such factors as retaining defence skills and capabilities in Australia, the cost, equipment numbers, repeat orders, patents, future requirements and Australia's ability to supply the item. Given the obvious limits of the defence budget and the requirements of Australia's defence forces, these are all matters which should properly be considered. Much has been made of the fact that Australia is to purchase the 155 millimetre howitzer gun overseas rather than have it made in Australia. Dismissing any other considerations to which I have just referred, I quote Mr Roberts, the Bendigo factory manager, in response to a question from Senator Siddons. Senator Siddons asked:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to this contentious question of the availability of work which should or should not be done at Bendigo. I have asked a specific question on this, but perhaps you could answer in general terms at this stage. Let us take, for example, the 155 millimetre Howitzer. Would the manufacture of one of these Howitzers put very many man hours into the factory?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Roberts replied:</PARA>
<PARA> One Howitzer is not very much. The tooling up would be the extensive part of the work. The actual work on the Howitzer would probably be only one-thirtieth or perhaps a fiftieth of the amount of work to tool up to make one Howitzer. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Siddons asked:</PARA>
<PARA> The tooling up is the problem?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Roberts answered:</PARA>
<PARA> The tooling up is the costly part of the exercise. The tooling up costs can be multiplied, say between 30 and 40 times each one. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same item, Senator Button asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA> Was it your view that the Ordnance Factory could produce it at roughly equivalent costs to any competitors?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Roberts said:</PARA>
<PARA> No, I am afraid I could not claim that because we would be tooling up for a very small quantity, therefore our capital costs and the tooling up costs would have to be borne in by a small number. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, there are only 36 of these guns to be made. Here lies the problem. It has been suggested time and time again that we should be making these 155 millimetre Howitzer guns within Australia. Without taking up too much time tonight, I say that there have been suggestions that the acquisition of those guns has been delayed for all sorts of other reasons in the United States of America because of previous demands on United States production for that country 's own program. The fact of the matter is that the acquisition of that gun has been delayed by only six months and it has been delayed only because of the problems of manufacture in that country. There is much criticism of the fact that the equipment was not built in Australia but to do so, particularly for a small quantity with no prospects of a repeat order, would have made the cost per unit absolutely prohibitive. Of course, we can fill the factory. We can fill it up to capacity as long as we like and as hard as we like; the only question is the amount of money we as a government are prepared to spend filling up an incompetent, incapable, inefficient, over-expensive factory. It makes an enormous dent in the defence budget as a whole. I believe that a balance has to be achieved between competing demands for the defence dollar. I quote Mr Wood, the Acting First Assistant Secretary to the Department of Industry and Commerce. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a continuing pressure in all fields of the Defence outlay. The Defence Science Organisation, the factory organisation, the Service equipment votes and the Service operating expenses all compete for whatever money is available. It all comes together in the five-year program process and is argued in committee before the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If you are to pay a penalty to make something of considerable proportions in Australia you will end up with less equipment as a total being purchased and less ability to make things. The new tactical fighter project, for example, will have a considerable penalty for doing work in Australia, but it is debated and the level of that penalty is a matter which will be decided by the Government in the end. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not only a question of the best utilisation of the defence dollar, but it is also a question of the total utilisation of the dollar within the total Budget. This is the question that we have to ask ourselves: Do we want the luxury of making equipment in Australia or do we want to contemplate aspects such as building more homes for those people who cannot afford homes-those in need? Of course the real problem is simply that Australia does not have a demand for enough volume equipment to justify building them over here to reduce the component and the unit costs. When countries such as America are able to build tens of thousands of the units and we require perhaps 20 or 30-odd, there is no way we can practically compete. I suspect that perhaps the Committee was unanimously of the view that Australia should have a capacity to make certain items in Australia and that certain skills should be maintained in this country. However, the point on which Senator Martyr and I differed from other members of the community was whether Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, was such a place for this capacity to reside, considering all other factors. We are of the view that if the capacity is to remain at Bendigo it ought to be properly in the hands of private enterprise, put on a commercial basis and integrated with other commercial work at the factory. The factory would then be capable of producing. Alternatively, of course, if the very worst comes to pass, the capacity of the factory ought to be transferred and integrated with other skills presently utilised at Ordnance Factory, Maribyrnong. That would make a very substantial saving in tax and would ensure no loss of skills for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument was put by the Professional Engineers and Officers Association that Ordnance Factory, Maribyrnong, should be rationalised to Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. However, dismissing all other considerations, the cost of that proposal is prohibitive and does not stand the test of any reasonable economic argument. The first report of the Special Advisor on the Future Development of the Australian Defence Production Factories presented in 1981 indicated that the estimated cost to transfer essential capacity from Bendigo to Maribyrnong was $1 .5m. The reverse was $60m. The Professional Engineers and Officers Association also claimed that the Maribyrnong factory was being phased out and that the forging aspect was obsolete. As I understand the situation, it is being refurbished and will continue well into the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other arguments against the rationalisation of Bendigo to Maribyrnong were put by the Factory Area Committee. It suggested that there were staffing difficulties and that there were some strategic weaknesses. In this time of high unemployment and given the mobility of the average member of the community, I find this aspect a remarkable revelation. In respect of the second matter I would have thought that Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, being a prime or secondary target in a time of conflict, would be a highly unlikely proposition. Numerous reports over the years have commented that it was not desirable that the factory continue as it presently does. For many years it has gone along far below capacity, and successive governments have done very little to correct it. What Senator Button said last night was ever so true; it is an indictment on all governments that absolutely nothing has been done about it. In fact in 1980-81 its total utilisation was less than 50 per cent of normal capacity which, by definition, is one shift at full shift capacity. Of that, only 36 per cent was related to defence work. We can say that for one full shift capacity at that factory only 18 per cent of that time was spent on defence work. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to honourable senators that with a factory which employs 650 people, with a replacement cost of capital equipment of approximately $200m, I find it very difficult to justify the maintenance of that factory as it remains at present. The balance of the work-50 per cent of it-was commercial work and the rest was done for other government departments. Certainly it is very hard to justify the commercial basis by any standards. As the majority report indicates, the type of commercial work being undertaken was of a one-off, complex, heavy engineering nature, and tendering was done on the basis, presumably, as I understand it, of being able to recover some part of the cost of the undertaking . As the report also indicates, the work tendered for was not particularly attractive to private enterprise. I refer honourable senators to the evidence provided to the Committee, and particularly to the evidence of Mr Roberts, the factory manager. The evidence states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Roberts-Generally speaking, that is the work that other people do not find attractive. From the engineering manager's point of view it is quite interesting , but from the economic point of view it is quite expensive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why is that? If you are trying to supplement defence work with commercial work, and you are having problems with your defence work, why compound the problem by going into another area which will be uneconomic?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Mr Roberts-And to improve our technology. It gives us a chance to up the art. Yes I think it is proving that this is one of the problems we are facing. It is expensive. </PARA>
<PARA>However, notwithstanding the fact that much of the work was not attractive to private enterprise, the tendering process guaranteed that factory a 9 per cent success rate. In view of the departmental evidence that the factory felt inhibited in tendering for commercial work, it is worth noting that notwithstanding the factory's perhaps unfair advantage it achieved 506,000 hours of tendered work over six years while seeking 5.5 million man hours of work. I put it to honourable senators that it is hardly inhibited in terms of its capacity to seek commercial work by tender. To me it shows gross incompetence in attracting work, notwithstanding that there may have been some sort of duplication. I make no judgment as to where the responsibility lies. Quite clearly the factory has demonstrated no skill, no confidence, no capacity and no ability to attract commercial work, even given the abnormal commercial advantage it has over those companies which have to make a profit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The honourable senator on my right would certainly not score at that rate. Evidence was given also by the Professional Engineers and Officers Association that the factory was not prepared to take on further commercial work because it did not want to be embarrassed in the event that it got other defence work. What I find remarkable is that it still tendered for 5.5 million hours. It has a record for the last six years of having approximately 36 per cent of 50 per cent of its capacity as a standard rate of its guaranteed defence work. There was no indication that it was likely to get more, yet it was so concerned and so embarrassed that it was terrified to tender for more than 5. 5 million hours. One has to question seriously whether that is a justifiable reason for it being so incompetent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall turn very quickly to the social aspects which are weighing upon some parts of the community. The sale of the factory to private enterprise should not necessarily be to the social or economic detriment of the Bendigo area in the event that a private operator is likely to be more efficient, more capable, more competent and likely to maintain present defence levels. There has been a guarantee by the Government, if honourable senators care to read the evidence- not a written guarantee but certainly a guarantee that anybody could read into the--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh is as relevant as he always is to every other argument he has ever been involved in. He is so obscure, so abstract and so divorced from reality that I find some difficulty in finding something to respond to. Perhaps the private operator could maintain the present defence level and certainly he could expand considerably the commercial side of things. It ought to be recognised that at present there is considerable expansion, in terms of real dollars, of the engineering sector of the community. I suspect that any manufacturer which takes over that factory will bring along its own orders and, together with that, will attract new business. In the event that the factory does not attract a new buyer and it is subsequently wound down, naturally there will be some social and economic indications for the Bendigo district.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say all the evidence we had was given on the basis that the factory was going to close down. The doom and gloom which pervaded that area when we sought evidence was, to say the least, depressing, even to an exuberant optimist like myself. Considerable evidence was given to the Committee of the various effects that closure would have. Naturally much of it was subjective by nature. Regrettably, some of it was both emotive and inaccurate. The following is an exchange between Senator Button and Mr Curnow from the Bendigo Trades Hall Council:</PARA>

<PARA>I do not know whether this man has three wives, one wife, is single, has eight kids, is an alcoholic, is frugal, or what he is. All I know is that he has worked out what everyone else spends on what he spends. The Australian Bureau of Statistics was asked to comment on a survey conducted by the incumbent of the State seat that presumably covers that area. He formed a study group of some sort. The group gave much evidence on the implications of the closure. It had nothing to do with what might happen if there was a sale. The methodology was examined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which had this to say about that group's survey:</PARA>
<PARA> The telephone poll had no sampling technique or description of how it was considered. I would regard the results as completely unreliable. The projection of the 50 per cent response rate on to the whole population is entirely fallacious. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on at great lengths to describe the real danger in taking any notice whatsoever of that survey. Regrettably, that was symptomatic of every part of the social evidence that we got. Frankly, the factory, employing 650 people and with an annual Budget of $9m, is an important part of the Bendigo economy. Nobody doubts that. Naturally there will be some downturn in the real economy and in real estate if the factory is closed. There will be some unemployment among those who are employed in industries which are indirectly affected by the factory. </PARA>
<PARA> As must be the case, the decision as to whether those retrenched workers stay within the community at Bendigo or move on to other areas is very much a matter for themselves. However, the Government is well placed to redeploy those people in other Government factories over the next period. Of course, we ought to understand that there is a demand within the total community for the sorts of skills that are available at Bendigo at present. Of the 650 employees, 175 are guaranteed jobs because they fall within the Public Service Act; 233 fall within trades associated with the metal industry; 132 are semi-skilled workers in the same capacity; and 102 are apprentices. I would be staggered if, in this day and age of mobility and demand, those people could not get jobs, providing they are prepared to go and look for a job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The moment the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee came down with its recommendation for the sale of the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, it sounded the death knell for that factory. We are not talking about a judicial murder; we are talking about an ideological thrill kill on the part of the Government. It never really intended to sell the factory . This is just a ploy to close it down. That comes through in the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Government's Clothing and Ordnance Factories and in the attitude of the Lynch Committee, which brought down the decision. I do not think the original Lynch decision was based on very much thought. I do not think it gave very much thought to the matter. It looked around and said: 'Where can we give a palliative to certain ideological Liberals in the party? This is where it occurred. It is true that the majority report of the Committee has quite clearly gone through evidence and developed some arguments in favour of sale to private enterprise or closing it down. I do not think the Lynch decision ever considered any of those factors. The decision to close or sell the factories in Bendigo and Coburg was an ideological one, one that was meant to run brownie points in the party room.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One has only to look at the composition of the Committee to understand what it was about. I would have thought that the Government, reluctant though it was to set up the Committee, would appoint a couple of Victorians to it because it concerned their electorate, their base. Apparently none of the brilliant legal minds in the Liberal Party that represent Victoria could serve. Instead, we had a situation in which it said: 'Who lives the furthest from Bendigo?' The answer is Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator John Martyr. I have some sympathy for those honourable senators because they have had to carry the can for the Government. They have done it diligently. If they have done it with loyalty it is not a particular virtue for which I would criticise them. It is a particular quality in life that one does admire loyalty and they have been particularly loyal to the Government. I do believe, however, that in spite of the sincerity of their approach they had ideological blinkers on. Over the years Senator Martyr has probably had many ideological blinkers on from time to time. However, as I said before, there is no doubting his loyalty to the Government. I am not casting any aspersions on the sincerity of his approach to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> At the inquiry-I was only there briefly; I admit that-and in this place Senator Crichton-Browne has shown himself to be the greatest gung ho capitalist I have ever seen. It is a pity that the calls of government have deprived the Bendigo Ordnance Factory of a natural manager who could have gone in there with enthusiasm and dynamism and restored the profits of that factory within a few months. That is very disappointing. If the electorate rejects him in five years and the factory is still there he would be most welcome. There would, of course, be a great smell of tar and feathers awaiting him. </PARA>
<PARA> The more interesting aspect to me as a Victorian senator has been the reaction of the Liberal Party in Victoria and the local Liberal members. Over the years they have all espoused a belief in private enterprise. They all go around warning the electorate of the threat of socialism and how bad government enterprises are. However, the moment their government does something about it they all bow out in typical loyal fashion. The Federal member for Bendigo, Mr Bourchier, went virtually on three months' holiday, going off to the United Nations, and let his electorate stew. Of course, he does not like the decision. If it had been made in any other Federal electorate, Mr Bourchier would applaud it. It is only because it has been made in his electorate that he gives lip- service in opposition to it. Only two conclusions can be drawn. Either he is insincere-one would hate to allege that about a member of parliament-or he is a pathetic local representative in terms of having some influence over government policy. They are the only conclusions I can draw about it. Mr Bourchier says he will make representations to Sir Phillip Lynch. Good luck to him. I hope he succeeds. But, given his past track record, I doubt it. Mr Bourchier issued a Press release today. It was stated in the Press release:</PARA>
<PARA> He made it clear that he supported the sale of the factory to private enterprise, which would run it more efficiently, but that if it could not be sold the Government should continue to operate it. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, Mr Bourchier disagrees with the decision of the Committee. Of course, he went on in typical Liberal fashion. The telex stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bourchier . . . complained that the trade union movement had sabotaged prospects for selling the factory by veiled threats of industrial action against any purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA>In a typical Liberal tactic, the Government is trying to take the heat off by attacking the trade union movement. I do not think it will get away with it. I do not think the people of Bendigo could be that gullible. </PARA>
<PARA> Local State members have been very active on this issue too. Mr Daryl McClure and Mr Bruce Reid were quoted in the Bendigo Advertiser on Monday. They were reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ''As far as we are concerned, there will be no closure of the Bendigo factory'' , they said. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the local Liberal members-note the two up for election. The Upper House member is not facing election; he will worry about a Press release in three years' time. Of course, in line with what Mr Bourchier said those State members are referred to later in the article. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The two politicians said it was ''now clear that the union leadership was using its own workmates in a political game in a State election.''</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure honourable senators that the people who work in the ordnance factory in Bendigo do not have time for any political game; what they are interested in is retaining their jobs. Those local members, in the public relations material that they have been putting out, have said that they oppose the sale of the factory. They claimed also in press releases months ago how they had put in great submissions in order to prevent this closure. What we really have to do, of course, is to compare their four flimsy paragraph, one-page submission with the detailed submission of every other goup in Bendigo, including the three or four different levels of workers at the factory. We can look at the Council's submission. All the submissions were detailed, rational submissions. What did the two local Liberal members do? They put in a one-page submission. I wonder just how fair dinkum they are. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of debate on why the Ordnance Factory should be retained and why it should not. I will not go into all the defence arguments; I think Senator Siddons covered those admirably. There is a case for Australia having a reserve defence capacity. We have been caught short before. No one can gaze into a crystal ball and say when the next world war or local military action will be. It is essential that Australia retains the capacity to develop its own defence equipment. It is essential also that we do not lose our technological base. The destruction of that factory would represent the loss of a great resource for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true, as has been mentioned, that the factory is doing commercial work. I heard Mr Roberts's evidence and I got an entirely different impression from that of Senator Crichton-Browne. He talked about a 9 per cent success rate. What he has not developed here tonight is any indication of what the normal success rate is in tendering for commercial work through private enterprise or anywhere else. I got an impression-it could have been incorrect-that that was quite a good batting average. </PARA>
<PARA> Liberal governments over the years-both Federal and State-have talked about decentralisation. What they usually mean is decentralising into the suburbs of Melbourne or Sydney or they talk about it but they rarely do it. The destruction of this factory would go completely against decentralisation. I commend Senator Crichton-Browne for spending three or four minutes on the social effects the closure of the factory would have on Bendigo. I think this is an important issue . The unemployment rate in Bendigo is 10 per cent. In the nearby surrounding town of Castlemaine, a fire recently burnt out the major employer in that town. It would be disastrous for Bendigo if this factory were to close down. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the point about why I do not believe the sale of the factory was ever feasible. At no stage in the evidence that I have read-I cannot deny that it is not there somewhere-was a proper investigation done as to whether there was a commercial buyer. I would have thought that the Committee should have done that. I know it is difficult. Is there a commercial buyer or is this just an excuse to close down the factory? On what basis would that commercial buyer buy the factory? Would it be just to asset strip? It is no use putting platitudes in the report that we should not sell the factory as an asset stripping exercise. Of course, someone who can see making a quick profit will do that. I do not believe that there is a commercial buyer for this factory. The only alternative left is to keep it as a government-run instrumentality. I do not believe it should be closed down. I believe the people of Bendigo have been short-changed by this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat my initial assertion: The original Lynch decision was baseless. it was done for ideological reasons. We often hear that the Liberal Party is a free- enterprise party in spite of the scores of tax concession schemes and in spite of regulating of industry all over the place. I think the intention of the sale of these two factories was to fob off certain dissidents in the Liberal Party who want to see a closer relationship between their philosophy and actual government. I hope that in the end we will get a consensus on this. I think it will be a major issue in the State election. I think the Government will get a message then that maybe it is not worth the ideological thrill in electoral terms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise three queries in relation to the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories which concerns the future of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. Firstly, I am concerned that so little attention was devoted to the underlying reasons which caused the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo to degenerate into a situation where closure of what was once an important defence establishment in a decentralised area of Australia now appears to be necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Experience in the conduct of similar establishments reveals, for instance, that there is too much departmental intrusion from a variety of sources in the day to day management of such industries. The factory managers are frequently subjected to numerous interferences from committees, departmental heads, sundry experts and other authorities. All too often the prospects of an overseas trip will turn purchasing officers away from Australian sources to overseas suppliers despite token support from departments on maintaining a viable defence industry in Australia. In so many areas today there is nothing short of a mania to purchase overseas rather than to acquire from Australian based sources. Until these un- Australian practices are reversed, manufacturing and employment in Australia must be in a state of vulnerability both to closure and retrenchment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second concern I have about the report is the lack of depth as to the reasons why the factory lacked adequate finance over the years to update sufficiently its plant and equipment to meet the needs of a modern and efficient manufacturing establishment capable of meeting the sophisticated requirements of , for example, the Department of Defence. Unless we are prepared to examine the fundamental reasons for the demise of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory then other similar establishments could well follow the fate suggested by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I am not satisfied that there was adequate research to indicate that the factory was capable of being sold or kept as a continuing concern and as a viable proposition. However, I do not want the Senate to take from my remarks that a degree of rationalisation or even surgery after years of neglect is not necessary. I simply emphasise that I think we must look behind the woodwork and examine the reasons for the demise so that we can offer a constructive and not a destructive report so important to so many Bendigo families. The amendment as distributed represents a wide range of matters of condemnation of Government policy. As a package I therefore cannot accept the Opposition's amendments. On the other hand, I believe that the report has certain fundamental deficiencies that I have listed. For this reason I feel myself in a position of not being able to recommend the report as amended to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has been debating yesterday and again this evening the report of the Senate Select Committee on Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories on the Government Ordnance Factory at Bendigo. The Committee was set up in response to a decision by the Government in April last year in the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions to endeavour to sell the factory to private enterprise. The response to that decision from members of the Australian Labor party was quite predictable. They obviously react on doctrinaire lines by saying that anything owned by the Government should be retained by it. They reacted in this debate almost with indignation at the thought that something owned by the Government should be sold to private enterprise, without really considering the pros and cons of doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee was established to undertake the task of evaluating the Government's decision. It is very pleasing to note that the majority members of the Committee, Senator Chrichton-Browne and Senator Martyr, both of whom have spoken in this debate, have supported the decision after having heard evidence and evaluating the pros and cons of the matter. However, the Labor members of the Committee and the Australian Democrats member of it have taken the view that not only should the factory be retained but also no attempt should be made to sell it and that further, as I understand their speeches and the amendment that has been moved, the factory should be expanded as a government operation. Although I was not surprised that the Labor members of the Committee should take that view, I am rather surprised that Senator Siddons of the Australian Democrats should have taken that view. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Committee was tabled only yesterday. It is an important document of 150 pages. Obviously the matter needs to be studied much further. The decision of the Senate tonight to take note of the report will no doubt be supported by all honourable senators, and the report will be put to further study. Certainly it will be studied by the Government. In due course and, I hope , as soon as possible the Government will make a formal response to it. However, as I have said, it is interesting that the report supports the decision that was made nearly a year ago by the Government to seek to dispose of this factory to private enterprise. I might say that the Government then decided to test the interest of the private sector in acquiring the factory, but we did not pursue that test because of the interest of the Senate and the establishment of this Committee. So, any further steps to give effect to that decision of the Government have been suspended over this period. It is too early yet to say, as seems to have been assumed in this debate, that the private sector will not be interested and that there cannot be a sale of the factory. In fact, I am advised that, when the Government's decision was announced, several major companies responded to the invitation to register an interest in it. So, it may well be that this is a real proposition and it is not to be assumed that the private sector will not be interested and that a sale would not be made to it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I do not propose tonight to debate the pros and cons of that decision. As I have said, it has already been considered by the Government. It has now been considered by the Committee. The Government will be considering the report of that Committee and will then be making a further decision as to what steps are to be taken. Of course, the Senate will be advised of that decision. What the Government is concerned about is that we should be making full use of available capacity. There is an excess of ordnance capacity in the two government-owned factories-the one at Maribyrnong and the one at Bendigo-and we believe more effective use could be made of these capabilities. If private ownership is interested in the factory at Bendigo, that will contribute to the rationalisation process. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that a private owner may operate the factory along slightly different lines from the one that is in existence in Bendigo does not mean that we will have all the great social and economic evils that seem to be so readily seen by the Opposition. Some of the functions that the factory has may well continue. Others may be better transferred to the other operation at Maribyrnong. We see this as part of a sensible rationalisation of resources. It may well be that a private purchaser will contribute to that rationalisation, but that does not mean to say that there will be drastic social and economic effects in Bendigo. At this stage that is the course that the Government is pursuing. If the private sector in the end proves not to be interested or a sale on reasonable terms cannot be effected, the matter will be reviewed again. I make it quite clear that the Government has not made a decision to close the Factory. We have simply made a decision to endeavour to sell it to a private operator and to seek to rationalise the Government's needs for the capability, some of which is excess to what is required at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The real reason why I have taken part in this debate this evening is that I wish to respond, on behalf of the Government, to the amendment that has been moved to add to the motion to take note of the report that the Senate should express its concern about a number of aspects of the Government's defence procurement policies. I propose to address that amendment briefly and to invite the Senate to reject it as being quite unjustified and as inappropriate to the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment is in a number of parts. It speaks of a failure by the Government to respond to a number of reports of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I take that to mean two reports on this subject of defence procurement, one known as the Hamer report which I think was presented in 1977, and a much more recent one known as the Katter report which was presented in 1980. There are a number of aspects of the Hamer report of 1977 which the Government has responded to and acted upon. Many of its recommendations have been incorporated into standard departmental practices and others are in line with existing practices. However, the Katter report laid down or proposed a fairly major long term policy in relation to defence procurement over the next 10 years, and that matter is still being considered by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The next aspect of the amendment expresses the view that the Government has failed to provide modern guns and missiles for ships of the Royal Australian Navy. This is really quite an extraordinary proposition and is quite untrue. The Navy's ships are fitted with modern weapons. By way of example, the four guided missile frigates which are in the process of construction today will have the most modern 76 millimetre guns, standard anti-aircraft missiles and harpoon anti -ship missiles. These are the same weapons as those in service in the United States Navy. As I understand it, Senator Siddons was concerned that the Navy would not have guns to shoot down missiles. This is, in fact, what the 76 millimetre guns are designed to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The submarines are also equipped with new mark 48 torpedoes together with the latest fire control systems and other sensors. The new Fremantle class patrol craft have a gun quite adequate for their present role. I know that there has been some debate about that gun but for the purpose of the patrol vessel it is perfectly adequate. Recently one of the patrol vessels was engaged in an operation off the North Queensland coast. The armaments that it had at its disposal were quite adequate for that operation which is one of the major types of operation which these patrol vessels are called upon to engage in. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment then alleges that the Government has allowed the ordnance factories to run down through lack of work while ordering weapons from overseas which could have been manufactured in those factories. This is probably the gravamen of the Labor Party's views on this whole subject supported as they are by the Australian Democrats. This raises the fundamental question as to how far we can develop, with our relatively very limited demand for weaponry compared with other nations, a capacity in Australia to meet this demand in any sensible way. We would be establishing a capability which in many cases would be far in excess of the demand that we are likely to have. A very good example is the complaint from Senator Siddons about the acquisition of the 155 millimetre gun which he said could have been manufactured in the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. Although that may well be true, the fact is that only 36 of these guns will be required by the Australian Army in the forseeable future. I know that Senator Siddons is a businessman and I thought he would have a more businesslike approach to problems of this kind. Why would the Government establish a capability to manufacture a gun when it had a demand for only 36? This is a good example of why, from purely economic common sense, we are required, I believe, to purchase a lot of this equipment overseas even though it may be possible to manufacture it in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we are in the business of manufacturing our own defence equipment when it is economically sensible to do so. We have an offset policy which we pursue and which has created a great deal of business for Australian manufacturers. We have announced that our ability to manufacture artillery will be enhanced by the local manufacture of a 105 millimetre gun which is required for the Army. There is sufficient demand for this gun to justify fully the local manufacture. The Bendigo factory has and will have a significant share of this work. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given a very reasonable comparison. In one case there is long term demand for an adequate amount of equipment which justifies the development of a capability in Australia. That is being done with the 105 millimetre gun for the Army. There is, of course, concentration on the local manufacture of various forms of ammunition. I do not want to go into the details of it, but this is another example of long-running demand which justifies the establishment of a capability. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment then goes on to complain about the failure to secure adequate guarantees on cost, delivery, offsets, Australian industry participation and technology transfers for defence material bought overseas. It refers particularly, as I have said, to the 155 millimetre gun. I have already mentioned why the decision was taken not to develop that capablility. The amendment also mentions the Leopard tank that ironically involved a contract entered into by the Labor Party when in government in 1975. In relation to that acquisition to date $13m in offsets has been achieved in pursuance of the policy of local manufacture where it is economically sensible and feasible. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of the Government is that contracts for major defence equipment should be negotiated wherever possible to obtain the best prices, firm delivery dates and contractual commitments for Australian suppliers to provide part of the project. The policy has been in force for some years and over the last 10 years some $400m-worth of work has been undertaken by Australian industry. That policy will be pursued and no doubt as Australian industry develops further capacity much more use will be made of it. There will be a number of further opportunities for Australian industry to obtain greater opportunities in the future. Of course the decision to purchase the new tactical fighter-the largest single purchase of defence equipment that Australia has ever made-will give a tremendous boost to the Australian aerospace industry. I have already indicated that Australian industry will expand with the production for the Army of the 105 millimetre gun and its ammunition and other types of ammunition. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other examples could be mentioned. I have already given many examples of the policy of encouraging local manufacture where it is economically sensible to do so. It is certainly the Government's policy to expand that manufacture as far as possible. We have regard to the need to build up rapidly our defence capability. We have to acquire weaponry of a very sophisticated and expensive kind. We have to make sure that we can acquire it quickly and make the best use of the limited financial resources we have at our disposal in doing so. Therefore, it would be quite irresponsible for a government to insist in an arbitrary and doctrinaire way on the development of equipment in Australia for limited runs at a vastly greater expense than the equipment could be obtained overseas. For all those reasons, the Government rejects the Opposition's amendment, supported as it is by the Australan Democrats, and trust, that the Senate will vote against it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion and totally oppose the amendment. The dissenting reports and the speeches of those who have supported them, particularly this evening, have one common threat. They all vigorously contest that the Bendigo Ordnance Factory can be sold as a going concern. What supernatural prescience have people opposing this motion got that I have not? No one will knows whether the factory can be sold as a going concern until all efforts have been made to sell it. I strongly contest that they have any better knowledge than I or anybody else in the community who is interested in this matter. My firm belief is that when all efforts are made there will be a very good chance of the factory being sold but that is as much speculation as has been offered in the opposite direction by the Opposition. None of us will know until all of the efforts have been put into selling it. I know that, human nature being what it is, the task of selling the factory will not be made easier by the definite assertions in Parliament tonight and last evening that it cannot and will not be sold. Honourable senators opposite and others may denigrate the Parliament and the people in it but there is no doubt that a great deal of notice is taken of what is said in this chamber and the other one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Siddons took the opportunity to make a wide ranging defence statement which, with respect, I do not think added a great deal to present knowledge in the defence debate. It seemed to me that Senator Siddons linked the whole defence and foreign policy cosmos with the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. I have a vivid imagination, possibly because of the several sets of blinkers I have worn in the past or perhaps for other reasons, but my imagination is not so vivid as that I believe there may be one or two important matters in the defence, foreign affairs and ordnance situation other than the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. It is important. We thought it important enough to consider its future; but, in terms of the wide ranging situation introduced into the debate by Senator Siddons, I do not think it is relevant at all. </PARA>
<PARA> One memorable point Senator Siddons made was that the 4 1/2-inch and 5-inch guns presently in use-they are to be phased out soon-in our Navy are useless in modern combat. He seems to have forgotten that these guns and mounts were, for a long time and even partially now, one of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory's prime reasons for existence. It seems to me that he did not argue too strongly for retaining the factory and its facilities when he pointed out how obsolete are the things that it makes. </PARA>

I suppose that the ebb and flow of economic activity affects all sorts of people and not just the Bendigo Ordnance Factory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now refer to the comments of another speaker in this debate, Senator Watson, a friend and colleague on this side of the chamber. I do not want to be unkind to him, but all the answers he seeks will be found in the report if he takes the trouble to read it. We took a great deal of trouble to put that report together so that people like Senator Watson might have the pleasure of reading it. To ask questions like he did seemed to be superfluous. I shall not spend much time with him. I shall consider the more major points raised by Senator Button, Senator Siddons and other speakers last evening and this evening. It will be seen from the report that the Committee examined the evidence in the light of various options. The Government's stated intention was to sell the OFB as a going concern. That was the option that principally occupied the Committee's attention . However, the Committee recognised that other possibilities existed for the OFB . It was for this reason that it canvassed the effects of the various options in regard to defence, commercial and social issues. I am pleased to say again that this was one set of examination points on which the Committee agreed very early. I am grateful for that. The options, other than the outright sale, discussed by the Committee were, firstly, the sale of the factory as a going concern, maintaining a partial defence capacity; secondly, rationalisation and/or closure ; and thirdly, the retention of the factory in government control. A further option raised was the sale of some parts of the OFB as going concerns in themselves. This was not an aspect on which the Committee received a great deal of evidence. We did not spend a lot of time on this option because it did not seem to be one that would be very successful in the end. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found on the evidence that the OFB possessed few totally unique industrial processes necessary to defence production. It found that most tasks at the OFB could equally be undertaken at other government factories or by industry generally. Given the low level of defence orders to the OFB in the last decade, we could not be convinced that it was abolutely vital to our defence requirements. The Committee appreciated the dilemma of the Department of Defence and the Department of Industry and Commerce in that they must attempt to obtain the greatest possible value for the taxpayers' defence dollar while, at the same time, they have to ensure that the defence skills and capabilities we already have in this country, which we have acquired at a high cost, are not lost or dissipated. To resolve the dilemma the Committee believed that rationalisation of the ordnance munitions industry was necessary and that the sale of OFB formed part of that process. The Committee believed that even an immediate closure of OFB would only marginally affect Australia's defence capacity and capability as all of those defence works at OFB could be relocated in a comparatively short time to other munitions factories. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne has already mentioned the difficulties of moving quickly the 4 1/2 inch gun and mounting repair facility and the difficulty of finding a building of sufficient height that would be available immediately. But I think to anyone who has the barest experience in these matters that is not an insuperable problem. We found that in order to maintain production levels OFB has had to undertake commercial work at approximately 50 per cent of production. However, as Senator Crichton-Browne pointed out, there has been only a break- even return on that commercial work. This has meant that OFB has required a subsidy each year from the defence appropriations and has been unable to resolve the problem of excess capacity. The Committee accepts the notion that that allows staff to maintain skills. </PARA>
<PARA> I perhaps take a more charitable view than that held by my colleague Senator Crichton-Browne because I felt the commercial work should have paid its way. The nature of the commercial work undertaken did not have the potential for an economic return to OFB as invariably it involved short run items requiring significant research and development. When the costs of running OFB are taken into account, work of this kind would appear to have made no financial contribution to the resolution of the problems of the factory. The Committee appreciated that OFB had the capacity and capability to undertake a wide range of ordnance munitions manufacture. However, the cost of tooling up for the comparatively short runs required for Australian defence orders was prohibitive compared to the cost of overseas purchases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The level of commercial work undertaken at OFB casts doubts on the need for the factory as a defence establishment. In the last 10 years commercial work has accounted for approximately 50 per cent of production. Action in regard to this should have been taken as a result of past reviews of OFB's performances. That this situation has been allowed to continue since World War II is the reason why action must be taken now, we believe, to rationalise the activities of the Government ordnance factories or, alternatively, to see that they are given a real defence work load.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An honourable senator asked before why I did not reply on the matter concerning the Leopard tank. I think the interjection came from the Labor side of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leopard tank, from memory, was ordered during the period of the Labor Government. If my recollection is correct, I think propositions were put by the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, to the then Labor Government that the turret and gun ought to be made at Bendigo. If my recollection is correct the Labor Government' s answer was no. As a commercial operation OFB has many advantages. It has a steady, skilled work force. Defence work should be forthcoming to the factory at least to the extent of the utilisation of unique work skills and machinery that exist at the factory at the moment as well as any additional defence contracts that might be obtained. It is hoped that a private operator will bring his own capacity and expertise to the factory. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button made a major point, I think, about the legal problems. I respect his capacity very much as a lawyer but lawyers do have different opinions. Anyway, it seems to me that the essence of his allusion to the government clothing factory case of many years ago was that provided a government factory being run under the defence power did not undertake work which exceeded 50 per cent defence work, it was then all right to take a little bit of commercial work . That puts me at odds with Senator Button's interpretation of the decision in that case. Surely what is not in contest at all here is that a government factory such as the Ordnance Factory does have a very great advantage over commercial firms when quoting for commercial work particularly when the commercial work is quoted for at rates which are far lower. The rates of man- hour return at Bendigo are far lower than the commercial rate for commercial work. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that any government running such a factory would find itself in very serious legal trouble if it allowed that situation to continue. All of the commercial firms in competition with such a factory would want to know why they were not so favoured as was the government factory. That may only be a perceived problem but nonetheless a serious one that will be totally resolved if the sale is a success and the ordnance factory is under another kind of management. However, as I said, I cannot offer an authoritative legal opinion but the best advice we have had is that certainly there would be a problem in that direction. Also there may well be a problem in the first area I mentioned-that of a factory operating under the defence power. </PARA>
<PARA> We were well aware that the decision to sell OFB would cause a lot of bother locally. We were able to listen to plenty of evidence when we visited Bendigo. But Senator Crichton-Browne and I cannot see that if the decision to sell the factory is successful there will be any significant social or economic impact in the Bendigo region. I come back to where I began: I know that the whole burden of the Labor Party and Democrat case is based on the assumption that there is no hope of sale. This is bound to have some effect on potential buyers. I hope it will not. It seems to me that if the sale is successful the problem is solved to everybody's satisfaction. It is most unfortunate that the burden of the other side's case assumes there is absolutely no hope of sale, there will be an asset stripping exercise and that what the Government is trying to do is just a prelude to closure anyway. I think this is a most unfair way to go about the matter. It is quite obvious to me why this course has been chosen. With due respect to those honourable senators opposite who have taken part in the debate, I believe the proximity of the Victorian elections has a lot to do with the rather crude political grandstanding that we have seen in this chamber tonight. It has not added anything at all to the concerns of the people of Bendigo to have this matter a plaything in this chamber for the advantage of some and the disadvantage of others. </PARA>
<PARA> Still, the Committee had a job to do. I thank some of those honourable senators on the other side who spoke for at least giving us the credit of doing the job diligently and sincerely. We are very conscious of the problem that people feel is going to occur in Bendigo. We still insist that the decision to sell is the right one. If it works it could well provide a new kind of prosperity in the area. But we should all concentrate on trying to make the sale a success. I cannot understand why honourable senators on the other side of the chamber are taking the attitude that they are. It is not helping: They must see that. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case the Committee could not accept the concept-I think there are some basic differences between honourable senators on this side of the chamber and honourable senators on the other side of the chamber-that the Government has a social responsibility to maintain the factory in its present form. The factory has to be made viable in its own right. The best method of achieving this, given the size of defence orders, which are unlikely to increase, is to sell the factory as a going concern. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perfectly normal for the people of Bendigo to want the factory to remain open under government control and the present arrangement, which has prevailed for many years, because it offers continuity and the security of employment that many people seek from the Public Service. The factory does not make commercial judgments based on economic conditions. It is not subject to market forces. In fact it is insulated from almost every normal consideration including relevance. In some ways it has become the social and economic pillar of the Bendigo district. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose it is worth while quoting from the Hansard record of the evidence given to the Committee in this case. My friend, Senator Crichton-Browne, is sitting beside me. He asked the Mayor of Bendigo, Councillor Stoltz:</PARA>
<PARA> Do you believe it is the inherent responsibility of the Government to maintain the factory because of the social benefits that it provides this community by way of employment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Mayor of Bendigo answered:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is presently the responsibility of the Government. The Government has to weigh it very heavily in its consideration in selling the Ordnance Factory. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crichton-Browne asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Do you see the Government's responsibility as being inherent in providing the level of employment that it is providing now because of the benefits to your town. </PARA>
<PARA>The Mayor of Bendigo said:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>If employees in other factories experience this sort of difficulty, the worst option prevails and the factory closes. </PARA>
<PARA> Now there need be no long term unemployment for the present factory workers. Evidence has been given that there are two other heavy engineering works within the Bendigo region. It can reasonably be expected that they will absorb a part of the factory's activities and that any additional work load moving to them will militate in part against local unemployment and the economic effects created by total closure. Again, whilst no evidence has been given, presumably a significant number of married employees have working wives. In the event of the factory employed spouse being redeployed outside the Bendigo region, the vacancy created by his wife would provide further job opportunities to those presently unemployed. I raise these matters not because I believe the factory ultimately will be closed but because so much gloom and doom, as Senator Crichton-Browne has said, has been painted by people who seem to wish that there be a disaster in order that they might capitalise on it politically. I commend again this report to the Senate. I ask the Senate to reject the amendment moved by Senator Button. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to obtain parliamentary approval for Australia to take up increases in its capital subscriptions to two international financial institutions-the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Internatinal Finance Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the main function of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was established in 1947, is to provide loans on semi-commercial terms to its less developed member countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Up to the end of June 1981, the Bank had lent about $US68.2 billion to its member countries for projects covering all the major sectors of economic development with emphasis on the development of infrastructure facilities in the transport and communications, industry and energy sectors, as well as projects for agriculture, education and water supply. </PARA>
<PARA> Following an examination of the adequacy of the capital base of the Bank for its operations in the 1980s, the governors of the IBRD approved in January 1980 an increase in the authorised capital stock of the IBRD of approximately $US40 billion. This represents an effective doubling of the Bank's capital base and should allow it to continue to increase its operations in real terms. The increase was covered by two resolutions, one approving a general capital increase and the other an additional capital increase. Under the latter resolution each member country is entitled to a fixed number of shares. It was passed to offset an unintended reduction in the aggregate voting power of developing countries, which would otherwise result from the general capital increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia voted in favour of the resolutions authorising these capital increaes (the text of the resolutions, including the number of shares to which each member is entitled to subscribe, is set in the explanatory memorandum to this legislation). Members, including Australia, are entitled, but not obligated, to subscribe to this authorised increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is entitled to subscribe to 6,037 shares under the general capital increase and to 250 shares under the additional capital increase, a total of 6, 287 shares, valued at $US758.43m. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the general capital increase, 92.5 per cent of the subscription is to remain on call with the other 7.5 per cent ($US54.62m) to be paid-in. Of the paid-in portion, 10 per cent ($US5.46m) has to be in the form of gold or U.S. dollars and the balance ($US49.16m) in Australian dollars. The latter amount ($ US44.95m at the current exhange rate) will be paid in the form of a promissory note. Subject to agreement, with the Bank, this will be encashed in approximately equal instalments over four financial years commencing 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the additional capital increase, the full subscription price of the 250 shares remains on call. </PARA>
<PARA> The IBRD is an effective and efficient institution in the provision of development assistance to developing countries, and it plays an important role in the S.E. Asian region. This has been recognised by Australian governments over the years since the Bank's establishment. I believe it to be in Australia's interest to continue this policy of support by taking up, in full, the increase in our capital subscription to which we are entitled under the two resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Finance Corporation, which was established in 1956 as an affiliate of the World Bank, is an international development institution established to promote the growth of productive private investment and to assist enterprises which will contribute to the economic development of its developing member countries. In addition to the direct financial assistance it provides, which may take the form of loan or equity investment, it also arranges for other investment finance, mainly from the private sector, to be made available. </PARA>
<PARA> Up to the end of June 1981, the Corporation had invested about $US4.1 billion in nearly 600 ventures. The syndications it has arranged are an important measure of its ability to attract private financing for the projects in which it is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the need to ensure that the IFC had adequate resources to continue to expand its operations, the governors of the Corporation approved a resolution in September 1977 authorising an increase in the IFC capital from $US110m to $ US650m. Australia voted in favour of the resolution. As in the case of the (IBRD ) capital increase, member countries are entitled, but not obligated, to subscribe to additional shares. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is entitled under the resolution (the text of which is set out in the explanatory memorandum) to subscribe an additional 9,976 shares at a cost of $ US9.967m, all of which would be paid-in. Under the terms of that resolution all payments associated with additional subscription must be made by 1 August 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The IFC has proved itself to be a very effective catalyst for attracting private capital for investment in enterprises in developing countries. As honourable senators will be fully aware, this Government has continually emphasised the important role that the private sector can play in economic growth and development both in Australia and in developing countries. It is totally appropriate therefore for Australia to register its support for the corporation and its activities by taking up its full share entitlement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the motion. It is a routine matter, which provides firstly that the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee will still have the power to appoint three sub-committees with a minimum of three members but there is now no upper limit on how many members of the full Committee can be members of a sub-committee. The previous limit was seven and on at least one occasion more than seven members of the Joint Committee wanted to serve on a particular sub-committee. That situation has now been rectified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion provides that in addition to the members appointed to a sub- committee, the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Committee shall be ex officio members of each sub-committee appointed. This overcomes a problem that arose when a former Deputy Chairman of the Committee wished to attend meetings of a sub-committee and found that under Standing Orders it was a problem in that a question of privilege was raised. The question was that when evidence was being given in camera, if the Chairman and Deputy Chairman, who were not formally members of that committee, attended, they would not be protected by parliamentary privilege if they took part in the proceedings. The new paragraph also covers a position which arose concerning me as I had been appointed to the Middle East and Southern Africa Sub-committee and then was subsequently elected Deputy Chairman of the full Committee. I wished to remain on the sub-committee and now will be entitled to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The last alteration also covers the question of privilege and means that now all members of the Joint Committee who are not members of a sub-committee may take part in the proceedings of that sub-committee but shall not vote or move any motions or constitute a quorum. In effect the motion gives greater flexibility for the operations of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee and as such is supported by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the amendments to the Act in question, brought about by the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Amendment Bill, is to enable the privileges and immunities available under the 1963 parent Act, which basically are privileges and immunities available to persons and organisations, to be accorded to representatives of international organisations attending conferences of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, held in Australia. To give an example, the European Economic Community now has an interest in Antarctic marine living resources. The immunities available under the present legislation would be, by this legislation, extended to such an organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second purpose of the Bill is to enable the granting of exemption from Australian income tax to foreign experts and committee members of organisations such as the Common Fund for Commodities and the Asian Development Bank when those people are visiting or working in Australia. So the first amendment, dealt with in clauses 2 to 5, relates specifically to provisions which must be made for organisations such as the EEC. I point out that when the 1963 Act was drafted it was not then contemplated, as I understand it, that international organisations as well as countries would become members of other international organisations. However, Australia has now ratified the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. Under this Convention the European Economic Community will be entitled to participate along with the member states of the Antarctic Treaty. The European Economic Community, for example, will send delegations and representatives to meetings and, as the host state, Australia has an obligation to extend to such delegations from such organisations the same privileges and immunities enjoyed by diplomatic envoys representing particular countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment, which is set out in clause 6, has been introduced to enable Australia to implement a taxation obligation under two international agreements. One establishes the Common Fund for Commodities; the other establishes the Asian Development Bank. This amendment will exempt from taxation on income experts participating in the work of prescribed organisations. At present Australia is not a party to any other agreement under which a similar concession could be made. I refer the Senate to the fact that in her second reading speech the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) advised:</PARA>
<PARA> The measures should not be significant in terms of revenue forgone. </PARA>
<PARA>That is to say taxation revenue, as the number of persons and organisations involved in this process of attending functions and research meetings in Australia would be few. This is very much a machinery Bill to facilitate the participation of organisations such as the EEC and others in conferences and so on in Australia subject to the same conditions as those to which diplomatic representatives of certain countries are now subject. The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. Indeed it is eminently sensible, but I think we should make some points about it in passing which relate to the extent of Australia's commitment to research into and the conservation of Antarctic resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The Antarctic is an area in which Australia has had an extension of its national charmed life, in geographical terms at least. The lucky country ethic has extended to Australia's participation in research and development in the Antarctic region. The Antarctic has an enormous potential in terms of mineral development, for example, coal and other minerals. I suppose the extent of that potential is not accurately known at this stage. There is also a much better recognised potential in terms of the marine resources which need research and protection. Quite recently the level of Australia's commitment in the Antarctic was attacked because of Government cost-cutting measures. One of Australia's bases, Casey, is threatened with closure. It needs several million dollars in order to keep operating. The important point here is that if by 1991, when the question of the Antarctic involvement of various countries is to be reviewed, Australia has not made a better effort in relation to its presence in a vast area of the Antarctic we certainly stand to receive a great deal of criticism about the sort of efforts we have made to date. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week Dr Clarrie McCue, the Director of the Antarctic Division of the Department of Science and Technology, was reported as saying that the Division could not continue its normal activities without additional resources. With respect, it is another example of short term, ad hoc decision making and an absence of any sensible long term planning approach to Australia's commitment to the Antarctic and to the development and researching of resources available in that region. I shall mention one example. The glaciological work being done at Casey is acknowledged by some experts as possibly the best in the world. It is a field in which Australia attained some degree of international prestige. If the Casey base were to close it would set back a most valuable research project. I do not think the Casey base will be allowed to close but I think it can be run down to the extent where it does not make a viable contribution to the region or does not contribute in any sense to a viable future presence for Australia in that region. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned, as I think it is appropriate for an Opposition to be concerned. I was listening to the debate earlier tonight. I was sometimes chided for putting forward views about these matters-chided in a very kindly way. The Government needs to get on with development of policies about Australia's role in the Antarctic. It is essential to get on with exploration of the potential oil and mineral rich territory before the treaty runs out in 1991. It is essential to get on with research into the marine resources of the Antarctic. It is essential to keep work such as the glaciological research being done at Casey going in a viable sort of way so that Australia can continually have a presence in that area of which we can be proud. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1991 there will be all sorts of conflicting claims surrounding any negotiations on a new agreement and we do not want to be in the position of having it claimed against us that we have neglected our obligations in respect of the very substantial area of the Antarctic under Australian control. The fact of the matter is that the whole future of the Antarctic is going to be a major issue once technology develops to a point where development of the Antarctic becomes feasible. Australia should be laying the groundwork now to enable it to participate fully in the debate on the future of this area. We commend the Bill to the Senate. We use this occasion to remind the Government that in this as in many other areas of policy development the performance has been less desirable than it might be. We otherwise wish the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill also has a certain machinery quality about it. I would like to begin by explaining the purpose of the Bill which gives effect to a Government decision announced in a statement on 20 August 1981. The purpose enunciated in that statement is to establish the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The function of the Centre is to mobilise and expand Australia's research capacity so as to assist developing countries in agricultural and related areas and to develop an expanded, better co-ordinated and more identifiable Australian effort aimed at achieving nutritional self-sufficiency in developing countries. Apart from some qualifications which the Opposition has by way of amendment and so on- I hope the Government will give some consideration to the amendment and not treat it in the rubber stamp way it sometimes does-the Opposition totally applauds the initiative and spirit of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before going on to say something about its importance as we see it, I should say that a number of programs which would fall within the concept of this Bill are already being conducted by Australian agencies of one kind or another. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other bodies are doing relevant research into the topic of this Bill. The present situation in many developing countries regarding the availability of food supplies and the availability of adequate long term food supplies is a very serious one indeed. The international community has long recognised this and, in consequence, a number of agencies and programs have been established, several of which operate through the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia at the moment there is no mechanism which could promote a co- ordinated and systematic approach to Australia's agricultural aid assistance. Most aid is given on a somewhat ad hoc basis as a result of requests for help from various governments. For example, the International Rice Research Institute has relied on a number of occasions on Australian expertise and assistance supplied by an organisation such as the CSIRO. That is just one example which comes quickly to mind. By and large the aid which is given in terms of agricultural production, is, as I have said, given on an ad hoc basis. There is a need to establish an effective structure for identifying the agricultural problems of developing countries. In particular, there is no structure which operates to co-ordinate the efforts of university researchers, State departments of agriculture, the CSIRO and any private organisations and individuals. I again make the point that the work done by some of the university bodies, private organisaions and individuals, and the CSIRO is quite significant. This Bill has been introduced into the Parliament to correct some of the deficiencies caused by the fact that there is no umbrella body. It is expected that the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research will co-ordinate and make more identifiable Australia's overseas aid efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make some brief comments on the question of the organisation of the Centre itself. The Centre is not, itself, to engage in any research activity. It will contract research work out to various bodies, such as universities, State departments and other organisations, including the CSIRO. As I said earlier, it will be an umbrella organisation which will be responsible for co-ordination. The Government has insisted that there be greater efforts to involve scientists and institutions from developing countries. This is dealt with in clause 5 of the Bill before the Senate. Clause 7 establishes the Board of Management of the Centre, which will be responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the conduct and control of the affairs of the Centre. The support services for the centre will be provided by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau. There is also to be a Policy Advisory Council, which will consist of 17 ministerially appointed members from various organisations interested in research. The Board of Management of six members will consist of the President of the Policy Advisory Council, the director of the Centre, the directors of ADAB and three other members from the Policy Advisory Council. The Centre will have a director and about ten professional staff. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite apparent from what I have said that the Opposition supports this Bill. Efforts by countries such as Australia in the area of overseas aid are essential if we are to contribute to a new equitable world economic order. There is a crying need to do something about the millions of people in the world today who are starving because of the inability of their countries to produce sufficient food. Australia, through the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), has taken somewhat flamboyantly noisy initatives in relation to the Brandt report and the whole question of the North-South dialogue. But when we get to the nitty-gritty in these issues, Australia's contribution has not been as good as it might be, that is to say, we have not gone to the extent which one might wish to put our money or our organisational capacity where our mouths are in relation to this question of aid for underdeveloped countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation in that context is welcome. It would be more welcome if it were accompanied by a further commitment to Australia's foreign aid contribution, which has significantly declined in recent years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I understand that. I said that it had significantly declined in recent years. Aid management in Australia needs reform and reorganisation. It needs to be streamlined. This sort of legislation is a help in obtaining that result. The initiative, as I have said, is highly welcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government seems confident that the resources of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs will be adequate to ensure the efficient functioning of the Centre for International Agricultural Research, but the resources of these two bodies have been severely strained because of government cutbacks and the activities of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. It may be that cuts in funding to these bodies will not enable adequate support services to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should research be contracted out? Research facilities exist in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other government instrumentalities. In our view, the Government should encourage these bodies to take up research rather than to cut back on their operations. The Government has cut back on scientific research programs overall but, in some extraordinary quid pro quo, has given research out to private bodies. There is no evidence that this will be any cheaper. We submit that it is more appropriate that research be undertaken by government departments where facilities and talent exist to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a sunset provision-clause 43-which provides that the legislation will cease to exist effectively after 12 years from the date of commencement. That is to enable a review of the operation to take place at the end of 10 years. Depending on the outcome of that review, new legislation could be drawn up or the Centre could be allowed to lapse. In our view that is a long review period. One cannot speculate, in terms of international equity, in terms of the provision of food and so on, that that is anything but an insignificant period but, in terms of an organisation such as this, it seems to us to be a long period. A shorter length of time would be more appropriate. Accordingly I propose at the Committee stage to move an amendment which was moved in the House of Representatives that the review of the operations take place after six years. Incidentally, that is a normal period for a so-called sunset clause in the United States of America, the home of sunset clauses and everything else of that kind which excites the imagination of Australia's politicians in a derivative way. We suggest that the review of operations of the Centre should take place after six years and that there should be a cessation of the operation of the Act after eight years by virtue of the sunset clause. I will be moving an amendment to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of six years some people will have served two terms on the Policy Advisory Council. I think that is important in considering when the review should take place. The terms are of three years each. At the end of six years the members will have served two terms. It seems an appropriate time to conduct a review at the same time as one is looking at fresh terms for members of the Advisory Council. The Council will comprise highly skilled people and the position with regard to the Centre should be known at the end of the six year period. </PARA>
<PARA> Other than those comments, we commend the Bill to the Senate. I wish only to add in that chiding sort of way that we hope that in looking at the functions of this Centre the Australian Government will perhaps give some attention to the question of land reform as well as agricultural development in the countries which are the likely beneficiaries of this initiative. Otherwise I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today at Question Time I said that I was going to raise a couple of matters tonight dealing with questions which I had raised in the Parliament last year. I had received answers from the Ministers but the answers have never appeared in Hansard. I was one of three senators today who made mention of that fact. The first matter I refer to is the one that I raised on 12 November dealing with people from Canada with visitors' permits who are being allowed to work in Australia. I expressed the view that this was a very one-sided arrangement. I was told, while I was in Canada, that Canadians coming to Australia were given work permits and Australians going to Canada were not allowed in the main to take a job. I have now received a letter dated 9 February from the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee, in explanation of the matters that I raised. To save the time of the Senate I seek leave to have that letter incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>6 Third Street</PARA>
<PARA>MURRAY BRIDGE SA 5253</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator McLaren</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the matter you raised in debate in Parliament on 12 November 1981 regarding Canadian nationals who are issued with visitor's visas to come to Australia and are also given work permits. </PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with the introduction on 1 January 1975 of visa requirements for all Commonwealth and Irish citizens it was decided that young people from the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada should be permitted to make working holiday visits to Australia. Young Australians have long been able to enter the United Kingdom for working holiday purposes and the above-mentioned decision was taken on the basis of reciprocity. Although reciprocity was not involved in respect of young Irish and Canadian citizens they were included in the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department became aware in 1976 through an initiative by the Australian High Commission, Ottawa, which we had encouraged, that the Canadian authorities would be prepared to consider some form of reciprocal treatment for young Australians upon formal request by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1976 the Australian High Commission in Ottawa raised the matter formally with the Canadian authorities. A letter dated 15 March 1977 from the Canadian Department of External Affairs to the Australian High Commission reported the decision of the Canadian Minister of Manpower and Immigration to allow, under specified conditions, up to 400 young Australians to spend a working holiday in Canada in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the Canadian, our arrangement has no numerical ceiling on the number who may benefit annually from it nor does it require, as a pre-condition of visa issue, evidence of a firm job offer. In fact the Australian arrangements require that the prime objective of applicants should be a holiday in Australia with employment a subsidiary consideration for the purpose of supplementing holiday funds if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I have provided these brief notes in order to clarify the Australian/Canadian situation your raised. For your information, in the last year some 2,500 temporary employment visas were issued to Canadians for entry to Australia, whilst some 800 temporary employment visas were issued to Australians for entry to Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> This information, I hope, has clarified the situation for you. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely Ian Macphee</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other matter which I raised also on the same day during the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981-82 concerned the VIP manifest which is tabled in the Parliament twice a year. I made a suggestion about having some greater explanation embodied in the manifest when it was tabled in the Senate so that we could, with much less trouble, find out the actual cost of these VIP flights, particularly those flights used by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It is well known that I often pursue those matters in the Senate. I am disappointed with the letter that I received from the Minister for Defence, Mr Killen, on this matter. It is dated 9 March. I have waited to see that letter in Hansard this week but it also has not appeared. I will take the opportunity now of quoting from that short letter which I received from him. I said in the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1):</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which we dealt with a short while ago, certain costs are shown. But, buried in the appropriations for the Department of Defence is another set of costs for the same purpose, that is, flying Ministers and the Prime Minister. I have suggested before-and I suggest again-that all these costs ought to be accumulated and put before the Parliament in one paper so that we can ascertain what it costs a year for the Prime Minister, his Ministers and members of standing committees of the Senate and joint parliamentary committees to fly around this country or overseas so we are not running from one Estimates committee to another trying to define the actual cost to the taxpayer for running VIP aircraft and related costs which are charged against various departments. All these costs are split up. This is a fancy way of doing it if one wants to hide these facts from the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we know that that has been the practice in the last six years. Many of the costs of the Prime Minister and particularly the people who travel with him are allocated to the various departments. We are unable to get the actual costs of the present Prime Minister not only to fly around Australia but also to fly overseas. The present Prime Minister used to be very critical of what Mr Whitlam cost the taxpayer when he undertook similar journeys. As I pointed out in this Parliament on many occasions, all of the costs associated with Mr Whitlam's overseas trips were allocated under one line appropriations; so we could see the costs. This Prime Minister, from the exercise we have been able to do, is costing the Australian taxpayer much more money. It is very hard to find the amount because he has it shandygaffed through every department. As I said, that is a very easy of keeping the costs hidden from the Australian taxpayer. Mr Killen wrote to me on 9 March. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator McLaren,</PARA>
<PARA> In the debate in the Senate on 12 November 1981 you made proposals for additional details to be provided on the Schedules of RAAF Special Purpose flights. </PARA>
<PARA> I have examined your proposals. Noting the additional time and effort in preparing the expanded schedules and the current arrangements which allow individual Senators and Members to query details on individual flights when the Schedules are tabled, I have decided not to alter the existing Schedule. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, (D. J. KILLEN)</PARA>
<PARA>I can well understand why Mr Killen has decided not to alter the existing schedule. Like his leader Mr Fraser, he does not want to divulge the cost to the Australian taxpayer. But that is a matter that I will be pursuing further when we get the Estimates in a few weeks time. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which I have had a quick look at tonight is the manifest of VIP flights from 1 July 1981 to 31 December 1981. That manifest is now a public document but it has not yet been tabled in this Parliament. I have only got half way through it but again I see that Mr Tony Eggleton was a passenger on a VIP flight-not a very long one-from Canberra to Sydney. Mr Eggleton is a paid servant of the Liberal Party. I have complained about this before but apparently he is still travelling around at taxpayers' expense on Liberal Party business- not on the staff of the Prime Minister, but as a paid servant of the Liberal Party. I will have some more to say about that matter at a later date. That is all I need to say tonight. I thank the Senate for giving me leave to incorporate Mr Macphee's letter in Hansard. I have read out Mr Killen's answer to me so that it is in Hansard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) $57m is included in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1981-82 to augment other funds available to the Defence Service Homes Corporation, mainly from repayments of existing loans. This level of funding supports a lending program estimated at around $160m in 1981-2.</PARA>
<PARA> (2)-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Yes, in certain circumstances. The general policy, which has applied since 1951, is to approve applications for a loan to discharge an existing mortgage only if the mortgage was arranged with the prior consent of the Corporation. Consent is freely given to enable applicants who are subject to a waiting period to offer security for bridging finance.</PARA>
<PARA> Exceptions to the general policy are made if an eligible applicant is a blinded or totally and permanently incapacitated veteran or the terms of the mortgage are onerous and causing serious financial hardship.</PARA>
<PARA> In assessing applications for loans to discharge mortgages on the ground of hardship the Corporation takes into account the relationship of the interest rate to contemporary market rates, the ratio of repayments to income at the time the mortgage was arranged and at the time of the application and the applicant's future income prospects.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) reliable estimates cannot be given of the extra finance that would be needed annually if restrictions on the grant of loans to discharge mortgages were removed. A survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1979 indicated that some 428,000 eligible ex-servicemen and women and 117,000 widows had not applied for a loan. The survey excluded serving members of the Defence Force, many of whom are also eligible persons. A significant proportion of eligible people who have a housing mortgage could be expected to seek a Defence Service Homes loan which attracts concessional interest rates if loans were freely granted. To put the potential cost into perspective, for every 100 loans at $25,000 that are granted, funds totalling $2.5m are required.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 September 1981 (Hansard page 558) Senator Macklin asked me as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services inform the Senate whether the Commonwealth Government bookshops which the Government is planning to lease to private operators are currently making a profit? Secondly, will the leasing arrangements which the Government proposes include profit sharing with the Commonwealth? Thirdly, will the terms of the lease ensure the continuation of a retail shop front point of sale for all Commonwealth publications? Fourthly, will the Government ensure that all public servants employed in the bookshops have the opportunity to continue in the Public Service with the status and promotional opportunities that they currently enjoy?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Precise figures showing the profitability of individual bookshops are not available as, for accounting purposes, the transactions of all seven shops and the central mail order service are treated as one business. In recent years the overall financial result has been approximately a break-even, that is costs incurred have been recovered through sales revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> Notional accounts for individual bookshops compiled in 1978 for the Joint Committee on Publications Review of the Australian Government Publishing Service showed that, while the Canberra bookshop was operating profitably in 1977-78, the other six shops were then unprofitable. The figures were quoted in the Committee's Sixth Special Report, pp. 62-63.</PARA>
<PARA> Further notional accounts taken out recently in respect of the financial year 1980-81 indicate that Melbourne and Sydney bookshops are now operating profitably, Canberra is very close to break-even but the other four still show losses.</PARA>
<PARA> Interested parties are being invited to bid competitively for the right to take over the bookshops as going concerns with an established clientele. The precise nature and extent of payments to be made to the Commonwealth in connection with the proposed leases will not be known until all offers have been received and considered.</PARA>
<PARA> Interested parties are being informed that the Government would prefer that lessees continue to operate the bookshops from existing premises, retaining them as established and recognisable sources of government publications, unless it can be demonstrated that relocation would increase sales or customer convenience.</PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that some applicants for leases will seek to retain the experience and skills of staff currently employed in the bookshops by making offers of continued employment. Should any officers not be accommodated in this way, efforts will be made to place them elsewhere in the Public Service in accordance with the procedures laid down.</PARA>
