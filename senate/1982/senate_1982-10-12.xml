<PARA> The Clerk's letter sets out the terms of a resolution agreed to by the Senate on 23 September.</PARA>

<PARA> In view of the resolution of the Senate I have given further consideration to this matter. Such consideration has not changed my opinion.</PARA>
<PARA> I must therefore with great respect to the Senate resolution decline the invitation implicit in it. I do so, however, with an appreciation of the compliment paid to me by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> I would ask you to pass this letter to the Leader of the Government in the Senate with a request that he in turn pass it on to the Clerk of the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the purpose of my giving these notices of disallowance on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is to preserve the Committee's rights while considering a response from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and while awaiting advice from the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) and the Minister for Communications (Mr N. A. Brown) concerning aspects of these regulations. Today is the last sitting day on which such notice may be given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Regulations (Amendment) is to provide a legislative basis to ensure that persons who are engaged or persons whose services have been made available for the purposes of the High Court are granted workers compensation coverage under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government) Employees Act 1971. The regulations are made retrospective to 21 April 1980. Prior to the making of the regulations, compensation was paid to such persons by ex gratia arrangements. The Committee has received an explanation from the Minister for Social Security as to why the ex gratia arrangements were made, and for the reasons for the delay in making the regulations, but has not as yet had the opportunity to consider the Minister 's response.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations, regulation 146AJ (5C) grants immunity from civil and criminal proceedings, including defamation, to the Commonwealth and a returning officer in respect of the issue of material provided by a candidate and sent out with ballot papers. The Committee's concern in relation to this regulation is twofold. Firstly, the Committee has sought the Minister's comments on the suggestion that the matters contained in the regulation are of such substance that they might be more appropriately the subject of an Act of Parliament rather than of delegated legislation. Secondly, the Committee has also raised with the Minister and the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) the question whether the regulation-making power provided in sections 133AA and 198 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 is wide enough to authorise the making of the regulation in question. The Acting Attorney-General has advised that he has forwarded his comments to the Minister, but the Committee awaits the Minister's response.</PARA>
<PARA> The Postal Services Regulations contained in Statutory Rules 1982, No. 147 have been produced to fulfil an undertaking to the Committee given in November 1975 concerning protection of rights in relation to the opening of mail. Following a painful saga of negotiation between the Committee and successive Ministers for Post and Telecommunications, the Committee is pleased to report to the Senate that the regulations now made appear to have overcome the Committee's long- standing objections. However, one small problem remains. The Committee has asked the present Minister to clarify why a right of notification to senders and addressees of certain objects which have been destroyed by postal authorities has not been included in the regulations. The Committee is awaiting the Minister 's advice on this matter.</PARA>

First, that the Prime Minister established a co-ordination committee of Cabinet which frequently determined issues without the presence of the relevant Minister; secondly, that the Prime Minister sometimes directed Ministers to leave the Cabinet room so that this co-ordination committee could meet-conduct which Mr Peacock described as 'outrageous'-and hold discussions behind Ministers' backs; thirdly, that the Prime Minister was fracturing Cabinet government and the parliamentary system as we know it; fourthly, that the Prime Minister acted with a 'manic determination' to get his own way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for National Development and Energy. Is the Minister aware that in the United States of America it is unlawful for an electricity company to impose on present electricity subscribers costs that are clearly attributable to a scheme which is being built but not yet producing income? In other words, the costs of a new power station cannot be a burden on present users. Is the Minister able to say whether that is the situation in this country or do power commissions require some people, who might not even live to use the power that is produced by a new power station, to pay higher power costs than would otherwise be the case? In view of the user-pays principle, does the Minister think that such a practice is fair?</PARA></TALK.START>

I will have some investigations made and let the honourable senator know. One of the problems in this country has been that over the years electricity tariffs have been fixed as a result of perhaps political rather than economic decisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister representing the Prime Minister agree with the former Liberal member for Wakefield, Mr Bert Kelly, that the Prime Minister' s attack on the Royal Commissioner who inquired into meat substitution, namely Mr Justice Woodward, was unwarranted? Does the Minister agree with Mr Kelly also that this criticism is 'yet another example of the Prime Minister's bullying streak'?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1297" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read the statements of Mr Kelly and thereupon I read the relevant extracts of evidence given to Mr Justice Woodward. From the evidence given by Mr Kelly one thing is perfectly clear: Throughout his evidence he said that his main and almost sole objective was to concentrate upon the need for a single meat authority. He said that he had regarded malpractices in the meat industry as being very subordinate. I forget his exact words, but in substance he said the malpractices were trivial compared with his main objective . In other words, it is quite clear that Mr Kelly throughout his evidence indicated that in any conversations he had he had one predominant thought in mind-that was the institution of a single authority-and that he regarded the rest as secondary and indeed much smaller in significance. I do not have the exact words; I would be very happy to get them and to quote them. I understand also that Mr Kelly has indicated that he did not ever particularise in any conversation with Mr Nixon any of the details of malpractice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, I have to say that I disagree with Mr Kelly's comments. I believe that the Prime Minister has acted to show that there is an aberration in the report of the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry. There is no reason at all why a government or a community cannot criticise aspects of a royal commission report. Even the Opposition criticises the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union in refusing to accept some of Costigan's findings and, in fact, asserting the opposite in this place. Therefore, I see no reason why a Prime Minister should not refer to what he believes are aberrations. To support what I have just said I commend to all honourable senators a reading of Mr Kelly's evidence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can confirm to the Senate that at the current plenipotentiary conference of the ITU a draft resolution has been put forward which, if passed, would exclude Israel from the conference and other meetings of the Union. However, I draw attention to the fact that this draft resolution is not scheduled to come to debate in the conference for some days and it is not yet certain whether the draft resolution in its present form will come to a vote . Apart from its being open to amendment, there is, reportedly, a possibility of an alternative draft resolution being tabled which would not have the effect of excluding Israel from the Union. I can assure the Senate that the Australian delegation to this conference has been instructed to oppose a resolution which would have the effect of excluding Israel from the ITU.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Contrary to the Press report to which the honourable senator referred, I must say that to the best of my knowledge, according to information received through the Department of Foreign Affairs, the United States has not made any public statement regarding its intentions in the event of the passing of a resolution excluding Israel from the Union. In these circumstances it is not appropriate at this stage to speculate on a course of action which it would be desirable for Australia to take.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for National Development and Energy a question about the proposed establishment of a uranium enrichment industry in Australia. Has the Minister noted the unseemly behaviour of Australia's most conservative Premiers, Mr Bjelke-Petersen and Mr Tonkin, who are falling over each other in their desire to promote Australia into the next stage of the nuclear fuel cycle? Is the Minister aware of the vast implications for nuclear proliferation of establishing a plant that will inevitably produce plutonium as a by-product and which could fuel the nuclear arms industry? Can he outline how the Government intends to cope with the massive health risks that will flow from a plant dealing with a substance as toxic as uranium during its enrichment, particularly as one proposed site for the plant is only 60 kilometres from Brisbane? Can he give an undertaking that no action will be taken to establish an enrichment industry until the matter has been exhaustively debated by this Parliament?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend to Senator Chipp that traditional Japanese film Rashomon in which four people look at a particular set of events and each person sees these events in a different way. In this case I saw two non-Labor Premiers striving to see that an industry which would provide jobs for hundreds, even thousands, of skilled Australians, might be brought to Australia. The nuclear industry, which is established throughout the world, causes no significant health risks at all. I reject in the first place the allegation of unseemly behaviour. I commend those Premiers who strive to get jobs for Australians. Indeed, it is significant that it should be the non-Labor Premiers who are doing this. That is my first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, I utterly reject any suggestion that the establishment of a uranium enrichment plant would contribute in any way to the proliferation of nuclear arms in the world. To say that is to misunderstand totally the nature of the plant. The fact is that an enrichment plant would aim to enrich the uranium from about 0.7 per cent to about 3.7 per cent or 4 per cent, compared with a weapons grade enrichment plant which is structured entirely differently and supervised entirely differently by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Such a plant would increase the enrichment to an infinitely higher level. One could not get more different sets of circumstances than those prevailing in a commercial enrichment plant and those in a weapons enrichment plant. I reject the honourable senator's assertion completely.</PARA>
<PARA> I also reject the suggestion that there is a threat to health in a uranium enrichment plant. The radioactive effects inside uranium enrichment plants are lower than they are in the mining of uranium. In fact, there are virtually none. It is true that to ingest uranium, whether from the end of a paint-brush as no doubt Senator Chipp did when he was a child, with his nice yellow water paint or by eating it, is not to be recommended at all. It is toxic, but so are most of the chemicals that are handled in chemical factories in Australia. A uranium enrichment plant is a chemical plant. It is not one that generates high or even average radioactivity. To believe otherwise is to misunderstand the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we have accepted in principle that if Australia were to decide to have an enrichment plant, it would accept the particular centrifuge technology of Urenco-Centec-the European technology-and we would embark upon a feasibility study to see whether there were markets. I wish to stress that before any decision to build such a plant was made there would have to be an environmental impact study and an examination of all details relating to health. I know of no industry the true nature of which is more distorted than is the uranium enrichment industry. Therefore, for the benefit of the Senate, I will obtain a completely objective scientific statement of what is involved and make sure that it is made available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am saying is that the practical experience of uranium enrichment plants presently in operation throughout the world has been that, properly supervised as they are, they constitute no additional health hazard at all, whether established 60 kilometres from a city or within a city. The precautions associated with an ordinary chemical factory, not a radioactive materials factory, must be taken in an enrichment plant, primarily because, in the first stage of conversion-from yellowcake to uranium hexafluoride-it is necessary to use the gas fluorine which, though widely used, is toxic. therefore , there must of course be protection of health but I can say that the experience throughout the world is that uranium enrichment plants are working effectively without any effect upon the health of those employed in them and that, certainly , they are chemical factories, not factories in which there is a high degree of radiation.</PARA></TALK.START>

I may be wrong on that; I will check it and find out. What happened was that the Government invited the President of the Law Council of Australia to nominate an independent counsel.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Button said that it is a waste of money. Western Australians will be interested to know of the criticism by the Australian Labor Party of the Ord River and everything that it stands for. It is well worth noting. Actually, the proposed irrigation scheme to be based on the Burdekin Dam will benefit a wide range of agricultural activities in the region as well as augmenting the domestic water supply of Townsville and I stress that. My understanding is, and I have checked this recently, that the Burdekin irrigation area will not be for the expansion of the area devoted to sugar production in Queensland. I stress that it is not for such expansion. A recent statement by the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries indicated that any land developed for sugar cane production will represent a transference of farm quotas from other areas and not an expansion of the sugar growing area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Expansion of the sugar industry, as Senator Crichton-Browne will know, is subject to strict controls according to Queensland Government procedures. Since the call by the Western Australian Government for expressions of interest in the development of sugar production in the Ord River region, it is true that several statements have been made by Federal Ministers on the prospects of such a development. All of those statements, as I understand them, have emphasised that any decision to expand sugar cane production throughout Australia should be based primarily on economic and commercial grounds. These grounds would include the outlook for sugar on the world market and the need for the integration of sugar produced in the Ord region into existing Australian marketing arrangements .</PARA>
<PARA> I referred to the actual rationale for the construction of the dam. I think it is on the same basis as the Burdekin project but the fundamental situation is that under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations the Minister for Primary Industry has responsibility for the issue of export permits for sugar. This power is used to assure domestic market supply and also to ensure adherence to Australia's obligations under the International Sugar Agreement when quotas are in effect. I make the point that the allocation of export permits is based on the national interest-that is, it takes all States into consideration and not just one, so Western Australia's interest would be taken into account. I would expect that this would continue to be the basis for the future allocation of permits. Fundamentally, the development of agriculture in any one State is the responsibility of that State. If Western Australia wishes to proceed with the development of sugar production on the Ord, that is a matter for Western Australia to decide in view of all the circumstances. It would need to take into account the ordinary commercial situations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that an application has been received by the Tasmanian Fisheries Development Authority for the issue of a Commonwealth fishing boat licence for an ex-whaling boat which is felicitously named Cheyne II. The spelling appears to be a bit off but, apart from that, I welcome this belated recognition of my place in the fishing scheme of things. As to the second part of the question, there is still a vacancy for the Tasmanian boat under the present plan as laid down. That, however, relates to the present policy which is established between the Commonwealth and the States for the south-east trawl fishery. The licence that is available for each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania is for trawlers of the size 32 metres to 45.7 metres. To date, a licence has not been issued for a Tasmanian vessel in this category. Cheyne II exceeds 45.7 metres in length and would not be licensed under this arrangement. I can only conclude that that last bit does not refer to me, since I am something under 2 metres in length.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry or a delegated officer would be responsible for issuing licences for vessels within the existing policy limits. But the notices which have been issued totally prohibit the use of vessels over the length which I have already indicated. A change of policy would therefore be required to license the boat concerned, and that would require the agreement of both the Commonwealth and the States concerned. In that, the Minister for Primary Industry would be guided by the views of the relevant States and industry organisations. The position of Cheyne II is still being examined. It is subject, therefore, to an expression of views by the State fisheries authorities and it is a matter which would require Commonwealth and State agreement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Social Security. The Minister should be aware of statements made recently, in particular by the South Australian Minister of Housing, Mr Murray Hill, indicating that the great majority of home buyers are not aware of housing rebates that are available and, therefore, are not claiming them. Can the Minister explain this lack of awareness, especially as the national promotion of the Commonwealth housing package has already been conducted? What has the Minister or his Department proposed to remedy this ineffective and highly expensive communication problem- that somehow the truly needy have been conveniently missed yet again?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for the question asked by Senator Elstob and, in particular, for his final words because they fly in the face of a question asked , I think, by Senator Giles in this place when she criticised those same housing rebates for not being an appropriate approach to the housing problem. I welcome the acknowledgement from the Australian Labor Party that the housing rebates will help many people in the community who are feeling pressure today because of interest rates. I am indebted to Mr Murray Hill for raising this matter. It is consistent with the excellent way that he tackles the housing problems of South Australia. The South Australian Housing Trust is a well known leader in the field and Mr Hill's leadership to the Trust is something that I very much appreciate. He has put his finger on a very real problem. It is a problem that we are certainly tackling at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator, in his question, referred to the fact that we have already had an advertising campaign relating to the housing package. An important emphasis in that campaign was to get us through a period when there was an overlap between the Housing Deposit Assistance Scheme and the home purchase assistance grants. Honourable senators will recall that a scheme of assistance to home buyers was phased out in the middle of the year and that a new system commenced operation some months before the phasing out of the old system. Therefore early advertising has concentrated on ensuring that people who have an entitlement under the old scheme knew that it was being phased out. It is proposed to undertake fresh advertising over the next couple of months to ensure that individuals in the community are aware of the extensive range of assistance which is made available by the Commonwealth Government for those who seek home ownership. I think it will be important to emphasise not only the availability of deposit assistance but also the fact that the tax rebate does mean that people can undertake perhaps a greater commitment when they borrow than they otherwise would be able to.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been much encouraged by the fact that a number of spokesmen for the housing industry over the last month or so have commented favourably on the impact which some of those measures are beginning to have. The concern expressed by Senator Elstob is shared by the Government. We have in hand plans to extend advertising assistance which is available in an attempt to make it more effective. I can also point to the fact that the State authorities and, indeed, some sectors of private industry are doing what they can to extend knowledge of what assistance is available. I have seen some private enterprise material-some of which has been assisted by my Department in the sense of having its accuracy checked and so on-which is being spread throughout the community so that people are aware of what is available. As recently as last week in my home State of Western Australia, the State Government conducted very extensive advertising which detailed the forms of assistance available from State governments as well as from the Commonwealth. So there is a range of measures to be taken. It is quite correct that there is little point in having these forms of assistance if they are not known to those who need them. I again thank Mr Murray Hill for his drawing them to the public's attention and I hope that he will continue to do so with the same sort of campaign that has been undertaken in my home State of Western Australia.</PARA>

Is it a fact that the Government sees tourists from overseas as a major growth area in our economy? Is it also a fact that one of the attractions of Australia for overseas tourists is a relative freedom from tipping, a pernicious practice which in other countries applies to almost every service provided, whether normal or exceptional, and which is embarrassing to the donor and degrading to the recipient? Does not the Government desire to stop this very undesirable custom from spreading any further in Australia? Is the Minister aware that an information book, provided in the guests' rooms of major hotels catering for overseas visitors, states that in Australia there is no service charge added to accounts but there is a growing tendency for visitors to tip about 10 per cent of the overall charge? To combat this bad advice, will the Minister take action, through the Australian Tourist Commission, to see that all overseas visitors are informed that Australian workers in the tourist industry are adequately paid, that they receive heavy penalty payments for out-of-hours work and that tipping for routine services is neither necessary nor desirable?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The chorus of hear, hears from Government benches I think probably reflects a fairly widespread view in the Australian community that we do not particularly like the growth of the practice of tipping. It certainly has been less prevalent in Australia than in many other countries. I think there probably is a great deal of the sort of feeling which was expressed by Senator Hamer in his question abroad in our own community. It is a fact that tourists from overseas are an important growth area in our economy. International tourism to Australia and its contribution to the economy have increased substantially in recent years and there is evidence that our attractiveness as a destination for foreign tourists will continue to increase. There has been an increase in numbers and in addition there has been an increase in the amount of money which those numbers have brought with them. In 1981, for example, the number of short term visitors to Australia increased by 3.6 per cent but the foreign earnings increased by 18.7 per cent to total $1,028m. So it is an important area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should, however, separate out the personal and perhaps emotional response which the earlier hear, hears indicated and the factual information which I have been given with respect to the effect of tipping on tourism. Whilst tipping has been described in the question as an undesirable custom, the Australian Tourist Commission, which is responsible for the promotion of tourism to Australia, has no evidence to indicate that the relative freedom from tipping in Australia is an attraction to overseas visitors or that tipping is on the increase in Australia. So there is a shortage of hard evidence.</PARA>
<PARA> The particular information book referred to by Senator Hamer is probably a privately produced book. But the Australian Tourist Commission also supplies information to overseas visitors to Australia along the lines suggested by Senator Hamer in its publication Your Travel Planner. The publication is produced in a number of languages and in all language editions the basic information given on tipping is:</PARA>
<PARA> Tipping is your prerogative, a reward for service. Hotels and restaurants don't add service charges to accounts; wages are determined by industry awards in the service industries.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the basic information which Senator Hamer suggested was relevant to the question of tipping, namely, the fact that people are paid award wages in the service industries is presented to tourists by the official tourist authority for Australia. As far as the rest of the question is concerned, I must acknowledge the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has given me quite a number of tips while I have been answering this question. I can assure him that all of them have been quite unnecessary; I am paid an award wage for answering in the way that I do.</PARA>

Has the Prime Minister now identified completely with the Queensland Government, which has been criticised by the Commissioner for Community Relations, by a United States congressional committee, and by the United Nations Sub-Committee on Human Rights in Geneva, for its racist practices? Has the Prime Minister now identified completely with the frequent attacks by the Premier of Queensland and by the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs, Mr Tomkins, not only on the land rights movement but also on the Queensland Aboriginal and Islander people themselves?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister's record, both in this country and on the international stage, in promoting the interests of all Australians is well known . The Prime Minister has played a very prominent role in negotiations which have taken place between the Commonwealth and Queensland over a considerable period. The fact is that the legislation promised by Queensland, plus the Commonwealth guarantee given first of all by me on 1 March and repeated since then on behalf of the Government, does provide guaranteed tenure for Aboriginal people to the reserve land which is the subject of the present legislation. While that Commonwealth guarantee exists to back up any Queensland legislation, Aboriginal communities in Queensland have nothing to fear and, in fact, their tenure will be secure. It is quite unfair, in view of the role which the Prime Minister has played, for Senator Ryan to make the suggestion she does in her question. He has taken a prominent and active role on behalf of Aboriginal Australians. He continues so to do. I believe that the comments were inappropriate and ungenerous.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Education and refer to the Government's decision to provide further supplementary grants to tertiary education institutions-that is, in addition to the established prospective supplementation arrangements-in order to provide for costs incurred by universities and colleges flowing from the most recent decision of the Academic Salaries Tribunal.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe I may have been asked a question about the Academic Salaries Tribunal before the recent break. The Commonwealth has decided to accept the recommendations of the Tribunal. Indeed, I made an announcement to that effect last week. I might add that the Tribunal has continued the series of moderate decisions which have come down lately, recommending a 7 per cent increase for academics. At the same time a Tribunal determination was made for people covered and represented by the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association in which rises of between 6 and 7 per cent were recommended. The Government has accepted those decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because we accepted the Academic Salaries Tribunal decision there was indeed a shortfall in the amounts which had been allowed prospectively for colleges and universities. The Government has decided to pick up some but not all of that shortfall. We will expect institutions to absorb 10 per cent of the shortfall. In addition, 10 per cent of the shortfall will not go into the base for 1983; the institutions will have to absorb that. But what has come out of this exercise is that the vice-chancellors and the principals have played a responsible employer role before the Academic Salaries Tribunal. The Government is aware of that and acknowledges it. The Tribunal for its part has made what the Government considers to be a very reasonable and proper determination. I believe that the Government in its response has given due regard to both of those factors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill was introduced into the Parliament some time ago and honourable senators will recall that it was popped off to a Senate committee for consideration. That Senate committee gave a preliminary report and sought and obtained from the Senate an extension of time. The Government has not reconsidered its attitude to the Bill since the Bill was sent off to the Senate committee. Indeed, to do that would seem to be rather unnecessary and perhaps time wasting, given that the Government accepts the obligation that when a parliamentary committee reports it must then examine the report and respond to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had a discussion with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and it is my understanding that he expects the Government to examine the Bill in light of the report when the report of the committee is available to us. Quite clearly, we do not deal in these matters on questions of personal opinion, be that opinion mine or his. The position quite simply is that the Government has not changed its policy with respect to the Bill, but the Government acknowledges that when the Senate committee has completed its report the Government will, in accordance with normal practice, examine the recommendations and views of the committee and respond. I would assume from the initial report we have had from the committee that that would involve us in deciding whether we should hold to the approaches which are contained in the legislation, since it seems likely that the committee, or at least part of it, will be critical of those approaches.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that funds are not sought from Aboriginal legal services; nor have they been provided by the Commonwealth to Aboriginal legal services for the purposes of enabling them to pay bail money, certainly not where people have knowingly or wilfully broken the law. A letter was written by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, whom I represent, on 22 September to Mr Mam , the State Chairman of the National Aboriginal Conference Queensland branch, which bears upon this matter. I will table that letter for the Senate as it relates to the question which Senator Kilgariff has asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of some Press reports to the effect that bail money for those arrested in Queensland was raised from a number of sources, but as far as I know they do not include Aboriginal legal services. I am aware that there was a public appeal on radio station 4ZZZ and many people responded to it. One Press report said that up to $8,000 was raised from that appeal. Aboriginal communities in Arnhem Land are reported to have provided $20,000 to assist those who were arrested in Brisbane. There are thought to have been some private donations from individuals in the general community. As far as is known to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, bail money was not provided by Aboriginal legal services. If there was any wrongful use of legal service funds provided from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs this would be noted as the accounts of the legal services were being audited and when future requests for funds were being considered in due course. At present we have no evidence that those funds were used for bail money, and to that extent I can reassure the honourable senator as to many of the matters which he has raised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I wish to raise a matter that I have raised three times since the Parliament resumed for the Budget session. In the first instance it was raised by way of a question with Senator Chaney, drawing to his attention the serious plight of the workers in the south- east of South Australia as a result of the importation of cheap timber from New Zealand and North America. Although I asked him that question on 24 August, I have not yet had a reply. I have also raised the matter in the adjournment debate on two occasions and am still awaiting a reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am really concerned about is that, during the absence from the Parliament of Mr Phillip Lynch, the responsible Minister, Mr Hodgman, the Minister for the Capital Territory was charged with his responsibilities. It is quite evident from correspondence that has been handed to me by the South East Trades and Labour Council that Mr Hodgman is not doing the job he was supposed to do. I was very pleased to hear today the announcement in Parliament that Mr Hodgman is no longer the Minister responsible because he has been doing nothing at all to help the unemployment problem in the south-east of my State. I hope that, after the responsible Minister has reviewed the letter from which I am about to quote, urgent action will be taken to try to remedy this serious unemployment problem in the Mount Gambier area. On 13 September Mr Hodgman wrote the following letter to the Secretary of the South East Trades and Labour Council in Mount Gambier:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Melvin,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank your for your letter of 31 August 1982 to Sir Phillip Lynch-</PARA>
<PARA>I use the title because it is in this letter. It is not my usual practice to use titles; I do not believe in them-</PARA>
<PARA>-concerning his decision on the Softwood Sawmilling Industry's request for a reference to the Temporary Assistance Authority (TAA). </PARA>
<PARA>As I have stated in this Parliament, I introduced that delegation to Mr Lynch in Melbourne in an endeavour to get some action. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Following his meeting with your delegation, Sir Phillip received a report from the Department of Industry and Commerce on the Industry's request. Having considered that report, and in view of New Zealand being the main source of import competition, he decided that discussions between the permanent heads of the relevant Australian and New Zealand Departments would be a more appropriate course of action than a reference to the TAA at this point in time. In reaching this decision, the special trading relationship that exists between Australia and New Zealand under the New Zealand /Australia Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the advanced stages of negotiations on the proposed Closer Economic Relationship (CER) were recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> Shortly after taking the decision, Sir Phillip was hospitalised and in the event there was no media release on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose here that there was no communication to the South East Trades and Labour Council either. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Minister's decision was referred to in the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA>This is the important point; it shows how much common sense Mr Hodgman has and how he is devoid of intelligence and of knowledge of how this Parliament operates. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Minister's decision was referred to in the Senate on 24 August by my colleague, the Minister for Social Security (Senator the Hon. F Chaney), in response to a question without notice by Mr J Porter, Member for Barker. I am enclosing for your information a copy of the relevant pages of Hansard containing Mr Porter's question and my reply. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have Mr Hodgman writing to the Secretary of the South East Trades and Labour Council, telling him that Mr Porter, the member for Barker, asked Senator Chaney a question in this House. He then proceeds to send him a copy of the reply, which he, Mr Hodgman, gave to Mr Porter in the other place two days later . But there is no mention of that in the letter. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> You will notice that, in my reply to Mr Porter, I mentioned the progress being made on the dumping complaint relating to New Zealand timber imports into Australia. The Bureau of Customs official has now returned to Australia and some aspects of his investigations are being clarified in both Australia and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> These investigations, however, are not delaying the Bureau's analysis which is being progressed as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>That is signed 'Michael Hodgman, M.P., Federal Member for Denison, Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce'. I explained in the Parliament a fortnight ago on the last day of sitting that that question which was asked in the House of Representatives on 26 August was asked by Mr Porter after he had read the Senate Hansard and had seen that I was doing something to try to help the people in the south-east for whom he is the Federal member, although he does not live there and does not have an office there; he resides in Adelaide and has his office in King William Street. After I had raised the matter, he posed a question to Mr Hodgman and when Mr Hodgman replied to a letter from the President of the South East Trades and Labour Council he got the whole thing jumbled up as though it had been through a mincer. </PARA>
<PARA> That is conclusive proof that the Government is not concerned about the import of cheap timber from New Zealand and North America and, because of its lack of interest, the people in the south-east of South Australia are being put on short time. The mills are now on a four-day week. Some of the mills are closing down and this Government is doing absolutely nothing about it. But what I am concerned about and what the South East Trades and Labour Council is concerned about is the way that we were ignored after Mr Lynch had told us, when we met him in the Treasury Building in Melbourne, that he would make a statement to us, within a week, of what he was going to do. There has been no communication since then except that bit of piffle from Mr Hodgman. I hope that Senator Carrick who is in charge of the House this afternoon will now take some definite action and let us know what is going on. I heard on the grapevine that there are some moves afoot to set up a TAA inquiry but we have heard nothing official. We have to grouch around the place and sort out this information where we can get it. We do not know whether it is correct or not. It is time that this Government got off its backside and did something about the people in the south-east of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In another question I posed to Senator Chaney on 24 August, I asked him whether he had had any representation from the Premier of South Australia, Mr Tonkin, about some assistance. He has not yet come back to me with an answer. I have heard nothing about whether Mr Tonkin has made any representation except that I saw in the Adelaide Advertiser one day last week that Mr Tonkin had belatedly sent a telex to Mr Fraser drawing his attention to the problem that exists in the south-east. That is only about two months after we in the Australian Labor Party-the interested people-together with the Trades and Labour Council, had made some representation to this Government. Mr Tonkin, like Mr Porter, then comes in at the end of things and gets a bit of publicity in the paper. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am saying is that neither the South Australian Government, through Mr Tonkin, nor the Federal Government has any interest at all in the problems that exist in the south-east. It is a damn pity that that seat is a blue ribbon Liberal seat. That is one of the reasons why nothing is being done to help the workers in that electorate. I hope the Government takes cognisance of what I have said this afternoon and gets busy and does something about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The inquiry to which the honourable senator refers gave its decision on 17 December 1981. Its hearing occupied a total of 66 sitting days. The Commonwealth and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal together paid a total of $84,691.60 to counsel appearing in the matter. The cost of sittings by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the total cost to the Commonwealth of items other than counsel's fees cannot be quantified with precision. Many of the costs incurred in relation to the inquiry were fixed costs such as salaries and wages which would have been incurred regardless of whether the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had been hearing this particular matter. There were in addition the usual costs and disbursements which are associated with major litigation as, for example, for travel and photo-copying. I am unable to say what are the estimated total costs of the inquiry.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) The Treasurer's statement was not a reference to replacing public sector outlays with private sector expenditures. It referred to restraint on public sector demands on total real resources because strong growth in private sector demands for those resources was already evident.</PARA>
<PARA> The effects on economic activity of replacing public sector outlays with an equivalent level of private expenditures, were such a replacements to occur, would depend upon the relative productivity of the two types of expenditure and the manner in which they were financed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce, upon notice, on 9 March 1982:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has the Government responded to comments by the President of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, Mr Muskens, who suggested that Australia has developed a reputation overseas as a country where the traveller may have holidays disrupted through unnecessary delays in the processing of clearances; if so, what was the Government's response.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) How does the Government reconcile any failure to so act with the reported view of Sir Phillip Lynch that tourism is worth as much to the economy as the car industry and almost as much as the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Has the Government taken any action to answer Mr Muskens' comment that 'It is about time that the Government recognised (the importance of tourism) and ensured that unnecessary delays were eliminated if we want to encourage visitors to our shores'; if so, what action was taken.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1310" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The question of delays in Customs and Immigration clearances has been raised directly with the Minister for Industry and Commerce by the Federation and other parties.</PARA>
<PARA> In responding to these representations the Minister has indicated his concern at the effect that problems related to passenger processing could be having on Australia's image as a desirable tourist destination.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is fully aware of the implications to tourism caused by the problems referred to by Mr Muskens and has taken a number of measures aimed at improving Customs' procedures and reducing as far as practicable delays in processing passengers through Customs.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government's recognition of the importance of overseas visitors to the Australian economy and the Australian tourist industry is clearly demonstrated by the initiatives in recent years designed to encourage tourists to visit this country. These initiatives have paid off. In 1981 there were almost 937,000 short term arrivals of overseas visitors, an increase of some 18 per cent on 1979. Even the increase of 3.5 per cent in 1981 over 1980, whilst representing a slow down in growth, was still a better result than that achieved by many other OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA> A high level of investor confidence in the industry, increased receipts from overseas visitors and steady growth in domestic tourism have been achieved despite the downturn in the world economy.</PARA>
<PARA> Senators will have received a letter of 29 April 1982 enclosing a portfolio on the Australian tourist industry. The data and information it contained demonstrate why the tourist industry in Australia should be recognised as one of our key high growth sectors and an important contributor to employment and general economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA> Since then the Government has taken further measures to stimulate the industry. These measures were announced in the Government's industry incentives package and in the Budget and are designed to stimulate tourism growth throughout the 1980's.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the specific matter of passenger clearances, delays are largely caused by heavier than expected passenger loadings, peaks caused by compacted arrivals within short periods and off-schedule arrivals. At present, Departmental staffing is so arranged as to have maximum staff available at peak times. However, large variations to passenger arrival patterns of which the Department has little or no prior warning will inevitably lead to clearance delays.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has approved the institution of joint interdepartmental management and liaison arrangements in relation to administrative procedures at Australian airports of entry.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result, all Departments providing services, together with the Departments of Aviation and Foreign Affairs, are involved in continuing discussions relating to possible improvements to the passenger processing system.</PARA>
<PARA> As a first step, trials have commenced at Sydney and Brisbane airports to stream Australian and New Zealand passport holders away from other passengers arriving at the primary Immigration/Customs clearance barrier. The purpose behind the introduction of the concept of streaming of passengers is to minimise delays for the greatest number of passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> A survey conducted at Sydney Airport for the period January to April 1982 showed that on 77 per cent of occasions queuing times did not exceed 40 minutes, and a subsequent survey undertaken following the introduction of streaming of Australian and New Zealand nationals from other nationalities indicated that percentage queuing times of less than 40 minutes had improved to 93 per cent and 86 per cent respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> I can thus assure members that every effort is being made to utilise available Customs staff resources to the best advantage, bearing in mind both the requirements for essential control measures and the desire to facilitate the clearance of all passengers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator has asked identical questions of a number of Ministers, as indicated by the above question numbers. With the approval of those Ministers my Department has collated the information provided by the other departments and I provide the following consolidated response:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Department of Aviation has two types of equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) high voltage electrical transformers;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) high voltage capacitors.</PARA>
<PARA> The high voltage electrical transformers containing PCBs are located at Melbourne airport in the terminal services building; two contain 1123 litres of PCB fluid and a third contains 1682 litres. The three transformers are in spill- proof bunds and metal enclosures. These precautions were taken as a result of advice from the Department of Construction in 1977. (The Victorian/Tasmanian regional office of the former Department of Transport published an Airways Engineering Instruction in March 1980 which advised of the hazards of PCBs, provided safety instructions in case of accidental spillage, and recommended remedial action in case of contact. It also detailed steps for protection of the environment and indicated disposal procedures). High voltage capacitors containing PCBs are located at Sydney and Canberra airports as part of filter circuits for airport lighting regulators. There are 18 regulator sets at Sydney and 3 at Canberra. Each regulator set comprises 9 capacitors, which are totally sealed. Each capacitor would contain less than 100 ml of PCB fluid.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Veterans' Affairs is aware of two transformers containing PCBs installed at the Repatriation General Hospital, Hobart. These transformers are maintained by the Department of Transport and Construction.</PARA>
<PARA> PCBs exist in significant quantities in all of the munitions and aircraft factories administered by the Department of Defence Support. They are contained within a wide range of equipment, including electrical transformers and heat exchangers. The Department has circulated Accident Prevention memoranda pointing out the dangers from these materials and setting out in a Code of Practice safe procedures for the control and replacement of existing equipment containing PCBs .</PARA>
<PARA> Several Divisions of the Department of Science and Technology have transformers and capacitors containing PCBs. In addition the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL) possess small quantities of reference materials for analytical purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Defence is aware of two transformers containing PCBs at RAAF Amberley. These transformers are maintained by the Department of Transport and Construction. In some cases, where defence equipment has been identified as containing PCBs, alternative insulating fluids have been substituted. Because the use of PCBs was widespread before their adverse health and environmental properties were recognised in Australia, some equipment as yet unidentified may still contain PCBs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Australian Mint operates a number of medium frequency melting furnaces for the production of coinage and medal alloys. The electrical system for these furnaces incorporates capacitors which contain PCBs. These PCB capacitors are stored in a restricted access area in the main basement. They are being replaced progressively with a different type of capacitor containing silicone fluid rather than PCBs. Complete replacement is expected in approximately 12-18 months.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Foreign Affairs is aware that PCBs exist in the electrical capacitors supplied for the Department's communication centre. The Department is however negotiating for the supply of alternative equipment containing no PCBs.</PARA>
<PARA> For those departments not mentioned above, no material or equipment containing PCBs has been identified. There is a possibility that some electrical equipment operated by all departments may incorporate small sealed capacitors which contain PCBs.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. It is pertinent that, under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations, the importation of polychlorinated biphenyls, terphenyls and other poly-phenyls and goods containing those substances is prohibited unless the permission of the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been granted. This Regulation has been in force since 1973. Health implications of the use of PCBs in Australia have been kept under surveillance by the Commonwealth Department of Health and the National Health &amp; Medical Research Council for many years. It is also relevant that, in connection with its involvement with the Australian Environment Council, the Department of Home Affairs and Environment has reviewed the use of PCBs in Australia and has liaised with industry to encourage the phasing out of PCB use.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) PCBs may be disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner either by high temperature incineration or chemical decomposition. The means do not presently exist in Australia for disposal of existing and potential waste PCBs by either of these processes, except in very small amounts. Consequently redundant or useless material or equipment containing PCBs are currently stored in a secure manner appropriate to the hazardous nature of PCBs pending arrangements for satisfactory disposal.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Up to 30 June 1982, the Commonwealth Government approved grants of $539,200 to St John Fisher College, Bracken Ridge, and $482,000 for Trinity College at Beenleigh. The first grant was payable over three calendar years 1979, 1980 and 1981 whilst the second was paid in 1981 and 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth assistance allowed for the development of major facilities to assist with the relocation of an existing secondary school in one case and the provision of new facilities in an area of high public demand in the other. In each case the community supporting the school made a significant input to the capital development itself and has incurred substantial debt servicing costs as a result. In the case of St John Fisher College, the Commonwealth's contribution amounts to a grant of 61 per cent of the total estimated cost of the project whilst in Beenleigh's case the percentage was 71 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The processes which precede the approval of such a grant are very thorough and ensure that only projects with a high educational and financial priority are assisted. The State Planning and Finance Committee of the Commonwealth Schools Commission carries out the review and assessment of each applicant school. This Committee is made up of representatives of the non-government sector, the State Education Department, and other people with educational, financial and related skills. The Committee assesses each applicant school in terms of the educational merit and the financial need of its proposal and recommends a level of grant in respect of successful schools from a predetermined allocation approved by the Commonwealth parliament and contained in legislation for expenditure on non- government schools in each State. Recommendations of Planning and Finance Committees are reviewed by the Commonwealth Schools Commission which recommends which grants should be made before I as Minister make final decisions. The honourable senator can be well assured that painstaking processes that lead up to Commonwealth grants for some schools ensure each is thoroughly justified.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as capital grants are concerned, the Commonwealth in the 1982 calendar year will provide non-government schools in Queensland with $6.961m whilst government schools will receive $18.929m as direct grants from the Commonwealth. In addition to these funds the State is expected to have contributed $53.615m from its own resources in the 1981-82 financial year for capital expenditure on government schools. The amount allocated from both Commonwealth and State funds for expenditure on government schools in Queensland represents approximately 91 per cent of the estimated total capital expenditure on schools in Queensland in 1982. In 1981, the latest year for which figures are available, 78 per cent of the students in Queensland were enrolled in government schools. Most non- government schools receive no direct assistance with the provision of capital facilities from the State Government other than some assistance with interest payments on borrowed moneys. Some independent Grammar Schools in Queensland receive a subsidy from the Queensland Government to assist with approved capital projects.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Commonwealth funding to schools is provided on a calendar year basis as approved by the Commonwealth Parliament in the various States Grants (Schools Assistance) Acts. Details of the various allocations for 1982 in outturn prices are set out hereunder.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) to (5) I am advised by the Reserve Bank that during part of the second half of 1981 the Reserve Bank lent funds directly at 6 per cent per annum to those eligible to borrow under its Officers' Homes Advance Scheme.

The Bank is unable to say whether any of the amounts of funds made available in these ways were subsequently lent at an interest rate of 6 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer did make the statement attributed to him by the honourable senator. This statement cannot be taken to mean that all capital inflow is speculative. It is useful at the outset to distinguish long and short term foreign capital inflow. Long term foreign capital inflow would normally be used to acquire real resources, plant and equipment et cetera and thereby increases the value of real resources we can import. It is not generally considered to be sensitive to short-term fluctuations in interest rates but must still be offered a rate of return competitive with long term rates available on international capital markets. If this rate of return were not forthcoming, the inflow of new foreign investment would decline. Capital inflow also includes short term investment. While some of this may be speculative-taking advantage of short-term fluctuations in international interest rates-most occur to meet short term financing requirements, such as the payment of taxes in the June quarter. This is a useful function, from the point of view both of short term domestic liquidity management and of short term trends in the balance of payments.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No: the decision was conveyed to all overseas missions in a circular from the Australian Information Service.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The circular read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> A decision by the High Court of Australia on May 11 will allow the Australian Government to pass laws relating to obligations assumed by Australia under international treaties, even where those laws affect areas previously under the control of State Governments and Parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA> By a four to three decision the High Court held that the Australian Government had power under Section 51 (29) of the Australian Constitution to pass the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The relevant section of the Constitution gives the Parliament, subject to the Constitution, the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to external affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Stephen, one of the majority judges, said that although the decision would mean an intrusion by the Commonwealth into areas previously the concern of the States, this did not mean that there had been some alteration of the original federal pattern of distribution of legislative powers.</PARA>
<PARA> Rather, there has been a growth in the content of the area of 'external affairs '. This growth was seen as reflecting the new global concern for human rights and the international acknowledgement of the need for universally recognised norms of conduct, particularly in relation to the suppression of racial discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA> The case arose over the refusal of the Queensland Government to approve the transfer of a pastoral Lease to Aboriginals in 1976.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr John Koowarta and other Aboriginals living at Aurukun requested the Aboriginal Land Fund to buy the Archer River pastoral holding for grazing purposes. The vendor was willing to sell, but the then Queensland Minister for Lands, Mr Kenneth Tomkins, refused to permit the Lease to be transferred on the grounds that it was against Queensland Government policy.</PARA>
<PARA> In a ministerial statement to the Queensland Parliament in December, 1976, Mr Tomkins said the State Government 'does not view favourably proposals to acquire large areas of additional freehold or leasehold land for development by Aborigines or Aboriginal groups in isolation'.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Koowarta brought an action in the Queensland Supreme Court that the Queensland Government decision was invalid under the Racial Discrimination Act. The defendants then applied to the High Court for a ruling that the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act under which Mr Koowarta sought his remedy were invalid.</PARA>
<PARA> In its decision, the High Court found the Australian Government indeed had the power to pass the Act and in particular held that Sections nine and 12 of the Act, the provisions Mr Koowarta claimed the Queensland Government had contravened, were valid as a current exercise of the Australian Government's constitutional power.</PARA>
<PARA> Section nine makes it unlawful for a person to do any act involving discrimination on the basis of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origins. Section 12, among other provisions, makes it unlawful for a person to refuse or fail to dispose of any estate or interest in land on the basis of race , colour, or national or ethnic origin.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter will now go back to the Queensland Supreme Court to decide whether there has been a breach of the Act, and what should be done about it.</PARA>

<PARA>Prawning Industry</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry , upon notice, on 17 August 1982:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Did the Federal Government, in 1968, encourage the private sector to establish a prawning industry in the Gulf of Carpentaria with the promise of infrastructure finance and a 96-kilometre exclusivity zone in respective areas; if so, what infrastructure finance has been spent to date for this purpose and on what specific items has this finance been spent.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Will the Government be prepared to honour a promise made 14 years ago to prevent the increasing drift of the prawn processing industry to the Queensland eastern seaboard and help sustain the only significant industry in the Gulf region that provides employment for up to 3,000 workers in the peak season and earns for Australia between 25 and 30 million dollars annually.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney-The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) and (2) In the late 1960s, during the period in which the prawning industry was being developed in the northern region, there was a concern that the non- availability of suitable on-shore processing and service facilities would severely limit the development of the available prawn resources. At this time, the prawn trawlers in use were quite small and either held their catch on ice or in brine refrigeration. This meant that the boats had a limited working range and had to land their catch every few days to prevent spoilage.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure continuity of product supply and thereby encourage the establishment of northern on-shore processing plants which would service the fishing fleet, 'protection zones' to apply round processing plants were introduced in 1968. No 'mother' ships receiving product from boats for transport to other plants were permitted to operate in these zones. The provision of direct Commonwealth financial assistance for infrastructure was not involved.</PARA>
<PARA> As the northern prawn fishery has developed, boats have become larger and ice and brine refrigeration have been replaced with efficient dry refrigeration. These developments have resulted in boats being able to remain at sea for prolonged periods and to still land a very high class product. Boats have therefore become much less reliant on shore-based processing plants.</PARA>
<PARA> The operation of processing plants in remote areas has also proved to be very costly and considerable savings have been achieved by undertaking final processing in established centres on the Queensland east coast and elsewhere. Some of the larger boats are undertaking processing operations at sea as a cost saving measure. For these reasons, the Australian Fisheries Council, when reviewing the management arrangements for the northern prawn fishery in 1979, decided to abolish 'protection zones' and this decision was supported by an overwhelming majority of the industry.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) It is not clear, from the senator's question, as to the scheme referred to. However, if it refers to a property being developed for irrigated agriculture close to Dalby, I have been advised by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries that the most recent information it has is that 2,4-D and 2,4,5,-T have not been used by aerial application.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am not aware of public statements made by the Chairman of the Wambo Shire Council on applications to spray chemicals. As far as can be ascertained the Wambo Shire Council by-laws do not provide the necessary powers to control aerial spraying. In Queensland, the spraying of chemicals from the air is controlled by the Agricultural Chemicals Distribution Control (ACDC) Act which is administered by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Spray aircraft are permitted to overfly a township providing they comply with Air Navigation Regulations and the ACDC Act. Regulations under that Act require that each individual spray nozzle is fitted with a positive and effective leakproof cut-off system.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am advised that, if the scheme referred to is the one mentioned in the answer to question (1), an environmental impact study was sought by the Queensland Water Resources Commission and the Wambo Shire Council before applications for a waterworks licence and levee bank permits were granted. I am further advised that the impact study took into account the use of agricultural chemical sprays.

<PARA> (1) Details of direct Commonwealth funding only, are known.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In 1981 and 1982 the Commonwealth Government provided a total amount of $14 650 for research specifically into Chironex fleckeri. Funding source was the Australian Research Grants Scheme (ARGS). Other research of relevance to Box Jellyfish, including, for example, current flows, population biology, etc. was also funded.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) See (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Dr R. F. Hartwick, James Cook University of North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) Direct funding by the Commonwealth through research granting schemes namely, Australian Research Grants Scheme (ARGS) and the Marine Sciences and Technologies (MST) Grants Scheme, is allocated on the basis of advice from expert advisory committees, Queen Elizabeth II Fellowships and Australian Research Grant Committee (QEFARGC) and the Queen's Fellowships and Marine Research Allocations Advisory Committee (QFMRAAC) respectively. The allocation of funds provided to universities through the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC ) is a matter for each of the universities concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> In formulating its recommendations for funding, the QEFARGC has regard to the scientific excellence of research proposals received in response to its widely advertised invitation. In contrast, QFMRAAC has regard not only to scientific excellence but also to national priorities in marine science, recommended each year by the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee ( AMSTAC) which are widely publicised by QFMRAAC when inviting research proposals. The level of Commonwealth funding devoted to any particular field of study therefore, is a function of the scientific quality of research proposals in that field which are submitted to the funding committees and, in the case of MST Grants, standing of that proposed research in relation to the national priorities developed by AMSTAC and endorsed by myself.</PARA>
