<PARA>To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate of Australia in Parliament Assembled. This petition of certain citizens of Australia concerned with continuing cuts in Federal Government funding of higher education respectfully showeth that the Federal Government cut-backs in funding have:</PARA>
<PARA> Made it increasingly difficult for many Australians to contemplate study at a university or college of advanced education.</PARA>

<PARA> Seriously jeopardised Australia's ability to keep pace with and contribute to technological developments in a whole range of areas.</PARA>
<PARA> Reduced the quantity and quality of community education programs offered, especially in rural colleges.</PARA>
<PARA> Forced universities and colleges of advanced education to cut back on the numbers of staff available to teach existing courses endangering the quality of education offering and narrowing the range of courses available.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore humbly pray that your Honourable Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> Ensure that levels of government funding for education are at a level that will enable all Australians to undertake the higher education of their choice regardless of their personal financial circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to a question I asked him on 16 February this year in which I asked what were the three essential elements of the Fraser Government's wages policy, to which the Minister replied that I should be patient and await a statement that he would make later that day. I now refer to that statement made on 16 February and to the speech given to the American Chamber of Commerce by the present Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Macphee, eight days ago. I now ask the Minister: What are the central elements of the Government's wages policy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1340" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Government spokesmen have been at pains to point out over the last half year and, indeed, over a longer period that they see it as essential that there be wage restraint in the community generally if jobs are not to be destroyed. In saying that they have been echoing a view which I would have thought would have the broad support of the community. It certainly had the support of the Labor Treasurer, Mr Crean, when he used words which have often been re-quoted; namely, that one man's wage rise can mean another man's job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As recently as a few days ago Mr Macphee referred to the fact that wage rises in excess of productivity, and in excess of the current inflation rate would certainly make the employment situation even more difficult. The Government has put its position with respect to wage rises before a number of tribunals. It has had a degree of success in that. With respect to its own tribunal-that which looks at the wages paid to members of this Parliament-there was a scaling down of the sort of increase that might have been expected. There have been similar successes with respect to decisions relating to the wages of academics and public servants, the returns to medical practitioners and so on. In other words, the Government, across a range of wages and salaries, and not merely those which affect people normally described as wage earners, has sought to urge wage restraint on the part of tribunals and the community. That is a very central element of the Government's attitude to wages policy. I will ask the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to provide a fuller statement for the Leader of the Opposition but I would have hoped that in the present circumstances, when disemployment is such a problem for Australia, there would be broad agreement on the very real need for wage restraint on the part of those who are in employment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; In the Budget of last year the Government amended the sales tax exemption that was applicable to ships and other vessels in order to ensure equity in the sales tax treatment of boats and other vessels used exclusively or principally for purposes of pleasure, sport or recreation. Prior to that action, boats hired out on a bare boat basis for pleasure or sporting purposes were taxable, whereas boats hired out with a crew for similar purposes were exempt. The amendment corrected that position by making both classes of boat taxable. Boats used for purposes other than pleasure, sport or recreation remain exempt from tax. Senator Bjelke-Petersen mentioned difficulties in the boat building industry. I know of no evidence that directly connects any recession in that industry in Queensland with the broadened sales tax liability. However, I will see that her question is referred to the Treasurer for any response that he may wish to make. But, as I say, that amendment in the Budget of last year was designed to establish equity between the different usages of the boats. I think that was understood at the time. If there are other difficulties that were referred to in the question I will see that some response is given to them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Social Security and refers to the fact that moneys paid in pensions and benefits are not considered as income when loss of income is calculated for determining sickness benefit. What is the basis for this action by the Government? If such moneys are not income according to the Department of Social Security, in future will the Australian Taxation Office take the same attitude and consider such moneys as being not taxable?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter raised by Senator Grimes involves an interpretation of , I think, section 108 of the Social Services Act. That section provides for the payment of sickness benefit when there is a loss of earnings due to sickness. I do not have the section in front of me but there is a requirement in the Act as to the form of income lost which gives rise to an entitlement to sickness benefit. In about the middle of the current calendar year a specific case came before the Department in which this arose. A legal ruling was sought from the Attorney-General's Department and that legal ruling indicated that under the existing section there were limitations on when sickness benefit could be paid. Clearly, it can be paid where a person is working, becomes sick and loses income because of the illness. There is a difficulty where a person is receiving some form of social security income and ceases to be eligible for that. That person is then in a position where sickness might prevent employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of the ruling or advice from the Attorney-General's Department, my Department revised the instruction to officers as to the administration of sickness benefit. It is important to note that the revised instruction which was circulated in June made it clear that under the changed interpretation-which I emphasise was not a change in the law or a change in policy by the Government or the Department but a response to advice as to what the law in fact means-an alternative benefit could be available in appropriate cases, namely, a special benefit. What is not yet clear is whether that gives rise to circumstances of hardship and difficulty which would warrant an amendment to section 108 of the Act. That is a matter which I have asked my Department to examine and to report to me on.</PARA>
<PARA> The Director-General of the Department has also been in touch with regional officers of the Department to ascertain the extent to which there is an actual difficulty for claimants because of the re-interpretation, on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, of section 108. That information is presently being collected to assist in the consideration of the policy question which arises. I would like to make it quite clear to the Senate that in no sense was the change of interpretation the result of any wish on the part of the Government, or indeed of the Department, to limit the payment of benefits. Rather, of course, the Department is bound by the requirement that it must administer the Act according to law. It has discovered that the law is not quite what it was thought to be and as a result follow-up action is being taken. But I also stress that in cases of hardship-that is, in cases where a person who is not eligible for sickness benefit is without means-of course the possibility is available for the payment of special benefit. My wish and that of the Government is to ensure that hardship will not occur because of these provisions. I will examine the Act and see whether some amendment should be made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is that in a particular case it was thought by an officer of the Department, after examination of the provisions of the Act governing the sickness benefit, that the sickness benefit was not payable. Because there was past practice which made that view doubtful, the legal opinion of the Attorney-General's Department was sought. So in the normal course of administration of this provision, a particular case gave rise to a query. That query was dealt with in the appropriate way-namely, by getting clarification as to the meaning of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>

Two lay followers were detained with Father Gore but all were released on the same day, after questioning. To date a warrant of arrest has not been served on Father Gore, although our embassy in Manila understands that one was issued by a local judge on 28 September. There is no indication yet of when the warrant might be served or when Father Gore will be asked to appear in court. On 1 October an officer from the embassy travelled to speak with Father Gore and to offer him appropriate assistance.

It is interesting that in this year, while Commonwealth funding for government schools increased by 2 per cent, recurrent support by New South Wales for its own government schools diminished by 2 per cent. I should have thought that Mr Mulock was in no position to preach to the Commonwealth when this year he has cut recurrent funding by 2 per cent for his own schools and when he has cut capital funding for schools in New South Wales by 20 per cent. The fact is that the New South Wales Budget, brought down by a Labor government, has cut education for its own government schools at the same time as we have been increasing, in our Budget, support for the government school system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, refers to persons involved in tax avoidance and evasion in Australia who transfer assets out of the country before they can be properly dealt with in the courts. In asking this question, I refer to a question asked by my colleague in another place, the honourable member for Hawker. On 9 September, Mr Jacobi asked the Prime Minister about the use of the ministerial discretion in sections 7 and 9 of the Passports Act 1938 to stop these people from leaving Australia with assets which may well be liable to taxation. The Prime Minister in reply said that he hoped that the situation would not develop where people would have their normal rights taken away from them before a prosecution was launched. Is the Government aware that on Friday, 8 October the Western Australian Supreme Court was told that a Perth property developer, Henry Chapple, was alleged to have taken $2m out of Australia to Great Britain at a time when the Taxation Office has outstanding assessments against Mr Chapple, his family and a number of companies totalling $3m? Is the Government also aware that Mr Chapple was a director of companies which were transferred to tax consultant Brian Maher? Does the Government consider that Mr Chapple's ' normal rights' are in this instance more important than the $3m owed to the Tax Office or more important than the $2m this man took out of the country? Finally , will the Government now take appropriate action under the Passports Act to ensure that persons like Mr Chapple and against whom there is substantial evidence are not able to transfer assets out of Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have information about the specific case of Mr Henry Chapple as quoted by Senator McLaren, but I accept what the honourable senator says, that there is a liability established. As I have understood it, the general situation has been that where the Taxation Office has made an assessment and has sought to obtain satisfaction, it has, I think, proceeded in the legal way to get a restraint upon transfer of assets. That is my recollection; it may or may not be wholly right. I believe that that has been the normal practice in the past. I do not think there has been any movement away from it at present. I do not know why Mr Chapple has been able to transfer assets, if he has. The Commonwealth Government is determined that the debts due to the Commonwealth from the taxpayers of Australia shall be paid and we will take all the steps that are available to us within the law to collect those taxes. That is what we are trying to do right at this moment. But I will look at the matter regarding Mr Chapple and also the matters raised in the early part of the question regarding statements on passports. If there is any further information I will let Senator McLaren have it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Construction, concerns the reduction of the merchant shipping fleet of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. Is the Minister aware that in the past 12 months BHP has laid up seven of its ships in Sydney and Geelong and has announced the possibility of further reductions? Will the Government ensure that any companies which lay up ships do not then use Government subsidies to build more ships in overseas shipyards which would result in more ships on the Australian register also being laid up? In the light of the announced laying up by BHP, can the Minister explain the purpose of the shipbuilding subsidy to expand the number of Australian ships carrying Australian cargoes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true, as Senator Lewis outlined in his question, that the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd has in fact laid up a number of vessels as a result of a fall-off in its trade. The result of that, of course, is some unemployment in that area. I would need to check whether the exact number of ships laid up is seven. However, I understand that it is a very considerable number. Of course, to find the reasons for that we would need to look at the steel trade generally. The fact has been evidenced in this place and in the other place recently that clearly there has been a downturn in the world steel industry as a result of falling markets overseas and that, of course, has particularly affected BHP's exports and has led to an increase of imported steel into this country. The Government's assistance in respect of BHP generally has been announced recently. The Leader of the Government in this place has often mentioned particularly the assistance given to BHP by virtue of its ability to offset losses of one group of companies against profits of another within the same company group. That will be of considerable assistance to BHP in retrieving its situation and redeveloping its trade and opportunities here and overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As regards the second part of the question, clearly Senator Lewis has a misunderstanding about the nature of the shipbuilding subsidy insofar as this subsidy is not available for ships which are built overseas and is, in fact, allowable only in respect of those ships which are built within Australia. Whether they are used on overseas trade or within the coastal trade of Australia is not a question for consideration. The subsidy relates only to the actual building of the vessel within the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations will be aware that there are well in excess of three times as many days lost from the work place because of industrial accidents as there are because of industrial disputes and that, in 1981, 500,000 workers were injured in industrial accidents resulting in 2.2 million lost work days and $4, 500m paid out in compensation. In the light of these staggering figures, why has the Government not established a uniform national collection of data relating to industrial accidents? Is it a fact that there is a Government proposal to publish a national bulletin on industrial accidents and that it is hoped to have it by late 1984? Will the Minister have this wasteful procrastination halted and set up the bulletin immediately so that accident prevention can be properly tackled?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the repeated interest of Senator McIntosh in this subject. He does raise it at Question Time from time to time and elsewhere. This subject was considered at some length by the Senate back in the middle 1970s when a committee of which the present Leader of the Opposition and I, amongst others, were members was looking at a national compensation scheme. There is no doubt that industrial accidents are a significant cause of loss both to the individuals and the businesses concerned, and hence to the total community. The question of accident prevention generally is quite complicated. The National Advisory Council for the Handicapped is grappling with the question of how one can get a better co-ordinated national overall approach to accident prevention. There is a series of bodies which concern themselves with accident prevention. The National Safety Council of Australia, the Child Accident Prevention Foundation of Australia, and other bodies, including many in private industry, are concerned to reduce the losses to which the honourable senator has referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal that there be an industrial bulletin is not one with which I am immediately familiar. I will have to refer that part of the question to the appropriate Minister whom I represent in this place for a considered reply, along with the request for information about the need for a uniform national collection of data. The field is one in which there is room for a great deal of initiative, not merely at the Commonwealth level but also, indeed, at the State level. In such areas as the imposition of differential premiums for workers compensation, and so on, action could be taken by a number of governments to tackle the problem to which the honourable senator has referred. I will ask Mr Macphee to consider the questions raised and let the honourable senator have a considered reply.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to the first two parts of the question, no doubt Senator MacGibbon will have seen newspaper reports in, I think, today's Press of the International Energy Agency's publication-it is available if he would like to borrow it-on the world energy outlook. That received widespread publication and, indeed, the IEA reflected the answer to the two parts of the question. First of all, there is a strong insistence that the present glut and low pricing of oil is very temporary and that there is a likelihood that in the second half of the decade, unless proper measures are taken, the surplus could turn to scarcity and prices could rise sharply. That is the keynote of the study. It is a thesis my Government and I support entirely. It is true that the question of what will happen in the second part of this decade will depend very largely on how individual nations comport themselves in regard to alternative energy and conservation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole thrust of the Government's energy policy is to aim at self- sufficiency. I am happy to say that in a wide range of matters, for instance in conservation, in substitution away from oil to coal, to gas, to electricity, in the development of more energy-efficient vehicles, in the switching to liquefied petroleum gas, in the building of pipelines, and in a dozen other matters, progress is being well made. Perhaps the most interesting thing is that import parity pricing has produced a great uplift in exploration. This year twice as many wells will be drilled as were drilled last year. One in every four of the wells drilled recently as wildcat wells has produced petroleum products. It looks as though we can now move more optimistically through this decade. Whilst I would always be cautious of undue optimism, my Department and I believe that we can look forward with confidence over the decade and beyond to getting a national self-sufficiency balance, that is, being able to withstand any threat of cut-off of supply from overseas, which is always likely if a disruption occurs in the Middle East. The chance of developing self-sufficiency in the 1990s is, I think I can say cautiously, one which we ought to be able to achieve in Australia. But we will have to work on it. Above all else, we will have to work to ensure that conservation, whether in industry or the home, is pursued to the fullest extent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, for a brief and glorious moment I felt quite flattered. I felt that that was a question that might have been addressed to the Treasurer. I regard it as something of a tribute that I should be expected to sort out the estimate of the deficit from my particular chair dealing with social security. In fact, the honourable senator has raised questions about expenditure in a number of areas in regard to which there is, of course, a degree of uncertainty. As to the proportion of the work force that might be unemployed and hence how many might be receiving unemployment benefits, the Budget Papers were predicated on a figure of 400,000, or certainly close to it. That has been the subject of some discussion in the Senate. I believe it was based on the estimate of the Treasury at the time the Budget was prepared, given the information then available. It may require revision in light of the fact that the figures have gone substantially above that level at a time when, seasonally, one would not have expected that to happen. It is a matter that will require further consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would emphasise that, if there were to be any reconsideration of the Budget figure, that again would be, by definition, an estimate. The actual number will be affected by factors that are not entirely within the control of the Government, including international factors such as world economic activity. Also, it will be affected by domestic aspects such as the drought itself, which the honourable senator mentions in his question. In other words, if there is to be a revision of the figure already established as the basis for the Budget calculations that revision, in itself, will by definition depend upon estimates and uncertain future events. However, I will refer the question to the Treasurer , since it is the Treasury which makes these estimates for the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I could just add that, with respect to the effect of the drought on tax receipts, again there is of necessity some uncertainty because of the unpredictability of seasonal conditions. We have all been a little cheered by the fact that there have been this past week reasonable falls of rain in some parts of New South Wales. Those falls certainly have not been general. They are not falls such as would enable one to say that the drought had broken in some of the extensive areas of New South Wales that are drought prone, but if they are not merely isolated, and are followed by further falls, some of the worries which the Senate could properly have about the amount required for drought relief may be eased. So with respect to both unemployment and drought relief, which even more is subject to seasonal conditions, we are dealing with areas of some uncertainty. I will refer the question to the Treasurer and seek a considered reply.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The arrangements for dairy products under the proposed closer economic relationship embrace an understanding agreed to by the representatives of the Australian and New Zealand dairy industries. My advice is that the understanding does not actually make any reference to specialty cheeses. The Memorandum of Understanding between the dairy industries in the two countries provides that the current understanding on New Zealand's level of cheese imports into Australia will continue, with New Zealand sales being related to the growth in the Australian market. For example, if domestic consumption of cheese in Australia is estimated to increase by 5 per cent in the next year, New Zealand can expect to increase its sales of cheese to Australia by an equivalent percentage. The understanding also provides for the cheddar quota of 1,220 tonnes per annum, operating under the present New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement, to be abolished and for future sales of New Zealand cheddar cheese to Australia to be related to market growth. Normally there will be consultation between representatives of the two dairy industries twice a year on matters of mutual interest, including trends in cheese consumption in the Australian market . It is expected, as a normal commercial matter, that New Zealand's marketing strategy will have regard to the preference among consumers for different cheese varieties. If there are difficulties, the understanding provides for consultation between the two industries with the mutual objective of not undermining returns to cheese producers in Australia and not undermining the established price structure in the Australian domestic market. So there does not appear to be anything which would preclude the existing cheese quota being transferred, but it is subject to the safeguard which I have just outlined.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Approximately 18 months ago the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was going overseas and before he went he described systems of public funding of elections as corrupt. In the course of his overseas visit, he visited eight countries, including the United States of America, where he saw President Reagan. All of those countries have systems of public funding of election campaigns. It is quite extraordinary that the Australian situation should be so different from that of many other countries in which public funding systems have been introduced. Mr President, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a document entitled 'Public Subsidies to Parties and Candidates in Selected Democratic Countries, 1979' which is taken from the book Democracy at the Polls-a Comparative Study of Competitive National Elections edited by David Butler and others.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is brought forward at this particular time because for the first time in the history of the Liberal Party of Australia we were hopeful that there might be some bipartisan approach on this important issue. The reason for that is quite clear. Recent events in Australia have raised an urgent need for public funding of political parties. For example, the release of the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union is enough to make arguments for public funding conclusive. It would not be necessary for the Liberal Party of Australia to have its fund raising committees chaired by known tax evaders if there were a system of public funding of political parties in existence. We have learnt in this Parliament of hundreds of millions of dollars of avoided tax through bottom-of- the-harbour schemes and other schemes. It used to be a slogan at election times, when parties put forward their programs for the election, 'Where is the money coming from?' People are now asking in relation to the Liberal Party and some of its very prominent members: 'Where is the money going to, and where is the money which the Liberal Party is able to spend at elections coming from?'</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. Senator Walters should get her facts right. That party is now a recipient of very substantial sums of public money to finance the election campaigns of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. It is likely that some people might assume, in this community, where hundreds of millions of dollars have been obtained by people through tax evasion, that much of that money has found its way into the coffers of the Liberal Party. Let us take the case of Mr Horgan in Western Australia, who is said by the financial editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, amongst others, having conducted an analysis, to have evaded $7m in tax in four years. As Chairman of the fund raising committee of the Western Australia Liberal Party, it is fair to assume that he would set an example to his colleagues in the Liberal Party in Western Australia and make some of that $7m available to the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This motion is brought forward in this context because it might be now, at this particular point in history, that the Liberal Party would be seen, in terms of its public image and esteem, to be advantaged by these sorts of allegations not being capable of being made against it, as indeed would the Australian Labor Party in similar situations. The Labor Party, for example, in the last Victorian election, received-I think it is common knowledge-$100,000 from the teachers unions in Victoria. That was a matter which was publicly disclosed. It ought to be disclosed so that people can make a judgment about the Government in terms of its subsequent decision-making as to where the money it got came from. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are advocating here is a system of public funding of the kind which exists in many countries throughout the world, and particularly more locally in New South Wales. Enormous levels of expenditure are involved in election campaigns by major political parties. Those levels of expenditure place great demands on the party systems, which are essential, by common agreement, in this Parliament for the proper working of a democratic system. So it is not just a question of having political parties funded in order that they can operate correctly and with propriety. It is a question of political parties being above suspicion in respect of the sources of their donations and in respect of the decisions which they make which might favour particular interest groups in the community and which might be related to the sources of those donations. Governments will not escape the odium of that sort of charge, that they are open to pressure of a particular kind, while there is no public disclosure and no public funding to make parties independent of outside sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that in Australia manipulation of political parties remains a constant threat to the democratic system because funds are channelled in secret to political parties and to such shonky outfits as the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation in Queensland. New South Wales has presented something of an example to Australia on the question of public funding. After a great deal of breast beating by the Liberal Party, it came round to the view that public funding was desirable; this last thing being the greatest treason in the Liberal Party-to do the right thing for the wrong reason. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that within weeks of the election the Liberal Party had put its hands out for $484,000, which it ultimately got. Since I am needled about the Liberal Party in New South Wales, lest the suspicion of tax avoidance money reaching the coffers of the Liberal Party be not raised in the context of this debate, let me just mention in passing the whole question of the so-called Liberal Party access clubs in New South Wales, which makes it quite clear that tax avoidance is not a new thing to the Liberal Party in that State. Let me also mention the extraordinary remark of the Liberal Party's principal fund raiser in New South Wales, Mr Valder, who said that the money that he collected for the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party would be laundered through other States in order to avoid the legislation in New South Wales. What an extraordinary statement for a prominent official of the Liberal Party to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the context of this debate I want to direct my remarks to two issues, although my colleagues will be speaking on particular aspects of public funding. One issue is the desirability of public funding of political parties for election campaigns, and public funding according to the votes obtained by a political party at the last election. The other issue of importance in the context of this debate is the need for the disclosure of the financial interests of Ministers of a government and members of parliament. Integrity, honesty and adherence to proper standards in public life are matters that increasingly concern the electorate in Australia. They could not have concerned an electorate more at any time in the history of Australian government than they do now, after seven years of Malcolm Fraser's Government in this country. People are right to look at this Government and think that for many of its Ministers integrity is a long way down the line of priorities.</PARA>
<PARA> Only in the last fortnight the Prime Minister has talked a lot about what he calls the importance of the principle of fairness in Liberal Party philosophy. The principle of fairness means nothing unless it can be seen to operate and can be seen by the public to be operating. If the public can see a principle of fairness operating, whether it be in relation to taxation matters or whether it be related to the sources of funds of political parties, there is no better beneficiary in Australia than the Liberal Party, from which the words 'the principle of fairness' sound like hypocrisy to most members of the Australian community. There is no better illustration of the need for disclosure by Ministers and members of parliament of their own financial interests. </PARA>

On this question of disclosure, the Labor Party is committed to a system of public funding of political parties in order that spurious donations may not flow into its coffers or the coffers of the Liberal Party and in order that the public might see that the political parties which are the mainstay of the parliamentary system are operating in a fair and honest manner. We are also concerned to see that the principle of public declaration of pecuniary interests by members of parliament and others holding office is implemented as a matter of government policy. In office a Labor Government would legislate for public funding and for a public register of pecuniary interests of members of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer the Senate to what has happened under this Government in relation to that question. In 1975 the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament was established to report on the declaration of interests of members of parliament and Ministers. It is extraordinary to see what happened to the members of that Committee. Some of them were Liberal, some National Country Party and some Labor members. Their report was unanimous. The members of that Committee included Senator Marriott, who subsequently lost pre-selection in Tasmania; Mr E. L. Robinson, who subsequently resigned from the Ministry; Senator Sheil, who was in the ministry for 24 hours, was sacked, and subsequently left this place in the context of an election; and Senator Webster, who was sent overseas to fill the post of High Commissioner in New Zealand. What an unhappy record for the members of that Committee. Of course, as in all matters, the other member who still remains is the Minister for Primary Industry , Mr Peter Nixon, the great survivor in this Parliament. Mr Nixon is still here. Let us look at what that Committee recommended to the Parliament on the sorts of decisions which ought to be taken in relation to this matter. First, the Committee recommended that members of parliament should disclose the names of all companies in which they had a beneficial interest in shares, no matter how insignificant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was saying that the Joint Committee of this Parliament, which included Mr Nixon and others, recommended a system of disclosure of financial interests of members of parliament, and particularly Ministers. When the Fraser Government came to power it did nothing about that report. When Fraser came to power in 1975 he said that under him there would be the highest standards of government in this country and nothing but the highest standards would do. At the same time he ignored this report of parliamentarians. He shelved it and appointed another committee, which was headed by Sir Nigel Bowen, a former Attorney-General, to devise a code of conduct for members of parliament. That was the Bowen Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest, and its report was tabled in Parliament on 22 November 1979. By any measure it was a mild report. Its recommendations would have imposed no great burdens on Ministers. They did not have to disclose anything publicly. All they had to do was disclose their interests to the Prime Minister. The suggestion that interests should be disclosed in secret to the Prime Minister was a typical example, if I might borrow an expression, of putting Dracula in charge of a blood bank. The report also recommended that the Prime Minister should take certain action in relation to Ministers if they did disclose such an interest. It said that a Minister should not hold shares in a company which deals with his Department. It also recommended, of course, that members of parliament also should disclose interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 22 September 1981 I asked Senator Sir John Carrick what the Government was doing about the Bowen report recommendations, which were tabled on 22 November 1979. In reply to that question, Senator Carrick said that the Government was moving to bring into the Parliament recommendations for the implementation of the Bowen report in relation to members of parliament. That indicates a glacier- like speed in dealing with this important issue, surpassed only by the speed with which this Government has dealt with the question of tax evasion. It took seven years to deal with that issue, and it has taken four years to deal with the disclosure of pecuniary interests of members of parliament. Why the great haste? It is because members of this Government, members of the Liberal Party in Australia, do not want these things disclosed, and for very obvious reasons. None of the recommendations of that report, other than this half-hearted soppy thing about a Minister reporting his financial interests to the Prime Minister, have ever been implemented. But we find Mr Nixon, the signatory of the original report, making recommendations about Murray-Goulburn Co-operative Ltd, a company in which he was a shareholder, and dealing with that matter without declaring his interest to the Prime Minister. There are numerous other examples of similar conduct by Ministers in this Government. All of these points go to the question of the integrity of the political process in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the first tasks of a Labor government, when it is elected, will be to try to restore credibility and honesty to government in Australia. That will be its very first task, because no government in this country can do anything while it is so lacking in credibility, while it is so incredible as the Fraser Government is in relation to the behaviour of its officials in respect of moneys which are raised and donated to the political party and in respect of the behaviour of its Ministers. So the first task of a Labor government will be to try to restore credibility to the whole system of government. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of public funding of political parties, I have said that we are similarly committed to the introduction of a system of public funding. In introducing such a system, we will be joining most of the major democracies of the Western world who do not find anything particularly offensive about public funding and about public disclosure of where the donations made to a political party come from. Australia will be well served if such a system is introduced in this country and it is not run away from by people like members of the Fraser Government who are concerned to protect their private financial interests rather than developing a good process of government in Australia which has the respect of the people because of its intrinsic integrity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I rise in an attempt to draw the debate back to the issue that really is before the Senate. The Australian Labor Party, in its matter of public importance, is proposing in the first place to discuss the public funding of election campaigns and the full disclosure of donations or other assistance to political parties and candidates. While I understand your decision, Mr Deputy President, in respect of the broader point that you made in regard to assistance to candidates, I believe that the essential thrust of the matter as it is spelled out relates more importantly to the public funding area and also to the disclosure of donations. It will be upon those matters that I will be concentrating most of my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button sought, in the course of his remarks, to denigrate the Liberal Party in various ways. He drew attention to matters which have occurred recently and sought to link those in some way to the electoral benefit flowing directly to the Liberal Party. One can only refute that kind of allegation. One has only to state quite clearly the code that all Liberal Party members of Parliament are bound to, that is, that no Liberal Party parliamentary member has any knowledge whatsoever of the amounts contributed to Liberal Party campaigns by any person whatsoever. It is a firm requirement that that information be not disclosed in any way to any Liberal candidate who stands for public office. That system has been laid down for a number of years. It has applied ever since I have been a member of Parliament. Certainly I have no understanding or any knowledge whatsoever of the campaign donations received by my party in South Australia or, for that matter, in Canberra, at the Federal level. I have no knowledge of funds provided by any donor, whether in my own State or anywhere else. It is certainly a clear understanding of all Liberal members of Parliament that that is the situation. It is something to which the party maintains rigid adherence. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us turn to the real issues that are before us in terms of this matter of public importance. First of all, there is the matter of public funding and how that is to be developed in any system. No information on the development of this system is provided in the statement of the matter of public importance, and no details are provided as to how it can be achieved. But let us just consider one or two of the philosophical points that are connected with this matter. First of all, it represents a direct charge on all taxpayers who may be contributing to the benefit of political parties. This means that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was making the point that freedom of choice is the fundamental issue in any democracy. That is what is under challenge when funds are being provided by the taxpayer direct to political parties. Senator Button sought to make the point that this was a well recognised practice in other countries. He did not give us any examples by which we might be able to compare Australia with those other nations. But let us take one example. Let us take the United States and the question of public funding for the election of the President. That is probably the most significant election on the world scene. The amount of money that was provided in 1980 for the election involving Mr Carter and Mr Reagan was, I think, in the order of something like $US50m. I think that a different set of circumstances applies there than in the case of parliamentary elections. It is clear that in the United States, while there have been demands for public funding of both congressional and state legislature elections, that has not come to pass for the very simple reason that in the United States a prospective president seeks to command the popular vote right across all State boundaries, right across the country. That means that he is seeking, perhaps, a plurality of something like 50 million votes. He needs a far greater appeal than a party organisation can sustain right across the nation. When we relate that to a population of something approaching 250 million people, that is a very significant consideration. It is noted that in the United States the Government has not extended public funding to parliamentary, that is congressional, or other state elections. I think it is important to draw attention to that difference. Clearly, a different set of circumstances applies there. In our country our government is formed within the Parliament, within both Houses of Parliament, and the Leader of the Government depends on the existence of a majority in his favour in the House of Representatives. That clearly is a different issue. The circumstances are different. I draw the attention of honourable senators to that because I believe it really thrusts at the heart of the very point that Senator Button was seeking to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us consider some of the other alternatives that have been developed for the Australian circumstances. First of all is the kind of indirect assistance that is given to political parties in the way of-</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator McLaren" NAMEID="4L7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLaren</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about all the Buicks on Kangaroo Island?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator McLaren would only shut up for a little while we might be able to get some facts before us. The fact is that various indirect public assistance measures are provided for political parties. We all know of the availability of free time offered by an independent broadcasting organisation, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, for each political party. Time is made available to parties which already have seats within the Parliament . That seems to be well accepted on all sides. There is, of course, the provision-without too much scrutiny-of offices and electoral assistance for senators and members of parliament, researchers, secretaries and people of that kind. There is the provision at public expense of the VIP flight for the leaders of all parties during election campaigns. Of course, there is the opportunity for people to listen to the radio and hear a public broadcast of parliamentary proceedings. We all know how much benefit that is to us, as members of parliament, in getting our message across.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another very important point in this indirect area is the very real contribution of taxpayers via the tax deduction applicable to contributions to trade unions by their members, portion of which ends up as a political levy payable to the Australian Labor Party. In that sense the ALP has a very strong advantage compared with any other political party in this country. There is a tax benefit for contributions to the ALP. There is no like provision which assists any member of the Liberal Party, the National Country Party or, as far as I know, the Australian Democrats. I think that point needs to to be made very strongly in this place. The Australian Labor Party is the only party which receives a direct contribution from the taxpayer in that sense as the law exists today. This is achieved through the indirect method-a very surreptitious method, some people might say-of a levy made on a front organisation in the form of the trade union movement. In that way the Labor Party is already benefiting. I resent strongly the kind of allegation made by Senator Button that the Liberal Party is somehow getting a benefit from funds on which tax has been avoided or which have been through some kind of laundering when the system to which I have referred operates and is known to have operated over a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many arguments against public funding of political parties and my colleagues will develop them as time goes on. However, some other points mentioned by Senator Button need to be answered as well. First and foremost, he said that an information service developed within the Government would somehow seek to assist the election of Liberal and National Country Party candidates. He referred particularly to the disclosure recently that $1.5 will be made available to the Australian Taxation Office to inform members of the public about the new taxation benefits that will be flowing to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That does not deserve any kind of answer. This flowed directly from a paper laid on the table of the House of Representatives, and I believe also this place, which clearly spelt out the need for improved information services. It highlighted the problems and difficulties that government-and I am talking of government in the generic sense, not of a particular government in the narrow sense of the word-has in getting full value for money spent on advertising and getting quality information services for the money committed to staff and other resources. Various suggestions were made in respect of the ways in which those services could be upgraded. The Government fully disclosed its reasons for taking up those suggestions which it adopted. The initiative involving the Taxation Office to which Senator Button referred is just one part of a total commitment to an improvement and upgrading information service right across the board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last financial year the total expenditure for departmental advertising arranged through the Australian Government Advertising Service was of the order of $17.5m . Among the major items in this total were $5.3m for Defence Force recruiting, $ 2.8m for loans and Australian savings bonds promotions, $700,000 for the census of 1981, $1.3m for petrol conservation campaigns-and who could deny that that is not a very logical and reasonable objective in these times of rising fuel prices ?-and $601,000 for advertising health insurance changes. That, of course, is a most reasonable thing, given the degree of change that has occurred in recent times. Roughly $700,000 was spent in respect of plant and animal quarantine, which is so vital to our primary industry, particularly at this time when it is under such pressing difficulty because of the drought. In addition, $1m was spent on campaigns connected with the International Year of Disabled Persons. Do any members of the Opposition oppose any of those expenditures? Do they say right here and now that they would campaign against those kinds of expenditures which bring to the attention of the people the most important programs of this Government relating to the welfare of the nation as a whole and the individuals who constitute it? I particularly mention that another $4m has been used in respect of Press displays and classified advertising of notices, tenders, auctions and vacant positions. I do not think that any senator or any government would disagree with that kind of expenditure. I challenge Senator Button to come back in here and claim that he would knock out all of that expenditure if, unfortunately for the people of Australia, his party became the next Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The kind of money that is being spent on advertising at the national level will , it is hoped, achieve a far more effective result in terms of getting the message across to people. I instance again the taxation advantages that will start on 1 November. Although the Labor Party has sought to impute some sinister motive to this activity, the fact is that many fairly complicated moves are involved in these new taxation measures. There is a new eligibility for home loan interest rebates. That is a most important benefit for Australians, but it is also quite complicated. It is important that Australians understand how it will work. It is important that we allocate moneys in order to educate people as to their eligibility. Would the Labor Party deny that that ought to be done? Is it not important that these things are brought to the attention of Australians so that they properly understand what their entitlements are under the law? There are other more complicated items as well which affect the taxation system. Health insurance payments will now be tax rebatable. Other items relate to investment incentives for industry. We have spoken in this place on previous occasions about other measures, all of which are of very considerable importance . </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just compare some of the expenditure on advertising made by the Labor Government to see how relevant Senator Button's argument really is. I have made my calculations rather quickly and I acknowledge that there might be some small discrepancies. But I believe them to be fundamentally sound. Let us compare in real terms the expenditure on advertising. The Labor Government in 1974-75, which was its last full year of office, spent the equivalent of $20.4m on advertising. The expenditure in 1980-81 by this Government in the same terms was $21.07m. That means there has been a very marginal rise in real terms of the order of $600,000-a very small sum when one compares the amounts of expenditures overall. However, I hasten to add that there are other issues as well. For instance, during the period of the Labor Government there was a very considerable expenditure on Press secretaries and other information systems. When this Government came to office there was a very significant decrease in the number of people employed in ministerial offices for the purposes of propagandising, as Senator Childs would have us believe. There have been considerable offsets to that $600,000 advertising rise of which we have just spoken in lower staff costs for ministerial offices than existed under Labor. It is of very significant importance for us to recall those matters when we compare the kinds arguments that are put in this place by Senator Button which seek, by way of smear, unsubstantiated rumour and allegation, to undermine the integrity of the Liberal Party and this Government. Those allegations are not justified by proper argument; colourful langauge is used to illustrate what Senator Button claims is the lack of integrity of honourable senators on this side of the chamber. That the Opposition should conduct itself in that way is resented by members on this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> One or two other points do need to be made following the honourable senator's very tiresome speech which did not touch at all on the matter of public importance in relation to the disclosure of donations to political parties. An argument is going around that there is some major advantage in a government providing funds to political parties for election purposes as opposed to private persons providing funds. I mention the point that people may see their money going into causes which offend their consciences, in fact, they would be contributing to help causes to which they had direct opposition. I believe that is a fundamental denial of democracy and the freedom of choice in this country. One has only to consider some of the issues that arise in this place upon which no doubt members of the Opposition hold very clear views in their consciences and to compare those views with the views held this side of the chamber. Would honourable senators on either side of the chamber like to see their money used in an election campaign to advance an issue in which they did not believe? This is the test of democracy and freedom of choice. This is the ultimate point at which democracy functions in this country. We need to consider that point most closely. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button referred to loopholes being found in the system and, by that means, people avoiding disclosures. There is the question of all kinds of anonymous donations, provisions of assistance in kind and so on which can avoid the system altogether. I think that what is needed more in this country is not so much regulation as such but rather a different attitude to the question of integrity in government, in political parties and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One wondered what the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) was discussing because it was not until the last few minutes of his 20-minute oration that he dealt with the subject matter which is before the Senate today; that is, the need to establish a system of public funding of election campaigns. The Minister spent most of his time defending the Government's own publicity activities rather than addressing himself to what we believe are the corrupting influences of private funding of political parties. The events and revelations of the last six weeks which have surrounded the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union have shaken the foundations of the Fraser Government and undermined any confidence which the millions of ordinary taxpayers of Australia have had in the justice and fairness of our taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen scandal after scandal, indiscretion heaped upon indiscretion and arrogant and unethical behaviour develop into a cynical abuse of power. There is a direct relationship between what has happened and the way in which the Liberal and National Country parties are funded in respect of election campaigns. The matters concerning the meat substitution racket, the Australian Dairy Corporation, medifraud, Customs impropriety and tax evasion are relevant. My intention is to make some connection between all of these factors-all of these revelations-and the nature of the conservation parties, their supporters, their ethics and their policies because the way in which the conservative parties finance their massive election campaigns is related to these matters. The leader of the conservative parties, the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, is now strutting about as the conscience of the business world. It is as if the sins of his followers will be absolved by the purity of his utterances if only we will believe in him. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the facts about the Liberal and National Country parties and how they are funded by their big business friends, their spivs, in the business world and in turn by the Australian taxpayer. That is what this debate is about. The great tenet of Liberal Party funding-it has been repeated somewhat by Senator Messner today-is that parliamentarians remain aloof from and in blissful ignorance of any donors and donations. Mr Menzies insisted on this. Eggleton and other Liberal Party bureacrats enjoy repeating it often in these sorts of debates. What absolute balderdash! Does anyone believe that large amounts of money are invested for political purposes by businesses or businessmen without the expectation of some return? Public funding, after all, is about honest funding of election campaigns. Recently in my area-in the electorate of Cook- supporters of the Liberal Party organised what they quaintly called the access club. One paid one's money, received a tax rebate and access to a couple of Ministers of the Fraser Government. No doubt that access would not be confined just to discussing personal pleasantries. Mr Tom Burrell, the Chairman of the Assembly of Australian Business Organisations, accepts the view of the Cook access club that donors to the Liberal Party should not be seen as neutral philanthropists, always ready to dip into their pockets for the cause without any desire for favours. Soon after the 1980 election Mr Burrell said:</PARA>
<PARA> If political parties are to truly represent the interests of their members and establish policies that are acceptable to them then any outside funding will significantly reduce the party's responsiveness to their members' desires. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Burrell is under no such illusions about the connection between members of the Liberal and National Country parties and the policies of their Ministers. Ironically, the outside funding to which he referred concerned public funding, the one method by which corrupting influences can actually be removed from our political institutions. That has become an urgent consideration. No one should live in a fantasy land of disbelief that the same connections are not currently being activated. the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party is in a state of excitement more akin to panic over the Costigan revelations. It is clear that that branch of the Liberal Party has been taken over by a bunch of corporate crooks. The stable door stunt of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and Mr Fraser's recently aquired sense of ethics regarding retrospectivity for tax criminals has prompted some calling in of the accounts. It is well known that enormous pressure has been applied based on past generosities and future promises. It seems that this has had some effect. We have seen the reverberations go through the Liberal Party as those who have been its supporters and its financial backers are now expressing great concern about the attempts to overcome the problems associated with tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the identities of those donors and the nature of their donations? Of course the Liberal and National Country parties do not like the names of their benefactors to get out, but it does not take an intellectual leviathan or a Philip Marlowe to know who they are. For starters, in the mid-1970s the same Mr Fraser caused the then leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Snedden, some heartburn when he did a little fund raising of his own and for his own aggrandisement. Another ex-Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon is know to have raised half a million dollars in 1972 in a last-ditch effort to stem the tide. One wonders what the interest on that investment might have cost had the Australian Labor Party not won government then. So much for distancing Ministers from donors, benefactors and supporters, as this Government's contribution to the debate suggests!</PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of money itself comes from the taxpayers, care of the taxation system and the ethics of the business world so beloved by Mr Fraser. One old and well tried method is to inflate the advertising bill to cover political donations and then claim it as a tax concession. Multi-National Rip-offs Incorporated, tells its advertising agency to increase its bill by, say, $100, 000. The agency then does $100,000 worth of free advertising for the Conservative parties and claims that as a tax deduction and, what is more, gets it-not the lousy $50 or $60 that Senator Messner suggested ordinary wage and salary earners receive in their returns. The taxpayer, therefore, is de facto funding the conservatives' election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> Another use of the tax deductible advertising technique is apparent with the infamous Bjelke-Petersen Foundation of Queensland, soon to be joined by a new fund called the National Free Foundation in New South Wales; both instruments of the National Party and its bagmen. By paying for an advertisement in the Foundation's bulletin at an exorbitant rate a company can claim such a donation as advertising expenditure and hence as a tax deduction. The Bjelke-Petersen Foundation has become one of the ugliest blots on the whole Australian democratic scene. It has reached the stage of being an embarrassment even to the Liberal Party in Queensland. The current President of that organisation, Mr Herron, has gone on record as saying that the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation is blatantly corrupt and corruptible. When I asked a question of Mr O'Reilly at the Senate Estimates Committee C hearing on Monday night he had to admit that these expenses and advertising accounts are being paid in respect of a whole number of activities of businesses and are accepted as tax deductions without question by the Australian Taxation Office. What gall then do these same people, who oppose what the Labor Party is suggesting, have in accusing the fairest, most open and most accountable of political funding procedures-public funding-of being in some way a denial of justice and democracy. It is a case of telling the biggest lie and telling it so often in the hope that eventually it will be believed. Because of the secrecy which surrounds these fund raising instruments it is impossible to ascertain how much money has been funnelled into the Liberal and National Country Parties' coffers for political purposes through these means. This also accounts for the ferocity of the conservative opposition to the public disclosure of donations. Of course it explains how the Liberal and National Country Parties are able to spend twice as much as the Labor Party in their election campaigns. Can we ascertain that these parties can therefore outspend the ALP during these elections by that ratio? That difference, using the tax deductibility system described above, is in fact made up by the taxpayers of Australia and that is de facto public funding. </PARA>
<PARA> A measure of the conservatives' ethics and respect for the law-electoral or taxation-can be gauged by their response to the new public disclosure and funding legislation in New South Wales. The Leader of the New South Wales Country Party, in attacking the legislation, listed the ways in which the law could be circumvented. These included businessmen calling donations 'public relations' and the funnelling of donations through interstate connections. What did we find a year after the New South Wales State election when that funding legislation was in operation? The New South Wales Liberal Party received most of its funding from its federal secretariat here in Canberra and, along with other methods as previewed by Mr Punch, managed to keep its donors cloaked in secrecy. I wonder how much advertising money was supplied by the taxpayer in that recent election. </PARA>
<PARA> The long-suffering taxpayer has now also been treated to the relevations about sales tax evasion being perpetrated by various crooks around Australia. As the automotive industry said through in its own spokesmen: 'Some of these people pay tax according to their level of morality'. Mr Fraser will have to have a talk to them. Yet the industry has been urging the Treasurer, Mr Howard, for many months to do something about this fraud which has cost the Australian taxpayer an estimated $250m. So far this Government has reacted in a tortoise-like fashion. Again, who are the beneficiaries of this evasion? They are accountants, lawyers, businessmen-typical Liberal Party backers; the very same people who believe that their positions are protected by supporting a Liberal Party Government. How naive one must be expected to be to think that there are not strings attached to the money that reaches the Liberal Party coffers and that those strings are not now unravelling before our eyes as a result of the actions within the Liberal- National Country Party Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest in this litany of abuse and deception is the emerging story of Medibank fraud. For years these unscrupulous members of the medical profession, who are placed to take advantage of our tax system, have been doing just that. The Australian Medical Association official report states that over $100m a year could well have been stolen from ordinary taxpayers and, like the painters and dockers, most members of the medical profession are supporters of the Liberal Party. In 1975, for example, before the election of that year, the Executive Secretary of the Australian Association of Surgeons wrote to 700 surgeons in Victoria and told them that they had to give large sums of money to the Liberal Party to protect their interests. Just to prove nothing has changed, a few weeks ago the Executive Secretary of the Australian College of Opthalmologists wrote to his colleagues in New South Wales asking for big money, again to protect what he saw as their interests, lodged as they are with the Liberal Party, with the Fraser Government. Similarly, who are the beneficiaries of the missing money of the outrageous Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd affair, where millions of dollars have been lost in a Singapore bank account?</PARA>
<PARA> These sorts of things that are happening surely point out to this Government the need to re-examine its attitude to public funding to remove once and for all such influences from the way in which governments are elected. These are the people and organisations who finance the conservative parties of this country using taxpayers' money, unknown and unseen; the multinational companies, unethical businessmen, unscrupulous doctors, the rich and the powerful and the old boys network, all working to misuse the spoils by supporting and helping to elect a government of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA> During an Estimates committee hearing a few weeks ago we were given some insight into how this Government puts aside something like $15m just for the purpose of selling its own electoral policies. Honourable senators ought to have no illusions at all that the Fraser Government, with all of its powerful and rich supporters, with all the bad smell of tax evasion and political patronage, has still to set aside in the current Estimates $1.5m to spend during November for the purpose of popularising the so-called 1982-83 Budget. I urge consideration of public funding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I can certainly understand the Opposition seeking to force on all Australians increased taxation in order to fund its election campaigns. It has been forcing certain sections of the community to do so for many years. It finds that it is on to a good thing and now wants to force all Australians, through the payment of additional taxation, to fund its election campaigns. In Australia we have a system of compulsory unionism, and many unions are affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. Thus, there is a certain compulsion upon union members, whether they be supporters of the Labor Party or not, to fund that party. Under compulsory unionism the union forces employers to agree to employ only union members, who must then pay into the Labor Party's coffers. How many parents struggling to bring up their children are now forced, whether they be socialist-minded or not, to pay for Labor Party election campaigns? I can assure the Opposition that it is completely repulsive to those who have strong anti-socialist and anti- communist feelings to be forced to fund Labor's campaigns.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a voluntary contribution at all. Members of affiliated unions are forced to contribute to the Labor Party. There is no voluntary unionism or contribution to the party in that regard; it is all compulsory. In Australia particularly, with its two parties-Labor, with its philosophy of complete socialism, and Liberal, with its philosophy of true, free democracy-we find that certain sections of the community will not under any circumstances agree to having taxes put aside in order to fund a socialist government. At what cost to the taxpayers is this to take place? The likely cost has not been mentioned by the Opposition. If we examine the only experience of the system available in Australia, that of New South Wales, we find that in the year prior to the last election $6.3m of the taxpayers' money was put aside to fund publicly that campaign. What would be the cost of a Federal campaign, conducted throughout Australia? How many extra millions would be added to the tax burden of Australians in order to fund a Federal campaign? I can assure honourable senators opposite that people who earn their money feel that they can spend it far more wisely than by putting it towards any party's campaign. If they have any doubt on that score they should ask the people. Why does it not carry out a few surveys, as certainly happened in New South Wales? A gallup poll conducted in New South Wales in November 1980 revealed that 71 per cent of those polled objected strongly to public funding, to their tax payments being used to fund any election. Again, a Sydney Morning Herald poll of May 1979 indicated that 75 per cent of the people of that State were completely opposed to the use of their money to fund a party in whose philosophy they did not believe. If the Opposition believes that it is on to such a good thing I suggest that it ask the people generally. Labor Party supporters may well go for it, but I can assure the Opposition that the swinging voters, upon whose support both it and honourable senators on this side of the chamber depend, do not go for it at all. The 75 per cent poll figure proves that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of the disclosure of interest. Senator Button seemed to devote his whole speech to a discussion of the personal interests of members of parliament. Of course, that has nothing to do with the matter before us, which refers to 'disclosure of donations, or other assistance, to political parties and candidates'. Dr Ernie Chaples, who was perhaps one of the most ardent supporters of public funding in New South Wales, following the New South Wales election presented a paper to the 24th Annual Conference of the Australasian Political Studies Association and was reported in the Australian Financial Review of 26 August, just a couple of months ago, as saying that this type of legislation is wide open to abuse; that it is not able to be implemented in a correct fashion. This is substantiated in the headlines that Senator Button so cleverly tried to avoid mentioning. I refer to the headlines in the Sydney Morning Herald following the New South Wales election which read: 'Wran vows to block Liberals' $480,000'. The accompanying article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Premier, Mr Wran, vowed yesterday to prevent the New South Wales Liberal Party receiving $484,000 for last year's election campaign, despite a decision by the Election Funding Authority clearing the way for payment. </PARA>
<PARA>It is that sort of abuse to which this kind of legislation is open. Another article, a couple of months later, read:</PARA>
<PARA> A series of letters leaked to the Herald yesterday show the State Government had made a concerted effort to prevent the New South Wales Liberal Party receiving almost $500,000 in public funding for last year's State election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have the New South Wales Government saying that elections ought to be publicly funded and then the Premier trying to deny public funding being passed to the party in opposition. That is the sort of abuse that we have learnt to expect from the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The disclosure of financial support for a party is against the privacy of interests that this Government supports. No one should be forced in this regard. That is why we have a secret election. No one should be forced to say publicly for which party he or she has voted. The secret ballot of this country is jealously guarded, yet the Opposition seeks to remove that element of secrecy. It is trying to make the people of Australia come out and say: 'We voted Liberal . We donated X dollars to the Liberal Party'. What would happen then? The unions affiliated with the Labor Party would boycott them and we would have a disgraceful situation in this country. There is no way in which honourable senators on this side of the chamber would go along with that kind of procedure. If the Leader of the Opposition believes that no discrimination would be shown towards a business that stated publicly that it supported the Liberal Party, he should think again. The unions affiliated with his party would make sure that discrimination was shown. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the disclosure portion of the matter of public importance is concerned, I say that there is no reason in the wide world why the Australian Labor Party should not make disclosure. If it is so keen on the idea, why does it not go ahead and do so? Why does not Labor disclose who supports its party? There is nothing in the wide world to stop it from providing a list. People might be interested in it. Of course, some of its supporters might be very angry and might withdraw their support, but there is nothing in the wide world to stop it from making such disclosures. If it is so keen on the idea, I ask it please to do so, there is nothing to stop it from doing that. </PARA>

The following appeared in an editorial in The Australian:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No system of public funding can be organised without denying genuine democracry . </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that those words really describe what this matter of public importance is about. No system of public funding can be organised without denying genuine democracy. Why should individual voters be denied the right and opportunity to vote with their pockets as well as their pencils? In a democratic society people should be entitled to decide how much, how little or if at all they wish to donate to a party of their choice. I believe that is the crux of the matter. As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) said earlier, the difference between the Labor Party organisation and the Liberal Party organisation is that the Labor Party's financial arrangements are run by its leader, the leader of the parliamentary wing. That is not so in the Liberal Party. The parliamentary wing of the Liberal Party has no knowledge whatsoever of donations or where they come from. That is the vital difference between the organisation of the two parties. </PARA>

I can understand the Labor Party's not believing us. It would not understand that sort of principle because it does not have it. But on this side we do have it, and it is a very genuine and very well adhered to principle. Australians live in a very jealously guarded democracy of which there are too few in the world. As I have already pointed out, apart from those members of unions affiliated with the Labor Party who are forced to contribute to Labor Party election funds, Australians have the right financially to support or otherwise the party of their political philsophy. If the Opposition wants parties and people to fund its election campaigns, I suggest that it change its policies. It should give up its socialist policies, its communist sympathies, and instead follow policies designed to strengthen a free democracy and so have greater appeal to electors. It might then find that the funds come in a little easier.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always wondered why the Liberal Party opposed so vehemently public funding. In the Canberra Times in March 1981 the Prime Minister of this country (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was reported as saying that public funding was corrupt. I wondered when Vice President Bush, a recipient of public funding, visited this country whether Mr Fraser admonished Mr Bush for being corrupt when he feted him around the countryside, at dinners at the Hilton, et cetera. I do not think he did. When Mr Fraser tours countries and lectures them on tariff policy, when he goes to the United States, Japan, West Germany, Austria, Sweden or Canada, does he also lecture them about having corrupt systems because they use public funding? Of course he does not. In 30 years' time this debate will be regarded in the same way as we regard the great Reform Bill debate of 1832 that swept away the rotten boroughs. In 30 years' time this subject will be regarded as a ridiculous thing to debate because it will be a fact of life in the next 20 or 30 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am interested that Mr Fraser has said that he will sweep the tax evaders out of the Liberal Party, especially in Western Australia. When is he going to take on the corrupt New South Wales Branch of the Liberal Party, the branch of the Liberal Party that has accepted public funding? I am sure that Senator Walters would join with Mr Fraser in a great crusade-what a fearsome duo they would be- into New South Wales to clean up that branch. It has accepted over $400,000. I ask Senator Walters whether those people are corrupt. Are they or are they not? Of course they are not. They are just opportunists. Before the last New South Wales State election we heard comments from the New South Wales Liberal Party similar to those heard today. Firstly, we heard Mr Mason, the then leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales-he was the fifth of the seven they have had in the last seven years-describe public funding as 'one of the most cold-blooded predetermined acts of a socialist party to destroy the Westminster system of government'. That is what Mr Mason said. Now, several months later, his party comes out and accepts public funding. One can draw only two conclusions: Either members of the New South Wales Liberal Party are opportunists or they are closet socialists out to destroy the Westminster system. One can choose between the two . What it really means is that the New South Wales Liberal Party never really opposed political funding but just jumped on a bandwagon, desperately trying to win some votes. A desperately unpopular party in New South Wales hoped to bolster its votes on this issue. The electors spoke; Labor won 69 seats, the Liberal Party won 14 seats and its colleagues in the National Country Party won 14 seats. The Liberal Party could not even outpoll the National Country Party in New South Wales when it campaigned on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The second argument-Senator Walters brought it up today-is that it is wrong to dip into the public purse; that to subsidise political campaigns and political parties is almost a form of stealing. This already occurs in many instances. The first person I would like to quote on this is the treasurer of the Victorian Liberal Party. He said that being out of State government cost the Liberal Party $2m. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> For years the State director has been seeking the financial resources to strengthen the secretariat's services in research, intelligence and communications. The funds have not been available to do this. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Peter Derham said:</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we were in Government in Victoria, the Party placed its reliance in these areas in the parliamentary party. This of course is no longer possible. </PARA>
<PARA>So they were using the Victorian taxpayers' money to subsidise the Liberal Party in that State. One has only to look at the Federal Government, at the way it dips into the public purse to subsidise its party and its campaigns. This year the Government Information Unit will cost $1m of taxpayers' money in political propaganda. As has already been mentioned, $1.5m has been set aside in the Treasury for shonky publicity campaigns leading up to an election. Another $300, 000 is being spent on surveys. It is only because of the diligence of the Labor Party in the Estimates committees that those surveys are now becoming public. They would have been used for party political purposes. Of course, the Liberal Party uses staff, VIP aircraft and Commonwealth cars when it is campaigning. So public money is going into political campaigns-much to the disadvantage of the Labor Party or any Opposition party because the Government takes the lion's share of it. It is not right to say that this would be dipping into the public purse for the first time. It is happening at the moment. As well as those that have already been alluded to, various fund raising schemes, especially those used in New South Wales, use tax deductibility to get money into the Liberal Party. They run bodgy dinners that businessmen write off in their taxes and then the taxpayers pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters raised points about the unions. What about the companies that kick in money to the Liberal Party? How do they pay for it? They put up their prices and the rest of the community pays. It is exactly the same as any union. The worst example of pillage of the public purse by government comes from Victoria. I do not know whether any senators here saw the new directions policy launched by the late Liberal Government in December 1980. It was the most blatant political campaign I have ever seen. It was only a political campaign. It cost $165,000 in about two weeks to promote the Liberal Party in that State. Then $2.1m was allocated to other peripheral advertising leading up to the State election. What did the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal think of that particular advertising campaign? It banned it during the election period so it must have been political. One cannot claim that the Government was trying to extol the virtues of government policy. It was political advertising and those advertisments were eliminated because of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The third major objection the Liberal Party has is that it likes the voluntary donation system. I ask everyone in the Senate: Why do people donate money to political parties? The answer from across the way was that they do so from a sense of altruism, of public mindedness. People donate money because they believe that political parties should have the right to operate in a free environment and all that sort of rubbish. If we ask some of those who donate money to political parties, like Ted Vibert, who has been in the news a lot recently, they will tell us why. They donate it as a bit of an arm twist, politically. From my point of view, as a poker machine person, it is a bit of a political arm twist to politicians. That is why they make the donations. Do donations influence the Liberal Party? In a copy of the Sydney Morning Herald last year, the following appeared:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, has been warned by major manufacturing interests who are vital Liberal Party donors that their funds will be withdrawn if the Federal Government cuts tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> One Liberal Party source told the Herald yesterday that the interests involved were 'six figure' donors to the party and came from the 'backbone' of the party' s financial base. </PARA>
<PARA>There were the donors warning the Government to take political action or they would withdraw their funds. </PARA>

I also read in the Sydney Morning Herald the following statement in a biography of the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon-one of those chummy articles:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Which Liberal Ministers went out chasing funds? Probably incompentent ones because Nixon beat them to it. Is the Government going to criticise the National Country Party for not having its ethics of having nothing to do with the money? Of course Liberal Ministers go out and chase money. If honourable senators want further proof of that, they should listen to Mr Leo Hawkins, the former State Secretary of the Liberal Party in Victoria. On Nationwide three years ago he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Now I think it's quite wrong for the Prime Minister, the Premier, other leaders to have to go through the sort of antics that are required to lever money out of people in the community who've got relatively large sums to give.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, they do not tell Senator Walters. Why is the Liberal Party opposing public funding? It likes the status quo. The Liberal Party likes the status quo that allows it to outspend the Australian Labor Party by three to one in every election. It likes the status quo that allows it to outspend the Australian Democrats by at least 10 to one at every election. When the boot is on the other foot the Liberals squeal. When the National Party came up with $900,000 in the last State election in Queensland the then Director of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Stephen Litchfield, objected and said it was a terrible thing. Of course the National Party had its $900,000 because it is funded by the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation, the most shonky fund in this country through which political favours are done in return for money coming back in. The Liberal Party knows that is true. It knows there is no insulator there. What price is a knighthood in Queensland? I believe it is $100,000. That is the sort of fund raising scheme that operates in Queensland to bring in money to help support the conservative parties of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we come to the bottom line, the Liberal Party does not really oppose public funding; it opposes disclosure. That is where the action is; that is where the Liberal Party really takes a strong line. It opposes disclosure because it knows that once firms are named as having donated money to the Liberal Party a Liberal Party government will not be able to do them any more favours. We should not fall for the ridiculous argument of union retribution or anything else. That is the reason the Liberal Party opposes disclosure. If we had disclosure we would not have to find out from the courts that a Mr Gale, from the Gollin group, gave $25,000 to the Liberal Party and substantial aid to the Prime Minister when he was in Opposition. We know Mr Gale will not be around as a Liberal Party bagman because he has another 10 years to do, after being convicted of embezzlement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party does not claim to be totally clean. I think the lowest point in Labor Party history was the Iraqi breakfast when the Labor Party tried to borrow overseas money to pay for its election debts. None of us in the Labor Party is proud of that. It is a consequence of not having public funding. The National Country Party is not particularly clean, though I note its bagman should be out just in time for the next Federal election if it is held next year . That will be a great relief to the members of that party. If we had public funding it would also be possible to avoid illegal activities, such as when Mr McDonald, the then leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, had to go to illegal gambling nights to raise money for the party. I urge all members of the Senate that it is time we had public funding. It will clean up election campaigns and will remove all suspicion that political parties are responsive to their donors. It will mean that, with the escalating costs of elections, political parties will not have to sell their souls in response to donations. That time has come in other countries, it has come in New South Wales and it is time it came in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a very valuable matter of public importance brought forward by Senator John Button, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for a system of public funding of election campaigns and full disclosure of donations, or other assistance, to political parties and candidates. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats support every word in that statement and we have embodied almost those words in our policy documents. That was done by a vote of all members of the Australian Democrats, and I might say that it was a unanimous vote. The last weeks of political life in this country have been dominated by continuing revelations of tax frauds, from the report of the Costigan Royal Commission of Inquiry on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, the McCabe-Lafranchi report and other reports. It has been made abundantly clear that the tentacles of these fraudulent operators and promoters have reached and are reaching well into our political structure. We have read novels and seen documentaries about how organised crime has infiltrated the political mechanisms of the United States of America. We did not take that warning, and the Liberal Party and the National Country Party today are not taking that warning. They still oppose the public funding of political parties and elections and the full disclosure of donations. In other words, they are leaving the way totally open for the shonky operator, for the white collar criminal, for organised crime-without becoming too emotional, for the Mafia which is well established in Australia-to make substantial donations to political parties in this country. Since the formation of the Australian Democrats in 1977 we have had a firm written policy on this matter. It is:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. A public electoral fund should be established to finance candidates, parties and elections. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The amount which candidates and parties spend on campaigns should be kept within strict limits set prior to each campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. All donations or assistance valued at more than $2,000 to any candidate or party should be capable of public disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA>That is our policy and we have stuck to it. I would be sympathetic to the view that, if persons because of altruism want to give $100, $200 or $500 or whatever to a political party, they should be protected, if they want to be protected, by not having their names associated with the particular political party. What we are saying is that people who make these non-insignificant donations to political parties should be allowed to remain anonymous. We say that any donation over $2,000, which we would regard as significant, should be capable of public disclosure. A political party may be asked at any time by the Press-and the Democrats are-whether it has received any donations over $2,000, and if so, whether it could provide details. We have a policy of open disclosure in regard to that. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe this position has been clearly vindicated by the scandals exposed by the Costigan Royal Commission. An examination of those revelations shows that the system does need protecting. Prominent Liberals, particularly those involved in fund raising for the Liberal Party, have been named in the Costigan and McCabe-Lafranchi reports. I am not suggesting that the entire Liberal Party is financed by ill-gotten gains coming from tax rorts or criminals. What I am saying, however, is that I am not prepared to believe that none of it came from people who might be involved in bottom-of-the-harbour tax avoidance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an old saying that not only must justice be done but also it must be seen to be done. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) is an honest man. If I asked him now to say 'I can guarantee that not one cent has been received by the Liberal Party over the last five years from any promoter of a tax fraud', he could not do it. Of course he could not do that. I would not expect him to. He might not even know; but he could not do it. I should have thought that that is not good enough for the people. They would want to know that the Liberal Party which presently governs this country did not receive one cent from white-collar criminals, from organised crime or from the Mafia. I should have thought that that knowledge is essential if people are to have confidence in their political parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sydney Technical College put out a report last week entitled 'Marketing and Political Parties, 1972-82'. In that report it is indicated that a minimum amount of $20m has been secretly given to the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the Australian Labor Party in the last 10 years. I need only to mention that figure to indicate the kind of muscle and influence that can be exerted by the donors of that $20m on those political parties. The New South Wales Liberal Party President, Mr John Valder, recently indicated that a $50,000 donation had been explicitly threatened by the Government's desire to pursue retrospective tax legislation. That gentleman raised $2m in three or four months. He must be a fantastic fund raiser. He is an honest man in that he has stated that he has been threatened by prospective donors that if the Government does something, $50 ,000 will not be forthcoming. He is also honest enough to make this shocking statement:</PARA>
<PARA> A lot of businesses make you get down on your knees for donations and sometimes . . . there is a high price for getting donations. </PARA>
<PARA>What does that statement-'There is a high price for getting donations'-mean? It was made by Mr John Valder, the present Liberal Party President in New South Wales. Of course, it means that if one takes the bag around and gets substantial donations from multinationals, from oil companies or wherever, they ask a price for those donations. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give an indication of what I mean. Is the Minister for Veterans' Affairs now prepared to say: 'I can guarantee that the multinational oil companies operating in this country have not given one dollar to the Liberal Party over the past five years'? Of course he cannot do that. The fact is that they are notorious world wide for corrupting political parties. They even made fools of themselves in Italy a few years ago by denying that they gave any money to political parties. They were exposed by a congressional inquiry. It was found that, by a mistake in the computer, they had given $80m to the Communist Party of Italy. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Fife, announced that there would be 100 per cent divorcement from oil companies owning service stations; in other words, legislation would be brought in, made retrospective to 30 October 1978, so that no oil company could own a petrol service station. It was a promise backed by Cabinet, backed by the whole Ministry and backed by every member of the Liberal Party and the Country Party in the party room. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was made with absolutely no qualifications. In fact the Minister said that he would make the legislation retrospective to 30 October. When the legislation was introduced in 1980, there was only a 50 per cent divorcement, which was a laugh. I allege that the multinational oil companies in this country gave over $1m to the Liberal Party during that time. I have figures to suggest that that can be proven. Is there any connection between the two? I allege that the Liberal Party receives about $1m per year in secret donations. That can be easily worked out. Honourable senators should do their sums. They should multiply the membership fee by the number of members and figure out how much it costs the party to run its secretariat, to place advertisements in newspapers and whatever. There is at least-I am erring on the side of conservatism-$1m unaccounted for per year. In an election year it is about $3m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where does the $3m come from? What sort of pressure and muscle do the people making those secret donations exert on the Liberal Party? Does the Labor Party receive money from the trade union movement? Of course it does, and it admits that it does. I do not know what the figure is. The Labor Party receives about $ 750,000 or $1m per year from the trade union movement. It is courageous enough and honest enough, however, through its leaders and its present Federal president, to have said 'We do not want a bar of this. We can be a better party if we do not have to rely on support from an outside organisation such as a trade union'. At least Mr Neville Wran has put his legislation where his mouth is and has brought in public funding for political parties in New South Wales. What did the Liberal Party do then? It said that it would make the issue the biggest one in the campaign. It was not going to take a cent of this filthy money, this public funding. But what is it doing now? Does it have its hands out crawling after the Treasury in New South Wales asking for a handout? Of course it does. One wonders where the principle lies. </PARA>
<PARA> Like all decent Australians, I have been disgusted by the way in which the poker machine lobbies have been handing out thousands of dollars to political parties in Queensland and elsewhere. Are we not disgusted at the way in which the Nugan Hand organisation dispensed largesse among the political parties in this country? Are we not disgusted with the way in which the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation operates in a scandalous way in Queensland? Is this the way in which we are to get honest decent government in this country? The public funding of elections and candidates is common practice in many countries, such as West Germany, Sweden, Canada and Japan, among others. The United States subsidises the nominations and general election phases of its presidential campaigns. I compliment the Wran Government on its courage. The cost of funding election campaigns is 27c per voter per year-the cost of one postage stamp. Despite its easy acquiescence in taking the money, the Liberal Party is still keen to flout the law and avoid public disclosure of its donors. </PARA>
<PARA> How about this for hypocrisy on the part of the Liberal Party? I should like the Minister to answer if I misrepresent him. The Liberal Party advises its donors in New South Wales to send their money to a Canberra-based free enterprise foundation, which then forwards the money to the Liberal Party Federal Secretariat, which in turn passes it back to Sydney-thus avoiding all the New South Wales public disclosure provisions. All this is openly promoted and condoned by the Liberal Party. There is only one word for that-shonky. I should like the Minister at the table to deny that. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people object and say that they do not want to give money to any political party, particularly one that they oppose; they do not want parties to be publicly funded. I make three points. Such people are already subsidising political parties. As Leader of my party, I have been approached about substantial donations-$50,000 and $100,000. I have said 'Thank you very much, but you do know that we have under our constitution an obligation to disclose that donation if requested'. They then run for cover. They say 'We are sorry; we did not know that. The deal is off'. But then they return and say 'Can we not pay your printing costs, up to $50,000 or $100,000?' We say no, because if we take that sort of money or allow that to be done, we are in their debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Could not people, when putting in their income tax returns, state their option of to which political party they want a proportion of their taxes to be given? Or it could be done on a prescribed formula as per the votes at the last election. Something needs to be done to clean up the kind of corruption-I use that word advisedly-that exists in this country with the payment of money to political parties. Let us bring it out into the open; let us have public funding and let the public know where it comes from. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Senate is discussing the following matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for a system of public funding of election campaigns and full disclosure of donations, or other assistance, to political parties and candidates. </PARA>
<PARA>As might have been suspected-I think very regrettably-the debate has slipped down the line into a fairly emotional discussion in which all sorts of slush allegations and references to Mr Costigan and so forth have been bandied about across this chamber. It is a shame that it has developed into that sort of discussion because the matter generally under discussion is of great importance and it is an area to which Australians in this free country should devote a great deal of their attention and considered thought. I thought it was a pity in the very early stages of the debate that the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Button, who generally has a measure of humour and indeed sometimes a touch of logic in what he says, should have concentrated his performance on a heap of more or less slush allegations. Even Senator Button became somewhat emotional in this very interesting and important discussion. He certainly avoided reference to the fact that the Liberal Party decision in New South Wales was a pragmatic decision that seeks to abolish, when it has the power so to do, the sort of public funding that has been established by the Wran Government in that State. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MQ7">Senator SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and it is taking the money on what I described as a pragmatic decision. I think the honourable senator would agree. I think he would also agree that it is a pragmatic decision and probably from time to time the honourable senator is forced to take such a decision himself. Since Senator Chipp mentioned the matter I find that a poll, which was taken nationwide by the Age in April 1979, reported that 77 per cent of Australian Democrats opposed public funding. Maybe the honourable senator has changed his mind but that is the information I have before me today and it reminds me of the other matter that he mentioned which interested me a great deal. Senator Chipp mentioned that there should be a limit of perhaps $2,000 and beyond that amount or some sort of revelation should be made as to the source of the fund. I imagine that in that circumstance any number of donations-human beings being what they are-could be made at a figure slightly less than that amount. So there are great problems in trying to put guidelines and restrictions on this sort of legislation. Senator Gietzelt spent most of his time-I thought that today he did not read his speech as well as he usually does--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Robertson" NAMEID="OP7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OP7">Senator Robertson</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MQ7">Senator SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is only an observation. Senator Gietzelt spent a great deal of his time on the Costigan report on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. He mentioned one being a political philanthropist if one gave money to a particular political organisation. Political organisations basically establish and promote a political philosophy. Surely it is in order in a free society that someone with a real and proper measure of secrecy, as applies to the ballot by which we elect governments, should be able to support financially those entities which seek to provide and promote the political philosophies and the socio-economic circumstances that they believe are best for their own country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Robert Ray, when speaking on this matter today-I think Senator Chipp mentioned it too-said that Vice President Bush was the beneficiary of public funding in the United States. Of course that is so but it is slightly different from the public funding that we envisage where one takes X number of millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds. As I understand public funding in the American presidential situation it is public funding that comes from a tax credit fund which is purely voluntary and quite different from a deduction of funds from public revenue. Indeed, Senator Robert Ray referred also to the Government Information Unit and thought that $1m-that was the figure he cited-was too much money for it to be spending on whatever information it sought, and I believe quite properly sought, to extend to the Australian electorate. Yet in my State of New South Wales, from memory the amount spent largely in the field of information in the Premier's Department has increased, in five or six years or however long it is that Mr Wran has been the Premier, from between $4m and $5m to almost $40m. So I would hope that considerable Government information is being extended or else there is a large measure of inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the subject of the debate and briefly go over the propositions that we should be considering because the funding of political parties has always been and always will be a perennial problem. I believe that it is a perennial problem which we do not have any right to solve by asking taxpayers to bear the brunt. That is not the answer. Maybe socialists have little or no difficulty in moving the burden of cost to the shoulders of the taxpayer but it is certainly my belief-it is the belief of the Government-that it is not the taxpayers' responsibility to fund political entities to help them develop their policies or indeed, more importantly, to help them gain the Treasury benches in any State or the Commonwealth of Australia. That is the job for the political entity itself and for the people who belong to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this debate addresses itself to the question of whether funding should be public or whether it should be the concern of individuals and political entities , the question can be asked: What should funding do? Clearly, funding should enable the promotion with clarity of the issues and the solutions to various political problems and it should convey those matters to the electorate so that the electorate, having the determination and the capacity to analyse them, can come to sensible and responsible conclusions. That is what funding is all about, and that surely should be the responsibility of the people who decide on these problems as they affect the socio-economic climate, the people who seek to gain office in this country and therefore the capacity to implement those views. </PARA>
<PARA> A political party obviously seeks to implement its own political philosophy which it has sought to establish over a long period. Sometimes it has developed and evolved over decades or even longer. That party must promote and argue its own cause with the society that it seeks to establish and represent. The taxpayer, I suggest, has absolutely no responsibility to take part either in the establishment of that philosophy or indeed in its promotion. That is the basic circumstance which we are discussing this afternoon. Political parties are beholden to a view and, I believe, having become the holders of a specific view, they should then seek to regularise their capacity or the sources that they may have of funds to establish, develop and promote that view. It is not the province-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MQ7">Senator SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about taxpayers as a whole. I do not believe that it is the province of the taxpayer to promote Senator Chipp's philosophy or mine. It is as simple as that, and I think it is fundamental to a discussion of the matter we have before us this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another interesting view with which I think we should concern ourselves is that if political philosophy or belief is to be effective, if it is to generate an enthusiasm, if it is to develop, then it will be much more likely to do so if it does it on its own feet and is concerned with the efficiency, the effectiveness, of its development and promotion. As Senator Walters indicated earlier today, the sort of funding suggested may run into a significant amount of money. If it runs into $6m in New South Wales it could, I suppose, run into $30m or $40m for Australia as a whole. So it is a significant amount of money and it should not be the responsibility of the Australian taxpayer to provide that sort of money and probably, by doing so, bring about the inefficiencies and ineffectiveness that could well be a corollary of that solution, if it were a solution at all. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of points have been made in regard to disclosure. It seems to me unnecessary and indeed quite wrong that it should be a necessary part of a gift or the giving of finance to a political party that the source should be disclosed. That is an interference with the concept of the secret ballot. It is an interference, indeed, with the civil liberties of this community. Surely there is no need to disclose a contribution which may or may not be accepted by a political entity to help it promote and develop the sorts of circumstances it seeks to develop and promote in the community in which it exists. </PARA>
<PARA> As time is moving by swiftly, I conclude my remarks by saying that I believe it is a great shame that this afternoon a measure of emotionalism and slush allegations have superseded what this discussion should have been about, that is , a responsible attitude to the funding of political parties, the method of their funding, and whether, and I believe this is absolutely fundamental, that funding is the responsibility of all taxpayers. Whether or not it is the philosophies of a communist party, of a fascist party, of all sorts of grey areas that are being promoted, or not, it is a question of whether the Australian taxpayer should be involved in that sort of promotion or whether those who establish and believe in such a philosophy should be the people who are responsible for promoting it.

An article appeared in the Canberra Times on Wednesday, 29 September 1982, entitled 'Senate Committee Report-Tasmanian power ''oversupply'' seen'. The first sentence of the article read:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A confidential report prepared for the Senate Committee inquiring into south- west Tasmania has told the Committee that the forecast demand for electricity use by the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission is too high. </PARA>
<PARA>It was stated in the article that the report was 'prepared by the McLachlan Group', a firm of management consultants and covered 'electrical-energy demand'. The use of quotations from the report confirmed that the author of the article had access to the report of McLachlan Group Pty Ltd dated 9 June 1982 on electrical energy demand. </PARA>
<PARA> The McLachlan Group Pty Ltd was commissioned by the Committee to prepare, among other things, a report on the demand for electricity in Tasmania. Its report was received in June. Neither the Senate nor the Committee has authorised the disclosure or publication of any part of the McLachlan Group report of 9 June 1982. I have received assurances from the Secretary to the Committee that neither the staff of the Committee nor the consultants were responsible for the disclosure of the report to any other person. I am fully satisfied with those assurances. The Committee was concerned that the disclosure of a Committee document occurred, and it resolved that the matter should be drawn to the attention of the Senate by way of this statement rather than by proceeding in any more formal way or requesting the Senate to take any specific action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Bill before the Senate seeks to appropriate and pay to the States $457m for general purpose capital grants. Those payments are not repayable. The Bill also seeks to authorise additional funds from the States' general loan funds to be allocated for housing should the States so request. Some $65m of the States' general loan funds was, by agreement at the Premiers Conference in June, allocated or earmarked for housing. The total payments, of both grants and concession interest rates, to the States and territories for this year, if I have interpreted the figures correctly, will be $333m, a figure which could conceivably be increased if the States request that additional general purpose loan funds be earmarked for housing and paid in accordance with the provision in this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The figure of $333m is considerably more than was paid last year. However, it should be noted that last year, and indeed in a couple of previous years, the figures were extraordinarily low by long term standards. Indeed, it is indicated on page 136 of current Budget Paper No. 7 that in current value dollars the absolute amount of money-perhaps this is the best way of putting it-has declined from $335m to $318m between 1978-79 and 1981-82. In real terms, of course, the decline has been in the vicinity of 40 per cent. Over the longer period the decline in funds made available to housing is even greater. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps more important than the payments to the States is the payments to the States less repayments from the States for loans previously advanced for housing -in other words, net payments to the States for the purposes of public housing. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a small table, previously incorporated in the House of Representatives Hansard by Mr Uren, which compares the figures for 1974-75 and 1982-83 in 1982-83 prices.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps one should acknowledge that the Opposition fully supports the Government decision to increase marginally in real terms the amount of money made available to the States for public housing this year as compared with last year. We believe, however, that it should go a great deal further and it should do so for these reasons: Firstly, because there is a growing need for welfare housing, associated with rising unemployment, among other things; secondly, because there is a real long term need for a higher level of housing construction than we have at the moment or than we have had for the last couple of years. The Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry estimates a continuing need into the late 1980s for 160,000 new units to be constructed each year. The most recent figures on both building commencements and building approvals-they are suprisingly close together-suggest that the current level of activity would provide only 110,000 units. The third reason why there should be greater expenditure on housing construction generally, and on public welfare housing in particular, is that this industry has a very great employment generating potential. It is labour intensified and its import requirement is extremely low. It therefore has a high domestic multiplier and, unlike some other measures of economic stimulation which could substantially leak into imports, exacerbating an already catastrophic deficit on current account, there would be little leakage of housing construction into imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can give an example of one particuarly inept supposed method of stimulating the economy which has an extremely high leakage into imports. I refer to the decision which was announced, I believe in June, to allow farm machinery to be depreciated over three years instead of over five years as was previously the case. This will encourage farmers to purchase machines with an even greater degree of surplus capacity. They will be able to purchase larger and more expensive machines which are more likely to be imported. The propensity to import farm machinery is already in the vicinity of 40 per cent. That will not apply if additional funds are diverted into housing construction as an economic stimulus. That sort of leakage will not take place. Therefore, the domestic mulitplier will be higher and it will not exacerbate the very serious deficit on current account which we have this year and which we have had for the previous two years. </PARA>
<PARA> The need to stimulate housing construction is there. The means of stimulating housing construction is also there. The only obstacle to a greater stimulation of housing construction is the policies of this Government. It is most appropriate, for a number of reasons, that the primary attention to stimulating housing construction should go through the public sector. Firstly, it is more likely to be effective than indirect measures aimed at the private sector. Secondly, a greater number of people are either homeless or have inadequate accommodation because of rising poverty in the community. Thirdly, other arrangements, particularly the taxation system, discriminate heavily against those who rent as those who purchase and in particular those who purchase to rent to others. I will say more about that shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is correct that some publicly financed housing is not recorded as public housing and certainly is not public welfare housing. For example, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) has a 45-year government loan on his second house in Canberra at a rate of interest of 4 3/4 per cent. He gave that to himself in 1964. That is not recorded as public housing. Eighty-four per cent of the original capital still has to be repaid. This raises the question as to whether it is fair for a loan at 4 3/4 per cent interest to be provided to the Deputy Prime Minister for his second house in Canberra. Given the recent declaration of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that fairness to all Australians was to be the paramount principle guiding this Government in the future, I wonder how long it will take the Prime Minister to take some action to remove that anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA> It was revealed last week that in 1972 Sir Alan Westerman gave himself a 3 per cent loan from the Australian Industry Development Corporation on a house that he already owned. Sir Alan had a close association, as a senior bureaucrat over several decades, with senior National Country Party Ministers. The ethics of the National Country Party apparently rubbed off on to Sir Alan. In granting himself that 3 per cent loan from the AIDC, of which he was Chairman in 1972, he followed the moral lead provided by Mr Anthony with whom he had had associations as a senior bureaucrat in the first place and a senior Minister in the second place. As has been reported, Sir Alan repaid that loan in 1977 or thereabouts. It has been reported also that the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, some months ago repaid a similar loan which he granted to himself in 1970. As a passing observation it could be said that of those three people only Mr Anthony has yet to repay the loan. He must be the only man in history with a thicker hide than Mr Nixon. It was also revealed yesterday that employees of the Reserve Bank of Australia, who do not have the sorts of incomes which most people would regard as making them welfare cases, receive loans from the Reserve Bank at an interest rate of 6 per cent. What we need is less publicly financed housing of this type for the more fortunate groups in society-indeed, I would say that we really need none at all-and more directed to the needy. </PARA>
<PARA> The case, on equity grounds, for directing greater public funds into housing for the needy is especially strong because the tax system operates in favour of landlords or lessors and against occupier-buyers and renters. In one case which has been brought to my attention a house with a $3m mortgage is owned by a company. The interest payment on the $3m mortgage, in round figures, is half a million dollars a year. The house is rented by the company to its managing director, who also owns the company, for $200 a week, or just over $10,000 a year. As a result of that arrangement the company claims as a deduction from taxable income an interest payment amounting to half a million dollars and declares as income $10,400, which is that which is paid by the managing director to the company for living in a house which is ostensibly a company house but which is, of course, owned by the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> In another case, a house at 18 Richardson Avenue, Claremont, in Western Australia, which was occupied by the owner until January 1981, had a mortgage of $300,000 taken out on it in February 1981. That was the first of three mortgages taken out on the house. A further quarter of a million dollars was taken out in April 1981 and a further quarter of a million dollars was taken out in April 1982. All the loans were obtained from the Perth Building Society, at commercial or, arguably, slightly above commercial rates of interest. By April 1982 the house had a total mortgage of $800,000 and an interest payment of $125,000 a year, all of which was deductible from the income tax of the owner because the house was let. I do not know at what figure the house was let. That figure-less costs associated with the letting and maintenance of the house-would be assessed as taxable income in the hands of the owner of the house. That letting figure, or rent, certainly would not be anywhere near $2,400 a week, which is what it would have to be for the taxable income received for the house to cancel out the taxable deduction gained from the interest payment. I have the mortgage documents for the house in question, which I will seek leave to table in a moment. I should mention that the house in question is owned by Sir Victor Garland, who occupied it until he went to London as Australian High Commissioner in January 1981, when it was rented by Mr Holmes a Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The third of these mortgage documents bears on the second last page the signatures of Sir Victor Garland and his wife Lynette, witnessed by the official secretary of the London High Commission, who appears to be a Mr G. Gibson, with the stamp of the Australian High Commission appended to it. At approximately the same time as those additional mortgages were being taken out, Sir Victor was buying other property, some of it directly adjacent to the 18 Richardson Avenue address, one unit in another part of Perth and some land at Toodyay in the Avon area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was putting an equity argument, Mr Acting Deputy President, and pointing out that the existing taxation laws can be used by landlords who rent in a way which gives them very significant advantages over either those who are renting-the tenants-or over those who are attempting to purchase the houses in which they live. The basis for that very significant advantage landlords have is that the interest payments are tax deductible even though a very large component of the interest paid is compensation for inflation. I could explain that in greater detail but I think that is sufficient to make the point. That because the taxation system discriminates very heavily in this way, the case for providing public assistance through public housing for the genuinely needy is to that extent strengthened. In the case I have just mentioned the mortgages were taken out on a property which was previously encumbered, to only an insignificant degree, immediately following the letting of the property to a tenant; in other words, immediately following the creation of the conditions under which the interest payments on the mortgage on the house would be deductible from taxable income. The house in question was sold last month for $ 850,000, an amount which, I might add, barely exceeded the mortgages registered against it, which totalled $800,000. I understand the sale was virtually mandatory because the previous owner had made a very large payment which he had not anticipated. I seek leave to table the mortgage documents to which I have referred.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summary, on both macro-economic grounds-that is, the grounds that further expenditure on public housing would be a highly effective means of stimulating growth at a time when growth is desperately needed-and on equity grounds, there is a compelling argument, indeed an overwhelming argument, for the allocation of greater funds to this area of expenditure. It is for those reasons that the Australian Labor Party has a firm policy which commits it to a substantial increase in the funds provided to the States, they being the bodies responsible for welfare housing construction, and of course other measures which would stimulate the private sector as well. Given that the Commonwealth Government, although not having direct control over housing expenditure by the States, has a higher degree of control over public housing expenditure than it does over private housing expenditure, we believe, leaving aside the absolute amounts between the public and the private sector, that it is in the area of public housing where the Commonwealth's degree of responsibility is greatest. We welcome the small increase in real terms compared with the previous year that the Bill before the Senate provides. We note and deplore that that amount, although slightly larger than the amount provided in the previous year, is well below the amounts which were provided eight or ten years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States (Works and Housing) Assistance Bill 1982 has, as the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) pointed out in the second reading speech, two main purposes. They are to authorise the payment in the coming year of general purpose capital grants to the State totalling in the order of half a billion dollars and to authorise the payment in the coming year of amounts that the States and the Northern Territory may choose to nominate from their current year Loan Council borrowing programs to be provided for welfare housing at concessional loan terms and conditions. It must also be noted, however, that firstly the States are free to apply those grants as they choose, a fact which the Minister did point out; and secondly, the conversion of part of the States and the Northern Territory Loan Council programs is left entirely to the discretion of the individual State governments, or the Northern Territory Government as the case may be, or, as the Minister put it, according to their wishes and priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst I am sure that nobody in this chamber would disagree that State governments should always be given flexibility to spend the grants which come from the Federal Government in whatever way best suits them, since they presumably have a better idea of what the needs are, I believe we should also recognise that at least some State governments appear to be less concerned with the poor and the helpless in society than others. In recognising that we should take care at this level that we do not abrogate our own responsibility to people in the welfare area. </PARA>
<PARA> To claim, as this Government has done, that it has substantially assisted the States by providing increased funding for public or welfare housing is, I believe, nonsense. The much-vaunted 5 per cent increase on last year's figure is really a mirage. In real terms, the Government's commitment to welfare housing has hardly risen at all. If we look at the needs in the housing area we see that it has actually fallen. Not only has the so-called increase not even kept pace with inflation but also the amounts provided are considerably less than the provision made some years ago. In addition, they fail to take into account the increasing demands on public or welfare housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I had the delightful opportunity, Mr Acting Deputy President, of visiting your State, particularly the northern areas, where I was looking at something quite outside the field of welfare housing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are delightful people, although some, as honourable senators will see in a moment, are in straitened circumstances. While I was there my attention was drawn to an article in the Mackay Daily Mercury concerning a Mackay family which found itself, not quite overnight but it might just as well have been overnight, homeless. That article which appeared last Wednesday, was headed 'Mackay family without a home'. It made the following point:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Mackay woman with six children, aged between seven months and 11 years, is one of the homeless families searching for accommodation in Mackay. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Narelle Young has been living with neighbours and in a caravan for three weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out at this stage that Mrs Young is one of the quarter of a million people in Australia who are presently living in mobile homes. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite assistance from neighbours, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Legal Aid, State Government Community Health Services, Mackay real estate agents, Housing Commission representatives and others the family is still living in a small folding caravan at Central Caravan Park. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not particularly addicted to travel by caravan or camping out, but the concept of a family comprising husband, wife and six children, whose ages range between seven months and 11 years, living in a folding caravan at Central Caravan Park does not seem to be particularly appealing. Mrs Young had been attempting, with some vigour, to find alternative accommodation after the home that she had been renting was sold out more or less from underneath her. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> She said that one of her main problems had been finding a house that would accommodate six children. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . She put her name down for a Housing Commission home in February this year.</PARA>
<PARA> A spokesman for the Minister for Works and Housing, Mr C. A. Wharton, said that even the priority list in Mackay was extensive. There was little that could be done, as Mrs Young's name was not on the priority list. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what one has to do in Queensland to get on the priority list but apparently Mrs Young did not qualify. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Ruth Atkinson said the St Vincent de Paul Society had been trying to get a Housing Commission home for Mrs Young, but because she did not have an eviction notice she had to go onto the normal waiting list. </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably in Queensland an eviction notice is required before one gets on the priority list. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The St Vincent de Paul Society had offered help of food and clothing. </PARA>
<PARA>Mackay Life Line and the Mackay branch of the St Vincent de Paul Society had obviously exhausted all of their resources as far as helping Mrs Young was concerned. Of course, such organisations should not in any instance be responsible entirely for solving the welfare and housing problems of people in Mr and Mrs Young's position. These people have been caught up in a low wage, high family cost, rental payment, deposit chasm, circle. As I have said before in debates in this place, the problem of the increasing demand for public housing is almost entirely due to Government policies in other areas, particularly its commitment to the deregulation of interest rates and the effect of this on young couples with or without children who aim to fulfil what is generally accepted as the great Australian dream of owning their own home. Not only are people forced into attempting to bridge an ever-increasing deposit gap but also constantly increasing interest rates mean constantly increasing repayment rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Whereas 10 years ago, when I first brought my home, one could be fairly assured that the interest rate with which one started would at least be maintained at the same level for a number of years, interest rates now seem to change almost on a month by month basis, so that people are not even in a position to budget accurately. Of course, this means that there is an increasing demand for rental accommodation. As rental accommodation declines-as it is absorbed by those who are not able to purchase or build their own homes-rental increases become inevitable, partly because of a demand-supply situation and partly because often landlords themselves are faced with increasing interest rates on their mortgages . This, in turn, leads to an increasing demand for welfare or public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> I direct the attention of honourable senators, and anybody else who may be listening to this debate and who is interested in the plight of people in Mrs Young's position, to a booklet published by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, entitled House and Home-A Christian Call for Housing Justice. The booklet is the result of a study conducted over a 12-month period by that Commission and contains not only case studies but also particularly interesting statistics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No doubt Senator Tate was a distinguished member of a distinguished body. At page 4 the booklet states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is estimated by welfare organisations that between 100,000 and 300,000 people are homeless, one or two in every 100 of the population. In Sydney, there are 3,000 homeless young people every night. In 1978 4,500 homeless women and their children were turned away from refuges. </PARA>
<PARA>This seems to be an astounding situation to be allowed to develop, when one considers exactly what the housing industry contributes to the economy of Australia. It is not a minor industry. The booklet goes on to point out that the housing system is enormous and complex. It includes, of course, people who need housing; the supplying of housing; the building industry; the financial institutions-banks, building societies and finance companies; developers and speculators. Naturally, the Federal and State governments are involved. Also involved are the taxation system; the legal system; various other institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and youth hostels; the buyers and renters of housing; and mechanisms for distributing the costs and benefits of housing and the rights over housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Indisputably, housing is a major industry in Australia, one which requires large amounts of capital and employs hundreds of thousands of people nationwide. Housing construction is a significant indicator of economic activity and therefore, of the economic well-being of the society as a whole. That should not be news to anybody. It should not take somebody with a degree in economics to work out just how important is the building of housing to the community. The stocking of a house, once built, with carpets, curtains, various white goods and so on, is an integral part of the housing industry. It is no coincidence that in South Australia Kelvinator, one of the major suppliers of white goods in this country, has had to retrench large numbers of employees simply because the demand is not there-partly due to the fact that people are not building new homes into which they can put those commodities and partly due to the fact that they are not replacing such commodities as frequently as they would otherwise do , simply because the demands of mortgage repayments on their income are so severe. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1980, the Australian Bureau of Statistics published a housing survey of the Sydney-Newcastle-Wollongong region. Amongst other things that survey indicated that over 70 per cent of renters who were interviewed in those areas wanted to own their own homes. In fact, according to that survey home ownership seems to be the aspiration of about 90 per cent of Australians. As the Catholic Commission points out, there are very good reasons why people should want to own their own homes. In Australia a number of benefits can come from home ownership- social and cultural benefits, individual benefits, personal and community development, and a sense of continuity and belonging, which is an integral part of any sort of national feeling in a country. Of course, these benefits do not come exclusively from home ownership, but the Commission asserts that they are best guaranteed to most Australians by home ownership. Nevertheless a great many people do not and cannot enjoy those benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Commission's study, the major sufferers are the poor. The housing situation is a serious problem for young people, especially in times of high unemployment; for most people who receive social security benefits, whose weekly income is below the poverty line; for the aged, particularly those living alone or needing home support services such as Meals on Wheels, home help and domiciliary nursing to be able to remain in their own homes; for most young families, especially those with children, who are at present renting because increasing costs are making it almost impossible for them to meet any deposit gap; and for Aborigines, many of whom live in conditions as inadequate as those found in any of the least economically developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is most serious in inner metropolitan areas in the major cities, but it is spreading increasingly, as the Mackay situation indicates, into country areas. People find that they are unable to get the accommodation they require in city areas and therefore turn to country areas in the hope that more opportunities may be available to them. As Mrs Young discovered in Mackay, that is not always the case. This leaves people with a problem which would appear to be insurmountable in that they do not have a roof over their heads. They are unable to rent, are unable to bridge the deposit gap to build or to purchase a home, and are often unable to live with neighbours or relatives. They are forced , as the Youngs were, into a caravan, a mobile home-one of the homes which as I said earlier are occupied by something in the vicinity of a quarter of a million Australians. If they do not do that, they move into boarding houses. When the worst comes to the worst, they seek accommodation in public housing as this provides the least expensive accommodation with the greatest amount of security.</PARA>
<PARA> Public housing authorities cannot cope with the demands placed on them in the present crisis situation. The Commission notes that in recent years the waiting lists for public housing have grown at increasing rates so that now many applicants for public housing wait up to four or six years or even longer for their homes. In the case of Mr and Mrs Young, this could well mean that their youngest child, who is at present seven months old, will be attending school and still have no concept of what it is like to live in a permanent home. Those who cannot get high on the priority list for housing commission or housing trust homes are forced to remain as best they can in the private rental market. It has been estimated by the Commission that well over a quarter of a million pensioners are renting in the private market. In order to maintain their rental payments they are forced to cut back on other things-food and clothing being the two obvious ones. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem to me that this is an appalling indictment of the Government's policies and its lack of action. The problem can only get worse if it continues to be ignored or to be band-aided by miserly increases in funding in the face of a situation which indicates that dramatic injections of funding are necessary if we are to get anywhere near to solving this problem. My party does not oppose this legislation; far from it. The Australian Democrats wish only that the alleged increase in funds for public and welfare housing provided through this piece of legislation was a meaningful one and sufficient to meet the needs of the growing number of people who through no fault of their own are forced into the welfare housing arena. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Bill 1982. I wish to respond to the debate on the second reading, and in particular to the remarks of Senator Haines because her remarks were addressed mainly to the provisions relating to housing, the welfare aspects of which come within my portfolio responsibilities. Earlier in the debate Senator Haines made some statements which I heard over the speaker in my room so I may have misheard her. She referred to the fact that in the current Budget there had been no real growth in the allocation for welfare housing. If that is indeed what she said, I wish to put on the record that that statement is not correct. In fact this year the cash provided to the States for welfare housing represents an increase of 27 per cent . The figure for last year was $262m and for this year it is just under $333m. So, as was announced at the time of the Premiers Conference, there has been a quite significant increase in the allocation for welfare housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government also announced at the Premiers Conference that it was prepared to permit the States to nominate additional funds from their general works and housing programs for additional expenditure on welfare housing. As an incentive to the States to do that, the Government indicated that it was prepared to make available those additional funds on the very concessional conditions that are allowed for under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. They involve a very long period of repayment-something over 50 years-and a very low rate of interest . I am delighted to say, now that we have before us the evidence of the State Budgets, that this has had precisely the effect the Commonwealth wished when it put forward that proposition. The figures are not yet final because the States are currently seeking the consent of the Commonwealth to bring funds within that provision. However, the State Budget figures brought down so far include $137.4m nominated by the States and the Northern Territory as additional funds for welfare housing in 1982-83 out of their works and housing programs. </PARA>
<PARA> So in fact there has been a very considerable increase in State allocations for welfare housing. The Commonwealth action at the time of the Premiers Conference has been an important contributor to giving the States flexibility in that area. A table which has been prepared by my Department details the funds for welfare housing, and I will seek leave to incorporate that table in Hansard. It shows expenditure by the Commonwealth and the States, including State internal funds, over the period 1973-74 through to 1982-83. It therefore addresses the sorts of concerns which were the concerns of the Catholic and other bishops who I think were referred to earlier in the debate, and it throws some light on the general provision which has been made. I think it would be fair to say that in general it shows a declining provision by the Commonwealth contemporaneously with a rapidly increasing commitment by the States. That is compatible with the general approach of this Government, which has been to concentrate on the general revenue grants to the States rather than on specific purpose payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the volume of expenditure has held up because the States have increased their commitments while there has been a general reduction of the Commonwealth commitment. However, during the current year there was a reversal of that reducing Commonwealth commitment. That reversal, the increase of 27 per cent to which I have referred-the freeing up in works and housing funds-was a concession to the sort of factors that have been brought out in this debate. The Government wishes to respond to the concerns which exist and to the reality of a greater need for welfare housing under current circumstances. I seek leave to incorporate this table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I also point out that the welfare housing side of things is but one aspect of the Government's approach to housing. A good deal of attention was given in the current Budget to the housing problems of Australians generally. We have had some discussion in the Senate, and some criticism, about the fact that the Government has not devoted its attention solely to welfare housing aspects but has looked also to the interests of all Australians who are seeking to purchase their own homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The outstanding new development in the current Budget is the new tax rebate available to all home buyers who are paying interest in excess of 10 per cent. That is a very valuable concession to people who, as Senator Elstob from the Opposition benches might well know, are feeling some strain because of the increases in interest costs. It is a very considerable cost to the Budget but it is a concession which I think will be widely welcomed in suburban Australia by Australian home purchasers. In addition, as part of the housing package introduced earlier this year we have increased the housing deposit assistance available. It has been made as near to contemporaneous as possible with the actual purchase of a house and we have therefore tried to provide real assistance to those who have the problem of making the original deposit. We have taken action with the banks to increase the flow of funds in that important area of the provision of housing finance. So a range of measures has been taken. </PARA>
<PARA> At the welfare end, not part of the works and housing budget but very relevant to the matters raised in this debate, we have instituted a $20m a year program with the State governments to provide mortgage and rent relief. We are in the process of finalising those arrangements with the States but it is important for those people concerned about the welfare aspects of housing to note that we will henceforth, in co-operation with the States, be providing relief both to people who have difficulties with their mortgage payments and to those having difficulty meeting rent payments. As that program is jointly funded it will involve expenditure this year of some $40m, which should be a significant welfare contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a debate on welfare but I understand the relevance of the points raised by honourable senators because the works and housing program does have a direct welfare impact, both in terms of the creation of employment and in the provision of accommodation. I mention in that vein the fact that in the general programs of the Government which touch upon the accommodation of disadvantaged Australians, the Budget does contain increased provisions. I refer to the categories about which this can be said. We have the Aged and Disabled Persons Housing Program in which additional capital funds have been made available for both this year and next year. We have the Handicapped Persons Assistance Program , part of which goes to the provision of accommodation services. Funds available for this year and next year have been increased. We have the Homeless Persons Assistance Act under which we have taken a further step in regard to the $10m program which we promised and which will be exceeded in capital expenditure during the life of the current Government. We have the Youth Services Scheme, to which we have made an additional allocation. That is an experimental program which provides accommodation for homeless youth. We have doubled the allocation under the Family Crisis Accommodation Program, which provides money to the States so they can provide accommodation for families in crisis. That has been increased from $2m to $4m. I have already referred to the Mortgage and Rent Relief Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional money for housing goes out to another disadvantaged group in the community-the Aboriginal population-through the Aboriginal Development Commission which has received a total of something like $50m for expenditure in this year. In other words, I respond to the debate by saying that yes, the Government does acknowledge that there is a difficulty in the welfare housing area. It has taken a series of steps which are aimed at reducing the pressures in that area. I respectfully agree with those who said in the debate that this will not solve the problem but I believe it is a significant contribution towards easing it. I point to the important multiplier effect which was present in the Federal Government's providing a concession to the States where they were prepared to allocate additional funds to works and housing. It is notable that the Victorian Government was able to increase its welfare housing expenditure by , I think, 82 per cent and is seeking the advantage of that concession. There was reference to an increase in my own State of Western Australia from $7m to $ 20. I must say I have not quite got to the bottom of that but again it is an indication of a very greatly increased emphasis on welfare housing. I acknowledge the difficulties but I point to a series of measures taken by the Government to reduce those difficulties and I commend the legislation to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not give a State by State or Territory by Territory description of the Mortgage and Rental Relief Scheme because, quite frankly, I do not have all that material with me. I can advise the Committee that we have written to all State and Territory governments advising them of their allocation from that $20m. There have been extensive officer level negotiations in respect of the conditions which will apply. The Commonwealth has sought to give the States and Territories a fair amount of freedom in the administration of the Scheme but it has laid down broad guidelines which the States and Territories are required to follow. For example, it requires that not less than a quarter of the funds be devoted to mortgage or rent relief. In other words, we do not leave it open to the States or Territories to provide solely mortgage relief or solely rent relief. From a purely welfare point of view, it is my very strong view that it is essential to have an element of rental relief. There is great enthusiasm in some States for ensuring that there is a mortgage relief scheme for those who are really on the borderline between being able to own their own homes and not. Perhaps it is worth noting that in a number of States we are adding to schemes which already existed for some degree of mortgage relief and, in some cases, for rent relief. The present position is that negotiations are virtually complete I think in all States and Territories and I would expect to be in a position to make public announcements with the relevant Ministers in the very near future. With some States we are at the point of simply settling the terms of the announcement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The States and Territories do carry the burden of administration. That is appropriate because they directly administer welfare housing. They have jurisdiction over such things as building societies, which are very important in some States. They have jurisdiction over the terminating building societies as well. There are other terms to describe those organisations but I am sure the Committee knows what I mean. We are well advanced on that. We have a three-year program for mortgage and rent relief which we hope will ensure that a lot of people who are on the border between managing on their own resources and not managing will be assisted over difficult periods by these funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill 1982, simply stated, is to provide a loans scheme for students. The scheme, as it is explained, is intended to be supplementary or in addition to availability of other means of finance for students-first of all, the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme; secondly, finance available to students from loans schemes available from existing institutions, such as univerisities and colleges of advanced education; and thirdly, post-graduate awards. In addition, the scheme is subject to certain income levels; that is to say, a means test is applied in circumstances in which students are not recipients of financial assistance from TEAS or other schemes already in existence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should say at the outset that this Bill is a little short on detail, and a considerable number of matters in the Bill are to be left to regulations made by the Minister at a later date. I think it can be said that the intention of this Bill is clear from the Budget Speech, in which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said:</PARA>
<PARA> The foreshadowed Tertiary Student Loans Scheme will commence from the beginning of 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to a means test, loans of up to $1000 per year to a total of $8000 over the period of full time tertiary study will be available, with a generous interest rate subsidy and exemption from repayment for up to two years after completion of study. </PARA>
<PARA> Thereafter a repayment period of up to 10 years is provided for. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Education will announce further details. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important in understanding this legislation to remember the background to it. Some senators will remember the Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training, the Williams Committee, which took two years to report. It was a very high level committee. During those two years this Parliament was continually told that no decisions could be made about education until the Williams Committee reported. When it finally reported, its pronouncements were described by certain Ministers as a blueprint for education to the year 2000. If that was the blueprint, very little has been done about it. Very few of the Williams Committee recommendations have been implemented in any significant way. But in relation to the Committee's references to student assistance, I remind the Senate of Professor Blandy's research paper which was appended to the report and which caused a lot of excitement in government circles. Professor Blandy was advocating a loans scheme in substitution for any other form of student assistance. At that stage of this Government's history, a loans scheme seemed to fit in with the current ideology which it had at that time, much of which has been abandoned since, and the enthusiasm for a loans scheme was, as I say, highly marked, to the point of causing excitement. </PARA>
<PARA> In a sense, this heady excitement of the post-Williams era was confirmed in part by the report of the so-called razor gang, the Review of Commonwealth Functions, which was tabled in April 1981. In that report this was said about student assistance:</PARA>
<PARA> From the beginning of 1982, however-</PARA>
<PARA>Note 1982, not 1983-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a loans scheme will be introduced for tertiary students. This will enable them to supplement their current income by amounts which will be repayable after graduation. This is a form of assistance which recognises the substantial benefits flowing to individuals from a higher education and thus expresses a sound balance of community and individual interest. It reduces the burdens on taxpayers in an entirely appropriate way. The availability of this additional form of financial assistance will be taken into account in determining the level of benefits under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make some comments about that passage from the Review of Commonwealth Functions, which was instituted by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The first is that there is intrinsically or by implication in that statement a recognition-empty rhetoric, I would suspect-of the benefits flowing to individuals from higher education. Secondly, there is the commitment to reduce the burden on the taxpayer. Thirdly, there is that statement at the end that the loans scheme will be taken into account in determining the level of benefits available under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. I do not know that I am reading anything into that, but I think that the obvious conclusion that people would draw from that is that the level of benefits under the Scheme would not be increased or would, perhaps, be reduced once a loans scheme of the kind envisaged in the razor gang statement was in position. </PARA>
<PARA> One is entitled to be suspicious-and many people have been suspicious-that the Government wanted to replace TEAS with a loans schemes. That suspicion is fuelled by the reaction to the Williams Committee report and by the statement in the Review of Commonwealth Functions report. But the suspicion is absolutely confirmed; in our view, by the letter from the Treasurer to the banks when the details of the loans scheme were being discussed and were the subject of correspondence between this Government and the banks. In that letter of September last year, the Treasurer had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I am prepared to accept that a minimum loan of $500 per annum is reasonable, but I think it will be apparent that unless the annual lending is raised considerably there would be substantial problems for the Government in representing a loans scheme as a substitute for increases in the TEAS allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>There the Treasurer is saying, quite clearly in a letter to the banks-maybe by sleight of hand what is said to the banks is not said to the people-that the Government did not intend to increase the TEAS allowance and that it wishes to represent the loans scheme as a substitute for increases in the TEAS allowance. That was the intention; that was the plan. But like everything else which came out of the razor gang's recommendations, the bang was reduced to a whimper. The list of such examples is long. The Australian Wool Testing Authority, which was to be abolished, remains; the Bendigo Ordnance Factory which was to be sold remains in government hands; the size of the Public Service was to be reduced but it has increased. All of these things are examples of the empty rhetoric of the razor gang period and can be seen from day to day as the facts are revealed about what that much vaunted exercise has cost the Australian community. What we have had are little bits of token legislation bringing some benefits to some students but this present Scheme, after all the talk about it in earlier days, is essentially a Mickey Mouse scheme in pursuit of the empty rhetoric of earlier years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has some very major criticisms of this Bill and I will come to its attitude to it a little later. But the major criticisms of the Bill are simply these: It does not address real issues in education; it does nothing and it will do nothing to increase access to post-school education in Australia. It fails to address the real issues of conditions of living and study which are enjoyed by Australian students who have been able to obtain access to post- school education. The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission indicates that full time enrolments in post-secondary education have fallen by 12,000 between 1977 and 1981. That is an indicator of how much this Government is concerned about access to post-secondary education. I make the point that in 1977 Australia's participation rate, as it is called-that is the number of students participating in post-school education-was abysmal compared with the standards in other countries which enjoy an equivalent degree of economic sophistication. </PARA>

If one goes back to 1977, participation rates in Australia were abysmal compared with the standards which applied in such countries as the United States of America, Canada, Japan and a number of European countries. Since then the number of students in Australia participating in post-secondary education, according to the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, has fallen by 12,000. Since the Fraser Government came to power the comparative living standards of the Australian people have declined from No. 8 on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development list to No. 15 and so have the standards of participation in post-secondary education. We are becoming comparatively a less affluent community and a less educated community in terms of post-secondary education. We started from a bad base in terms of the number of young people in this country who are going on to undertake post- secondary education.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was referring to the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill 1982. I had been seeking to make the point that this Bill, in a sense, is a Mickey Mouse scheme, after the heady rhetoric of earlier days about the prospect in the minds of many members of this Government, including the Treasurer, of winding down the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and replacing it with a loan scheme for all students-I nearly said a loan scheme for all seasons, which may have been equally appropriate. The point I was seeking to make was that a very major criticism of this Bill is that it does not address the major concerns of education in this country which were dealt with in part by reports such as the report of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment and a variety of other reports, including Tertiary Education Commission reports over various years. I had just made the point that full time enrolments in post-secondary education has fallen by 12,000 between 1977 and 1981 and that in terms of this country the 1977 figures were nothing to be proud of, and that in fact very few or relatively few students in the post-secondary education age group were in tertiary education compared with other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission has been pointing out in a number of its recent reports, as I said, that full time enrolments fell by 12, 000 in the relevant years and that simultaneously there was a fall of 25 per cent in the proportion of 17-year-old cohorts, as they are called, proceeding direct from school to higher education. If the proportion of 12-year school leavers proceeding to university or college had, for example, remained in Australia at the 1974 level, there would have been an extra 8,000 young people who would have enrolled in the year 1981 alone. Since the era of the much maligned Whitlam Government there has been a very significant decline in post- secondary enrolments. If we multiply that figure or project that figure of 8,000 young people who might have enrolled in 1981, it suggests that something like 25 ,000 young Australians who would have been enrolled in courses at universities and colleges in 1974 have been lost to post-secondary education, that is, they have gone missing. That is 25,000 young Australians who, if the program of the Labor Government had continued, might well have been in tertiary education or post-secondary education and who have been lost to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the reality of the situation is that there are now over 120,000 young Australians on the dole. Whatever the current economic circumstances are, there is universal agreement that they are pretty bad. If we are to come out of these current bad economic circumstances utilising the human skills of this country then there is one thing that one can say with certainty, and that is that this country will be better off both in economic terms and in its capacity to grow and to contribute to the region in which Australia is situated. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, of course, substantial evidence to suggest that the most important factor in the withdrawal of talent from education has been the gradual but persistent decline in the level of financial support available for tertiary students. The costs of that to this country are enormous in terms of lost opportunities and lost developments. Australia has often been described as a resource rich country. It is an extraordinary fact that one of the factors which have made significant export markets for Australia in the past has been its natural resources and not the product of the skills of this society. If we look at societies around the world, it is those societies which are skill based as distinct from resource based which have had by far the greatest success in export markets and in the general situation of their economies. Australia languishes in tragic loneliness almost in respect of its dependence on resource development exports as distinct from skill based exports. Not only are the costs enormous in terms of the national economy but also of course they are enormous in terms of the opportunities for the development of young Australians through the education system. That is not just my view. It is a view that is supported by the Tertiary Education Commission. The Commission, in volume 1 of its report, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission indicated its concern with the decline in the participation of the young in higher education. In the context of changes to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS) and the introduction of a loans scheme, the Commission believes that it should draw the matter again to the attention of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>If I might interpolate, that is something that we have been doing for several years. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Both the increasing pace of technological change and the fall in the number of full-time jobs for teenagers make it important that able young men and women avail themselves of educational or training opportunities. A decline of one- fifth in the participation of young people in higher education is surely a matter for community concern. It runs contrary to Government policies relating to technological change-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate again and congratulate the TEC in divining that there are such policies-</PARA>
<PARA>and to transition from school to adult life. It raises questions about Australia 's long-term capacity to meet the challenges ahead of it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the crunch issue in many respects in relation to the development of skill and talent and the education system in this country, and it is ignored by this Government. The Commission goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> As pointed out in volume 1 (Part 1, paragraphs 2.30 and 2.31), the decline in the participation of young people in higher education appears to be related partly to their assessment of the benefits of higher education and partly to the availability of financial support for full-time study. The latter is a matter for Commonwealth Government policy. Since 1975 a major source of support for undergraduates, namely, the teacher training scholarships awarded by State education departments, has been virtually eliminated. Moreover, the real value of grants under TEAS has been eroded by inflation and the real severity of the means test increased. The reversal of the downward trend in the participation of the young, will, at the least, require improved financial assistance to students . </PARA>
<PARA>I note in passing that this Government and some sectors of the business community quite cynically and deliberately encouraged scepticism about the value of formal education. The business community has started to change its views on that matter. The Government does not seem to have caught up with that trend. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the matter of the inadequacy of student assistance generally. In 1975 and 1977 the maximum tertiary education assistance benefit equalled or exceeded the level of the unemployment benefit for 18-year-olds and over. Following the increases in the recent Budget, the TEAS benefit is still at least $5 per week less than the unemployment benefit. What is the incentive, in financial terms, to embark on tertiary education when there are very limited assurances about future employment as a result and when the unemployment benefit is pitched at a higher rate?</PARA>
<PARA> Of greater importance, however, is the failure of the means test to keep pace with wage and salary increases. In 1975, the last year of the Labor Government, the maximum family income allowed before TEAS eligibility was affected was 100 per cent of average weekly earnings, which now equates to about $15,000. Yet even after this Budget, the means test now operates at $12,248 and fewer students are eligible because of the means test. Fewer students are attracted because of the declining relativity of tertiary assistance schemes to the unemployment benefit. In 1977 approximately 99,000 received TEAS. In 1983 approximately 88,000 will receive TEAS, a decline of approximately 11,000. That figure, though perhaps not connected, is not unrelated to the size of the decline in the number of students participating in tertiary education in Australia-12,000 in the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> A further opinion on this issue was expressed in a Commonwealth Department of Education study in 1981 entitled 'Validation of Study of the Costs of Full-time Tertiary Students'. That opinion was expressed in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> In our view, this suggests that shift in the full time student population towards financing by parents-or by themselves-has led to a relative decrease in full time university and CAE students from less privileged backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA>So not only are we discussing the general question of the decline in effective access to education which has been shown by students voting with their feet, but also we are talking again about a shift in socio-economic backgrounds of students, which by any standards has never been good in the country. That standard is going backwards in terms of the socio-economic background of students undertaking post-secondary education. A table published by the committee whose report I have just quoted showed that in 1974 some 21 per cent of students were not on any student assistance scheme. In 1979 some 41 per cent were not on any scheme at all. That is because of the relative movement in the availability of finance under the schemes to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote the figures merely to substantiate an argument I put that, as usual, this Government is not addressing the main issues in education, just as it is not addressing the main issues in taxation, in the distribution of wealth in Australia, in industry policy, or anywhere else. I refered to the participation rates in post-secondary education, but the question goes further than that. It goes to the future of this country and the use of the skills and talents of Australian people. It goes to the question of what sort of economic capacity we will have in the future and what sort of export capacity we will have in comparison with other countries. This Bill is almost irrelevant to these major issues in education. Again, I say it is a Mickey Mouse Bill. Maybe this Budget represents the last increase in TEAS by this Government if this loans scheme is in fact a sort of a foot-in-the-door job. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer briefly to the Bill. I said before that it will do nothing to increase access to education. Secondly, I say it tends to favour students from relatively wealthy backgrounds rather than those on the borderline. Those with more secure economic backgrounds will be much more likely to take out a loan than those with uncertain socio-economic backgrounds. I am prepared to concede, and the Opposition concedes, that it may be of benefit to some students at the margin. This scheme may be of some assistance to some students in middle income groups from relatively well-off socio-economic backgrounds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating the motion for the second reading of the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill 1982, to which my leader has just moved an amendment. We first noticed something about the student loans scheme when the Budget was introduced on 17 August. We were told by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) at that stage that a tertiary student loans scheme would commence from the beginning of 1983. We were not told much else in the Budget Speech. We were told this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subject to a means test, loans of up to $1,000 per year to a total of $8,000 over the period of full-time tertiary study will be available, with a generous interest rate subsidy and exemption from repayment for up to two years after completion of study. </PARA>
<PARA> Thereafter a repayment period of up to 10 years is provided for. </PARA>
<PARA>We were told that we would get further details at some later stage. We have received those details-we received them in the Bill that is under discussion tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I had not been in this place very long when the Government decided to inquire into a student loans scheme. So it was no real surprise to find one in front of us when we came here for the Budget session. As I said, I had not been here long when the Government decided it would hold an inquiry into student loans, but it denied at that time that it had any intention of introducing a student loansscheme. I thought the Government had taken a most peculiar stance. At that stage it said it was not going to introduce a student loans scheme but would have an inquiry about one. In other words, it would have an inquiry about something it had no intention of introducing. I can remember during Question Time asking Senator Sir John Carrick, who was then the Minister for Education, why it was necesssary to have an inquiry when he said there was no intention of introducing a student loans scheme. His reply was to the effect that the Government was keeping its options open. It certainly was keeping its options open. It seems to me that ever since that time, which was probably about five years ago, the Government had intended to introduce a student loans scheme. The crunch came when what is popularly called the razor gang report was introduced into this place. I suppose it is more properly called the report on the Review of Commonwealth Functions but hardly anybody calls it that, including some people on the other side who lapse occasionally and call it the razor gang report. When the report was introduced on 30 April 1981 there was a direct indication in the report that a student loans scheme would be introduced. The report, under the heading 'Student Loans', said in part:</PARA>
<PARA> A loan scheme, administered by tertiary institutions, to be introduced from the beginning of 1982 as a supplement to TEAS. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, such a scheme was not introduced from the beginning of 1982 because the Government ran into quite a few problems with it. As well as that, the scheme will not be administered by the tertiary institutions. Apparently the institutions have been as wary as the students about the reasons for introducing this loans scheme. I wish to quote from comments made by one university at about that time. The Adelaide Advertiser reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The University of Adelaide Council has opposed the Federal Government's tertiary education funding decision. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on it said:</PARA>
<PARA> It will refuse to administer the ''Loans scheme'' as proposed by the Lynch Committee on the grounds that it will deter disadvantaged students from tertiary study and diminish equality of opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>The universities apparently would not have a bar of administering this scheme. The Government has had to go to the banks to get someone to administer it. The razor gang report stated that the loans scheme would be a supplement to TEAS. What is meant by a 'supplement to TEAS'? Is it regarded as an extra amount that the students will be able to receive-something that they will require to have a living allowance-or will it be a loan to enable them to overcome some temporary but significant financial problem? Apparently it is not the latter. Later on in the Lynch Committee report the Government said:</PARA>
<PARA> Changes to TEAS rates to be considered in the light of this additional form of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>This clearly indicates that in the future, if there is to be a student loans scheme, TEAS rates will not be increased as they would normally be increased if students need more assistance to carry on at universities or colleges of advanced education; instead the Government will take into account the student loans scheme as an additional form of assistance. On hearing that the Lynch Committee report stated that changes to TEAS rates would be considered in the light of the additional form of assistance-namely, student loans-most students were rightfully concerned that the loans scheme was the thin edge of the wedge. There was an indication that the emphasis would shift from direct assistance to loans. I believe students had every right to be concerned about this type of shift, from a reliance on TEAS to student loans. They had every right to be concerned if for no reason other than that over past years TEAS has been losing its value because it has not been adjusted in line with movements in the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to illustrate that point by quoting from a table which was prepared for me by the Parliamentary Library. The table sets out the TEAS rates in 1974 for at home and independent students. These rates were based on a percentage of average weekly earnings. The table cites figures from 1974 to 1982. In 1974 the at home rate was $850. As a percentage of average weekly earnings that represented 12.8 per cent. The percentage has steadily declined except for one aberration in 1979 when it went up to 13 per cent. Except for that the rate has steadily declined to $1,675 in 1982, which represents 10 per cent of average weekly earnings. There has been a decline in the at home rate from 12.8 per cent to 10 per cent. The independent rate shows a similar trend. In 1974 the maximum amount available was $1,400, which represented 21.1 per cent of average weekly earnings. Now, in 1982, the maximum amount available for an independent student is $2,583, which is 15.4 per cent of average weekly earnings. There has been a drop from 21.1 per cent to 15.4 per cent. I wish to show the table to the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), who is at the table, and ask whether it can be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Other figures are available to which I draw the attention of the Senate. The figures were published in a journal so there is no need to incorporate them in Hansard. In the 'Social Security Journal' of 1982, table 4 on page 37 sets out quite clearly the same type of information but in a different manner. The table shows the amounts available for TEAS in constant 1966-67 dollar terms. The table shows that $850 in 1974 the at home rate at that time, was equal to $536 in 1966-67 dollar terms. The table only goes up to 1981 but it shows that in 1981 the amount had declined to $502 in 1966-67 dollar terms. The same sort of thing happened with the away from home or the independent rate. In 1974 the rate was $882 in 1966-67 terms. This had declined to $774 by 1981. The table I have incorporated shows that there has been a steady decline in the purchasing power of the TEAS allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One could well ask the question: Has this loss of purchasing power had any effect on student numbers? It certainly seems to have done so. I took the opportunity of looking at the Tertiary Education Commission report of February 1981. Table 2.15 in Volume 1, Part 1 of the report contains quite a deal of interesting information. Among that interesting information is an indication that the proportion of year 12 students enrolling in universities or colleges of advanced education immediately after leaving high school has started to show a steady but significant decrease. In 1974 the proportion of year 12 students who went on to universities or CAEs was 54.3 per cent. In 1976 this declined to 51.1 per cent, in 1978 to 45.6 per cent and in 1980 to 42.3 per cent. So from 1974 to 1980 the number of students going on to universities or CAEs decreased from 54.3 per cent to 42.3 per cent. In the 17-year-old group a similar pattern is revealed. The proportion of 17-year-old students who proceeded direct from school to higher education in 1974 was 18 per cent. This decreased in 1980 to 14 .5 per cent, a decrease of 3.5 per cent, and there has been a steady decrease since then. What are the reasons for this? Before I gave those figures I suggested that one of the reasons was probably the fact there had been a loss of purchasing power in TEAS. The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA> Several factors have contributed to the reduced demand from young people for higher education. An important one is the decline in the availability of financial support for full-time study. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Tertiary Education Commission clearly sets out that because there is less financial support fewer students are proceeding to higher education after they leave secondary school. The Tertiary Education Commission goes on and reports the fact that in 1975 there was available to people not only a means tested TEAS allowance but also certain State teacher education scholarships which are now no longer available. This, of course, is tied up with the financial aspects and this is one of the reasons that we have fewer students. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the fact that fewer students are going on to higher education it should be noted that there has been an absolute failure to attract potential tertiary education students from the lower socio-economic backgrounds. This is a problem which bedevils educationists throughout the world and it is very difficult to find a solution which will make sure that people from lower socio- economic groups will go on to higher education. There are many reasons for those problems. One of the problems, of course, is student finance. That may be one of the reasons why we are having some problems in this regard. Volume 2 of the report entitled 'Studies of Tertiary Student Finances'. talking about socio- economic standing of parents of students in universities and CAEs, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The 1974 study of income and expenditure patterns of tertiary students found that the parents of those students were heavily over-represented at the top end of the scale relative to the total population of persons age 45 to 54 for both occupation and income. The 1979 data again shows a substantial over- representation at the top end of each of these scales. </PARA>
<PARA>The scales the report mentioned were socio-economic scales. I am not saying that we are having problems getting people from those lower socio-economic groups to universities and CAEs only because of finances, but finances constitute a significant area. One may ask: Does all this matter? Should Australia be concerned at a shunning of educational opportunity in the way in which the figures seem to suggest? Should we be concerned at an inability to attract a reasonable proportion of disadvantaged groups to tertiary education? I believe that we should be concerned. If we-I am talking about the Australian people- continue to shun education in the way in which we seem to be shunning it, in particular higher education, the long term effect will be that Australia will slide back and become a Third World country. This slide is now occurring. In 1966 Australia ranked No. 5 in the world in per capita income. By 1973 we had slipped to No. 10 and by 1979 to No. 11. It is interesting to note that from 1970 to 1979 Australia's growth rate in per capita income was 1.7 per cent. Malaysia, in the same period, had a growth rate of 8.5 per cent. What are we to do to redress the trend that has occurred over recent years in all these areas I have been speaking about? Obviously we have to give encouragement to potential students, to those able people who can undertake tertiary education studies. What form of assistance should they get? I come down in favour of a sound tertiary allowance scheme, not a loans scheme. I agree with Professor David Caro , who is the Chairman of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> All of us feel the Tertiary Allowances Scheme should be supported and we are worried that this may not be so as a consequence of the Loans scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Many people would agree with him and believe that we have to be careful and concerned that if we do have a loans scheme we will not have a decrease in the value of our tertiary allowances scheme. What will be some of the consequences if we do have a loans scheme? I believe fewer students will go on to universities, colleges of advanced education and perhaps even to technical and further education institutions. Many will not avail themselves of a scheme which will mortgage their future-and mortgage their future it will. even when they graduate they will not get any joy out of what the Federal Government will say to them when they are perhaps earning some money and ask whether the interest payments on the student loans they are paying off can be deducted from their taxable income. I asked the following question of the Treasurer about this:</PARA>
<PARA> In the event of the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill being passed by this Parliament, will a student who repays a student loan after graduation be able to claim either loan repayments or interest payments as income tax deductions?</PARA>
<PARA>I have received an answer to that question. The short answer is no, but before I get to that short answer I would like to read the answer that was given to me. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has stated that, in the absence of the relevant legislation, it is not possible to express a firm opinion on this question. By way of general comment he stated that, where a student repays a loan after graduation, the question whether he or she will be entitled to an income tax deduction for repayments of principal and interest will be governed by the general deduction provisions of the income tax law. So far as is relevant they provide a deduction for losses and outgoings incurred in gaining or producing assessable income other than losses or outgoings of a capital, private or domestic nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The repayments of the loan would be of a capital nature and, consequently, precluded from deduction. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it. The repayment of the loan would not be an income tax deduction. The answer continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Interest on borrowed moneys qualifies for deduction when the moneys borrowed are used for the purposes of gaining or producing assessable income. Under the proposals relating to the Tertiary Student Loans Scheme, the loans are intended for the maintenance of the student and his or her dependants. In these circumstances the interest paid would not qualify for income tax deduction. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the short answer is no. Once the student graduates even the interest payments will not be regarded as deductible for income tax purposes. I have said that many students will not avail themselves of a scheme that will mortgage their future. In this respect, I agree with Ross Holmes, General Secretary of the Federation of College Academics, who says:</PARA>
<PARA> Loans are a further extension of the discredited user pays principle; it is knowledge on hire purchase, and a tax on human investment-our most important national asset. </PARA>
<PARA>Students from low income families are unlikely to opt for loans and the financial burden that will result from them. This will further add to the bias, which I mentioned earlier, against lower socio-economic groups at universities and colleges of advanced education. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, I am concerned that women are likely to be wary about accepting loans as a means of financing study. Women are likely to have employment problems after graduation and in some cases, unfortunately, earn less. Therefore, probably we will be seeing fewer women opting to take out loans and thus going to universities and colleges of advanced education. Les Wallis, General Secretary, Federation of Australian University Staff Associations, FAUSA, says:</PARA>
<PARA> FAUSA has expressed its total opposition to the student loans scheme. It would discriminate against women and minority groups and would inevitably undermine TEAS. </PARA>
<PARA>I am also concerned that students from rural areas are likely to be deterred from borrowing. Farm incomes are not sufficiently stable to enable one to look into the future and decide whether one can afford to keep borrowing to go to a university or college of advanced education. It seems to me that that should be a matter of concern, not only to people in rural areas but also to the National Country Party, which seems to be supporting this measure. Perhaps that party no longer really represents these people. If it did it would be concerned about what is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall my time at university. I believe that students at a university or college of education should not regard their place there as a sinecure. If they do, they will not get anything out of it, but there is no reason why their time there should not be in some ways pleasurable. However, all the pleasure will be gone for students if they are caught in default, especially when it is through no shortcoming of their own. The sensitivity of the defaulting student is quite understandable. It seems to me that in other countries students who default are pilloried. A heading to a U.S. News and World Report article of 18 July 1977 reads: 'Time of Reckoning for Student Deadbeats.' That is the way student loan defaulters overseas seem to be pilloried in the literature. I understand that in other countries private collection agencies are used in the pursuit of defaulters and that these agencies sometimes adopt quite unacceptable methods. I have heard of the dismissal of State employees who have not repaid their student loans. I have heard of the names and addresses of student defaulters being published in local newspapers and of ex-students opting for bankruptcy as a way out of their problems following the taking out of student loans. </PARA>
<PARA> My main concern about having student loans in Australia is that if such a scheme is introduced we are likely to have in this Parliament the idea that as such loans are available for students, tertiary education assistance need not be sustained at the level at which it would be sustained if such loans were not available. Certainly there is need for some temporary assistance for students who run into financial problems at universities and colleges of advanced education. Most of the students who have gone through a university or college of advanced education have found themselves at some time in a temporary but serious financial situation in which they needed a small loan to help them out. Such loans should be available, but we should not be providing loans to meet living expenses of students and get them through universities and CAEs in that way. If we do, it will give rise to the consequences of which I have spoken. I agree with Paul Carrick, the National President of the Australian Union of Students, when he says:</PARA>
<PARA> Students loans are notoriously inequitable and have been a disaster in many overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA>I come down in favour of student allowances and support the amendment of my leader. In conclusion, I remind the Senate that Senator Button's amendment provides, amongst other things, that the Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Education and the Arts for inquiry and report by 16 November 1982. That would still allow the Senate to consider the report of the Standing Committee and deal with the Bill before the Senate rose for the summer recess. I support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill, on which we have heard from two speakers already this evening , provides additional resources for students in higher education and technical and further education courses in Australia. At the moment the expenditure on the Tertairy Education Assistance Scheme, Commonwealth post-graduate awards, Aboriginal study grants and secondary adult assistance schemes totals about $ 200m. This Bill will provide, in the coming calendar year, for the expenditure of $50m-an increase of one-quarter. In the following year another $50m is to be loaned. When the money available to students for tertiary study is taken up and a steady situation has been reached, the provision under this Bill will represent an increase of more than 50 per cent in the moneys available to help students in higher education and technical and further education courses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard from the Opposition dreary speeches, full of gloom, despite its support of the Bill. Opposition speakers have muddled about making gloomy statements about the proposed loans. It has to be admitted that if a student receives a benefit from the taxpayer, everyone would prefer to have it made by way of grant rather than loan. But that would cost considerably more. Nevertheless, we hear from the Opposition the gloomy statement: 'We support the Bill but why can you not make it all by way of grant.' The coffers of the Government are not bottomless. It is accountable and responsible to the taxpayer . The TEAS allowance has been increased by 20 per cent this year. The Commonwealth post-graduate award has been increased by 48 per cent. Aboriginal study grants and resources have been increased. Indeed, the provision made by way of grant to all student assistance schemes has been increased in order to overcome marginal needs identified in the student loan reports. Additionally, the sum would be available to students to permit them to complete their higher education or technical and further education. Also, the Government would subsidise the interest rate by 5 percentage points. A reduced interest rate will be charged, so there will be a degree of application of the userpays principle. I believe that that represents a fair supplement to the student assistance grants that have long been established in this country. The Menzies Government of 25 years ago introduced the Commonwealth scholarship scheme which transformed higher education in Australia. That was a Liberal Party initiative. It took the elitism out of higher education and enabled students of all backgrounds to compete for scholarships, subject to a means test. It permitted all of modest means to study engineering, politics, medicine, dentistry, economics and so on at universities and colleges. </PARA>
<PARA> Eight years ago the Commonwealth scholarship scheme was changed to become the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme but the old Commonwealth post-graduate award continues. During that period, particularly over the last 10 years, a number of needs were identified where students did not have full access to TEAS or Commonwealth post-graduate awards but still had needs of a certain dimension which a loans scheme would truly help them to solve. This is what this Bill does . It sets up a student loans scheme whereby there is a guarantee by the Commonwealth Government of those loans and whereby there is a 5 per cent interest subsidy to the benefit of those students. Any student can take up to $1 ,000 in any one year and $8,000 can accrue throughout the period of a student's studies. The period of repayment is 10 years after a two-year holiday in whch a graduate can establish himself in employment. At no stage does the scheme require the student or graduate to repay the loan at greater than 15 per cent of that person's income. There are constraints and subsidies. It is very carefully worked out to be a very realistic scheme. It borrowed somewhat from the student loans inquiry chaired by Mr M. W. J. Butcher who reported to the Commonwealth Government in May 1977. I quote from page 10 of that report where the Committee' s conclusions were guided by this statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy that all qualified students should be able to undertake tertiary education without hardship is specially referred to in the Committee's terms of reference and the Committee accepted this as the starting point for its consideration of the subject and the touchstone on which all proposals should be tested. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us overcome those remaining areas of hardship and need by way of allowing a student loans scheme to which students can have access much more freely than they could through grants schemes such as TEAS and Commonwealth post-graduate awards. The report of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment, to which Senator Button referred earlier, had appended to it a paper by Professor Blandy which was more radical than this. It took up the argument that many socialists put forward: Why should the taxpayer pay for the tertiary study of largely the children of higher income families? Why should the poorer people in the country through taxation pay for the education of the richer people in the country? That argument, put forward by many socialists, is also put forward by a number of Liberals who believe there should be fairness in the taxation arrangements of Australia. I happen not to subscribe to either of those poles. I believe that the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme is a good scheme as was the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. Certainly, the Commonwealth Post-graduate Awards Scheme, in its much increased and more valuable standing after the Budget, is of enormous importance to ensuring that we have professional graduates with post-graduate experience. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe these schemes are sound and must be retained. This loans scheme is truly a supplement to those grants schemes of student assistance. It has already been mentioned tonight that when the conclusions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions were announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in April last year reference was made to the investigation of a student loans scheme which would be supplementary to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. This is the burden of this scheme which was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) in mid-August in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The aim of the scheme is to give increased access to tertiary education. It is to meet student need and it has the rationale of having a fair balance between a burden on the taxpayers of Australia and a degree of user pays on those who make these borrowings. There could be a number of differently conceived student loans schemes. When I was employed at the University of Adelaide one of my responsibilities for six years was to administer the student loans scheme and I saw the experiences of some hundreds of students in my time. There was assistance directly to more than 1,000 students whereby they gained loans that got them out of particular difficulties, through their studies to the end of a year and ensured that they could keep on track in their course of study. </PARA>
<PARA> As many honourable senators know, part time students are not eligible for TEAS. Students from high income families are not eligible for TEAS. In fact less than half of Australia's full time tertiary students receive TEAS. But what if students prefer not to ask their wealthy parents for assistance during those years of study? What happens if parents deny their children some study? Governments cannot enforce obligations within families. It happens in our colleges and universities that there are students who do not receive assistance either from parents or from TEAS. If they are successful, they are some of the most resilient and hard-working students in Australia. Many of those of the older generation of graduate in Australia will say: 'That is how all of us did it. We came through before there were Commonwealth scholarships. We had to work part time and we had to work very hard during the summer in order to pay our way through university or college.' I am not using that as an argument to return to the old days. I am saying: Let us make sure that we have the kind of viable TEAS and Commonwealth Post-graduate Awards Scheme that have been achieved, particularly in the enhanced way following the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> There are students who do not have access to these schemes and this loans scheme, with its wide-eligibility, will enable that increased access. Student loans schemes can be conceived in various ways. In the Butcher report there was a small loans scheme proposal and a large loans scheme proposal. He came up with a recommendation for two types of schemes. This proposal before us tonight in the Senate is a moderate middle way which is fair and balanced. It is not so small in its scope that it does not sufficiently help the student in need, nor is it so large that it is hard to handle or overbearing in terms of the repayments and the costs that may accrue either to the Government or to the student. </PARA>
<PARA> What are some of the features of the loans scheme? The loans scheme is not patronising. It does not make a student dependent on others. It requires students to undertake their own commitments, their own accountability for loans that they seek to take out. It is not dependent in any respect upon a parental guarantee and only for students under 21 is it dependent upon a parental means test. Otherwise there would be such an outcry because students of wealthy families would have the same access to a loans scheme as those of lower parental incomes. Individual students themselves undertake the terms of the loan and of repayment of the loan. The loans scheme does not discriminate unfairly. It does not discriminate at all between groups of students. It will be just as easy for a woman as for a man to gain a loan. It will be just as easy for a mature student as for a school leaver to undertake a loan. </PARA>
<PARA> The eligibility criteria are very simple. A student needs to be full time, an Australian citizen or permanent resident and to have a taxable income in the previous taxation year of less than $5,000. There are a few exceptions that widen the eligibility. Those who already receive TEAS or Commonwealth post- graduate awards are automatically eligible for a loan even if their income does exceed $5,000 a year. Those are the kinds of eligibility criteria that are determined for this loans scheme. It does not matter whether a student comes from the country or the city, whether the student is a man or a woman or is young or old. No eligibility criterion relates to the ability to repay the loan. The scheme, built upon a Government guarantee, assumes that any student undertaking a course at a college or university will be able in due course to meet the repayment and, if he cannot, the Government is the guarantor and pays out the loan. At no stage in those 10 years after the loan has been taken out does the scheme require greater than 15 per cent of income to meet the repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> The loans scheme is realistic. I do not believe it is burdensome. It has a 5 per cent subsidy, coming from the taxpayer, built into it. At the moment the interest rate for borrowings up to $100,000 from banks is 14.5 per cent. With the 5 percentage point subsidy from the Government, that interest rate to the borrower is reduced to 9.5 per cent. If the going interest rate for overdraft and similar borrowers in banks were 10 per cent, then students would be required to meet only 5 per cent of the interest on the loan. I think, too, that the loans scheme has a particular generosity for those most excellent students who gain Commonwealth post-graduate awards. They are competitive awards, as is well known, and those with first class degrees can go on to masters and Ph.D. studies or other higher diploma studies, and they compete with one another to gain those awards. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget the grant for a Commonwealth post-graduate scholar was increased by 48 per cent. In addition, whereas there was a limit of $500 that could be gained by a second award, say from a university or from a private scholarship, that has now been extended to $1000 extra from a second scholarship, if it is given by a university, and to $5,000 extra if it is given by way of a private scholarship. So a Commonwealth post-graduate award holder in certain circumstances may have $6,500 from the award itself, $5,000 through a private scholarship-that takes it up to $11,500-and, if there is some need, given family responsibilities or living needs, he could still automatically apply for a $1, 000 loan. I believe that that is indeed generous. It is the kind of generosity which a number of us on the Government side urged the Government to take on so that we could ensure that there were sufficient resources for post-graduate study in Australia. Of course, the number of Commonwealth post-graduate awards in this coming year, 1983, will be increased from 800 to 900 awards. Similarly, any person who holds a tertiary education allowance will be able to gain the loan. </PARA>
<PARA> Some objections have been expressed in regard to the loans scheme. Even some of those objections cited by the Opposition speakers tonight were raised months ago , when there was still speculation on what the loans scheme would be about. Because it was speculated that full interest would be paid by students and that it would be a burdensome loans scheme, it was understandable that some education commentators raised some objections to what they thought was going to happen. But, lo and behold, the Budget announcement was not what was put up as the Aunt Sally by student organisations and others. It was a moderate, balanced and fair loans scheme providing an additional quarter of resources from which tertiary students in Australia could draw. </PARA>
<PARA> When one asks those same early objectors to the loans scheme whether the funds will be taken up by students they say that of course they will, that the whole $ 50m will go in 1983, that students will jump at the additional resources in order to meet some of their current needs. In fact, they ask what barriers will be put in place to ensure that the money goes to those in greatest need and what will stop a student from getting his $1,000 and spending it on some frivolous thing, or at least on something which may be important to him but which is not directly involved in his tertiary study. I believe it is contemplatable for the Government to require some undertaking at the time a student takes out a loan that the money will be used for a bona fide education-related purpose, even if it is to provide a vehicle necessary to get to a university or college or to meet living costs. It would be most inappropriate for this loan to be taken out and immediately invested in some speculative scheme, earning 17 1/2 per cent interest. That would be a very irresponsible way for any student to act. I am sure that Australia will not be seeing much of that. That is the only area where there may be some objection because, if we trace the objections made in this debate, they were also made before the Budget announcement of the details of the scheme, which is a balanced, fair and reasonable scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The first objection put up was that the loans scheme will displace TEAS and other student allowance programs. How can that be credible when this year's Budget, to have effect in 1983, provides a 20 per cent increase in the real value of TEAS, a substantial increase in the adjusted family income on which the means test is based, and half as much again for the Commonwealth post-graduate award? When there have been such substantial increases in the grants available for student allowances, I believe that this objection falls flat. The report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions said that the loans scheme would be supplementary to TEAS. Both the former Minister for Education, the Hon. Wal Fife , and the present Minister for Education, the Hon. Peter Baume, have always said that the Tertiary Student Loans Scheme is supplementary to TEAS, the Commonwealth post-graduate awards, the Aboriginal study grants and the adult secondary education grants. So, when we have seen that consistency of statements by Ministers and the enormous increases with regard to the grants schemes, particularly the Commonwealth post-graduate award, I believe that this objection indeed falls flat. The interest subsidy in the scheme is only $2 1/2m. If we calculate 5 per cent of $50m, it comes to a bill to the Government of $2 1/2m in any one year. The Government is already providing about $200m in grants schemes, so the actual cost to the Government of a one per cent increase is of very small consequence in terms of cost to the taxpayer. That is the advantage. It makes available a very substantial increase in student resources at a small, reasonable cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> A second objection put up is that the loans scheme will discriminate against some groups of students and so deny them the wider access that the scheme provides. I have already referred to this. Of course, it is an assumption of that objection that there will be wider access. Some Opposition speakers say that they want the wider access for women and for mature students; they want the wider access that the loans scheme will give. I believe that the Minister in his summing up-as he did in his second reading speech and as the operation of the Act will show-will be able to authoritatively affirm that there will not be discrimination between groups of students. I understand the regulations will be available by the end of November so that the scheme can operate from the beginning of next year. </PARA>
<PARA> A third objection is that there is no need for a student loans scheme. As I have said, 60 per cent of full time students do not receive TEAS grants, persons who are doing second degrees are not eligible for TEAS, and students who fail are not eligible for TEAS; they have to repeat using their own resources. Are we going to rule out the chance of someone completing his course of study because he has the misfortune to fail a year? Surely we ought to be able to make some resource available-not to repeat TEAS-to which people have access and which they can later repay from their earnings as graduates. Then there are unexpected crises that bring financial hardship to some students and a student loans scheme helps to meet that. </PARA>
<PARA> Another objection that has been raised by some is that the students will not participate in the loans scheme. But even on the testimony of those most opposed to this scheme the whole $50m would be subscribed during 1983. They admit that. If the $50m is taken up, with $1,000 as the full amount, by all those participating, it will help 50,000 students, whereas if the minimum amount of $ 500 is taken, it will help 100,000 students. Shall we deny this Bill to the students of Australia? The Senate should pass the Bill, and pass it quickly, so that those 50,000 to 100,000 students will have the additional resource. </PARA>
<PARA> In my old university I asked what the student loan take-up was this year. In 1981 there were 74 student loans at an average of $600. This year there have been more than that number, at an average of $700. Students do take up loans to meet the needs of their studies, but the trouble is that not all universities and colleges have established student loans schemes. This is a national program available in every part of Australia for all college and university students, and it should be directly of assistance to them. I believe that it will be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA> The other objection is that the student loans scheme will be administratively costly. I should like to seek leave, Mr Acting Deputy President, to incorporate in Hansard an extract from Estimates Committee B which gives the exact cost of the administration of this scheme, which is totalled for the first year of establishment at $1,070,000, for a $50m scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I conclude by briefly referring to the one group in Australia that has been totally opposed to anything that looks like a student loans scheme-the Australian Union of Students. I believe that the AUS started up earlier this year such a momentum of opposition to anything that was looking like a student loans scheme that it could not itself stop it. It was on a tiger of its own making, and eventually it could not get off. Such was its rhetoric in the earlier months that it went far in excess of reasonable argument . In relation to these proposals, the AUS is quite unrepresentative of the ordinary students of Australia's universities and colleges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, it came to my attention today that the AUS executive does not meet in an open and representative way, according to the constitution, but that a smaller group of the executive meets beforehand and caucuses on the agenda of the executive meeting and then goes into that executive meeting with its pre- formed views. But this caucus is made up of only the communist students. I should like to seek leave later to incorporate in Hansard a letter written a week ago by Julia Gillard, the Education Vice-President, dated 4 October, and on the AUS letterhead, which says that the normal executive meeting has to be cancelled because there is to be a Communist Party student meeting on that day. The executive caucus-as it is called-will have to meet the day before what is called the formal executive. The formal executive is to meet the next day. It will spend longer in the caucus. The sort of evidence available in this letter is an indication of the way in which the AUS is no longer representative of students. That has been so for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> My final comment is with regard to the amendment proposed by the Australian Labor Party. I have not been consulted in any way as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. How can we seriously undertake the reference in five weeks?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing the Student Assistance ( Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill 1982. In itself, the Bill seeks merely to allow the Government to offer a guarantee to banks in relation to the granting by banks of loans to students. The Bill is presumably unexceptionable. After all , if there is to be a loans scheme, someone has to guarantee it. It is the principle itself that I wish to address-the notion of loans within the context of tertiary education in Australia. The Australian Democrats do not have an in- principle opposition to loans. Such an opposition would in itself be absurd. There are obvious positions, times and elements in which loans would be an exceptionally good idea. Indeed, we fully support the loans schemes to which Senator Teague has referred. We would add the fact that they are under-funded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those loans schemes have been extremely useful in supporting people in difficult positions, for one reason or another, to be able to continue their studies at an appropriate level. Here, for example, one might suggest that if a person had dependants and his family circumstances became difficult, this may be useful for him to continue through to the end of his studies so that he would have a degree which would make him a more eligible person in the job market. So I make it very clear that the Australian Democrats do not have an in-principle objection to loans. However, we object to the establishment of a loans scheme without the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme being set at a reasonable level , which it is not. We also believe that the TEAS ought to be indexed, which it is not. Because neither of those propositions is in legislative form, we do not propose to support this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to the banks in first mooting the idea and seeking from them their concurrence was quite plain. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am prepared to accept that a minimum loan of $500 per annum is reasonable, but I think it will be quite apparent that unless the annual lending is raised-</PARA>
<PARA>which the banks did-</PARA>
<PARA>considerably there would be substantial problems for the Government in representing a loans scheme as a substitute for increases in the TEAS allowances . </PARA>
<PARA>May I suggest a scenario for the Budget debate in Cabinet next year. The Minister for Education, goes to Cabinet, as is his wont, in defence of his ministry and suggests that there should be a rise in TEAS. The Cabinet has two alternatives; it can say yes or no. I believe that the question that could be asked is: 'Have the students taken up the loans that we legislated for last year ?' If the Minister says 'Yes they have' everybody, including Senator Teague, who tonight expressed it in very clear terms, would say: 'That piece of legislation has been a resounding success. We will therefore put more money into loans. I am sorry, Minister, you get no rise in your TEAS.' Or the Cabinet could say: 'Has the loan been taken up?' If the Minister is able to reply 'No, it has not' the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), being a great keeper of the purse, would say : 'If they have not taken up the loans they obviously do not need any more money . Therefore they do not need a rise in TEAS. On to the next subject'. It is a catch-22 situation. It is inevitable in the Budget considerations next year that if this scheme is in operation there will be no rise in TEAS. I believe there can be no dispute about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in which this has occurred in other places is that the loans scheme is a replacement for student grants. This Bill is carefully conceived to enable that to happen. Apart from some of the clauses in the Bill to which I have circulated amendments because I believe they are offensive in terms of putting political stipulations on who might be able to receive loans, the people who are eligible are those who fall under current schemes. The only other group outside of that is such an extremely small group because the items are so closely defined, certainly as they are set out in the Treasurer's Budget Speech. In effect the group that we are talking about comprises those who already fall under the eligibility criteria of various schemes which are available at the current time. It is that that adds a weight to the idea that this is carefully sculptured as a substitute for the TEAS allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other concerns in relation to loans that I would like to come back to shortly but I will look first at the wider prospect of why we, the Australian Democrats, differ fundamentally from the Government in our approach to education . We do not see education as a cost to the community. We prefer to talk about education as an investment and think of it in the same way. We are therefore seeking to treat education in the same way as we would investment allowances for industry, depreciation allowances for new plant, increased use of new technologies and other such areas. We would like the education debate to be centred on how much this country can afford to put into education this year, not on how much it is going to cost this country to run our education institutions and getting some of the users to pay for it. The users of education in this country are the people of this country. I do not know how many times one has to say that we do not erect education institutions for the delectation and delight of students. We have schools and tertiary institutions for this country's advancement and future. If it were not for that there would be no point at all in funding them. That is why we put money into them. Without them we would be a hill-billy backward country. That is why we put money into education. There is constant talk about the user paying. Yes, let the user pay. The country uses education; let it pay. </PARA>
<PARA> It is said that if someone goes to a tertiary institution he will get extra pay when he leaves. I would have thought that a free enterprise government would be happy about that. I would have thought that a free enterprise government would say: 'Good on them; let them work hard, get extra qualifications and because a person is worthy of his hire let him receive extra pay'. That is what free enterprise is about. If he gets extra pay he will pay extra tax. That is when we get the money back. He will pay extra tax on a graduated scale and that is what progressive taxation is about. That is the way in which we pay for education and that is the way in which we ought to pay for it. We are now stuck again in an education debate we have had before. I will detail some of the debates that we have had. We have the mindless amalgamation proposals, the surviving item out of the razor gang-everything else collapsed. The Government decided that it would stick with some, not all, of the rather absurd amalgamations. We have had the absurdity-the continuing absurdity-of the pseudo-abolition of the Curriculum Development Centre. We still do not know where it is; it is in some type of legislative limbo. We have had the serious diminution, as can be seen from reports, of the various commissions. I have talked on that matter on a number of occasions when the reports have come before the Senate. We have had the rather mindless attempt-certainly not from this Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), thank goodness, but from the previous Minister-to shift the responsibilty for unemployment on to the schools. He even went on national television and spoke about it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had the bludgeoning of States into reallocating funds into transition programs from other areas of high need because somebody suddenly got an idea that transition education was a good vote catcher. I suggest that those people who do not know about transition education read some of the more recent literature coming out of the Centre for Transition Education at the Australian National University and some of the critiques being made of the absurd schemes that float under that name. We have had a continual floating around by the Government of its transition program, as though that will help in some way to overcome unemployment. We have had the attempt to make second and higher degrees eligible for fees. That is one thing that Senator Teague managed to forget when he talked about eligibility. Now we have the ill-conceived loans scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many ways in which a loans scheme could be introduced and we have constantly championed one of them. I must admit that on the last platform on which I spoke on this matter the Australian Labor Party spokesman for education, who also spoke, had a go at me because I said that I was not in principle objecting to loans. He was totally against loans. Tonight I discovered that the ALP will vote for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Our position, as set out in our national policy, is that provided there is a reasonable TEAS and an indexed TEAS we will certainly look at loans. I believe it is a follow-on and that in that case we should talk about it as a supplement. At the moment we are talking about it and have to talk about it as an attempt to displace entirely the grants scheme. I am quite sure that the method used will be the method that was used in Sweden. The Government will not abolish TEAS allowances; it will simply fail to raise them, certainly in line with the consumer price index. Senator Teague who lauded the rises in the last Budget conveniently forgot the lack of rises in previous Budgets so we are still no further ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned that the literature about loans has raised some crucial points of educational concern which so far have not been discussed in this debate. I wish to raise some of those now. There is an indication from a Swedish study that was replicated in America with similar results-not indentical results -that loans encourage people to undertake courses which are short in duration and in which conceivably they believe that they have a higher than average chance of success. In other words, a certain amount of curriculum distortion is likely to take place with the imposition of a loans scheme in comparison to a grants scheme. This evidence is not conclusive but I believe that one needs to be careful when one is changing basic methods of funding in education. We need to know what will be the educational outcomes of those changes and we must seek to acquaint ourselves with what studies are available in relation to them. These judgments should not be made purely on economic grounds. They ought also to be made on educational grounds. I would be interested to hear the reply of the Minister for Education in relation to those studies which doubtless he has had brought to his attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned also, in the Australian context-in this respect, of course, we do not have any evidence simply because we have not had this situation occur before-with the vulnerability of the TAFE colleges in particular, because of the specific clientele that they have in the particular types of courses that they offer. It is well known, and I believe that the Government has not sought to disprove this or to suggest that it is not the case, the students from lower income families are certainly more discouraged to take on higher education when there is a loans scheme attached than they would otherwise be. The Government, I believe, has gone part way in this area, and it has endeavoured to seek at least a homogeneous group of students who may be available for loans. That is, by taking out only those students who are eligible for the assistance that is available at the moment, it has sought to suggest that this is a homogeneous group. Of course, it is nothing of the sort, for the particular reason that the criteria for those various grants differ quite considerably. Nevertheless, from all the studies that have been undertaken, the situation is evident that students who come from lower income families tend to be discouraged from going into debt and therefore would tend to be discouraged from undertaking courses to which there may be a debt attached. Because it seems that this Bill may very well pass the second reading stage, I have circulated an amendment which I believe would overcome the more deleterious effects of that situation. The amendment suggests a mode of repayment which would take away that fear from students who come from low income families. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the fear of many people who undertake TAFE college courses with regard to employment opportunities. This fear has been showing up in recent studies undertaken across post-secondary institutions. As a whole, it indicates that students at TAFE colleges are more concerned about the possibility of employment than those from CAEs or universities. If that is the case, again those people would react negatively to a situation in which, after graduation in some particular course at a TAFE college, they find themselves unemployed. The Government, I believe, has sought in its Bill to meet this situation in terms of the two-year holiday from repayment. I believe that that goes some way to alleviating that concern. However, in the growing unemployment situation, I do not believe that that could possibly be a substitute for that very real fear of entering into an obligation of some considerable magnitude. I think that the possible magnitude of this obligation is interesting. Let us take the situation of a person taking out the $1,000 loan per year as suggested, even with the 5 per cent rebate that the Government is offering. By the way, the Government is only offering the rebate; it is not legislating for it; it is not in the Bill and I will be seeking to move an amendment to put it into the Bill. Presumably that is the Government's intention; so I suppose it will not mind having it in the Bill. At the end of the course that person would have a debt of $6,048 plus bank charges, the amount of which we are not sure about at the moment. I say, by way of an aside, that Senator Teague really got carried away when he suggested that the banks would look after absolutely any student who might wish to take out a loan. Banks have not been all that forthcoming in relation to housing, which was the subject of the Bill we discussed previously, and I cannot see them being terribly concerned about knocking back students, except possibly those following the profession that the Minister professed to follow before he came into this House. That profession is always regarded as a good risk and certainly I am sure that most banks would be happy to make loans available to those students. However, arts students-for example, history students-would find it very difficult even to become teachers nowadays. In a number of other faculties they would find it excessively dificult, I believe, to get a loan out of a bank.</PARA>

I do not know whether he has thought about the consequences of that occurring. This would represent a combined debt of a staggering amount, presumably which again means, and I am sure Senator Harradine would be interested in this, a further attack on the family and the inability of that family to have children or to look forward to owning its own home, even without the problems mentioned by Senator Haines not so long ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that those types of considerations are pertinent when one is looking at the flow-on effects of the type of things that government undertakes. That is merely one example of the problems that may occur arising out of a debt and no employment, or a debt with employment but difficulty entering into any normal type of operation that one may want to enter into upon graduation. Of course, the whole nation is premised around the idea of the user paying. So I suppose really we are at a very basic level of loggerheads. The Australian Democrats hold very firmly to the notion that the country ought to invest in its tertiary education institutions, at this particular point of time, above all others. We believe that there are sufficient indications that unless we develop our human capital in this country, and I define human capital as the skills, the dexterity , the imagination, the knowledge, the insights of our citizens, as a country we do not have an economic future. I again remind the Senate that the Japanese Government, over eight years ago, made a deliberate policy decision to move very heavily into education funding. The reason for this decision was put down in its report on the development of Japan and the future of Japan to the year 2000. It was stated very clearly that Japan did not have the resources that many other countries had. It did not have basic minerals; it did not have a whole range of resources. But the Japanese knew that they had human resources, the knowledge, the intelligence, the understanding, the dexterity and the imagination of the citizens. We have those human resources also in Australia, to the same extent as Japan does. Yet in a resource rich country in terms of a whole range of other types of resources, we are saying we will rest on those other resources and neglect our human capital. The deliberate policies of Saudi Arabia are aimed at redirecting its funding away from the types of massive infrastructure development into education because it says that when the oil runs out it will need a basis for its future and its future will be in its people. That idea, that philosophy, would hold good at any time. But we believe it has particular relevance at this time in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> One need only look at the growth areas in other economies. Where are the growth areas in the United States economy? They are in technology, bio-technology and computer industries. Where is growth taking place in Japan? It is taking place in the same industries. In Switzerland, West Germany and Sweden it is taking place in the same industries. But is such growth taking place in Australia? No. The extent of our involvement is conducting a conference and issuing a Press release from the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson). We need to move heavily into this area and to invest up to the hilt in these types of industries. Therefore we have to invest in tertiary education. In the US economy there is a direct link between that element of growth, which after all is very small, and tertiary institutions. The United States believes that a dollar spent on education is a dollar well spent and better spent than anywhere else. That is the basic economic and philosophical notion that the Australian Democrats propound, and that is the basis for our objection to a loans scheme at this time . </PARA>
<PARA> We do not believe that we should be going around trying in some way to stop people taking up tertiary studies. Indeed, we are down by 12,000 tertiary students. We are not interested in running down our tertiary institutions and having fewer students in higher education. We are interested in spending more and more money and getting more and more students into those tertiary institutions. We wish to expand the number as rapidly as possible. We seek an expansion in particular vital areas. We believe that if these vital areas were injected into our economy both in terms of industrial development and the development of human capital to take up that advantage people would undertake those studies because they would see that on graduation there would be good prospects of employment. That is the type of general model into which we fit our objection to this scheme. We put forward the same reason in respect of our objection to fees. We object to all of the ad hockery that has gone on in place of a national education framework. That is the type of thing that we ought to be debating in this Senate but which we have not got around to yet. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had plenty of education debates in this place, but they have all been about this type of inane peripheral material. We are talking about $50m in this legislation when the economic future of this country is at stake. It is as serious as that. If education is not going to become a major element in the economic advance of this country then we really have blinkers on, we really are going backwards and we really cannot learn at all from these other economies which are picking themselves up and moving ahead. Education is the area we ought to be concerned about and it is the obligation which rests on the shoulders of the new Minister for Education. It is his responsibility to give his portfolio some life. The education portfolio has languished under his predecessors as though it was something that was needed because one has to have schools. I believe that many people in this country have placed their last hope in the new Minister for Education. They hope that he will give that type of leadership and display that type of foresight and will bring education back into focus, back into the centre of the arena and back where it should be discussed as the focal, crucial element in getting this country moving ahead. Why talk about $50m and the user pays principle and the other types of things raised by Senator Teague tonight? Such things pale into insignificance in terms of what education is about and the use to which it can be put if we really get down to the task. Let us have introduced some Bills which actually set out where we are going in that area. Let us stop the ad hockery and these inane debates about peripheral matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate to raise the matter of the scandalous state of student finance in general in Australia, to endorse substantially the remarks made by Senator Button and to a large extent to agree with the vehemence and the criticism made by Senator Macklin. The Australian Labor Party believes that the Government's very belated effort in this area of student financing indicates its inability to comprehend the need for the Parliament and the Government to have a proper input in investment for the future of our country. I found it rather distasteful to listen to the negative contribution made by the previous Government speaker, Senator Teague, who, in his rather pontificating way, struck a discordant note about the activities of a student association. He saw something sinister about people of a like mind coming together to form a common attitude in respect of education when he knows that that is the very way in which the Parliament itself operates. He sits as a mute in his party room and gets lectured to by his Ministers when the course of action that should be taken in the Parliament itself is being determined. I have not seen him in the years he has been here exercising any independence of attitude. He meekly follows in a slavish way whatever the party line might be in respect of the inadequate and completely inept policies being pursued by the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government, of course, has shown no commitment to providing an adequate grant based student financing system for Australian students. It is no wonder that we on this side of the House are completely dissatisfied with this legislation. My party, when it is elected to office some time within the next year, will be seeking to recast this proposal and to repeal the legislation. We will establish a decent and equitable system of student financing so far as young people are concerned. I can remember in my early days that it was considered adequate for the average person to have a primary school education. Then it became essential to have a secondary school education. Of course, in today's world it is absolutely essential to have a tertiary education to meet the sorts of challenges that clearly are facing all of the industrialised countries. The national government has a responsibility to play its part in this respect. Of course, this Government has neglected to provide proper student financing. It has attempted to fill the gap with stop-gap legislation. It has not recognised the need to take the steps that ought to be taken if we understand the role of education in the future development of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it ought to be pointed out to the Government that on several occasions the Senate has had to reject attempts by this Government to introduce fees for second degree students and that, of course, indicated the philosophical position of the Government. Fortunately, the Senate in its wisdom refused to go along with that piece of legislation because it recognised the vital role that tertiary education has in the future of our country if we are to compete with international trends and the developments that are taking place in the whole area of technology, as has been referred to previously by my party's speakers and by speakers on behalf of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of this Government is clear: It believes that education should remain something of a privilege for the well off. It is true that we have a fairly large middle class grouping in the Australian community, and the Government is prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to allow that grouping to be well represented in the tertiary education area. No real attempt is being made to provide the equality of opportunity which the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, and other Government spokesmen suggest from time to time that the Liberal Party is about. There is certainly no equality of opportunity indicated in this legislation, which will perpetuate the class differentiation that is so obvious in our universities today. We get this picture-I stress that it is just a picture-of the Government's inability to understand the hardship faced by those who choose to undertake full time study under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. A survey conducted in 1979 under the auspices of the Department of Education showed, in the words of the report, that 'total expenditure exceeded total income in the majority of cases'. </PARA>
<PARA> My comments on the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill revolve around two main points': First, the indecent lack of consideration with which the Government has brought in the loans scheme which this Bill proposes, and second, the need for a proper and wide-ranging look at student financing. The volume of representations and the numbers of letters from student bodies, academic organisations and university staff organisations over the last year or so indicate how much this Government is out of step, how much it is out of touch with the thinking that exists in these institutions. The Government, of course, has ignored all of those views and the feelings that have been expressed over the last year or two. It has presented this form of assistance to students as the answer to the expressions of concern and protest about the attitude taken by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that student loans will help students to meet the gap between their expenditure and their currently meagre incomes. It refuses, however, to acknowledge the paucity of the grants it provides through the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. As Senator Macklin has suggested, one would hope that the Minister for Education, Senator Peter Baume, who on occasions has certainly shown a little more understanding on these matters than some of his fellow Ministers, will argue, I hope successfully, for some improvements in these areas. The Government claims that because students will take out the loans provided by this scheme this indicates their acceptance. In fact, they have no alternative. The Government fails to see that students inevitably will find themselves forced to take out loans because of the complete and total inadequacy of TEAS. The Government refuses to acknowledge that a decent student financing system, one that offers access to post-secondary education for people from a broad range of socio-economic backgrounds, depends upon an adequate grants scheme. Student financing schemes that are based upon loans will create tremendous problems for the students. Of course, the Government does this because it fails to understand the valuable human resources which exist in this area. It fails to understand the technological challenge that is about us and the need to have an independent position in this country, arising out of a better education system, so that we can compete with the assistance that is so freely given in many other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The loans scheme has been put forward by the Government but it convinces nobody in the university field that it is adequate. It is five years since the considerations of the Butcher Committee on Student Loans. It is accepted that that Committee recommended that a loans scheme be set up. However, its report was accompanied by a dissenting minority report, and it convinced very few in the education or finance fields that loans were a good idea. Of course, the Government, acting as it invariably does in an ad hoc way, accepted the majority report. Both of the factors that were associated with the minority report are still true today. The Government has had five years since the report was first put down in which to convince students, administrators, bankers and financiers that loans are a good idea. It has failed dismally to get an acceptance of that concept. Let us look at what some of these people-the ones who should know about how a loan scheme will affect post-secondary education-have to say. I refer specifically to David Caro, the Chairman of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> All of us feel that the tertiary allowances scheme should be supported and we are worried that this may not be so as a consequence of the loans scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>He should know. He is involved in that area of education. The Chairman of the Australian Bankers Association has expressed doubts about the scheme. He wants the scheme to replace the TEAS allowance. He believes there will be substantial problems with this scheme if it is to be a supplement to the TEAS payments. Yet this is what the Government claims the proposed scheme should be. So we have some reluctance on behalf of the banking institutions, which after all are not even responding to the Government's requests to provide adequate funds for housing out of their invested funds. One cannot see any marked enthusiasm for their investment in this area. Here we have both confusion and dissatisfaction. In some respects there is even opposition to the scheme proposed in this Bill. I doubt whether that is any way to introduce a scheme that is supposed to help students. We can express considerable doubt, therefore, about whether this scheme will be satisfactory and will be accepted by students generally. </PARA>
<PARA> When one reads the views of the students one can see that there is a reluctance on their part to show any particular enthusiasm for the legislation that we are asked to approve tonight. The Opposition has taken the step of moving an amendment that the matter should go before the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts for inquiry and report by 16 November so that it can be examined in a little more detail. We do not believe the Government can justify rejecting that amendment when it has had five years in which to put into effect the recommendations of the Butcher inquiry. We suggest that the Parliament should exercise some jurisdiction in this matter. The Government has taken five years to convince itself of the correctness or otherwise of student loans. There is no evidence available that this is an acceptable scheme. I think it is proper that the Senate should exercise its right and have the matter considered by its own committee. It seems to the Australian Labor Party that the least it can do is to send this matter to its Senate Committee for further investigation. It is not only the question of confusion arising over student loans that warrants further study but the whole parlous state of student financing. This underlines and strengthens our view that a Senate inquiry into the legislation should be held. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that in 1975, not long after the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme was introduced by the Whitlam Government-one cannot argue that it was not a progressive and a very desirable step to create that so-called freedom of choice which we hear echoed time and time again in this place by Liberal Party spokesmen-a committee of inquiry was set up under the chairmanship of Doctor H. S. Williams. That Committee recommended a number of things regarding allowance levels-indexation, means testing and the like-but none of them have been accepted or followed up by this Government. We have had years of inactivity. We know that Government speakers will say that the Opposition is attempting to delay consideration of the Bill by having it sent to the Senate Committee for examination. This inaction, this failure to give proper consideration to the Williams Committee report, is one of the reasons why student financing is in the mess it is today. I think it is proper that the Government should take into condsideration the view of the students organisation . I know we have been regaled from time to time with all sorts of wild and outlandish criticism of the Australian Union of Students, but whether we like it or not the fact is that that body represents the considered view of student organisations in Australia. If this Government believes at all in listening to the views of people who represent the organisation of students, their views ought to be taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Williams Committee also recommended that regular reviews of student financing take place. Since that recommendation was made in 1975 not one proper review has occurred. So the Government stands indicted for years of inactivity. Of course we have seen how it was inactive not only in this area but also in the areas of tax evasion. It was pointed out before Senate Estimates Committee C, which met on Monday night, that on 14 different occasions the Commissioner of Taxation pointed out to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) the wholesale evasion of tax that was taking place. It is pretty clear now, from the way that the debate on tax evasion has developed, that there was no conviction in the Government's own ranks, in the Cabinet. Whilst the Government set up interdepartmental committees to look at Mr O'Reilly's recommendations for legislation to tighten up tax evasion, there was no will on the part of the Cabinet to do so. There was no determination to take advantage of the advice from the Commissioner of Taxation to avoid the sort of mess that the Government is now in in respect of taxation. That is just another indication of the indecision of this Government. It cannot agree on how to handle tax evasion; it cannot agree on student financing; and it cannot agree on the time of day. It is a government that is divided. It is a government that does not know where it is going. It is a government that ought to be thrown out of office at the first opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the legislation. There has been only one survey of any kind taken by a government instrumentality, and that was the 1979 Department of Education survey that I referred to earlier. What did that survey show? It was recognised by all who took part in it as being limited and partial. It worked with inadequate funds, inadequate resources and inadequate facilities. It was rushed in its consideration. It was merely a survey and it could not make any recommendations. The fact that the survey does provide us with useful information is a tribute to the organisations that assisted it, but in no way is it a proper review of student financing. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the proper function and role of the Senate is to review legislation. We have a government that is not able properly to carry out its role of governing for all of the people. That is the sort of government we have today. It cannot understand its role of intervention in society in order to create equality of opportunity. In this area the Government, as in so many other areas, has lurched from year to year with ad hoc and unplanned policies generally. In this case it has unplanned student financing policies. It is in the parlous state it is today because it has not got a clear and coherent position. I am talking generally. This year it has given some extra handouts in the way of allowances and proposed schemes, but that is all part of the stop-gap, ad hockery and confusion that is symptomatic of the Fraser Government. The Opposition's proposal is pretty simple. It is this: Before we go ahead and sow more confusion and create more hardship, let us stop and consider what we are doing. It is, of course, therefore essential that the Senate exercise its proper role, the review of legislation, and send this Bill to its Committee for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme has been with us since 1974. Today no one believes that it is an adequate scheme, but also no one is convinced that this Bill provides a proper alternative or supplement to the way in which the original scheme operated. We should therefore now consider the whole range of student financing properly and logically. This legislation fails to do that. The committee of inquiry suggested by the Opposition is a good place to start. We reiterate that education is a right and a necessity. Education is an investment in Australia's future. It ought to be considered as one of the most important investments for the future survival of our country because we are involved in a more competitive way than we have ever been. In view of this the Government must surely review its attitude to education and place it in a proper perspective. We should be in a position to provide that equality of opportunity which we believe is the right of all of those who want to have a tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> I compliment the Australian Union of Students on its representative capacity in this matter. I compliment it on its diligence and its submission. I believe it was a genuine attempt to place before the Parliament and the Government the genuine views of the students in our universities. I believe that the best way we can pay tribute to that submission is to adopt the amendment moved by Senator Button. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be worth pointing out to anyone who is taking any interest in this debate that the purpose of the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill 1982 is to provide for a subsidy on interest charged by banks on approved loans for the students and for the Commonwealth to give guarantees to banks that it will repay outstanding debts. I thought it might be worth stating at the beginning because the debate, so far as the Opposition speakers have been concerned tonight, has ranged over just about everything else. For some reason honourable senators from the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have been reluctant to address themselves properly to what the Bill really is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To Senator Gietzelt I can only suggest that the next time he gets someone to write his speech for him he gets someone with a higher level of education. The speech he just read to us in the Senate had precious little to do with this Bill , if anything. It could have been a speech on anything at all. In fact it reminded me of those cards one can buy where one crosses out certain words and leaves an appropriate word to go in the gap that is left in something that purports to be a message on something or other. That is about all that Senator Gietzelt's speech was. It was, of course, an exercise in propaganda. It was, as Senator Button clearly said in relation to his own speech, an exercise in relation to an election campaign, but did not claim to address itself to the Bill. This much I will say for the Democrat and Labor contribution to the debate : The representatives of both parties have been consistent. The Democrats have been consistent in their intellectual confusion in approaching Government Bills on education. The Labor Party has been consistent in its intellectual dishonesty in presenting its case in opposition to Government Bills. In the last 18 months the Senate has had before it a number of education Bills in which that has been the hallmark of the contribution by Opposition senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Typically, the Democrats have raised substantial objections to the Bill, based not on what it contains but on what might be in some subsequent Bill. I recall two debates in the Senate when a proposal that fees be introduced at the tertiary level for a very limited number of students was opposed by the Democrats on the grounds that it could mean that, at some time in the future, the Government would charge all tertiary students fees. It was said: 'Never mind what is in the Bill. Let us vote against a Bill that does not yet exist, if in fact it will ever exist'. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight Senator Macklin followed this typical line. He said that in other countries the purpose of introducing a loans scheme had been to replace other student support schemes. The Government, through the Minister for Education ( Senator Peter Baume) and through its announcements, has made very clear from the beginning in regard to its policies on the loans scheme, on the implementation of student support schemes, and on this particular loans scheme for tertiary students, that the loans are meant to supplement other student support schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the 1982 Budget effected substantial increases in student support. Grants under the Commonwealth Post-graduate Award Scheme have gone up by 48 per cent. The Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme level has gone up by 20 per cent. At no stage have Labor or Democrat senators addressed themselves to those facts. The loans scheme gives to students of limited other means access to additional finance if they choose to seek it. If, on top of the increases in student allowances, they want additional finance, this represents one of a number of possibilities available to them. I reiterate, this Bill provides for the subsidisation of the interest rate charged by banks. That is a feature of the loans scheme that again Democrat and Labor senators have ignored.</PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect is the guarantee to banks that the Government will repay outstanding debts on approved loans within prescribed limits. That is fundamental to the banks being involved, fundamental to the success of the scheme. In that form, given that the tertiary allowances, both under TEAS and the Commonwealth Post-graduate Awards Scheme, have been substantially increased, by 20 per cent and 48 per cent respectively, the loans scheme does what the Government said over 12 months ago it would do. It gives students of limited means access to cheap finance. It also gives them a choice. We have heard from a number of Opposition senators the implication that somehow or other this is designed to inhibit, to put down, tertiary education. Indeed, Senator Macklin said that the policy of the Government was to try to stop people from taking up tertiary studies. Given the framework of this Bill, that is a little difficult to follow. With all due respect to Senator Macklin, who is a very worthy student , he was himself a little difficult to follow tonight. He ranged far and wide. He began by saying that because of what had happened in other countries the Democrats would vote against the Bill. It was not a question of what the Bill did or of what the Government had been saying consistently since 1981 as to the purpose of the loans scheme. Nor was it a matter of what this Bill, combined with other policy decisions of the Government as announced in the Budget, proved was the policy on the funding of tertiary education. Apparently none of those things was felt to be important. It was rather a matter of what had happened under other governments in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that in that respect at least the Democrats have been consistent. That has been the basis of their objection to other government legislation but it really does not wash. The Democrats have to provide a better reason than that . They certainly have to do a little better than having Senator Macklin come here tonight whipping himself into a lather over how worthy is tertiary education. Judging by the outraged indignation in the tone of his voice, one must assume that he thought he was criticising the Fraser Government's policy on education. Of course, what he said actually had no relevance to this Government' s policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to repeat all that Senator Macklin said. I will assert that that is a fair statement of what he said and will merely pick up some of the points that he made. Time does not permit me to cover all of them. Indeed, it would be straining the patience of the Senate to expose it to the same drivel twice. The honourable senator made a very worthy statement but one that was nevertheless strange. He said: 'Education is an investment, not a cost.' I think it was a slip of the tongue. On the basis of what followed it would have been more appropriate had he said: 'Education is an investment, not a waste.' Even an investment represents a cost. Investing in something costs something. We agree that education is an investment, not a waste. We also agree that it costs money, so we have no dispute with Senator Macklin on his statement in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> It has always been the policy of the Liberal Party and of the Fraser Government that a substantial investment in education should be made at all levels. It was the Liberal Government of Sir Robert Menzies that initiated the policies which led to the great expansion of universities and colleges of advanced education in this country, making tertiary education truly accessible to more than just the very wealthy. I will admit that in saying that I am going back some way. I do so just to show that Liberal governments have been consistent in placing a very high priority on education and, specific to this debate, on tertiary education. I really expected Senator Macklin to bring up motherhood by the end of his speech, but perhaps he was a little too distressed. He observed that tertiary institutions are for the benefit of the country. I am pleased to announce that the Fraser Government agrees with that assertion. In fact it has consistently acted in that light. It did not always find it necessary to say so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, very good for the people-probably very good for the citizens of the country was what he meant. That is certainly what we think. There is no dispute about that. The dispute is as to the conclusion reached by the honourable senator, after the making of many worthy statements, that the Government is trying to stop people from taking up tertiary studies. Why on earth would the Fraser Government be doing that? Senator Macklin should look at the experience of other countries where presumably governments have set out to stop people from taking up tertiary studies. He could draw upon their reasons to state what were the reasons of the Fraser Government. It would represent the same kind of twaddle and would be no more germane to the argument; it would be absolutely irrelevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Fraser Government devotes enormous resources to tertiary studies and other levels of education. As I said in the beginning, the Democrats are consistent in their approach to this legislation. They do not like talking about it so they raise a different objection. Indeed, Senator Macklin said towards the end of his speech, by way of a summary of the Democrats' view of the Bill, that they had the same objection to it as they had to the Bill on fees. It was also fairly typical of Senator Macklin's approach that he did not specify what fees. During the debate on the earlier Bill he referred to fees generally, not fees for what- fees for students who already had academic qualifications or for a certain limited category of post-graduate students. Rather the Democrats raised the bogy of the imposition of fees generally, as something that might occur under some government at some time in the future. There was nothing on which to base that argument. The Bill did something else. The same objection was raised tonight. It was typical in that it was not worth trying to sell to the Australian people. I am sure that there are many students, as well as parents, guardians and supporters of students, who are aware that, through the Budget and this legislation, the Fraser Government is proposing that in addition to the granting of substantial increases in tertiary allowances for students, money will be made available cheaply to students, with preference being given to those most in need , in order to provide a source of financial support additional to what is available now. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Labor Party, in its basic argument which was really stated by Senator Button and was briefly alluded to in about the last two or three pages of Senator Gietzelt's speech, has said that this Bill should be sent to a Senate committee. It is a strange reference-strange in a number of ways. It is not strange that a Bill should be sent off to a Senate committee but strange in the manner of sending it off. As I said, this has been Government policy since April 1981. Senator Button has taken an active interest in education in his time in the Senate. For a substantial length of time he was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, the Committee to which he now seeks to send this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button's interest in education did not arise since the introduction of this Bill into the Senate in September this year. He had a fairly lively interest in it back in April last year when the Government announced its loans scheme policy and, indeed, prior to that. However, it did not occur to Senator Button, either before or since April 1981, to suggest that the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts might look at the value of a loans scheme to tertiary students. As a concept, it is not new. As has been pointed out by other Opposition senators, other countries have introduced it. It has been a matter of debate in education journals and elsewhere for years in this country-a debate to which Senator Button would not have been oblivious. But tonight he thinks it would be a good idea that the Committee look at the subject. It is a belated interest in those terms. He has known that the Government was going to legislate on the matter and he made no move. If he ever thought that the Government might legislate on it before the Government announced that intention, he made no move.</PARA>
<PARA> But now in October 1982 he makes the move and gives the Committee five weeks in which to carry out its investigation and present its report. All of us who have been members of Senate standing committees know how long an investigation, whether it is a general reference or a reference on a Bill, takes. A proper investigation takes months. If all the people who have an interest in it, including the Australian Union of Students, make a submission, give evidence and bring their learned opinion to bear, it cannot be done in a little more than five weeks. Five weeks will only give an opportunity for senators of a declared political view to express their view through another forum. They can do it here in the Senate tonight. They can declare themselves on the principle. Senator Button, with all his experience in education and on Senate standing committees, gives the Committee five weeks to investigate a Bill and report to the Senate. That is bad enough. But in the second section of the reference Senator Button directs the Committee on what are to be its priorities in considering this Bill. The motion states:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Committee take into account (i) the CTEC reference to the declining participation rate in tertiary education and the contribution which the inadequacy of TEAS makes to this alarming development . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That struck me as a little strange. I was not aware that there was a Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission report that drew any such conclusion that the declining participation rate in tertiary education was in any way attributable to the inadequacy of TEAS. I was not aware that there was a report of CTEC on that subject. When I read the motion a little closer, I realised that it did not say that. It states that there is a CTEC reference to the declining participation rate in tertiary education. In the same sentence and without any special punctuation it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> and the contribution which the inadequacy of TEAS makes to this alarming development. </PARA>
<PARA>That second allegation, that TEAS has something to do with participation rates, comes from Senator Button, not from CTEC. I am reliably informed that the report on this reference on the subject of participation rates in tertiary education which does not prejudge the reasons which could be many and varied is not expected before December. But on 16 November, Senator Button wants to have a report which takes these things into account. By then we will not know the finding of CTEC. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA> the finding of the study on tertiary student finances that the proportion of tertiary students of less privileged backgrounds is declining;</PARA>
<PARA>I am not saying that there is not a study that states that the proportion of tertiary students of less privileged backgrounds is declining. I am just wondering which study it is. Is it a study by the Australian Labor Party? Is it a study by the Australian Union of Students? What study is it? Whatever it is, it is quite improper that a Senate standing committee, being asked to look at a Bill, should be told the two things that should be of primary account. Senator Button's motion relating to the Senate Standing Committee goes on to state that it wants the Committee to report on the proposed agreement between the Government and certain banks. I suppose that is something it could investigate and report on. According to Senator Button, the second thing that it ought to report on is the need to provide for regular and automatic adjustments to TEAS to prevent the proposed loans scheme replacing TEAS as the basic form of student assistance. There is nothing in this Bill that leads to the loans scheme replacing TEAS as the basic form of student assistance. I repeat-the Government has repeated this also-that the loans scheme will not replace TEAS as the basic form of assistance. The Government has increased TEAS by 20 per cent. The loans are a supplement to TEAS. </PARA>
<PARA> Some reference was made by Senator Gietzelt to Whitlam Government policies on education. If regular and automatic adjustments-one takes it that means some form of indexation of TEAS-are a good idea, and indexation is not a new idea; it has been around a long time, it would have been a very appropriate time for the Labor Government to carry out that policy in 1975 when the inflation rate of Australia was 16 per cent plus. The Labor Government was in charge of TEAS then, having introduced it in 1974. It decided not to index it. That is not an argument against indexation but if that is the Labor Party's policy-it was not its policy when it was in charge of TEAS-it is not for the Labor Party to direct a Senate committee in the context of examining a Bill that gives loan guarantees in relation to banks what ought to be in the Bill on another subject. </PARA>
<PARA> TEAS is provided for elsewhere. It does not need to be provided for in the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill. It is quite inappropriate for an Opposition senator or any senator to suggest that legislation, when sent to a Senate standing committee for investigation and report, should seek to make recommendations which could so change that legislation. Firstly, there is the possibility-not a certainty but a possibility-that in principle some aspect of Government policy might be changed to Opposition policy. Secondly, there is the possibility of introducing into the Bill an element which does not belong in this Bill but belongs elsewhere. I shall give Senator Button credit where credit is due. He made the statement that this is the Labor Party's policy for the next election campaign and, therefore, he did at least make it clear that the purpose of his contribution was somehow or other directed to the next election campaign. I prefer that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was the message that came through. I was referring to Senator Button's statement of Labor Party policy and how he would like to put what he claimed to be Labor Party policy into other legislation which is not Labor legislation but which is the present Government's legislation. At least Senator Button was clearer on that than was Senator Gietzelt. Senator Gietzelt ought to be a little more careful in education debates that he does his own homework more thoroughly. The rhetoric was there; the substance was not. When Senator Gietzelt was measuring so strong on Australian Labor Party and Whitlam policies on tertiary education, he completely ignored a point that honourable senators on this side tried to draw to his attention at that time. We would have been interested in his comment, in the context of what he was saying, on the subject of the Whitlam Government policies on tertiary funding in 1975, when it abolished triennial funding for universities and went on to annual funding. The Hayden Budget of 1975 threw university and tertiary funding into chaos.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those in the Labor Party in 1975 who knew about education and its needs knew that that would be the effect. That would have been a good time for Senator Gietzelt to have shown his interest in tertiary education. I would like him to remember that because if he has any hand in Labor Party policies, alternative policies, in regard to how tertiary education should be funded then he ought to have full knowledge of the mess Labor made of tertiary funding in 1975. Senator Gietzelt told us that this Bill would perpetuate class differentiation. He was talking about middle class preferences. I reiterate that the Bill is for the benefit of those on lower incomes, who come from lower income families, who have to qualify under means tests which presently apply in the tertiary sector. It is a reinforcement for those on lower incomes, not that class to which Senator Gietzelt referred which has some privilege, according to him, in terms of money and access to money. The essence of all that is that Senator Gietzelt's speech was rhetoric and not substance. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I pay tribute to the Minister for Education, Senator Peter Baume , for his education policies. Senator Gietzelt made slighting reference to Senator Baume. He damned him with faint praise. He said he believed him to be a good Minister and that it is unfortunate that the Minister is in the position he is in. Senator Baume is indeed a good Minister for Education, as witnessed by this Bill and other policies announced in the context of the Budget that he has achieved for education in Australia. He has shown that he is a Minister who has fundamentally sound motivation in the field of education and specifically in the context of this debate in the tertiary education sector. I, along with others on the Governmnent side and outside this Parliament, welcomed and congratulated him for that 48 per cent increase in the Commonwealth Post-graduate Awards Scheme, an area in which there was clear need for an increase. I and others congratulated him and congratulate him now on the 20 per cent increase in the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and in the reinforcing of the basic thrust of Government policy as exemplified in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill 1982. It ought to be said at the outset that the Australian Labor Party is not utterly opposed in every circumstance to students in tertiary education institutions being assisted by way of loans of a particular type or administered by particular authorities. But we are adamantly opposed to the Tertiary Student Loans Scheme. We are not at all pacified by Senator Martin and other Government spokesmen reiterating time and again that the loans scheme is meant to be supplementary to and is not intended to replace the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme as the better mechanism for providing financial assistance to those Australian students who require that assistance in order to undertake those essential tertiary studies-essential for their own development, for the growth of the wealth of this country and indeed for the bettering of society as a whole. As I have said, we are assured time and again that this loans scheme is supplementary to the funds that will be provided by this Government through TEAS and other schemes of assistance. But when one notes the key commitment of government moneys outlined in clause 5 of the Bill, one finds a very strange clause indeed. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Guarantees in respect of loans made in any year shall not guarantee the repayment of principle moneys exceeding in the aggregate $50,000,000, or such greater amount as is prescribed in respect of that year. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, whereas at the moment the Government by that clause is committing itself to the payment of some $2m-being the 5 per cent interest subsidy on the $50m principal moneys there mentioned, as a maximum-the Government can at any time by regulation increase the amount of principal moneys in respect of which it can give an interest subsidy. So if this Government decides that rather than increase TEAS in accordance with the cost of living adjustments, by which it ought to be increased, it will make available somehow to Australian students $250m by way of assistance, then all the Government has to do is commit itself to repayment of 5 per cent by way of interest subsidy of $250m-that is, raise its commitment under this Bill, by regulation and not by coming to the Parliament, to an amount of $10m. That $250m will be available from the banking system by Government edict for these student loans. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, there within the key committal of Government moneys to this scheme lie the seeds of the replacement of TEAS and other forms of assistance to students. It will be done not by coming back to this Parliament, by way of a Bill seeking extra funds, but by way of regulation. Hence we are not at all pacified by the constant reiteration of the claim that this scheme is not meant to replace TEAS. That is why the Labor Party is opposed in principle to this scheme of loans but finds itself, in the absence of a better TEAS scheme, compelled perhaps by the end of the day to support this Scheme at least for the 1983 academic year. Then, when we are in government, whilst retaining all the commitments made under this Bill we will not continue this particular method of providing finance to students. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, loans schemes can operate on behalf of students in tertiary institutions in quite reasonable ways. In fact, many campuses and colleges of advanced education do operate such schemes. For example, at the University of Tasmania-my own university-the university administered schemes into which Kim Beazley put sums of money, beginning in 1973, are well administered and well regarded by the students and by the institutions of learning in which they operate. They are administered by people who by their close proximity to students and knowledge of the lifestyle of students, know correctly and definitely what difficulties a student might be facing in coping with a rental problem or the general maintenance of a reasonable lifestyle while undertaking studies. In fact, I have information from Mr Andrew Wilson, the current President of the Students Representative Council at the University of Tasmania, that the loans scheme operating at that University provides loans to students generally up to about $500. The loans are interest free for the first six months , 3 per cent is paid for the duration of studies and then normal rates of interest apply once the course has been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> That sort of system operating within the institution itself has proved extremely effective in ameliorating some difficulties which students face in the course of their studies. Students, understanding the nature of the lending authority, give an undertaking to repay according to the terms of the loan. I do not know of many, if any, cases of bad debt in this situation but the very structure of this Bill indicates that the Government expects that there will be bad debts. The banking system has obviously insisted that the Government guarantee the loans scheme being put forward by the Government tonight. In other words, the Labor Party would like to see further funds put into university or college of advanced education administered schemes as an aspect of that student counselling, that student assistance, which any education institution which takes a comprehensive interest in its students' wellbeing ought to attempt to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA> So, our real objection is that there lies in the Bill the very kernel of destruction of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme as the preferred system of providing assistance. We also have extreme misgivings about the banking system's role in relation to students making application. Clause 3 says that an approved loan 'means a loan made . . . for the purpose of contributing to the maintenance and educational expenses of the student'. Whilst the people concerned with counselling services, welfare services and loan services administered within the university or college of advanced education, people who are close to students and to their lecturers and to the whole system of learning going on at that place, may well understand and be able to check and verify that the loan is for the purpose of contributing to the maintenance and educational expenses of a student, I doubt very much whether the ordinary bank manager or lesser person within his bank establishment will be able to verify that in fact the loan will be used for that purpose. So long as the student approaching the bank fulfils the criteria set out in clause 3 (2), I think that the bank would be required to make the moneys available without, as I say, verifying that the moneys are really needed for the maintenance and educational expenses of the student. </PARA>
<PARA> However, our major objection to the banking system being used for the purpose of making loans available to students is that whilst indeed there is a Government guarantee, Government spokesmen have indicated that banks will be expected to pursue the student for repayments of the principal and interest due by every means at the banks' disposal, including, obviously, tracing the student if the student should move-interstate, perhaps, or even overseas-and taking such judicial remedies, court remedies, as may be available. In other words, the guarantee comes in as an absolute last resort as far as the Government is concerned. The banks will be required to make a proper assessment as to whether the student is likely to be able to repay the loan. In making that assessment, surely the bank would have to take into account such factors as the possibility of the student not only successfully completing the studies but also moving fairly rapidly into a sphere of employment which will enable repayment to be made within the stated contractual period. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many students emerging from various faculties, other than, say, medicine or engineering, in respect of whom it will be very difficult indeed for a bank to say that a particular person, at the end of his studies, will emerge into a situation of full employment and will thereby be able to undertake repayment of loans. In other words, the banks are still required to make their own judgment, bankers' judgments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague says no. He is saying that the banks will just open their doors and rely absolutely on the Government guarantee, which I find an incredible proposition. That is not in harmony with the statement of the Minister in the second reading speech, where it is stated, that the banks have to pursue all remedies open to them before the Government guarantee comes into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The banks have to make their own assessment. As Senator Macklin probably pointed out in his speech, student teachers in particular will find it extremely difficult in the next few years to persuade any banker that they are likely to move into employment of a full time character for some time after their graduation. In my home State of Tasmania it has recently been announced by the Liberal Government, led by Mr Gray, that the holders of teacher studentships who were guaranteed positions in the Government's teaching service will not now be able to fill those positions in 1983. In fact they have been encouraged to go to the Northern Territory and then perhaps to return to Tasmania after they have had some experience in the Norther Territory. Of course that has increased the sense of uncertainty in relation to employment and, therefore, the ability to repay loans of that body of students. I believe that experience will be multiplied in many other instances as we live in an economy which does not provide the employment opportunities which ought to be available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The banks have been asked by the Government to take on this role. The reason why they have been asked to take on this role is that the university councils right around Australia have refused to be involved. My colleague, Senator Colston recalled, as I recall, the University of Adelaide Council which stated, I think in Feburary or March of 1981, that it would not co-operate in administering a loan scheme of the type proposed by the Government, on the grounds that it would deter disadvantaged students and diminish equality of opportunity. That was the statement of the University of Adelaide Council-not a body of academics, not the professorial board but a council-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was asked by the razor gang which the Minister for Education has conveniently forgotten. The razor gang said that the loan scheme would be administered by the education institutions, the universities and the colleges of advanced education. The University of Adelaide Council responded to that part of the report of the razor gang which I recall very well indeed. That was the report of a body composed, as I have said, not only of academics but also of people from the general community. They could see the way in which this loan scheme would operate to the disadvantage of Australian students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another reason for grave misgivings concerning this Bill is that when one reads what an approved loan means it is defined as:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a loan made-</PARA>
<PARA>Amongst other things-</PARA>
<PARA>for the purpose of contributing to the maintenance and educational expenses of the student . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One wonders what is embraced in the term 'educational expenses'. One can legitimately raise in this chamber the question whether fees come within the definition of educational expenses and whether indeed we are faced with what has been a steady progression in the legislation brought before this chamber by this Government over the last three or four years since I have been a member of parliament whereby it has placed a requirement on students to pay fees in our tertiary education institutions. First it was the overseas students. Then it was post-graduate students. All this was done, of course, without a mandate from the electorate; it was never mentioned in election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> One can legitimately ask whether an 'approved loan' has been defined in a way which now permits the Government to introduce a contribution-a partial contribution admittedly-on the form of some sort of fee to be paid by first degree students within our tertiary education institutions. The loan, of course, as defined would be available to cover that fee requirement. In other words, there is a very grave fear in the education community that this legislation is preparing the way as a prelude to the setting up of machinery to enable the banking system to provide the money by executive fiat, as I have outlined, in order to enable students then to borrow money in order to pay their fees. In fact it is interesting to note that the maximum amount which it is said that a student can borrow in any one year is $1,000 which would be about the amount that would be expected to be paid in any system of fees introduced for first degree students within our universities or colleges of advanced education. So, one can see reasons why not only the student bodies themselves but also the councils of the universities and colleges of advanced education have opposed the concept of a loan scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the improvement of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme remains the single, most effective way of removing the barriers which contribute to frustrate access to tertiary education by those on low and middle incomes or families with low and middle incomes. Particularly is this the case where the young adult needs to travel away from home to a centre of tertiary education. I have had very explicit experience of that on the north-west coast of Tasmania where students seeking further tertiary studies have to go either to Hobart or Launceston in order to pursue those studies. Their families find it extremely difficult to support them away from their homes. I recall bringing to the notice of the Senate last year the fact that participation rates by north- west and west coast students in Tasmanian tertiary education institutions were way below those of students from comparable suburbs and comparable income brackets in Hobart and Launceston. Parents are finding it extremely difficult to support them in the three or four years they are away from home, especially whilst their siblings are still at home or perhaps undertaking secondary education and all the expenses that are associated with it. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Macklin quite rightly pointed out, the money that might be invested by the community in further support for and expansion of TEAS is repaid as the students who benefit from those tertiary studies eventually move into employment . By earning money appropriate to their qualifications and by paying tax on a progressive tax scale they put money back into revenue year after year. If there is a fair, equitable and progressive taxation system the moneys which ought to be paid in support of students in tertiary education do come back to the community. Of course it not only comes back from those who are immediately conerned; those who have, by achieving tertiary qualifications, been able to move into the higher income bracket. As Senator Macklin also quite rightly pointed out, there is a correlation generally between the numbers of those participating successfully in such tertiary education and the general wealth produced in the community. It is that general increase in the gross wealth of Australia, and indeed in the social well-being of Australia which is brought about by greater participation in tertiary education, that will once again generate the moneys which are needed to support those undertaking such studies. There is no doubt that the future of Australian society lies in developing a highly educated people. We need skilled minds to create wealth from high technology applied to our national resourcees and also to enable those who are not in paid employment to fulfil themselves as human beings with a capacity to creatively use their time. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst not wishing to prolong the debate I think it is essential to reply to some of the charges which were made by Senator Martin against my colleague Senator Button. She claimed that not only in the course of his remarks but also in the wording of the amendment which he moved on behalf of the Labor Party he failed to substantiate, by footnote on the amendment, the source of the remarks involved. I have in my hand now 'Studies of Tertiary Student Finances Volume 3' which was undertaken by Gruen, McMaster and Webb. It is a validation study of the costs of full time tertiary students. On page 15 of Volume 3, in most explicit terms, this is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The predominant reason why students are not on any assistance scheme is that their parents' incomes are too high (i.e., 78 per cent of TEAS non-recipients' reasons according to the 1979 survey). In our view, this suggests that the shift in the full-time student population towards financing by parents-or by themselves-has led to a relative decrease in full-time university and CAE students from less privileged backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words it is the conclusion of that report that there has been a relative decrease in full time university and CAE students, if they come from less privileged backgrounds, participating in those studies. It suggests that the reasons for that is the inadequacies of TEAS as revealed by the analysis in the report. One finds an absolute validation in that report for the amendment moved by Senator Button insofar as it speaks of the declining participation rate in tertiary education and the contribution which the inadequacy of TEAS makes to this alarming development. I think it ought to be put on record that nothing in the proposals put forward by the Labor Party, and on its behalf by Senator Button, cannot be substantiated, but they do need and would benefit from a fuller analysis within a Senate committee. It is for that reason that I support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 is an omnibus Bill, gathering together those social security and welfare initiatives of the 1982-83 Budget that require legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Part VI of the Bill contains the major initiatives it deals with in the form of amendments to the Social Security Act 1947. Part II amends the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954, and Part V the Delivered Meals Subsidy Act 1970. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also deals, in Parts III and IV, with consequential amendments to the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 and the Defence (Re- establishment) Act 1965, and makes minor amendments to the Social Services Amendment Act 1979 (in Part VII) and Social Services Amendment Act 1981 (in Part V111). There are further minor amendments to the main Acts in the other parts of the Bill. Since these minor amendments have no policy significance and do not involve expenditure, I do not propose to discuss them in detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The major initiatives embodied in this Bill consolidate and extend the steps taken by the Government in last year's Budget to direct available increases in welfare expenditure to those in the greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981-82 we identified three groups as being in need of particular help. These were families with three or more children, pensioners who pay private rents, and those single unemployment beneficiaries over 18 whose benefits are not automatically indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> Our assistance to them, through increased rates of family allowance for third and subsequent children, increased supplementary assistance and an increased single rate of unemployment benefit, represented, in our view, the best use of the increases in expenditure we were able to make at that time over and above the increases to which we were committed by the regular twice-yearly CPI-linked increases in most standard pension and benefit rates. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1982-83 Budget we have again introduced measures that will assist all three of these groups, as well as taking further steps to alleviate some of the pressure points in the system-particularly those that result from inflation. We have also enhanced the incentives for recipients of social security payments to improve their own positions, and so become less dependent on the government. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's Budget provides for an increase in social security and welfare expenditure by my department from the $9997 million in 1981-82 to $11,471 million. After allowing for the additional payday last year this is an effective increase of 18 per cent. This is a somewhat larger increase than we have seen in this area in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> A large part of the 1982-83 increase-some 75 per cent-is accounted for by the guaranteed indexation provisions I have already mentioned, increases in the estimated number of pensioners and beneficiaries my department will assist during the coming year, and other cost increases that are unavoidably built into the system. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill embodies most of the major initiatives, apart from some increases in overall funds available for certain subsidy programs, that account for the remainder of this year's increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to explaining the main initiatives contained in the Bill. I have had circulated, a detailed explanatory memorandum for the information of honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 of this Bill amends the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 to increase the rate of personal care subsidy for frail aged people. </PARA>
<PARA> This subsidy helps organisations providing accommodation for elderly people to meet the cost of employing staff to provide additional services for frail aged residents, such as assistance with bathing or dressing, room cleaning, personal laundry, supervision of medicine, or for a staff member to be available at all times. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of June 1982 a total of 780 hostels were receiving the subsidy, helping to meet the cost of additional services for approximately 21,700 frail aged residents. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill increases the subsidy from $80 to $120 for each eligible person for a four-week period (or from $20 to $30 a week) with effect from 6 July 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> This rise represents an increase of 100 per cent in the subsidy since October 1980, when the rate was last increased (from $15 to $20 a week), and will help to ensure that a high standard of care continues to be provided for our frail aged citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated expenditure on this subsidy for 1982-83 is $35 million-an increase of 57 per cent over last year's outlay. </PARA>
<PARA>Delivered Meals Subsidy Act</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The subsidy for meals-on-wheels services is increased by an amendment to the Delivered Meals Subsidy Act 1970. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 22 of the Bill will increase the subsidy available from October 1982 from 45 to 55 cents for a meal where a Vitamin C supplement (in the form of fresh fruit or fruit juice) is provided, and from 40 to 50 cents for other meals . This is an increase of 22 and 25 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of June 1982, 738 organisations were receiving a Commonwealth subsidy for the provision of meals-on-wheels and some 9,650,000 meals were delivered in 1981-82. This compares with 8,947,000 meals delivered in 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the Commonwealth began providing subsidies for meals-on-wheels in 1970 it has spent nearly $23 million on this important from of help for elderly people at home, and our increased assistance this year demonstrates the value we place on the effective operation of meals-on-wheels services. </PARA>
<PARA>Social Security Act 1947</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The other main Budget initiatives requiring legislation all involve amendments to the Social Security Act 1947 and are dealt with by Part VI of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments make a number of important adjustments to the system of social security pensions and benefits, and family allowances. They also introduce several significant new initiatives in the social security field. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose to deal with these measures as they affect the major client groups of my Department, rather than following the strict sequence of clauses in this part of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Initiatives for the Unemployed</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The single rate of unemployment benefit for people aged 18 years and over who have no dependants will be increased by $6.30 a week, bringing that rate to $64. 40 a week (Clause 77). </PARA>
<PARA> This rate will be equal to half the married rate of unemployment benefit, taking into account the automatic CPI-linked increases that will come into effect in November, which will increase the standard rates of benefit to $77.25 for a single person over 18 with dependants and $128.80 for a married couple. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of benefit for single unemployment people and sickness beneficiaries aged 16 and 17 years will also be increased by $4, giving them a total of $40 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The new rates will take effect from each individual's first payday in November 1982 (Clause 105). </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, to encourage unemployed people to take advantage of opportunities to earn extra income and gain job experience by casual work, they will be allowed to earn more without losing their entitlement to benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> The more generous income test that will apply from November 1982 is given effect by clause 83 of this Bill. It will mean that everyone who receives unemployment or sickness benefit will be able to have $10 a week of private income without affecting their rate of benefit at all. The amount currently allowed is $3 a week for single people under 18 and $6 for everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the partial taper introduced by the Government in 1980 will be extended so that beneficiaries who have more than $10 a week private income will retain 50 cents a week for every dollar of extra income up to an income limit of $60. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this is that the maximum rate of benefit will be reduced by only half the amount of income the person has between $10 and $60. </PARA>
<PARA> This will represent a substantial increase in the amount that can be earned before benefit is reduced by a full $1 for every $1 of income. At present the upper limit is only $40 for single people under 18 and $50 for others. </PARA>
<PARA>Pensioners</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Most pensioners will benefit from the automatic CPI-linked increases in the rates of pension that will come into effect in November and will increase the single rate of pension by $3.10 to $77.25 a week and the married rate by $5.20 to $128.80 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition the Government has recognised that many pensioners who have a small amount of income apart from their pension have been hard hit by inflation, and that some adjustment in the amounts of private income pensioners can have without affecting their entitlement to a full pension should now be made. </PARA>
<PARA> From November 1982, single pensioners will be able to have $30 of private income a week and couples $50 a week before their pension is affected. This change is embodied in clause 36 of the Bill for age and invalid pensions. It will also apply to widow pensioners and supporting parent beneficiaries. This is the first adjustment in these income limits for several years and will increase them from their current levels of $20 a week for single people and $34.50 for couples. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of these changes will be that some 430,700 pensioners with private incomes above the existing free areas will receive higher pensions. About 70 per cent of these will receive an increase of $5 a week (single) or $7.75 a week for a married couple. Some 16,000 people who are not now entitled to a pension will become eligible for a small part pension of up to $5 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> This initiative will result in an increase in the disposable incomes of these pensioners, who will be further assisted in this regard by the new pensioner tax rebate which is being introduced to protect pensioners with a modest income from being taxed. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 59 of the Bill increases the income limit for pensioner health benefits. These benefits are available to social security pensioners, including supporting parent beneficiaries, and to sickness beneficiaries, and repatriation service pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> We are proposing to increase the limits for these benefits, which were last adjusted in 1979, because we are concerned that a number of pensioners may have lost entitlement to fringe benefits, because their private incomes have risen above the existing limits through no action of their own. We are also concerned that some pensioners may be placing themselves at a disadvantage by arranging their financial affairs so as to keep their incomes below the current limits and qualify for a card. The increase in the income limits should help people in both these categories, and should encourage pensioners to enjoy the full advantage of any private assets they may have. </PARA>
<PARA> People who qualify for pensioner health benefit cards are entitled to a range of Commonwealth concessions, the most important being free medical and hospital treatment, free pharmaceuticals and telephone rental concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> The income limits at which entitlement to pensioner health benefits ceases will rise from November 1982 to $54 a week for a single person and $90 a week for a married couple, compared with the current limits of $40 and $68. A new uniform increased limit of $20 for each dependent child in a family on top of the base limits is also to apply. The additional income limits for children currently vary between $11 and $17 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the changes will be that the new limit for a single person with one dependent child will be $74 a week, and for a couple with one child $110 a week. For each extra child the limit will rise uniformly by $20 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 59 also provides that the higher limits will apply to eligibility for pensioner funeral benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> People who receive sheltered employment allowance have special income limits for pensioner fringe benefits. For a married couple with no children, this will be increased to $90 a week, the same as for other married pensioner couples. For single people receiving sheltered employment allowance, the limit will remain at its current level of $68 a week, still $14 higher than for other penioners and beneficiaries. However, the increase to $20 a week in the additional limit for each child will apply to both these groups. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these measures, the supplementary assistance or allowance payable to pensioners and beneficiaries who pay private rent is increased by Clauses 39, 50 and 80 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Supplementary assistance or allowance is available for pensioners, supporting parent beneficiaries, and long-term sickness beneficiaries (that is those of 6 or more weeks standing) who have little or no income apart from the pension or benefit and pay private rent or board and lodging. Last year the maximum rate of payment was increased by $5 to $8 a week. This year it will be further increased by $2 to $10 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 89 of the Bill increases the incentive allowance paid to recipients of sheltered employment allowance in lieu of supplementary assistance to the same level of $10 a week. For these people the allowance is free of any income test and does not take into account whether rent is paid or not. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of this statement pensioners who rent private housing are recognised by the Government as having a particular need for assistance-hence our further effort to help them in this year's Budget. This new increase will particularly benefit pensioners with less than $16 a week in private income who pay more than $26 a week in rent. </PARA>
<PARA> Some State housing authorities also pay rental subsidies to private tenants. To recognise these State initiatives in the housing area and to ensure that private tenants receive the full benefit of them, clauses 29 and 74 of this Bill exempt such rent subsidies from counting as income for the pension and benefit income tests. This exemption will apply, to give one example, to people receiving rent relief subsidised under the Commonwealth's Mortgage and Rent Relief Scheme through State and Territory Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> A further small but important change is made by clause 47 of the Bill. From November 1982 women living overseas who qualify for wives' pension may, when their husbands die, qualify for a widows pension without having to return to Australia. The position of women in these circumstances has been of concern for some time and has been raised on a number of occasions by the Opposition Spokesman on welfare matters, Senator Grimes. I am pleased that we have been able to take steps to resolve this problem in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Disabled People</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill reflects the special needs of disabled people in several ways apart from the increases in general income limits for pensions and income limits for pensioner health benefits that I have already referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular it introduces a series of measures that will be of special assistance to disabled people who are in the workforce or who want to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 90 of the Bill adds a new Part to the Social Security Act 1947, establishing a 'mobility allowance' of $10 a week for severely handicapped people who are in employment or undertaking vocational training, and who are unable to use public transport because of their disability. </PARA>
<PARA> This benefit, which will be available from April 1983, will cost an estimated $ 18m in a full year. It will be free of any income test or income tax. The benefit will not be available to those receiving the benefit of sales tax exemptions on new motor vehicles, or who receive the benefit of a car under the repatriation ''gift car'' scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been designed specifically to recognise the additional travel costs incurred by disabled people who undertake employment or vocational training and the fact that such people are often unable to take advantage of the sales tax exemptions on new motor vehicles. The scheme also recognises that participation in the workforce by such people is often precarious, by providing a three month period of grace during which they will continue to receive the allowance even though they have lost their employment or ceased training. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to introduce such a scheme as quickly as possible to meet pressing needs in this area, but it will be kept under close review to make sure it is effective in its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> From 10 March 1983, a new form of income maintenance payment will be introduced for people who undertake Commonwealth rehabilitation program and who otherwise would be eligible for another social security pension or benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The new 'rehabilitation allowance' established by clauses 97 and 98 of the Bill will be at the same rates as the person's social security pension or benefit, unless they are receiving a sickness or unemployment or special benefit which is less than the invalid pension rate. In that case, the person will be treated as an invalid pensioner in setting the rate of the rehabilitation allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The rehabilitation allowance will be provided under the same conditions as invalid pension-that is, income tested, but income tax free-and will attract the same fringe benefits. It may be paid during the rehabilitation program and for up to 6 months afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA> The current rehabilitation training allowance will be re-structured to reflect this initiative, requiring consequential amendments to the Compensation ( Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 and the Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965. The training allowance will be paid as an additional benefit to people undertaking rehabilitation training who receive the rehabilitation allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that some 4,500 people out of the 6,000 accepted annually by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service will be eligible for rehabilitation allowance, which will involve a net cost of about $1m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that single or young unemployment beneficiaries and young sickness beneficiaries undertaking rehabilitation programs will be particularly assisted by this benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also a number of measures in the Bill designed to remove the anomalies previously existing in the treatment of handicapped people attending different categories of special therapy and training services. For example, the incentive allowance paid to people in sheltered employment, which I have already mentioned will be increased from $8 to $10 from November, will also be extended, by Clause 33, to invalid pensioners undertaking activity therapy and adult training programs in centres financed under the Handicapped Persons Welfare Program. This allowance will be paid under the same terms as to recipients of sheltered employment allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, to improve incentives for invalid pensioners to participate in activity therapy and adult training centres, the higher income limit of $68 a week for fringe benefits that applies to single sheltered employment allowances will also apply, from November 1982, to single invalid pensioners participating in the programs of such centres (Clause 60). </PARA>
<PARA>Families</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the very important measures contained in this Bill for the assistance of families. Our initiatives in this area have been designed bearing in mind the extra costs that all parents undertake in bringing up children, and the particular difficulties faced in this area by families with low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> To help in meeting these extra costs, clause 65 of the Bill will increase the rate of family allowance by 50 per cent for the first and second children in a family from the endowment period commencing in October 1982. This will bring family allowance for the first child to $22.80 a month, and for the second child to $32.55 a month. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase, which is one plank of the Government's general tax relief measures in the 1982-83 Budget, will cost some $375m in a full year and will consolidate the increases for third and subsequent children introduced in the last year's Budget. While it will be of particular benefit to the 1.6 million families in Australia who have one or two children, all 2.1 million families with children will gain. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this general assistance for families, the Bill will introduce, from 1 May 1983, a tax-free family income supplement for low income families apart from pensioners and beneficiaries, of up to $10 a week for each dependent child, who does not already attract an education allowance or similar payment. This not only reflects our recognition of the particular cost burden borne by low income families who are bringing up children, but it also helps to alleviate the unfair and clearly undesirable situation in which an unemployment beneficiary can be better off financially than a person in similar family circumstances who is in employment, but earning low wages. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 62 of this Bill inserts a new Part V in the Social Security Act 1947 setting out the conditions under which this benefit will be payable. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, the main features are:</PARA>
<PARA> The scheme will be closely aligned with the Disadvantaged Persons Health Scheme for low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum rate of allowance of $10.00 per week for each eligible child, is equal to the additional pension or benefit paid for the child of a pensioner or beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA> The allowance will be income tested on the joint income of parents, and will be paid to the main breadwinner. </PARA>
<PARA> People with an income less than the amount of the 'threshold' will be eligible for the maximum rate of allowance for each child. The threshold is the amount of income which a married couple with no children may have before they cease to be eligible for a health care card. If the scheme were operating from November, the threshold would be $184 a week; but, because the threshold will increase as a result of CPI-linked increases in the benefit rate which affects the eligibility level for health care cards, it will be higher when the scheme comes into effect . </PARA>
<PARA> In detemining eligibility, the maximum rate of assistance will be reduced by half of any income in excess of the threshold. To illustrate how benefit will be calculated, using the November threshold of $184, a family with three children and income of $200 per week would be eligible for a maximum payment of $30.00 less half the difference between their income ($200) and the threshold ($184)- that family would therefore receive a payment of $22 a week.</PARA>
<PARA> Entitlement will generally be determined for a 6 month period. Like the Disadvantaged Persons Health Scheme there will generally be no decrease in the rate of payment throughout that period if income during any 4 week period is less than 25 per cent higher than the income on which the original assessment is made. </PARA>
<PARA> Entitlement will be re-determined at the end of the 6 month period on the basis of the basic threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course a person may seek an increase at any time if his income falls. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation allows a three month period of grace in which claims for the supplement can be made. Thus, if a person is initially unaware of the availability of the new benefit, he may get full payment from the date of its introduction provided that he claims by 1 August 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the family income supplement is a completely new benefit aimed at assisting low income families who are mainly in employment, the Government will monitor it closely to ensure that it meets its objective of relieving hardship among low-income families who are not pensioners or beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Families with a severely handicapped child who is cared for at home will also be assisted by an increase in handicapped child's allowance by $12 a month to $ 85 a month from November 1982 (Clause 72). </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we have taken the opportunity to remove two unintended anomalies in the treatment of sole parent pensioners and beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently where a widow pensioner receives maintenance of more than $6 a week for a child the excess is treated as the pensioner's own income for income test purposes. While it is clear that the same principle should apply to supporting parent beneficiaries, there is doubt that the legislation as drafted achieves this intention. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment contained in Clause 54 of this Bill will clarify this situation and ensures that maintenance payments received by all sole parent pensioners and beneficiaries will be treated in a consistent manner. This provision will take effect from February 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The other anomaly relates to the payment of supporting parents benefit to some individuals who are themselves counted as dependants of another person for the purpose of the payment of a pension, benefit or allowance. From November 1982 it will no longer be possible for a supporting parent beneficiary to count as a dependant in this way (Clause 27). However, there is a savings provision which exempts existing recipients of pensions, benefits and allowances from the effect of this change. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill provides for important new developments in our social security and welfare programs and gives help in direct and realistic ways to those groups in the community whom we recognise as being in particular need of assistance, including disabled people, aged people and families with low incomes . </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That that Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for amendment of the repatriation and Associated Acts to give effect to the Government's Budget decisions; to formalise the basis for certain 'Act of Grace' payments; to extend the liability provision 'arisen out of or attributable to' to members of the Forces who do not have the benefit of this liability; and to make certain machinery amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments provide evidence of the Government's positive consideration to veterans. The Budget decisions which I will now outline have been given firm support by the community and ex-service organisations: Repatriation benefits are to be extended to members of peacekeeping forces who served prior to 2 November 1981; service pension eligibility is to be extended to merchant mariners of Commonwealth and allied countries; disability pension at the 100 per cent General Rate is to be restored to veterans who received a pension for pulmonary tuberculosis prior to 2 November 1978; increases are to be made in the amount of income permitted for determination of eligibility for service pension and fringe benefits; disability pension is to be discounted totally in determining a veteran's eligibility for service pension and fringe benefits; and certain decisions relating to Social Security beneficiaries are also to apply to Repatriation pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligibility for double orphan's pension is to be extended. The present eligibility criteria for a double orphan's pension provide that it can be paid only if a parent veteran's death was due to an accepted war-caused disability or the veteran was at the time of death in receipt of a Special Rate or pension as a double amputee. The amendment in the Bill will mean that the Department of Veterans' Affairs will be able to assist the children of veterans who served in a theatre of war but who died from causes not accepted as due to service, by making available to them the double orphan's pension. They will also be eligible for benefits already provided to other orphans such as free treatment and education benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, Mr President, the pensions payable for amputations or loss of vision and the levels of the amounts payable for many other benefits including Supplementary Assistance, also known as Rent Allowance, are to be increased. The legislation will also be amended to incorporate provision for certain types of payments that have been made on an 'Act of Grace' basis. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the Budget, eligibility for Repatriation benefits is to be extended to members of peacekeeping forces who served as representatives of Australia prior to 2 November 1981. Honourable senators will recall that the Repatriation Act was amended following the 1981-82 Budget to provide benefits to representatives of this country who served overseas after 2 November 1981 with peacekeeping, observation and monitoring forces raised or organised by the United Nations or other international bodies. These provisions were further extended earlier this year to cover Australian members of the Multi-national Force now serving in Sinai. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment proposed by the Bill will provide eligibility for Repatriation benefits to Defence Force personnel who have, since 1948, been involved overseas in peacekeeping and monitoring roles and for the Australian police contingents on Cyprus which have been carrying out a similar role since 1964. </PARA>
<PARA> The Repatriation legislation contains differing liability provisions which reflect the perceived needs of providing benefits for veterans and their dependants at the respective dates when they were introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> These differences in liability provisions have led to criticism that veterans of various conflicts are being treated differently and that there is no real need for this apparent discrimination to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing liability provisions under the Repatriation legislation were adopted along the lines of early compensation legislation. These provisions, however, do not reflect current thinking on liability. The Government accepts the need for uniform liability throughout the Repatriation legislation, except where there is good reason to depart from this general principle, and has decided that, in the first instance, the legislation should be amended to apply the ''arisen out of or is attributable to'' provisions to all members of the Forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this decision will be that veterans of the First World War, the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War and all other conflicts involving Australians will have the same liability cover as veterans of the Second World War. This is a very proper step for the Government to take and I hope that its significance will be quickly realised within the veteran community . </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that the same principles of eligibility should apply to all veterans for all conflicts unless there is good reason to introduce specific principles and provisions for particular conflicts or for particular groups of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended to undertake a review of these provisions as part of the thorough review of all Repatriation legislation. This review which will be concerned with a wide range of complex provisions and will take some time, will apply the principles I have mentioned and be undertaken on the basis that there will be no watering down of existing standards of eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to extend eligibility for service pension to Commonwealth and allied mariners who served in a theatre-of-war during World War II. The basis of eligibility is similar to that applied under the Repatriation Act to Australian mariners and members of the armed forces of Commonwealth and allied countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year eligibility for service pension was extended to include Australian mariners. The proposed amendment extends service pension to those living in Australia who served against the enemy or assisted the allied cause during World War II. I am sure all Honourable Senators are aware of the great hardships suffered by merchant mariners during the war and of the important role they played in the war effort. The Bill includes provisions which exclude any mariner who in any way assisted the enemy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another provision gives effect to the decision of the Government to restore to veterans who were in receipt of a pension prior to November 1978 in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis (T.B.), the 100 per cent General Rate, irrespective of the actual assessment of their condition. This will restore them to the position prevailing prior to 2 November 1978 at which time pensions were frozen and reassessed according to actual incapacity. Restoration of the pension will be to a minimum of 100 per cent of the General Rate from 6 January 1983. These arrangements which do not include retrospective payments have been agreed to by the Federated T.B. Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Association of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also proposes that, from 11 November 1982, any disability pension received by a veteran or dependant will be totally disregarded as income when assessing levels of service pension and fringe benefits. This initiative which has been described as ''historic'' by the R.S.L. will, I am sure, be welcomed by all Honourable Senators. The proportion of disability pension disregarded for this purpose at present is 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with Social Security amendments, the income level used to determine a veteran's eligibility to receive the maximum rate of service pension will be raised from $20 to $30 a week for a single pensioner and from $34.50 to $50 a week for married pensioners. In addition, the fringe benefits limits will be raised from $40 a week to $54 a week for a single pensioner and from $68 to $90 a week for a married couple. These changes which will apply from 11 November this year will assist veterans who receive small increases in their income to retain their benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for an increase in the maximum amount of Supplementary Allowance, that is, Rent Allowance, payable to a service pensioner from $8 to $ 10 a week from 11 November 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has been made in the Bill for increases in many other Repatriation benefits to severely disabled veterans and in pensions paid to orphans. They are intended to have effect from 11 November 1982. The increases in benefits are in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index in the twelve month period since the previous increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the amendment in the Bill which relates to ''Act of Grace'' payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1942, special arrangements have existed for the payment of pension and benefits to certain persons who were exposed to the risk of injury or death through their employment in connection with World War II or later conflicts or war-like operations. These arrangements have covered persons with part-time service during World War II, representatives of various philanthropic organisations who were attached to the Forces and accredited by the relevant Service Department and certain Commonwealth employees. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that Honourable Senators will agree that this group of pensioners who provided such valuable service in war should have their rights formally perpetuated by being incorporated into Repatriation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill demonstrates in a formal way the Government's continuing concern to ensure that those who have served Australia, our Commonwealth partners, and allies, in war or war-like conflicts can be certain of being adequately compensated for the losses which they have suffered and the sacrifices they have made. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. The then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee, wrote to Professor Ada, Foreign Secretary of the Australian Academy of Science, in June 1980. In my letter he states:</PARA>
<PARA> It was at my request that a senior officer of my Department contacted you to discuss the matters raised in your correspondence. I have read the reports on the discussion and noted that agreement has been reached on the following form of words which may be quoted to the International Council of Scientific Unions:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Bona fide scientists from all countries will be admitted to Australia to attend the conference subject to the application of normal rules and requirements for visitor entry to Australia in operation at the time. Every effort will be made to facilitate the issue of visas to such scientists.</PARA>
<PARA> I should stress that if this form of words is used it must be understood by the Academy that the normal rules in operation at the time of any conference might well exclude a particular scientist, a group of scientists or scientists of a particular nationality.</PARA>
<PARA> In response, Professor Ada wrote, on 2 July 1980:</PARA>
<PARA> I am most glad to have your agreement to the use of the form of words that I discussed with a senior officer of your Department and I have noted your proviso that 'normal rules' may vary from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The unacceptability of the Soviet Unions international behaviour, as exemplified by its invasion of Afghanistan and its support for the suppression of the aspirations of the Polish people, undermines the stability and confidence essential to the promotion of international scientific understanding and communication. By firmly opposing such behaviour, Australia hopes to contribute to more stable circumstances in which international cooperation may flourish.</PARA>

<PARA> Question: 'For the past one or two months, various states of Australia have been sending similar missions to Japan, and all of them claim that they are the centre of economic activity within Australia and they say they receive the highest priority from the Commonwealth Government. Now, why such rush of missions to Japan from Australia? What are the recent developments in this regard? Of course we do realise the importance of fostering industrial activity in various parts of Australia, but if there is any particular reason for sending so many missions to Japan I would like to know.'</PARA>
<PARA> Answer: 'Well, we have only this one, of course, but the point is that Australia has been getting rather a bad name for industrial problems, high prices and the rest of it, and we are over here saying that we are not Australia we're Queensland. And when you think of the high costs and high prices and industrial problems, don't think of Queensland, because it does not add up to us , particularly as it adds up to New South Wales. And that is why we are here: to tell you that point. That we are different to the rest of Australia-particularly in this coal area-from the other states. Anybody with two eyes and two ears, if you came out there you would soon find out why we are different and why the high costs and problems generate in New South Wales, particularly.'</PARA>

<PARA> The Government has consistently maintained that it is not prepared to consider earmarking a proportion of the crude oil production levy for road building purposes. This levy is not a tax on consumers, but rather a tax on oil production. As such, it recovers for the community a substantial part of the windfall profits which would otherwise have accrued to domestic oil producers as a result of the Government's decision that all domestically produced oil be priced at full import parity levels.</PARA>

Is it also a fact that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has recommended that the visa application be refused, despite an invitation from the Senate Committee to Mr Horta? If this is correct, will the Government reconsider the application for a visa-a request already granted by the United States and New Zealand-in order that the Senate Committee may have access to all possible information on its reference?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I can confirm that Mr Ramos Horta applied for a visitor's visa at the Australian Consulate-General in New York. The stated purpose of his visit was to give oral evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence concerning its inquiry into East Timor. Mr Ramos Horta has already provided a written submission.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ramos Horta is a representative of Fretilin and his visit would have been identified as one by a prominent Fretilin personality. The Government does not recognise Fretilin. It recognises East Timor as an integral part of Indonesia.</PARA>

<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister will recall that I asked him a question on 18 March 1982 regarding the call by the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia for a full inquiry into small business in Australia. Has the Minister seen the August edition of Small Business Review, which again calls for such an inquiry into small business, particularly on such questions as alleged discriminatory taxation policy, inequitable financial treatment, and the impact of high level tariffs on small business? In view of the major importance of small business to the Australian economic and social well-being, will the Government reconsider its earlier refusal to institute such an inquiry?</PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce has supplied the following additional information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the requests by the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia (COSBOA) for a formal inquiry to be held into small business in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Specific problems and needs of small business have been subjected to formal inquiry on a number of occasions including the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System, the Committee of Inquiry into Management Education and the Trade Practices Consultative Committee. In addition there have been improvements in the range and quality of information on small businesses from both official and privately funded research. Consultative procedures, particularly the formation of the Small Business Advisory Council, have also been developed to alert Government to matters of concern to small business.</PARA>

<PARA> The Honourable Michael Hodgman, MP, has now supplied the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the original costing, for the new Parliament House, of $151m was prepared at May 1978 prices for a notional building of 58,000 square metres of usable area. At that stage, prior to the architectural competition, there was no design for the building and only a statement of the Parliament's accomodation requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> The costing provided by the winning architect for his successful design concept was $156.4m also at May 1978 prices. Following the design competition, an intensive examination was undertaken by the Parliament House Construction Authority and its consultants which indicated that a more realistic building cost estimate was $220m at May 1978 prices. The Authority's report to Parliament, tabled in the Senate on 21 August 1980, detailed the items where the winner's design exceeded those facilities included in the notional building cost estimate.</PARA>
<PARA> The major items which accounted for the variation between the notional costing and the Authority's considered estimate are outlined below:</PARA>
<PARA>$m $m  Pre-competition budget   151  Increased usable area  29  Underground car parking  18  Site works and landscaping  13  Energy saving devices  4 Standard of finishes  5  Total Variation   69</PARA>
<PARA>  Building Budget   220</PARA>
<PARA> Both Houses of the Parliament subsequently approved the winner's design and the building budget as estimated by the Construction Authority. That costing of $220m at May 1978 prices forms the basis of the Authority's cost plan and is subject to stringent and continuous cost control measures.</PARA>
<PARA> The Authority has advised the Government and the Parliament that it intends to construct the new building within the building budget of $220m with adjustment made only to cover inflation and additional requirements approved by Parliament . The most recent update of the building budget is $370.4m at March 1982, is made up of the original $220m, plus $141.5m for inflation based on an approved index, plus $8.9m for additional requirements approved by the Parliament. The budget is therefore being maintained in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA> The authority has rejected claims that the building will cost in the order of $1,322m as stated by Senator Mason in a recent letter to the Canberra Times. The Executive Officer of the Authority in his reply indicated that, such a ' calculation of the final cost of the building does not appear to take account of the fact that as work is completed its value no longer attracts the inflationary effect of rises in costs. To put the figures into a proper perspective, the inflation rate in the construction industry would need to exceed 40 per cent per annum and be sustained at that level through to the building completion date in 1988, in order to reach the cost figures quoted by Senator Mason.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament House project receives regular and on-going scrutiny by both Houses through the Joint Standing Committee on the new Parliament House. I am fully satisfied that proper cost control measures are being sucessfully applied to all aspects of the project, and it is regrettable that the ill-informed statements of Senator Mason are so misleading to the Parliament and the public.</PARA>

<PARA> Has the Minister seen reports from United States naval authorities that the FFG7 Frigates in service or being built for the Australian and United States navies are fitted with a fire control system, Mark 92 system, which is not capable of fighting a contemporary naval war, especially against modern air attacks such as by Cruise missiles and supersonic aircraft, particularly in bad weather?</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Press reports have been seen and reports have been given by relevant United States naval authorities to keep the Royal Australian Navy informed of problems in the Mark 92 Fire Control System.</PARA>
<PARA> The Mark 92 fire control system is a United States Government Furnished Equipment and therefore not the responsibility of the Royal Australian Navy FFG shipbuilder. The Mark 92 fire control system reported poor performance has been investigated by the United States Navy.</PARA>
<PARA> The investigations determined that the major problem was that operator expectations exceeded system specification and therefore many criticisms were not supported. However, the investigation also determined that equipment did not meet specification in the following aspects:</PARA>
<PARA> poor performance in bad weather;</PARA>
<PARA> reduced performance at target low elevation;</PARA>
<PARA> some unreliable components;</PARA>
<PARA> poor self check performance monitoring;</PARA>
<PARA> poor performance in an electronic counter-measurer environment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Mark 92 fire control system fitted in Royal Australian Navies FFG's performs to the same standards as the equipments fitted in the USN FFG's. The same problems exist.</PARA>
<PARA> Problem rectification proposals have been developed for implementation in three phases-near, mid and long term. The near and mid term proposals have been aproved for development and production by the USN. The long term proposal which comprised a new design phased array radar was not approved by the USN on the grounds of too little performance gain and high cost.</PARA>
<PARA> The near term proposals overcame all of the above deficiencies except the poor performance in the electronic counter-measures environment. This deficiency is overcome with the mid term improvement which also introduces considerable technology improvements.</PARA>
<PARA> The first two Royal Australian Navy FFG Frigates, (Adelaide and Canberra) have already incorporated some early parts of the near term improvements, the remainder approved at $300,000 for each ship are on order and scheduled for installation at the first refits late 1983/early 1984. Mid term improvements will not be available until about 1985. The two remaining FFGs (Sydney and Darwin) will have their Mark 92 Fire Control Systems modified to include the near term improvements before delivery.</PARA>
