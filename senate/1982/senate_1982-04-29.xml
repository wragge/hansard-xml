<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Veterans' Affairs inform the Senate what action his Department has taken in relation to an advertisement which appeared yesterday on page 9 of the Adelaide Advertiser, which was headed 'Vietnam Veterans', and which talked about a Lieutenant-Commander Jim Blyth, National Adviser for Armed Forces to the Department of Veterans' Affairs on agent orange, stating that for people with residues of 2, 4, 5-T and 2, 4-D and other dioxins in their bodies a 'Purification Programme' is perhaps the only way to get rid of them?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Social Security been able systematically to review the childhood services program within his Department? What arguments of any sound nature remain for retaining any direct involvement in this area by the Commonwealth Government when the States have primary responsibility in this area and when they are so well placed to receive and, without duplication, effectively apply direct block grants from the Commonwealth, grants at least equal to the extent of the Commonwealth's present spending? I ask: Will the Government give consideration in the coming Budget to incorporating transition arrangements towards improved childhood services programs in Australia so that they are entirely in the hands of the States?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1651" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since 1972 when the Child Care Act was passed by the Parliament, after introduction by now Sir Phillip Lynch, the Commonwealth has had a direct role in the provision of child care services around Australia. That does not mean an exclusive role but it has been an increasing one. In 1972 there were no Commonwealth subsidised child care facilities. There are now, I think, approximately 500. In 1972 there were, I think, about 14,000 children in formal child care arrangements; there are now about 90,000. No doubt Commonwealth interest and participation in this field have been factors in the growth of formal child care arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked what argument there was for Commonwealth involvement. I suppose one could construct an argument to say that with the clear State responsibility for the child welfare field-a responsibility which the States very strongly assert in the meetings I have had with State Ministers- with the clear State responsibility for education services and with the clear State responsibility for the delivery of health services, the States should be solely concerned with the provision of child care arrangements. I concede that a logical argument could be constructed along those lines. I have to say, however, that it appears to me that the Commonwealth involvement is such that such an argument would be unlikely to gain wide acceptance. Views on that matter, I understand, will differ, but I would not think that it would gain wide acceptance. There has been a recent comment by no less a person than the Prime Minister about the continuing Commonwealth interest in this area. I would not anticipate that we would be moving to the sort of block grant arrangements suggested by Senator Teague in his question. I concede that one could construct a logical case for such an approach but it is not an approach which has been adopted by the Commonwealth in respect of child care, and it is not one which I presently have in mind.</PARA>
<PARA> I should perhaps mention, in the context of the question, that it is certainly true that with respect to assistance for pre-schools as against child care arrangements, for some years now assistance has been provided by means of a block grant. That change occurred after the change of government in 1975 when the Government indicated that it felt that the Commonwealth's role should be directed more towards assisting child care rather than pre-school education. That block grant has remained at a constant level for some years now. I would except from my comments about block grants generally the existing arrangements which apply to pre-schools.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; To be absolutely precise, I would need to consult with the Treasurer on the taxation arrangements. I am aware from my former portfolio of Social Security of the difference in the taxation provisions for, say, invalid pensions and unemployment benefit. To be absolutely precise, I would need to check with regard to supplementary assistance. I will see whether an early answer can be given.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Construction. The Minister for Housing and Construction stated recently that the cost of new houses could be reduced considerably if State and local government regulations were standardised. Can the Minister inform the Senate what action, if any, has been taken by the Federal Department of Housing and Construction in order to achieve Australia-wide standards for the building of private dwellings?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some 10 days ago the Minister for Housing and Construction made a very firm statement about this matter while in Adelaide. I think he also dealt with this point with the various States by way of correspondence. As to the detail which Senator Lajovic seeks about the progress which has been made in this regard, I need to refer that aspect to the Minister and obtain some up to date information for him. But in general terms the argument is that perhaps standards are a little too high in some of the States and that this is adding significantly to the cost of the production of land to be made available for housing. I think one must bear in mind and give some balance to the question of conservation and the environment as well as having regard to the cost of land. But it is a very significant aspect and one which the Commonwealth will be encouraging the States to examine to the best of their ability. In the light of Senator Lajovic's particular concern and interest in the matter, I will see whether I can get an expanded explanation of the situation for him.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister for Health. Is it a fact that nursing homes are increasingly charging high bed holding fees to pensioner patients in nursing homes who wish to spend some time with their families? What will the Government do to remove this burden, which can amount to over $250 for a week of family reunion?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator would be aware that there is considerable pressure upon nursing home bed places. The question of how nursing home proprietors should handle temporary absences is one that was the subject of a lot of discussions between the Department of Health and those who represent nursing home owners. The formula that emerged has provided for charges to be made for some temporary absences. It is as a result of those discussions that the charges have emerged. It is thought that the charges for temporary absences represent a compromise which enables people to hold beds so that they can come back to them and which does not unduly penalise either the patient or the proprietors of nursing homes. This is the kind of matter which the Government keeps under continuing control. If Senator Childs knows of particular cases of hardship, I would like to know of them so that I can refer them to the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2G7">Senator JESSOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Communications whether it is a fact that in Volume I of the 'Requirements for Tender' provided to companies interested in tendering for the provision of earth facilities for the domestic satellite the Government emphasised the need for the maximisation of Australian industry involvement in the project? As I understand that a preferred tenderer has been selected, could the Government confirm that that tenderer is to contain a sufficient level of Australian involvement? Further, with regard to other equipment needed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Telecom Australia and the Department of Transport in relation to the satellite, can the Minister indicate whether an international company is to supply plant to any, or all, of these bodies or whether they are to be supplied with equipment made by a company in Australia? Finally, can the Minister give an assurance that , in this most important and costly exercise, Australian content, where possible , will be utilised to the fullest extent?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jessop's question contains a number of detailed parts. I am not certain that I can cover them all. It is a fact that the request for tender did lay down as one requirement that the Government's policy on offsets and preference for Australian made goods should be followed. There is a requirement in this kind of contracting that one does seek the highest possible level of Australian involvement and content. I think the policies relating to this have been clearly stated on a number of occasions and they are not being departed from now. Honourable senators will be aware that Aussat Pty Ltd is the company which has been established to own and manage the satellite system. Honourable senators may know that this company has selected Mitsubishi Australia Ltd as the preferred tenderer for major city earth stations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Jessop's question relates to the extent to which Mitsubishi has been required to comply with the Australian content and offset provisions. I have been advised that, because contracts are yet to be placed, it would not be proper to discuss the information in the tender which is commercial in confidence. I think honourable senators will understand that. Nevertheless, I can say that I have been advised that the tender by Mitsubishi is considered to be technically superior and competitively priced. Also of the tenders received it is the tender which offered the highest level of Australian content. In saying that, we do not believe that any confidential information is being released. I hope that that meets the concerns expressed by Senator Jessop, that it indicates that the policy on Australian content is not being abandoned and that the selection of Mitsubishi Australia Ltd in no way lessens the Government' s commitment to that policy.</PARA>

Has it been claimed that a Sydney television producer used a Hutt River diplomatic passport to get through Customs and immigration in Beirut? Have some 12 such passports been issued to Australian members of the Red Crescent Society which, I understand is the equivalent of the Red Cross Society? Does the Minister agree that use of these so-called passports could facilitate the movement of terrorists and drug runners around the world? Does the Minister agree that the abuse of these passports in the Middle East could well have a severe impact on Australia's diplomacy and trading relations with that region?

I understand that the matter has been drawn to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I have not yet had any response from him on the matter. I think, because it is a matter of the greatest importance as was detailed in the question from Senator Tate, it would be better if I got a considered answer from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I think I could say on his behalf that it would be a matter that he would view with very deep concern and that he would give it his careful consideration because of the many implications that could arise from the recognition of passports from the Hutt River province purporting to deal with matters on behalf of the people of Australia. I will undertake to seek the earliest response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

The CSIRO is consulting with the National Farmers Federation, its commodity council and affiliates and with pig and poultry producers about the live virus issue. A special group is to be formed to test and monitor the National Animal Health Laboratory's microbiological security. The Laboratory is due to come into operation in 1984. The security assessment group is a highly skilled body independent of the CSIRO. It will make doubly sure that the biological containment systems and procedures in the Laboratory are adequate. Microbiological security testing is scheduled to begin about the middle of 1983 and to continue for some 12 months.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that I was not in the Senate the other evening when Senator Evans raised this matter. But the matter had been drawn to my attention earlier in the week. I have had the matter looked at further since Senator Evans raised it. The position is that the person in question has been a temporary legal officer since July 1979. There has been a series of extensions of that temporary employment. She was interviewed for permanent employment during November-December last year. She was regarded as suitable for recommendation for permanent employment. The procedures that have to be followed before recommendation for permanent employment are ones that are required under the Public Service Act and by the Public Service Board. One of the requirements is to complete a form provided by the Public Service Board called 'Consent to Obtain Personal Information'. This form incorporates details of a personal nature including a provision relating to any criminal charges or convictions. Upon completion, this form is forwarded to the Australian Federal Police for checking. The person concerned declined to complete this form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of that continual refusal, the Public Service Board advised my Department that, as an essential pre-appointment check could not be completed, an offer of permanent employment had not been made to the person concerned. That is the position. The obtaining of this information is a part of the procedures necessary before a recommendation of permanent employment. The matter has been under discussion. The refusal of this person to complete this normal procedure has been a matter of consideration between officers of my Department and the Australian Government Lawyers Association. It has been agreed that if the person concerned, instead of completing this form, undertakes to obtain and provide an appropriate certificate as to her record from the police an extension of temporary employment for one week would be approved for that purpose. Although the person's temporary employment ends on 30 April-that is tomorrow-we have agreed to extend it so that if she is prepared to obtain this information she will be given the opportunity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter has been canvassed, as I said, by Senator Evans the other night. I was asked questions by Senator Evans about this matter, I think about this time last year. I stated then as recorded on page 869 of Senate Hansard of 26 March 1981:</PARA>
<PARA>before a person is appointed to the Public Service, my Department, with the consent of the person concerned, obtains details of any criminal charges pending before a Court together with details of any conviction or finding of guilt recorded against him. Alternatively, the person may obtain a certificate in relation to those matters from the appropriate police force.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the alternative procedure which we are now prepared to follow if the person concerned is prepared to take this step. But the rule about applicants for permanent employment-that is, those who have been recommended applicants for permanent employment-is that before they can actually be appointed as permanent employees under section 33 of the Public Service Act they are required either to give this information or to obtain it in this alternative way. That is a rule of the Public Service Board. The Department is simply giving effect to it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Health to the recent decision by the Royal Australian College of Opthalmologists to conduct the ongoing National Trachoma and Eye Health Program. I ask: Can the Minister advise what arrangements have been reached to conduct the program, what funds have been made available by the Commonwealth for the treatment of trachoma in each of the States and the Northern Territory and where, if at all, have these funds been spent to date? I add too that I believe the Northern Territory trachoma patients number over 50 per cent of those suffering from that disease in Australia. As the Northern Territory has the necessary expertise and personnel to carry out continuous treatment, unlike that carried out by the Hollows group, will the Minister ensure that all problems or restrictions created by either professional people or bureaucrats are removed immediately to allow a treatment campaign to be initiated?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make it clear at the beginning that the fact that the Commonwealth is mounting and supporting a national trachoma program in no way lessens the normal obligations which the States or the Territories have towards the health care of their citizens, whether they be Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal citizens. To the extent that this includes the treatment of trachoma, that responsibility remains. Honourable senators will be aware that a continuing program of public health improvement has been conducted through my Department to put into place some of the recommendations of the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program report which identified the need for environmental improvement as an essential part of the long term radication of trachoma. Honourable senators will be aware that the Government is committed to and is implementing a $50m five-year program to improve water and sewerage works. Much of that money is being spent in the Northern Territory as it is in the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The trachoma program, which is directed towards the treatment of those who suffer from this disease, has been conducted through the Department of Health and has been the subject of negotiations with the Royal Australian College of Opthalmologists. The College has been involved because of its expertise in the diagnosis and the management of trachoma, certainly to the extent that this involves continuing eye care. In view of the fact that very few opthalmologists are available in some remote areas of Australia and to the extent that the College of Opthalmologists can bring in opthalmologists and can concentrate specialist care in remote areas, we require and would hope to have the support of that College.</PARA>
<PARA> The funding of the trachoma program through the Commonwealth is not done through State governments. It is not a State grants program. It is funding which we are trying to organise through the College of Opthalmologists and in which certainly we are trying to get significant and effective Aboriginal involvement. Since the trachoma report was tabled just over two years ago negotiations have been going on between the College of Opthalmologists, health authorities and Aboriginal groups. Existing programs have been continued or modified during that time. During this time the College of Opthalmologists has developed and has presented a plan to allow the program to continue in each State and in the Territory with the assistance of committees which will have a majority of Aboriginal membership. The College has now agreed to conduct the ongoing program . It has also agreed to take full responsibility for the management and disbursement of the moneys which will be needed by the program and which my Department-that is, the Department of Health-will provide.</PARA>

I can advise that details of the program in Western Australia and of the national part of the program have now been given to me and a funding situation is being approved. We are expecting daily to be told of the arrangements in the Territory and in other States. It is not a question of this money being put through to the State governments and the Territory Government for them to conduct the program. It is being put through the Royal Australian College of Opthalmologists under arrangements which have been worked out jointly. I imagine that in the Northern Territory the money will go through a committee formed in the usual way and in which the Territory Government will be a participant but the program will be conducted by the College of Opthalmologists with major Aboriginal involvement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that there is a limit to the charge that any nursing home proprietor can impose on patients who leave the home temporarily. The limit, of course, is the daily bed charge. No proprietor can charge more than that. It has been possible for proprietors to make this charge since 1971. Since then it has been an accepted practice under different governments. I am advised that the Commonwealth now assists nursing home patients who need to make temporary moves out of nursing homes of up to one day a month where there is medical confirmation that this is desirable. In those circumstances the Commonwealth-not the patient-will pick up that fee. I can say in answer to Senator Hill that there is a limit to the daily bed charge beyond which a proprietor cannot charge. I can also say to Senator Childs that, additionally to what I told him earlier, there is now some Commonwealth intervention of up to one night a month to help people who need to make temporary absences.

It may well be that of those disputes which are occurring a greater proportion may be attributed to the matter that was raised by the honourable senator in this question.

Because of a variety of reasons, because of recession overseas and specifically also because there has been overseas, due to unemployment and other factors, an abatement of the upsurge of nominal wages and, indeed, some cutback of nominal wages, Australia now finds itself no longer in that happy trading position at all but faces a threat, if prices go up and if our productivity does not increase, of adverse competition. That is the general situation. Accordingly, anything that increases costs and reduces productivity at this moment will have an adverse effect on our trading and our capacity to employ.

The importance to South Australia is very obvious. South Australia has had particular skills in areas; it has had a very important white goods industry and a very significant motor industry. The doubts and difficulties hanging over the Australian motor industry have been particularly significant to South Australia. The development which has occurred following the Government's review of its car policy is a very welcome one indeed. I think it is important not only to South Australia but potentially to Australia as a whole.

The Minister will be aware, of course, that this is not the first example of the Queensland Government's refusing to allow the Aboriginal Development Commission to purchase property in that State. In the light of this persistent opposition of the Queensland Government to the transfer of leases to Aboriginal owners, how does the Minister expect the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland and, indeed , the Senate to accept that the Bjelke-Petersen proposals for leasing Aboriginal reserves to Aboriginal communities will result in any security of tenure at all?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should be obvious to honourable senators that the question of land acquisition by the Aboriginal Development Commission, for example, and the question of tenure for the occupants of Aboriginal reserves are entirely separate questions. They raise separate issues and they will be resolved in different ways. Senator Ryan's attempt to join them in this question only serves to confuse the matter rather than to clarify it. The arrangements for tenure on Aboriginal reserves are as we have set them out. However, the honourable senator does raise a matter of some interest in the first part of her question, and that is whether the Aboriginal Development Commission has attempted to purchase a property and has apparently been blocked. I have noticed comments made by the Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission, Mr Perkins, to the effect that it has tried to obtain a property. The ADC has, as one of its functions, the acquisition of land for use by Aboriginal groups and communities on the basis of priorities which are set by the Aboriginal people. Of course, this function of the Commission is in line with the Commonwealth's policies for Aboriginal advancement. Part of the funding of the Aboriginal Development Commission is directed towards land acquisition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware that the Aboriginal Development Commission has been informed that the Minister of Lands in Queensland has declined to approve an application to transfer the lease of Dorunda Station and that he has declined to do that under a particular section of the Land Act in Queensland.

In fact, there are a number of avenues for it to pursue, which we would want it to do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in Question Time, Senator Mulvihill asked me a question about the report of a working party which had been set up at the instance, I think, of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) following representations from the New South Wales Minister for Education, Mr Landa. I have a good deal of background information in relation to this matter which may be of interest to the Senate. I will seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard. I will read part of it specifically in answer to Senator Mulvihill's question. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That working party met three times in late 1981 and at the last meeting in December of that year the NSW Teachers Federation and the representative of the Office of the NSW Minister for Education agreed to provide some additional information about the log of claims submitted to the NSW Industrial Commission on behalf of casual teachers and a copy of a statement by Mr Justice Dey relevant to the NSW request. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is still waiting for that information.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will submit the report of the Working Party to me as soon as the additional information is available from the NSW Teachers Federation. At that time the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will consider the implications for the Adult Migrant Education Program Budget of the NSW request and the consequent implication for States other than NSW.</PARA>
<PARA>As the document does reveal, in another part, the financial impact of the request of the New South Wales Minister would not be inconsiderable. I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Following representations from the NSW Teachers Federation the then NSW Minister for Education, Mr Landa, asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to seek additional funds within the Adult Migrant Education Program to allow the NSW Adult Migrant Education State Service to meet the additional costs of appointing, as permanent staff, 170 of the hourly paid temporary teachers who were working on a full time basis within the Adult Migrant Education Program in that. Mr Landa estimated that that request would cost $0. 77m per annum. He also asked for a further $0.44m per annum to increase the number of teacher aides and other teacher support staff within the NSW Adult Migrant Education Service.</PARA>
<PARA> That request should be seen in context. The NSW Adult Migrant Education Service employs about 620 teachers. There are presently 123 full time permanent teacher positions and about another 200 teachers are employed on a full-time but hourly paid basis. The balance work a relatively small number of hours each week. Many of those part-time teachers are also employed as permanent teachers within the normal schools system. Expenditure on the Adult Migrant Education Program in NSW in 1980/81 was $12.23m including $3.23m for living allowances for persons attending full-time courses. In 1981/82 the expected expenditure will be $14.2m. This is approximately 44 per cent of the total AMEP budget of $ 32.3m for 1981/82.</PARA>
<PARA> Following Mr Landa's request it was agreed that a working party comprising representatives of the Office of the NSW Minister for Education, the NSW Teachers Federation, the Australian Teachers Federation and the DIEA would meet to obtain and examine the facts relating to this request. It was agreed that the working party would report on the facts of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA> That working party met three times in late 1981 and at the last meeting in December of that year the NSW Teachers Federation and the representative of the Office of the NSW Minister for Education agreed to provide some additional information about the log of claims submitted to the NSW Industrial Commission on behalf of casual teachers and a copy of a statement by Mr Justice Dey relevant to the NSW request. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is still waiting for that information.</PARA>
<PARA> While that working party recorded and reported the views and recommendations of the State and federation representatives, it was not required to produce recommendations from the total working party. Indeed, its brief excluded that option. The examination of the working party indicated that it would cost about $1.80m to pay the additional costs of 170 permanent teacher positions. That is, those postions are estimated to cost a total of $3.908m as compared to the $2. 826m for the employment of an equivalent number of hourly paid staff.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will submit the report of the Working Party to me as soon as the additional information is available from the NSW Teachers Federation. At that time the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will consider the implications for the AMEP Budget of the NSW request and the consequent implication for States other than NSW.</PARA>
<PARA> I should add that the NSW request will add significantly to costs without adding to the number of English language learning opportunities presently enjoyed by migrants.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In doing so, I make several observations. I notice that in the opening pages of the report reference is made to several of the conciliation commissioners who have retired. I pay tribute particularly to Mr Commissioner Holmes. He was a former national secretary of the Australasian Society of Engineers. I had the pleasure of working with him in the railway industry in years gone by. I feel that he epitomised the role of conciliation commissioners. That role is the same as the role of referees and umpires in sporting events. Today there is a tendency for such people to dominate the scene when their primary purpose is to keep things operating. Mr Commissioner Holmes was not a show pony. He did his work, as did most of the other conciliation commissioners. In making that comment, I note that, at times, there are some long-standing grievances in references to the arbitration system. It is only when one reads a report of this nature that one notes the long hours that are worked by various conciliation commissioners and the success that is achieved. But of course success is not news in the media. The disputes that go on for endless time only are those that are news. When I talk about 'endless time' it is in this age of changing technology when quite obviously people are seeking job preservation, which is certainly a laudable motive, that the role of the conciliation commissioners is made much harder. </PARA>
<PARA> This annual report is a small document when one considers the hours that went into it. Mr Deputy President, I think you would agree with me that conciliation and arbitration commissioners sometimes do not enjoy the best of health but soldier on. I think that has been epitomised by former Commissioner Mr Jack Heffernan-a man of high principles. These people have a difficult job to do. They are in the middle of a crossfire. I refer particularly to men such as former Commissioners Heffernan and Holmes and others who had an unblemished record in the trade union movement. Some people show diffidence about stepping into the middle ground to take these positions. People such as former Commissioner Heffernan and former Commissioner Holmes make a notable contribution to industrial harmony. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe-I might be a little bit utopian about this-that the Senate as a whole will be much more mature when it assesses conciliation and arbitration reforms. I am probably pre-empting something that will be discussed at a later stage-if not today then next week. I believe that with all the material senators receive- I do not designate it as junk mail-they should be able to receive, without having to ask for them, digests of decisions that are made in the field. Honourable senators would then get a much better appreciation of the complexities of industrial relations. I know-I will be quite fair about it-that on an earlier occasion I was somewhat critical of Mr Commissioner Walker in relation to a board that was set up to look at sexual harassment towards certain female carriage cleaners in New South Wales. I was critical of the fact that there was not sufficient feedback. Ultimately, of course, it was not Mr Commissioner Walker but the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) who caused the jam with regard to this matter, and I did not get the information quickly enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The point arising out of all this is that I would like reports of some disputes tabled in the Senate from time to time without honourable senators having to ask for them. I say that advisedly. For argument's sake let us take that rather complex decision on the dispute between the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and other craft unions. This was an extremely ticklish situation that I certainly would not attempt or have the temerity to debate at this stage here. I believe that if senators could have much quicker access to those sorts of judgments we would look at industrial affairs in a more mature fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look not just at that aspect of the waterfront. There are other problems at the moment concerning the container industry. There is the problem of the tally clerks. Some unscrupulous employers are trying to fill up containers with greater than the tonnage allowed. Then, of course, we get a flow-on of safety problems. I know that as late as a few days ago during the Senate Estimates committee's consideration of the Supplementary Estimates of the Department of Transport the Department referred to its vigilance with regard to safety. I know that my colleague Senator Elstob, a former senior official with the WWF, could regale this Senate about the Department's unceasing vigilance on safety. To me one aspect of the matter is that there are vigilant trade unions. The Miners Federation has a record of a high degree of agitation on safety matters. Because someone was a little easy-going at the Appin mine there was a tragic colliery disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> In winding up I simply say that this is an important document. It certainly underplays the role of conciliation and arbitration commissioners. At the same time we would be much better off in the Senate if, instead of the reams of paper that are utilised in documents that float into the Senate, some of these judgments that I referred to-even cases of conciliation-could be read. If some honourable senators read a dialogue of a dispute between the Merchant Service Guild of Australia and the Seamens Union of Australia about the manning of tugs they could examine the situation. We sit here in the Senate in reasonable conditions. There was a confrontation between a seaman and the master of a ship. The master went down into the engine room. A heated scene ensued. A dispute was on and off for seven or eight weeks. People fail to realise that we are all normal and some of us have a temper that explodes more quickly than others. The fact of the matter is that this is so often the crux of a dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick)- I think he can see the merit of his approach-that perhaps we can get some method whereby we can get digests of some of these decisions. Then I hope we would not expect these conciliation commissioners to be sort of divine beings who can just wave a wand and get industrial harmony. It is a lesson on industrial relations. In conclusion I simply say that this is a modest document but I believe it could be expanded to the advantage of the Senate as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I should also like to make some quick remarks relating to the twenty-fifth annual report of the President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The report indicates that there has been a substantial increase in the number of referrals to the Commission. It also indicates that the Commission is obviously starved of funds which are required for the proper and orderly functioning of the system. These are the elements contained within this report. I refer the Senate to page 1 of the report which, under the heading 'Work of the Commission', quite categorically states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a significant increase in the total number of matters lodged, which is up by 752 on the previous year and by 1066 on the year before that. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable senators to correlate that statement in the annual report with the statement contained on page 3 of the report which deals with awards. Of course, awards are the end result of the Commission's work after logs of claims have been served. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the proper and orderly functioning of the system it is essential that all awards should be kept up to date. Most awards are varied many times during their currency and it should be possible to have up-to-date copies of awards, including all variations, which can be referred to quickly. This, unfortunately, is not the present position which has been brought about by shortage of staff and the fact that the Commission is not using modern technology. It is a situation which is not new but the lack of up-to-date copies of awards has been a matter of concern for some considerable time. The Commission would be greatly assisted in its work, and its service to industrial relations practitioners and the community generally would be facilitated by the use of modern technology for the prompt and accurate updating of awards. </PARA>
<PARA>This is most important for those small businesses which often have considerable problems in deciding, in the first instance, under what awards their employees ought to be paid and, in the second instance, what variations have been made to those awards and when and how they would apply to the employees currently employed. I would like to highlight those two points contained in the twenty- fifth annual report in the hope that the Government would see that some effort spent in this regard could well facilitate orderly industrial progress within Australia and assist particularly those small businesses which often have some difficulties in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I admit, of course, that there are organisations such as the chambers of industries and so on which are perhaps duplicating some of the work involved in this area. Nevertheless, I would see that there would be nothing to prevent the Commission from bringing together both employers and unions if the Government were prepared to spend some money on the introduction of some modern retrieval technology which would be invaluable to the work of the Commission and, also, as the Commission states, to the work of industrial relations practitioners as well as to the benefit of the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would also like to join with Senator Mulvihill in congratulating Commissioner Holmes for the work he has done over the period since his appointment to the Commission in 1967. Immediately prior to his appointment I was a colleague of his on the Australian Council of Trade Unions interstate executive. Jack Holmes was one who knew what industrial relations was all about. He knew that there was a need within the trade union movement for people who were dedicated to ensuring that orderly industrial progress was achieved in a sensible manner. He was a man-the Government might not be aware of this-who was most interested in the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act relating to preference for unionists. In one of his keynote decisions he was able to implement the desired objectives of the Act. He knew what these provisions meant, he gave protection as required under the Act to conscientious objectors and he laid down principles upon which there was and still is general agreement in the industrial relations arena. I would hate legislation which is likely to come before this chamber or which is before it now to undo a lot of the good work that Commissioner Holmes has done over many years. I join with the Senate in congratulating him and wishing him well for the future. </PARA>

Sheaffer, in accordance with section 20 of the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973, had declared a direct and indirect pecuniary interest by virtue of the shareholdings listed in the report. If these shareholdings are not put into Hansard, people who do not read the report will not know that Mr J. L. Sheaffer has substantial shareholdings in some of the organisations which gave evidence to the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr J. L. Sheaffer-3800 shares ICI Ltd, 1598 shares BHP Ltd, 703 shares CSR Ltd, 395 shares CRA Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs M. J. Sheaffer-1324 shares BHP Ltd, 789 shares CRA Ltd, 300 shares Elders GM Ltd, 256 shares CSR Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs M. J. Sheaffer is also trustee of a Trust established by her late father, which holds, 6100 shares CRA Ltd, 5500 shares BHP Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those details need to be noted by people who might take some interest in this report. It is a pity that the provision does not apply in this chamber or in the other place. When legislation comes before the Parliament there should be an obligation on every person who has a pecuniary interest in it to make public how many shares he has in any company which might benefit from that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> I well recall that some years ago when the Australian Labor Party was in government Senator Murphy revealed, under the Act at that time, the names of people getting the superphosphate bounty and the quantity of superphosphate they were getting. We were able to ascertain what the bounty was worth to them. Mr Fraser received a very substantial amount from the superphosphate bounty. </PARA>
<PARA> When we were in Opposition after 1975 I had a problem in endeavouring to get into the public record the names of people receiving the superphosphate bounty. It took me three days to do it. The late Senator Greenwood opposed my attempts every time I tried to get those names into Hansard. It was former Senator Cotton , I think, who relented on the third day during a speech I made that lasted for nearly an hour. Finally, I got those names on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 20 of the Industries Assistance Commission Act obliges any commissioner who participates in a Commission inquiry to determine whether the phosphatic and nitrogenous fertiliser bounty ought to continue to reveal his pecuniary interests in any organisation which gives evidence before the Commission. So it should be in the Parliament. If members of Parliament are recipients of the superphosphate or nitrogenous fertiliser bounty they ought to be compelled by law to reveal to the public at large how much they are receiving in taxpayers' money by way of the bounty. I hope that we can do something in the near future. It will certainly be done when we come into government next year. These recipients who are members of parliament will be forced-</PARA>

When he took it off in the Budget, he made that decision retrospective to 1 July that year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Jack McEwen-who, I think, was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Primary Industry, or whatever it was called in those days. He hoodwinked the farmers. We did not do that. They knew in advance that they were not going to get the bounty. The average use of superphosphate at that time was 30 tons and the bounty amounted to less than $400. From the way members of the then Opposition screamed their heads off, one would have thought the Labor Government was breaking every primary producer in the country. The average farmer was losing less than $400 a year. Nobody can convince me, an ex-primary producer, that the loss of $400 will break any primary producer. If it does, he is a fairly inefficient farmer. Of course, we bore the burden of it. People were falsely led to believe that we were sending them broke. Of course, the people who really gained were the Pitt Street, Collins Street and Rundle Street farmers who go out perhaps once a month and shoot a rabbit on the property. I have been informed by people who run the bulk superphosphate depots that, particularly in South Australia, some of them were using 2,000 tons of superphosphate a year. We can imagine the amount of money they were getting to develop properties and then to sell them at an inflated rate. Of course, when the annual rates came around for those resident farmers who did not want to sell their farms, up went their rates; and they were the people who really suffered. I could speak at length about that, but I will not do it now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that the Commission recommends that the superphosphate bounty continue at $12 per tonne until 1985. If the Government agrees to that, we will not be having any legislation. If the Government does bring in legislation to ensure that the superphosphate bounty continues in line with the recommendations of the Commission, I hope that it is only $12 a tonne and not an increased rate to benefit to a great extent some of those people in the Cabinet, particularly those Country Party members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I will speak only briefly to this paper. It is of particular interest to us in the Northern Territory because brucellosis and tuberculosis are a problem in the Territory. The form of husbandry followed in the Northern Territory-large stations and small numbers-makes mustering very difficult. The husbandry of stock is not only difficult but also expensive. In the Northern Territory, we have the additional problem of pockets of high incidence of the disease; and it is very difficult to get to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, a further problem we have is the large number of feral animals that do not occur in the other States, except perhaps in Western Australia. We get a lot of feral animals and so the movement of tuberculosis and brucellosis is very difficult to control. It is vital for us in the Northern Territory to be able to maintain our United States market. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very interested to read on page 12 of the report the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA> According to the evidence, there are no present general bans or limitations imposed on imports of Australian beef and dairy products by other countries because of the presence in Australia of bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis. </PARA>
<PARA>It was my undersatanding that, while there are no limitations at present, we could face a problem in 1984. There was a statement, which I do not believe has been contradicted, that the United States would not take into the United States slaughter animals from areas that had not been cleared of brucellosis and tuberculosis, the main reason being that the United States hopes to clear its own herds by that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned the problem of mustering in the Northern Territory. While the incident I am about to relate does not apply to the Northern Territory, it could well do so. I cite the case of a station which spent $320,000 mustering its herd for testing for brucellosis and tuberculosis. It found two reactors in the herd. The compensation for that was $130-for an outlay of $320,000. Of course, it might be said that the station should be pleased that it had only two reactors and that the rest of the herd was clear. The problem is that this station and others have started to indicate that, because mustering is becoming very expensive, they may withdraw from the program; they may not muster. Of course, that would be disastrous because, if they did not muster, we would have no idea whether the disease was rampant in various areas or whether we were developing pockets-where there was a clean station adjacent to what I might call a dirty station, a station with a high incidence of the disease. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether we ought not to be looking at some other form of assistance to station owners and whether it might not be better, rather than simply paying for the destruction of the reactor or diseased animal, to look at some assistance with mustering, because we must not have stations stopping mustering for testing . Because I have raised that queston, I must raise a second question: Is there enough money available? Of course, the compensation fund is the only source of funds for the farmers. I wonder whether the Government might not be well advised to look at its method of funding and perhaps to make more funds available, as the industry is so vital to Australia. Nobody wants to suggest that large amounts of money be thrown over to any industry, but this industry is vital to Australia. It has given some support in the past but perhaps not as much support as has been given to wheat farmers and to southern farmers who raise their stock under entirely different situations from those which apply in the north of Australia, that is, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> More debate is needed on this subject. I note that there will be another speaker. I hope he will ask that the subject be brought back again and seek leave to continue his remarks later. A lot of areas ought to be debated and it might not be appropriate to do it here. I am particularly interested in an answer by Senator Messner to my colleague Senator Kilgariff on 21 April. I will not read the whole answer but will just quote the opening sentences which stated :</PARA>
<PARA> The national program against brucellosis and tuberculosis commenced in 1970. In the period up to 31 March the Commonwealth contributed 12 per cent of the gross amount of about $32.6m. The figure about which we are talking was mentioned by the Industries Assistance Commission in its 1975 report and was arrived at by costing the Commission's recommended assistance and expressing it as a percentage of campaign costs estimated at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>The sort of debate I want to see is one which determines where the figure of 12 per cent came from and whether the figure was not meant to be 15 per cent. We have had a suggestion of 7 per cent government contribution. I am not suggesting that there is any falsification of the record at all; I am simply saying that we ought to look at the government contribution in this area, and perhaps, while the Government has accepted the Industries Assistance Commission's report and is going ahead with the 75 per cent compensation, consider other areas of assistance. I have already hinted at one, and that is some assistance with mustering. I will look forward to taking part in the full debate if it comes forward at a later time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industries Assistance Commission's report has been accepted by the Government. I believe this report is a poor one for a number of reasons which I hope to be able to outline in the short time available. In 1975 the IAC brought in a report on an identical subject in which it considered it was appropriate that 15 per cent of the estimated actual cost of the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign be borne by the Government. The Federal Government at that time endorsed that judgment of the IAC by acting on the report. The situation today, however, is that the Commonwealth Government is running some $20m short of that target.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Page 25 of the IAC's report acknowledges this and points out that indeed rather than 15 per cent as promised it is 10 per cent, on average, of the total cost of the campaign. However, if one takes into consideration-on farm costs-costs associated with such items as the provision of farm facilities, mustering, as referred to by Senator Robertson, disruption of work schedules and the like-a more reasonable estimate of the Commonwealth's contribution is approximately 7 per cent, nearly half the promised commitment made by the Commonwealth at that time. It means then, if we take into consideration those costs which would amount to aproximately $60m to $70m, that that additional cost has been borne by cattle producers from 1976 to the 1981-82 financial year. The subsequent breakdown of funding for this campaign, I believe, is tremendously important. The cattle industry is paying for 60 per cent of the campaign, State governments are paying for 30 per cent and the Commonwealth Government is paying for 10 per cent. The Commonwealth Government's expenditure in the campaign is devoted totally to the compensation for slaughtered reactors-that is, infected cattle. In 1976 it agreed to pay for 75 per cent of the brucellosis reactors and for 60 per cent of the tuberculosis reactors, the latter amount being reasonable because the tuberculosis campaign proceeded much more rapidly than the brucellosis campaign and therefore did not require as much assistance at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The eradication campaign has begun to have some marked effects. These can be seen by the number of infected cattle slaughtered each year. The number has dropped every year, and this in part accounts for the lowering percentage of the Commonwealth Government's contribution to the entire campaign since its contribution goes toward compensation for slaughtered cattle. The Government, in failing to honour its 15 per cent commitment to the eradication campaign, has now, by the adoption of the IAC's latest report, caused the industry extreme concern. It would be advisable for the Commonwealth Government to look very seriously at writing off the loans of some $25.5m already made to industry in relation to the campaign. That money has already been expended and will have to be repaid by the industry which is running into difficulties in terms of its export markets. That is indeed something which I believe could be done by the Government. If the Government did that it would raise its percentage in relation to the campaign from 1976 to 1981 to approximately 17 per cent, very close to- indeed in excess of-its promised commitment. The Government could look quite reasonably at taking measures that would have minimal financial repercussions in terms of its budgetary commitments. I urge the Government to look seriously at that proposition. I am sure that if it did take that step it would certainly win itself a great deal of support in the cattle industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to a claim made by the IAC which I find absolutely extraordinary; that is, its claim that there is no evidence that our overseas customer countries such as Canada and the United States intend in any way to impose bans on Australian meat or dairy products if we do not eradicate brucellosis and tuberculosis by our target date in the 1990s. I find this claim extraordinary for one very clear reason-that the campaigns in our major customer countries have been conducted totally by governments. In other words, the funds have been borne totally by the Canadian and American Governments. I do not think it takes a great deal of reasoning to understand that governments which have committed themselves, such as the Canadian and American Governments have, to such extraordinary expenditure would be willing in any sense to jeopardise the success of their campaigns by permitting the importation of meat from Australia where the disease would still be existent because of two factors: First, the possible jeopardy of their own campaign and, secondly, they have sufficient problems within their own markets to satisfy their internal producers that there are really no pressures on them other than the bilateral arrangements for export and import. </PARA>
<PARA> Given this let-out in terms of the Australian Government's lack of commitment to our own eradication campaign, I see them flagging at some future date-that date would be very short; Senator Robertson flagged 1984, but I think that may be a little premature-the possible cutting up of our exports unless we step up our commitment. It means that some future government will be committed to quite rapid increases in expenditure to try to do something about a campaign which we are now running down. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed government action, of course, is to increase the slaughter levy. But some figures I have been able to ascertain show that due to the fact that our slaughter rate is decreasing the likely result over the next financial year of even this increase in government assistance will lower the Commonwealth Government's total commitment to the campaign to approximately 5 per cent or, if we take into account those on-farm costs I mentioned before, approximately 3 per cent. As I have already indicated, the consequences of this will be extreme. I again raise with the Government that it ought to take into account those loans, that it ought to seek not to decrease the percentage of costs but rather to increase the percentage of costs at this time so that at some future date we do not find ourselves in an extremely difficult and damaging situation in relation to our export meat market. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's 197th Report covers its inquiry into the administration by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs of the coal export duty. The inquiry resulted from comments in the 1979-80 Auditor-General's Report which disclosed unsatisfactory features relating to the collection and administration of the duty, a sum exceeding $90m for that year. </PARA>
<PARA> Shortly before the Auditor-General's examination, the Government enacted changes to the Coal Export Duty legislation which significantly increased the administrative procedures for duty collection. The major effect of these changes was to levy a lower rate of $1.00 per tonne on open cut coal mined below a vertical depth of 60 metres from the surface, while retaining the higher rate of $3.50 per tonne on exports of all other high grade coking coals. This policy change requires that the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs determine the ratio of coal in the respective categories in each shipment to accurately assess the duty. This was beyond the technical capability of that Department. The calculations involved required staff experienced in quantity surveying and mining engineering which were not then available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was advised that while the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs is responsible for duty collection, policy aspects and rate determination are the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Resources. Consequently both departments were examined by the Committee. Submissions were also requested from the New South Wales and Queensland Coal Authorities. Discussions were held with mining companies and representatives of the New South Wales Combined Colliery Proprietors' Association. The Committee visited coal mining and export operations at Moura, Goonyella and Hay Point in Queensland, and at Appin and Westcliff in New South Wales. These inspections provided the Committee with a detailed appreciation of the problems affecting the coal export industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's inquiry into this issue determined that, given the complexity of the 1979 legislative changes, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs has improved its procedures for the collection of the duty. However the Committee considers that there should have been greater consultation between the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Department of Trade and Resources prior to the introduction of these legislative changes. This consultation was particularly necessary in view of the fact that the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs had indicated that there would be substantial difficulties involved in implementing the new arrangements, particularly in relation to open cut mining below 60 metres. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee suggests that further improvements could be made if the Government reviewed the Coal Export Duty legislation to determine whether a simpler method of Duty Collection exists which would not discourage the use of high cost specialised technology in open cut mines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was also concerned that there was little evidence of Federal- State Government co-operation or co-ordination in the taxation of the coal export industry. In such a situation it is possible for a trend to develop whereby the industry suffers from a proliferation of taxation systems through the actions of each sector of Government trying to maximise its own revenue from coal export receipts while paying insufficient regard to the total tax burden on the industry. Evidence of this trend was given by the New South Wales Combined Colliery Proprietors' Association. Between December 1980 and September 1981 the Association estimated that the ''take'' by governments increased by 34.5% for a typical Hunter Valley thermal coal project. The Utah Development Company, which operates coal mines in Queensland, has calculated that the total Federal and State Government share of its income in 1981 was 71.6% an increase of 5.2% in one year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Public Accounts Committee has always based its activities on the principal that it does not concern itself with government policy issues, but considers the administrative implications arising from the implementation of stated policy. However, in the matter of coal export duty the Committee has sympathy with the industry's difficulties in planning ahead in view of the number of changes made in the Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> From January 1976 to May 1979 assurances were given by successive ministers that the coal export duty would be abolished. Since then, for budgetary and other reasons, the duty has been retained and even extended. In addition there have been almost annual changes to the duty rates since 1975 when coal export duty was first introduced. These factors, combined with the lack of Federal- State Government co-operation have had the effect of creating considerable uncertainty within the coal export industry, which already requires a high level of predictability because of its long lead time for development and expansion. </PARA>
<PARA> The view was put by the industry to the Committee that duty is a discriminatory tax, applying to only a part of the mining industry in Australia. Additionally, it was said the duty did not take account of world coal prices or different profitability factors affecting individual mines, particularly between producers in Queensland and New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these views the Committee briefly examined alternative systems of taxation which could be applied to the industry, including ad-valorem, proportional and progressive profits levies, resource rent taxes, as well as lump sum and royalty bidding schemes. We have not commented on the merits of individual systems, but rather have provided information in our Report to encourage discussion. We also await with interest the Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce into the Australian Export Coal Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to make possible the granting of proprietary rights , somewhat similiar to a grant of patent rights, to people who breed or develop new plant varieties. While this is a new area of legislation in Australia, similiar type schemes are currently operating in Europe, the United Kingdom, South Africa, the USA, New Zealand, Japan and several other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme, as set out in the Bill, will permit a plant breeder who has developed a new plant variety, to apply to a registration authority for the grant of a right to confer sole ownership of that variety on him, if he so wishes. Such rights will allow plant breeders to collect royalties if they so wish. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has been available for public discussion since 7 May 1981. The Government wanted to give interested people and organisations adequate opportunity to study the proposals. It wanted to encourage informed public debate, and therefore improved understanding, of the intent of this legislation. We believe such debate has occurred, and that we are therefore in a position to proceed further with the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There was general support for a plant variety rights scheme in Australian Agricultural Council from the States of Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. There is also general support from all national rural industry organisations with a direct interest in the legislation, including the National Farmers' Federation, the Australian Wheatgrowers' Federation, the Australian United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, the Australian Seed Producers' Federation, the Australian Nurserymen's Association and the Australian Seed Industry Association. </PARA>
<PARA> The major advantage resulting from a plant variety rights scheme will be increased availability of new plant varieties to the Australian Horticultural, Agricultural and plant nursery industries, with consequential benefits to farmers and gardeners. There is evidence that, in the absence of rights, Australia has been denied access to some potentially valuable varieties of plants developed overseas. These are varieties of pasture grasses, grape vines and a considerable number of horticultural crop and orchard plants. </PARA>
<PARA> Plant improvement by breeding is a long and costly process. Rights of ownership of a new variety, with royalties on sales, will compensate to some extent the costs incurred and will provide a stimulus to companies and private breeders to enter into long-term breeding programs. Such additional plant breeding will complement the work being undertaken by Government funded organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of the proposed Australian plant variety rights scheme has extended over several years. It evolved through a series of technical consultations between representatives of the Commonwealth, the States, seed industry groups and the Nurserymen's Association. The legislation covering the operations of similiar type schemes in other countries was also examined in detail. Honourable senators should be aware that the Australian Agricultural Council has been closely involved with the Scheme since it was first proposed. The Council will have an essential and key role in the operation of the scheme and it has already contributed substantially to the principles embodied in the present Bill</PARA>
<PARA> In brief these principles are: The Scheme will have the potential to cover all plant species. Participation in the Scheme will be entirely voluntary. The grant of a right will be given where a new variety can be clearly distinguished by one or more important characteristics from any other variety whose existence is a matter of common knowledge. These characteristics must be capable of precise recognition and description and the variety must be uniform and stable in its characteristics-in other words, it must remain true to its description after repeated reproduction or propagation. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in the Bill will prevent farmers or gardeners retaining seed of protected varieties for sowing of crops for sale for human and animal consumption. Protected varieties will also be freely available for research purposes and to plant breeders for use in breeding programs. Protection of a right, once granted, will be the responsibility of the owner of the new variety, through the normal legal process. There will be provision for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and for the protection of the public interest. The Act will be administered by the Department of Primary Industry in which a registrar of plant varieties will be appointed. </PARA>
<PARA> The plant variety rights issue has raised considerable interest within the community. I would like to comment on a number of points of general concern and misunderstanding. Perhaps the most important point to stress about this legislation is that it will be entirely voluntary-in other words there will be no requirement for a breeder of a new variety to register it under the scheme unless he wishes to do so. Also, the scheme will be open only to new varieties. All existing plant varieties will be ineligible for inclusion. These are fundamental points, which have tended to be overlooked by opponents of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people believe that Plant Variety Rights will give rise to monopoly control of our food supply and restrict public access to plant material. This is not so. As all varieties existing at present will not be eligible for grants of rights, it can be expected that they will continue to be available for any purpose, so long as there is a demand for them. With regard to new varieties registered under the scheme, the public will be able to reproduce and sell them for food or fuel or manufacturing purposes, or other utilitarian purposes which do not involve actual growing of the plants. The permission of the owner will be required only for the sale of the variety for growing purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> There are provisions in the Bill to prevent monopolistic practices in that the owner of a right will be obliged to supply reasonable quantities of the variety at reasonable prices. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most persistent arguments against plant variety rights is that the scheme may lead to takeovers of Australian seed firms by multinational chemical companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Takeover bids can occur in any business activity, including the seed industry. There is nothing unusual about that in a free enterprise system. However, I am confident that if any takeovers should occur in the Australian seed industry, they will in no way be as a direct result of plant variety rights legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the view that the criteria of distinctness, uniformity and stability would encourage the narrowing of the genetic base of commercial plant varieties.</PARA>
<PARA> Distinctness, uniformity and stability are the universal criteria required for the recognition of a new variety whether or not it is a candidate for rights. The same criteria are required by established registers such as the Australian Herbage Cultivar Register, the Oilseeds Register and the Coarse Grains Register.</PARA>
<PARA> Dependence on uniformity is a trend throughout the world. With efficiency in production being increasingly linked to mechanised handling of a uniform crop and consumer demand for a uniform product, it is a function of modern farming and is not related to Plant Variety Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> A related issue concerns the preservation of plant genetic resources for use in future breeding programs. This is certainly an important question, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with plant variety rights. It is a totally separate issue. Gene banks, or seed collections, particularly for the major crops, are already in existence in Australia and are expanding. Work on improving existing collections and establishing new ones is continuing-but, again, quite separate from plant variety rights. </PARA>
<PARA> It is being claimed by some that with PVR public breeding will decline. However , while there has been a tendency in some European countries for public breeding efforts to be directed increasingly towards basic research, information from New Zealand indicates that PVR has increased the effectiveness of State plant breeders, with more and better varieties being released. My view is that Australian agriculture has been well served by the high quality of its public breeding programs and I see no reason why this situation will not continue. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a fear that farmers and consumers will be forced to pay higher prices for seed and plants registered under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> While it might be expected that the owner of a right will set a premium on his variety, it must be remembered that farmers will still be free to choose the variety they wish to use. Farmers would only buy a patented variety if it was in their interests to do so. Also, breeding firms will not be successful unless they offer a product which is competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that PVR creates a fundamental injustice toward those countries of the Third World where much of the world's breeding material is derived. This is simply not true. If a Third World country wishes to receive compensation from overseas collectors of wild varieties it is a matter for those countries to pursue. It is not a matter related to the Australian PVR Scheme. It should be recognised that collecting of germ plasm has taken place for years, well before PVR was ever thought of and is essential to the broadening of the genetic base of our economic plants. </PARA>
<PARA> The view has been expressed that Australian native flora should not be subject to Plant Variety Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me again reiterate that no existing variety of plant, whether native of otherwise, will be eligible for a grant of rights. Furthermore, no variety which is merely discovered will be eligible. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, all Australian native flora varieties will be ineligible for registration. A variety bred or developed from a native plant could be eligible, but then it would not be part of our native flora. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the establishment of a Plant Variety Rights Scheme may not be the best way to stimulate effort in plant breeding. </PARA>
<PARA> Options open to the Government for stimulating plant breeding have been carefully examined. It was concluded that the most appropriate way to stimulate plant breeding in Australia while also providing access to desired overseas varieties was by the use of Plant Variety Rights which would provide a fair reward for investment by both Australian and overseas breeders. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of merit testing has also had some airing over recent months. Some people appear to be of the view that in considering the granting of a right, the merit or the quality of the variety should be a criterion for the right. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the granting of a right to a particular variety in no way implies that the variety is better than an existing one-merely, that it is different. To the best of my knowledge, no other countries with plant variety rights legislation include merit testing as an integral part of the scheme. I believe it is very much up to the market place to determine whether one variety is better than another. </PARA>
<PARA> Coupled with this is the question of a national list of plant varieties which are permitted to be sold. Some European countries do have such lists. However, there is no intention to develop a national list for Australia. This means that there will be no list which regulates or stipulates what plant varieties can be legally sold. </PARA>
<PARA> There have also been claims that the lack of a PVR Scheme in Australia has not prevented plant breeders from obtaining breeding material from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many examples where requests for overseas varieties have been refused because Australia has not had a PVR Scheme. Varieties of nectarines, peaches, cherries, plums, grapes, ornamental plants and some field crops are some examples. </PARA>
<PARA> Plant variety rights will enable Australia to have access to a far wider variety of plants from overseas, and this must benefit the local industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also nonsense to suggest that PVR will lead to poor quality farm crops being produced that are more susceptible to pests and disease. Farmers and gardeners simply will not buy varieties which are susceptible to pests or disease, when they can continue to buy existing varieties which have already been proven. Neither are breeders going to develop, register and market new varieties which cannot compete in the market place against existing varieties.</PARA>
<PARA> Claims that PVR will lead to restrictions on public availability of seeds and information are also without foundation. Plant variety rights will encourage investment by breeders in Australia and this must lead to a greater variety of seeds and plants being available. The New Zealand experience in this regard has been an increase in the flow of scientific information and breeding material since PVR was introduced there in the mid 1970's. </PARA>
<PARA> No decision has been made that Australia become a member of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV). Its purpose is to assist member countries with the operation of their schemes by exchange of technical information and to encourage reciprocity arrangements between countries. Membership is entirely voluntary, and it is not seen as necessary for Australia to be a member. This, of course, could be considered at a later stage, if governments and industry thought it worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of funding, it is intended that ultimately income from fees will meet the cost of administering the Scheme. In the meantime, the Commonwealth will accept responsibility for funding, which is estimated initially to be $100,000 a year. Registration fees will be set shortly. It is expected that they will be in line with comparable fees overseas, which are mostly less than $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that the purpose of the Bill is to make possible the granting of proprietary rights to people who breed or develop new plant varieties. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this Bill opens up prospects for encouraging greater development of small plant breeding firms in Australia and therefore, an increase in the number of new plant varieties available and improvements in the efficiency of Australian plant industries. Mr President, I commend this Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill to amend the income tax law ranges over a number of subjects. </PARA>
<PARA> Following from the 1981-82 Budget, it effects considerable improvements in the zone allowances for people in more isolated areas of Australia, and allows a more rapid write-off of plant for use in the iron and steel industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of tax deductible gifts, there are measures to allow deductions for gifts to three polish relief funds and to certain animal protection societies, as well as some to guard against abuses of the incentives for the arts segment of the gift provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Two groups of amendments of an anti-avoidance nature concern the provisions under which profits from buying and selling property within 12 months are subject to income tax, and the provisions governing the taxing of income derived by trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also changes of a more technical kind dealing with medical expenses paid to incorporated practices and overseas living-away-from-home allowances of members of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> Important though each of these changes is, the amendment of major significance in the Bill is that concerning international profit shifting arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer foreshadowed this change in his speech on 27 May 1981, when he introduced the legislation that is now in place as Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I have much pleasure in now bringing into the Senate the foreshadowed companion amendments, thus completing a package of general measures that are designed to render ineffectual arrangements that have the purpose or effect of avoiding Australian tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest amendments will repeal section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and replace it with revised provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The new provisions will deal comprehensively with the shifting of profits out of Australia, whether by transfer pricing or other means. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures in the Bill aim to give clear guidance to the Commissioner of Taxation as to the way in which they are applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the variety of situations that occur in practice is such that the revised provisions, like those they re-express, have had to repose broad powers of judgment in the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> His exercise of these will, of course, be subject to review and appeal in the normal way. </PARA>
<PARA> The shifting of profits to minimize or eliminate a taxation liability, while not a new problem, is one that has become increasingly significant in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The growth of international investment, the relative ease with which money, goods and technology cross international boundaries, improved communications, and the development of a network of tax havens have all served to facilitate profit shifting arrangements by transnational enterprises, both Australian and foreign-based. </PARA>
<PARA> Profit shifting through transfer pricing has also become the subject of considerable public discussion in recent years, both in Australia and abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> At the international level, it is appropriate to recognize the valuable work of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development-the OECD-which has formulated guidelines for dealing with transfer pricing in its various forms. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Treasurer announced the Government's intention to revise section 136 to deal more effectively with international profit shifting arrangements, the Standing Committee on National Resources of this chamber, in its report on the development of the bauxite, alumina and aluminium industries, has also commented upon the operation of the existing section and indicated the areas where it considered the section might be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to inform the Senate that the proposed measures do in fact include provisions along the lines of those which the Committee considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Although complementary to Part IVA, the proposed measures are not limited in scope to arrangements that have a dominant tax avoidance purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> In that regard, it is important to recognise that an arrangement to shift profits out of Australia may be entered into for a complex mixture of tax and other reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as the Treasurer mentioned in his earlier statement on this matter, the fact that tax saving is not a key purpose of a particular arrangement or transaction is no reason why we, as a nation, should not be in a position to counteract any loss to the Australian revenue inherent in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The main requirements for the application of the revised provisions are that a taxpayer has supplied or acquired property or services under an ''international agreement'', one or more of the parties to which were not dealing at arm's length with each other, and that the supply or acquisition was at prices other than those that might have been expected in a transaction between independent parties dealing independently, that is, at arm's length. </PARA>
<PARA> The term 'International Agreement' is broadly defined but will not affect transactions wholly within Australia, where both sides of a transaction are reflected in Australian tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Where the Commissioner of Taxation determines that the new provisions should apply, arm's length prices will be substituted for income tax purposes in place of those adopted in the profit shifting arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>The revised provisions, like the existing section 136, will permit the scrutiny of profit shifting arrangements-other than those between separate but related entities-that may be made by a single taxpayer that has business operations in more than one country, for example, a taxpayer with a head office in one country and branch operations in another. </PARA>
<PARA>Profit shifting at this level occurs not through actual purchases or sales, but through book entries involving, for example, the invoicing of goods at non-arm's length prices or the charging to accounts of excessive expenses between head office and a branch. </PARA>
<PARA>Technically, profit shifting arrangements of this kind involve questions of the source of a taxpayer's income and the extent to which expenditure is incurred in deriving income from a particular source. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill therefore contains provisions which authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to determine these questions by reference to arm's length criteria. </PARA>
<PARA>An important feature of the new provisions is that, subject to powers of remission, a statutory penalty will be imposed, equal to 10 per cent per annum of the tax becoming payable by virtue of the revised provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Without that, taxpayers who engage in profit shifting to reduce their Australian tax liabilities would have the 'odds to nothing' when they engaged in such arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>These measures, which are to have effect in relation to income derived an expenditure incurred after 27 May 1981, will overcome a number of deficiencies in the existing section 136. </PARA>
<PARA>They will, in express terms, bring the Australian income tax law into line with the approach adopted by many other countries and with the provisions already embodied in our double taxation agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, they are, by any standard, a significant legislative response to arrangements that are damaging to the Australian revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>ZONE ALLOWANCE</PARA>
<PARA> Following the Budget announcement the Treasurer gave details of this change on 15 November 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>The change follows a careful examination of the zone allowance system in the light of the report of the public inquiry into the system of income tax rebates for people living in more isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the new arrangements given legal force by the Bill with effect from 1 November 1981, the basic rebates of $216 for zone A and $36 for zone B will not be altered, but the part of the zone rebate that is related to dependants will increase. </PARA>
<PARA>It will rise from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the relevant dependant rebate amounts for zone A and from 4 per cent to 20 per cent for zone B. </PARA>
<PARA>A special basic rebate of $750, in lieu of the ordinary basic zone A and zone B rebates, will be available for people residing, or spending the required period of time, in particularly isolated areas in either zone-that is, at places in excess of 250 kilometres by the shortest practicable surface route from the centre of the nearest population centre of 2,500 people or more. 1976 census data will be used to establish the population of centres for the purpose of the special basic rebate. </PARA>
<PARA>The situation will be reviewed after 1981 census data becomes available. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the existing test of eligibility for a zone rebate, under which a person must reside or actually be in a zone area for more than half the year of income, will be liberalised in two respects, effective from 1 January 1981.</PARA>
<PARA>First, a person who resides or spends time in a zone area for 183 days or more over a period of two consecutive income years, but who does not satisfy the existing test in relation to either income year, is to receive a rebate in the later income year. </PARA>
<PARA>Second, a person who resides in a zone area for a continuous period of up to five income years, but who does not satisfy the existing test in the first and last of those income years, will be entitled to a rebate in the last year, provided the period in the first income year combined with that in the last income year exceeds 182 days. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention that, to maintain the long-standing relativity between the level of the zone A rebate and that of the rebates available to certain persons serving overseas with a united nations' armed force and to Defence Force members serving in certain overseas localities, the dependant component of those rebates is also to be increased from 25 per cent to 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>DEPRECIATION OF BASIC IRON OR STEEL PRODUCTION PLANT</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators may recall that details of this Budget measure were announced on 30 October 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>As announced, special rates of depreciation, on a prime cost basis, are to be provided for new and second-hand plant used primarily and principally in the production of basic iron and steel products. </PARA>
<PARA> The new rate will be 20 per cent except where, under existing law, eligible plant would attract a rate of more than 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In those cases, a 33 1/3 per cent rate will apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The new measures will apply to eligible plant that is ordered after 18 August 1981 and before 1 July 1991, and is first used or installed ready for use before 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> Plant constructed by the taxpayer will qualify on the same basis if construction is started within the 18 August 1981 to 1 July 1991 period. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of the special depreciation allowances, basic iron and steel products will be, broadly, those products included in the definition used for the purposes of the 1980 report of the Industries Assistance Commission into the iron and steel industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, following representations received form the Government of Western Australia, the Government has agreed that sponge iron should also be recognised as a basic iron product for the purposes of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> As outlined in the Treasurer's 30 October statement, the accelerated rates will apply to direct production plant and also to plant used by the producer within the production premises on certain necessary associated processes. </PARA>
<PARA> Road vehicles of a kind ordinarily used to transport persons or deliver goods will not qualify for the accelerated rates. </PARA>
<PARA>GIFTS</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments proposed by the Bill will further extend the gift provisions of the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> These allow deductions for gifts of the value of $2 or more to specified funds, authorities or institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> One extension will authorise deductions for gifts made after 5 February 1982 to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and to the equivalent societies in Queensland and the Northern Territory-The Royal Queensland Society for the prevention of Cruelty and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. </PARA>
<PARA> I announced this decision on 5 February 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The second will authorise deductions for gifts made to three Polish relief appeals. </PARA>
<PARA> In the statement on 18 February 1982 the Prime Minister announced that gifts made during the current financial year to help Poland live appeal conducted by the Australian National Committee for relief to Poland would qualify for deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> Following representations, the Government has decided that gifts made to the Australian Red Cross Poland Appeal and the World Vision of Australia Poland Emergency Appeal should similarly qualify. </PARA>
<PARA> Still further amendments will modify the operation of the taxation incentives for the arts scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> That scheme authorises deductions under liberalised conditions for gifts of works of art and other cultural property to the Australiana fund, a public art gallery, library or Museum or to artbank. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, such gifts qualify for deduction irrespective of the time when, or the manner in which, the gifted property was acquired by the donor. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of the deduction available is generally based on the market value of the property at the time the gift was made, determined by reference to the average of two or more valuations obtained from approved valuers. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of the modifications proposed to that scheme was foreshadowed in the Treasurer's statement of 14 October 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> That amendment will, in two specified sets of circumstances, apply to gifts made after that date so as to restrict the amount of the deduction to either the value of the property or any amount paid by the donor for the property, whichever is the less. </PARA>
<PARA> This restriction will apply, firstly, where the property is donated within 12 months of its acquisition by the donor, and, secondly, where the property was acquired by the donor for the purpose of making the donation, or was acquired subject to an agreement or understanding that the property would be so given away. </PARA>
<PARA> This basis of deduction will not, however, apply to gifts of property inherited by the donor. Such gifts will continue to qualify for the market value of deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> Further amendments cover arrangements for the appointment of valuers under the scheme, by formally placing responsibility for such appointments with the Secretary to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Guidelines for the purpose are being inserted in the law. </PARA>
<PARA>SHORT-TERM PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer foreshadowed this change in a statement on 10 September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> He said then that section 26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act needs to be amended to support the policy of the section that profits made from short-term property transactions are to be subject to income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 26AAA requires that the assessable income of a taxpayer include any profit arising from the sale of property purchased within the previous 12 months . </PARA>
<PARA> Where a person who owns controlling shares in a company has the company purchase property and, when the property appreciates in value, effectively realises the resulting profit by selling the controlling shares in the interposed company the section does not apply, and there is doubt whether the profit is brought to tax by related provisions of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Similiar uncertainties could arise in the event of use of a trust as the vehicle for the purchase and sale of assets within 12 months, or by selling off an interest in property held for less than 12 months through a chain of companies, or through interposed companies, partnerships or trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill deals with these situations, so that a taxpayer's assessable income will clearly include the profit component of the sale price of shares in a private company or an interest in a trust estate or partnership that is attributable to an increase in the value of underlying property purchased within the preceding 12 months. The amendments will apply where the value of the underlying property immediately before the shares or interest are sold is 75 per cent or more of the net worth of the company, trust estate or partnership. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 26AAA is to be further amended so as to apply in a related situation where a taxpayer sells property received as part of a distribution in specie by a private company or trustee of a trust estate, the property having been purchased within the preceding 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Treasurer announced these measures on 10 September 1981 he indicated that they would apply in relation to underlying property purchased after that date, other than trading stock, depreciable plant or property held for resale at a profit. </PARA>
<PARA> It has, however, been found necessary to include in the Bill additional safeguarding provisions to prevent taxpayers from being able to exploit a general exclusion of those classes of property. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that these safeguards depart from the terms of the Treasurer's announcement, the further measures will apply only in relation to underlying property that is purchased after the date of introduction of the legislation into the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>INCOME OF TRUST ESTATE AND OF DEPENDENT CHILDREN</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the amendments that were foreshadowed by the Treasurer in a statement of 27 August last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments, which are to operate from that date, are designed to clarify the provisions relating to the system for taxing the income of trust estates and of dependent children that was introduced in 1980 in two areas where, it has been claimed, loopholes exist. </PARA>
<PARA> In one case, a blatant tax avoidance scheme was developed in reliance upon the alleged deficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme attempts, by the creation of multiple trusts, to exploit the measures adopted in 1980 to free from tax at the maximum personal rate, accumulating trust income in respect of which a beneficiary has a vested and indefeasible interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Under those measures, such income is instead taxed to the trustee on behalf of the beneficiary at personal rates of tax, including the zero rate applying (in 1981-82) to the first $4,195 of income. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the scheme, it has been contended that each of the multiple trusts has a vested and indefeasible interest in, but is not presently entitled to, a share of the net income of the head trust, and that the measure I have just referred to operates to allow each of the multiple trusts to obtain the benefit of the tax-free threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that it is not accepted that the scheme is effective, but these amendments will modify the relevant provisions of the law, so that such unintended results clearly do not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment under this head relates to the exemption from the special tax applicable to the income of minors, for income derived by a minor from his or her own employment. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been claimed that, because the definition of employment income adopted in the law includes payments made for services rendered, the exemption extends to income that a child receives from a trust estate that derives that income from carrying on a business of providing services performed by its employees. </PARA>
<PARA> This claim is contrary to the intention of the law and the amendment will indicate expressly that the exemption from the special tax in respect of employment income that a child beneficiary receives through a trust is applicable only where the beneficiary provides the services. </PARA>
<PARA> A related amendment, to apply after the date of introduction of the legislation , will clarify the scope of, and the application of safeguards in relation to, the exemption for business income derived by a child from carrying on a business , either alone or in partnership with others, to make it clear that business income includes income from a business of providing services. </PARA>
<PARA>MEDICAL EXPENSES</PARA>
<PARA> At present medical expenses paid to a qualified person are eligible for the general income tax rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> The law is to be amended so that medical expenses of the kinds that qualify under the existing provisions will also be rebatable when paid in respect of a professional service provided by a qualified person although the payment itself is made to a corporate, or other unqualified, employer of that person. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will apply to payments made on or after 1 July 1981 and is in recognition of relaxed rules of professional bodies in permitting the incorporation of medical and other professional practices. </PARA>
<PARA>LIVING-AWAY-FROM-HOME ALLOWANCE</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a technical change in the law will remove the present exclusion of members of the Defence Force from the operation of the provision which authorises a deduction against the amount of any living-away-from-home allowance that is required to be included in the assessable income of an employee. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will ensure that allowances in the nature of living-away-from- home allowances received by Defence Force personnel serving overseas continue to be taxed to the same extent as similar allowances received by their civilian counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, all these measures are explained in some detail in the explanatory memorandum that is being made available to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, I need do no more at this stage than commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide, together with authorities available under other legislation, borrowing authority needed to help ensure that calls on the Consolidated Revenue Fund do not exceed amounts legally available to the Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot validly exceed moneys ultimately available to the fund. Thus , for many years, successive governments have introduced legislation for the purposes of funding Defence expenditure out of the Loan Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> In my Budget speech for 1981-82 I announced that the prospective overall Budget deficit for this year was estimated to be $146 million. Since the Budget was brought down, the outlook has changed. On current information, total outlays are now estimated to be of the order of one and a half per cent above the Budget estimate. The increase has resulted from larger than expected wage and salary increases, funding for new Government initiatives and inescapable cost and price increases arising since the Budget was prepared. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, total receipts are now estimated to be about one per cent below the Budget estimate, largely as a result of shortfalls in revenue from the crude oil excise caused by industrial disputes, and rejection in another place of the proposed sales tax legislation to broaden the tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> The resulting increased Budget deficit has given rise to a possibility that calls on the Consolidated Revenue Fund might exceed moneys legally available to that Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Existing legislation permits certain expenditures to be funded either from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or the Loan Fund. Funding from the Loan Fund to the maximum extent could, indeed, if there are no untoward developments, avoid the prospect of a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. However, it is not certain that the margin currently available would be sufficient to meet contingencies, such as, for example, further industrial action having additional adverse implications on revenue flows and on the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> The simplest and traditional means of providing appropriate legislative authority to meet such contingencies is a loan Bill of the type I am now presenting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes a specific limit to the amount of any borrowings that may be undertaken. That limit is $300 million which amount the Government considers reasonable to meet contingencies of a kind noted above and which compares favourably with the provision in the Loan Act 1980 of $900 million. </PARA>

<PARA>STATES GRANTS (TERTIARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, which provides for the limited introduction of tuition fees in tertiary education institutions in the States and in the Northern Territory, was passed by the House of Representatives last year but rejected by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a provision for the Minister to make determinations as to the circumstances in which students should be charges tuition fees or be exempt from such charges. However, this provision is subject to a number of limitations specifically mentioned in the Bill. These include the following. First, students undertaking courses leading to first degrees or diplomas cannot be charged fees. Second, the maximum fee is set at $1,000 per annum. Finally, students who have commenced courses before 1982 are to be exempt from fees charges for those courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides, as a condition of recurrent grants, that institutions charge tuition fees in accordance with these arrangements and that they do not charge tuition fees in other circumstances. The Bill provides for recurrent grants scheduled in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981 to be offset by an amount equivalent to the money from tuition fees which those institutions will be required to charge. </PARA>
<PARA> As it will not now be possible to introduce tuition fees before the beginning of 1983 it is the Government's intention, when this Bill is enacted, to introduce an amending Bill which will provide for fees exemptions for courses commenced before the beginning of 1983 rather than 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> At no time has the Government advocated the restoration of tuition fees for first degree or first diploma qualifications, but it continues to be the Government's view that those who wish to further their studies beyond a reasonable range of basic qualifications should make a contribution towards the cost of tuition. There are substantial benefits which flow to individuals from higher education and the Government believes that the community as a whole should not be expected to meet all of the costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1981</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the limited introduction of tuition fees at the Australian National University. The principles involved in this Bill are essentially the same as those in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill empowers the Minister to make determinations with respect to such matters as the categories of students liable to pay tuition fees, exemptions, the situation of overseas students, and the level of fees to be charged. Statistical information on student enrolments and fees chargeable is to be provided by the University. The University Council is empowered to make statutes in respect of tuition fees. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is intended to provide for the limited introduction of tuition fees at the Canberra College of Advanced Education and is a companion measure to the Bills to amend the Australian National University Act and the States Grants ( Tertiary Education Assistance) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The same principles are involved in this Bill as in the Australian National University Bill and the provisions of the Bill relating to the introduction of tuition fees are in the same terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill empowers the Minister to make determinations in connection with tuition fees on the same basis as with the University Bill and there is a similar obligation for the College Council to ensure that each student liable to pay tuition fees does so. The same annual limit of $1,000 is set. </PARA>

This will involve a further appropriation of $3.7 million.

<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend two Acts: the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1978 and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981. Amendments to the 1978 Act will finalise adjustments to grants for the 1979-1981 triennium and are in respect of increases in the salaries and wages component of recurrent grants. This will involve the provision of a further $53.7 million for the recurrent programs of universities, colleges of advanced education and TAFE institutions in the States and the Northern Territory. Amendments to the 1981 Act reflect the implementation to date of the Government's decisions on the consolidation of colleges of advanced education. The Bill includes a transition provision to take account of certain name changes that have occurred as a result of consolidation of colleges of advanced education. On the understanding that consolidation is actively pursued during 1982, the Bill provides funds for 1982 for the Armidale College of Advanced Education, the Newcastle College of Advanced Education, The Milperra College of Advanced Education, State College of Victoria Hawthorn, State College of Victoria Institute of Early Childhood Development and State College of Victoria Melbourne. Funds are also provided to the Wollongong Institute of Education until the end of April when it will amalgamate with The University of Wollongong. With the concurrence of honourable senators I incorporate in Hansard the following statement outlining the adjustments to the schedules of grants for 1982 for individual universities and colleges of advanced education arising from these changes. </PARA>
<PARA>OUTLINE OF ADJUSTMENTS TO SCHEDULES OF GRANTS FOR 1982</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981 provided funds in accordance with the Government's policy for the rationalisation of advanced education. By the end of 1981 acceptable arrangements had been received for 24 of the 30 colleges proposed for consolidation. Acceptable arrangements for consolidation are still required for:</PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA> Milperra College of Advanced Education</PARA>
<PARA> Armidale College of Advanced Education</PARA>
<PARA> Newcastle College of Advanced Education</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria</PARA>
<PARA> SCV Hawthorn</PARA>
<PARA> SCV Institute of Early Childhood Development</PARA>
<PARA> SCV Melbourne</PARA>
<PARA> 2. On the basis that the consolidation of these institutions is actively pursued during 1982, certain adjustments have been made to the schedules of grants. These adjustments will ensure that the six remaining institutions are funded for 1982. There is no provision for their funding as individual institutions after 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The details of the adjustments to the schedules of grants for 1982 are set out below:</PARA>
<PARA> In the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981, some funds for advanced education purposes were identified as national unallocated monies. This Bill provides funds from the national unallocated monies for 1982 for the following colleges and amounts as specified:</PARA>
<PARA> $m  Milperra College of Advanced Education  3.027  SCV Hawthorn  5.9  SCV Institute of Early Childhood Development  3.08  SCV Melbourne  14.195</PARA>
<PARA>The funds provided for 1982 to the University of New England and the University of Newcastle included amounts for the programs conducted by the Armidale College of Advanced Education and the Newcastle College of Advanced Education. This Bill transfers funds from the scheduled 1982 grants for the University of New England and the Univerisity of Newcastle to the Armidale and Newcastle Colleges of Advanced Education respectively:</PARA>
<PARA> $m  Armidale College of Advanced Education  4.97  Newcastle College of Advanced Education  10.13</PARA>
<PARA>Agreement has been reached that the Wollongong Institute of Education will merge with the University of Wollongong from May 1982. To take account of the situation until then, separate funding for the institute of $1.333m is provided from the funds originally provided to the University. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also provides for amounts of $200,000 and $129,000 to be transferred to the Western Australian Institute of Technology and the Victorian College of Pharmacy respectively. These transfers implement requests made by the States concerned and in the case of the Victorian College of Pharmacy are to meet costs of administering a Staffing Information Exchange and Staff Placement Service which has been established by the State Government on behalf of colleges of advanced education in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Adjustments also have been made to the funds appropriated by the 1981 Act for Research Centres of Excellence and Community Language Courses to take account of allocations to the Australian National University which are appropriated separately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Grimes has suggested that this is purely an initiative of the Government. My understanding is that there has been a number of discussions on this matter in recent weeks, particularly over the last week, between the Party Whips and that there was agreement that this matter should be moved up. Indeed, it was my understanding that that should be so. It is within that context that the matter has been bought forward. I have no advice to the contrary on this matter. It is not an uncommon practice, particularly of the Opposition, to ask that such motions be debated out of their order. Indeed, the Government has willingly complied with requests from the Opposition, as previous weeks will show, for motions to be debated out of their order. There has been a request to place this motion at the top because it is a precedural motion affecting the general work of the Senate. It can be dealt with quickly. It has been a matter of discussion at the Party Whips level over recent days.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me clarify a couple of points . Firstly, it is well known that the business previously dealt with on Thursday evenings-it is now to be dealt with on Thursday afternoons-is seen as the province of the Opposition. This has always been so. We suggest what should happen on that occasion and then the Senate makes the decision. That is the first point. We would always be opposed to having what amounts to Government Business dealt with on the afternoon which is given over to our business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point concerns the suggestion of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) that this matter has been one of discussion between the Party Whips. It certainly has. But the matter was discussed not in terms of whether it might come up on Thursday afternoon or during General Business but rather of what was the attitude of the Opposition to this situation . I have made the Opposition's position clear; there is no doubt about that. The message I have passed on as Whip has been that we see value in a principle such as the one put forward by Senator Jessop. We would say that on every occasion we would decide, the Senate being the master of its own destiny, whether we needed to set up something extra and we would not want to see any limitations. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the major point has been covered already in the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Grimes. I raised this point at the Whips' meeting this morning . It seems to me to be totally inappropriate, given the situation that we have at the moment of the suggested establishment of a select committee to investigate a very sensitive area, for the Government to want to bring forward a notice of motin which seemed to be trying to block the Opposition. The Leader of the Government in the Senate shakes his head, but it is clear that that is how it is seen. I think that is very unwise. The point which I made this morning, I thought with some recognition from the other two Whips, was that it would be unwise to bring it on. There is a reasonable amount of agreement on both sides about this matter. We have looked at it and said that we see advantages in what is coming up. Without pre-empting the debate, we would have been happy to debate at a later stage the value of what Senator Jessop is putting. But at this stage it would be seen, certainly by the Opposition side, as a step being taken by the Government to block a reference that might be introduced by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I make it abundantly clear that there is no intention by the Government to use this as a device to block any new proposal for a select committee that should emerge. It is purely a procedural motion and a matter for establishing general principles. This matter has been under discussion for some months, as all honourable senators know. I believe the sensible thing to do would be to determine the substance of it. If, indeed, it means that there is general acceptance that only a restricted number of select committees shall be viable at any time, it is quite within the Senate's capacity to re-arrange the other non-urgent business so that there are only two or three committees at a time. It does not conflict in any way with any decisions that may or may not be made by the Senate. I hope that good sense will prevail.</PARA></TALK.START>

We do not see any reason why it should be raised for discussion this afternoon having regard to the circumstances which have been outlined. That is the basis of it. We understand the position of the Senate as much as the Government does. There is no question of working honourable senators to death on select committees. We are not in favour of that course.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the debate last night I think I outlined fairly fully why I objected to this proposal of the Senate Standing Committee on Standing orders. I was not happy with some of the replies given which tried to placate me. I am still concerned-and not convinced, of course, by the arguments that were put forward against my protest-about what will happen if the proposal is carried. The report of the Standing Orders Committee states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the new sessional order is adopted, Mr President will, as a matter of practice--</PARA>
<PARA>I was in error last night in saying that it would be up to the clerks to circulate the list of petitions; I make that apology to the clerks--</PARA>
<PARA>have a list of all petitions circulated to honourable Senators, and the text of petitions referred to the relevant Standing Committees, so that, should Committees wish--</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that word 'wish' in that proposal-the committee may not wish to do so. Then, of course, that is where a petition would end after not being read on a Wednesday in the Senate. The Committee goes on further to propose:</PARA>
<PARA>to inquire into any particular petition, they may seek a reference from the Senate . . . </PARA>

At least the person who is presenting the petition on behalf of the signatories has the right to have that petition read out on Tuesdays and Wednesdays-not so long ago this was done also on Thursdays. Of course, that right was taken away. The way the Standing Orders stand at present, honourable senators have only Tuesdays and Thursdays to have petitions presented to the Senate. Of course, we know that on the Wednesdays those petitions are read while the proceedings are being broadcast if an honourable senator desires that the petitions that have been presented to him by his constituents be read. So, people who have an interest listen to the petition being read. It is not always-I remind Senator Grimes-that people even hear the petitions read. I had several phone calls last night after I presented my petition yesterday protesting against the cheap home loans. The Australian Broadcasting Commission went off the air for five minutes in South Australia. People rang to see what the text of my petition was. So, people are interested.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If people did not want to be embarrassed they would not have rung up the honourable senator. I am concerned that the Senate Standing Committee may not wish to have its time taken up dealing with petitions. In the course of my remarks last night, I referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations which at the present time has 16 references before it. We can look at every standing committee. Each committee has at least three-many of them have more-references to contend with at the present time. Of course, it has now been explained to me that it will be the prerogative of the President to decide to what standing committee those petitions are sent. The President will be put in an awful position. Mr President has to make up his mind about what standing committee is appropriate to deal with petitions. Of course, some petitions are very involved because of the way that they are worded. They may have to go off to more than one committee for consideration. If that happens I can see a problem. If two reports dealing with the one petition come back from a committee they could be in conflict. Where do we go from there? I think that the people who sat on the Standing Orders Committee did not give enough consideration to the proposal that they are bringing forward in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main objection of those of us who spoke on this side of the chamber is that this proposal, if implemented, will take away the right of Australians to have their voices heard in this Parliament. It is all right for the Ministers and the people on the front bench to say that other methods are available. But of course , it is like the person who gets the first bite of a chocolate or a meat pie; there is not much left for the bloke who gets the second or third bite. An honourable senator should be very persistent in this place. That is one thing that I have learnt from my colleague Senator Cavanagh. An honourable senator should never give away any rights that he has. Once those rights are taken away, one never gets them back. The recommendation is that this proposal be made by way of a sessional order. In my view if this is agreed to, it will soon find its way into permancy in the Standing Orders. Honourable senators will be in the same position as people in the other place. Petitions are not read there. They will just be precised. I expressed my concern about this last night. This will be left to the clerks. I do not know whether the Senate clerks or the clerks in the Table Office will have the responsibility to paraphrase the petitions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out again last night, I am not happy at the way the preamble of my petition was paraphrased. Of course, I have the liberty, as a senator, to alter that preamble if I so wish. I do that. Of course, that right again will be taken away from me if the Clerk stands up in this place and uses his own preamble to present the petition. I will have no choice. I will have to have a consultation with some of my colleagues, particularly with one who is not now in Parliament who is an expert on Standing Orders and see whether some other method, if this proposal is carried, is available to us so that we can take some action. I can assure honourable senators that if we can take some action those who want to save time by changing the method of presentation of petitions will lose more time arguing the toss about the interpretation of certain Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out last night when I was speaking, nine petitions were presented yesterday. Some of them had a very long preamble. It took exactly 15 minutes of the Senate's time to dispose of those petitions. I think it is quite erroneous that the first paragraph of this proposal should state:</PARA>
<PARA> In considering the more effective use of the time available to the Senate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>All the Standing Orders Committee is looking at is saving 15 minutes on a Wednesday by not having the presentation of petitions. </PARA>

I do not think that we should put ourselves in the position where we judge what the rights of the citizens of Australia may be. We should not put ourselves up as the jury and make a decision-if this motion is carried today-that no longer will people will have the right to have presented petitions which they go to some lengths to prepare and get signatures for. The petitions are brought into the Senate, just precised by the Clerk and taken on by a Senate standing committee according to its wish or the committee may seek a reference from the Senate. That leaves the matter very much open. If this motion is carried I very much doubt whether any Senate standing committee will be looking for that extra work by saying that it will have a look at the petition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senate standing committees are all-party committees. Whilst some persons on a committee may wish to take on a petition, if it is going to be an embarrassment to the Government of course it will not be taken on because the Government has equal numbers on those committees. If it comes to a vote the Government has a casting vote. So whoever is in government at that time will make sure that if a petition is going to be an embarrassment to them it certainly will not come on for consideration by that committee. With the way petitions are presented now they embarrass the Government while they are being read out and that is the end of it unless another one is brought in the next day. Of course, that is what is happening. I am very much afraid that that is one of the reasons why this proposal has come about. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to something I have complained about in this place before. I am on the Senate House Committee which operates as a Joint House Committee. There are no minutes of proceedings of what takes place in that Committee. Of course, there are no minutes of proceedings of what takes place in the Standing Orders Committee. So we who elect our colleagues to represent us never know what proposition they support or what they put forward. Very few of them have stood in the Senate and supported some of these proposals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one of the treacherous Australian Labor Party members on the Senate Standing Orders Committee who sold out the Opposition I thought I might issue one or two comments on this subject. The view of the Labor Party members on the Standing Orders Committee was unanimously to support his recommendation. I am not sure whether the actual votes or the consensus decisions in the Standing Orders Committee will appear in the minutes. I support the proposal in relation to petitions because I believe they are simply a farce. People go to a lot of trouble with petitions. They print them; they run them off; they take them around the suburbs and into the countryside and they get thousands of signatures on them. The petitions come into this place and I believe they have absolutely no effect at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If honourable senators look at the Ministers who are sitting opposite when petitions are read in the Senate they will see that they are virtually sleeping with their eyes open. I am sure that is just as true when we are in government. No one takes any notice of petitions. They have no effect at all on governments. The real effect they have is to delude the people who have signed them and who have gone to all that trouble into thinking that they do have an effect. I am sure that if all the people who signed a petition actually came to this House and saw what was done with it they would never sign another petition.

I find it attractive because I believe the procedure we have for presenting petitions in this chamber does not add anything to the dignity of the chamber.

<PARA> The petitions about which Senator McLaren is complaining, saying that he would not be able to present them in the Senate publicly, are petitions of a political nature. I do not say that in any disparaging way. If an honourable senator wants to use the forms of Parliament as they are at present for political purposes I do not see why he should not be able to do so. But I think the subject matter of the petitions which are being presented in such a way could be raised when dealing with some other matter. The petitions Senator McLaren wants to present could still be presented. I do not see why he could not raise those matters at some time during debate or even every night in the adjournment debate if he wishes to do so in order to highlight the contents of that petition and the fact that it has been presented. Under the proposal we have before us at the moment the contents of the petition will still be printed in Hansard, so they will be available in a permanent record. They will be available for the public to refer to or for individual senators to refer to and send to their constituents if they still desire to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been the added suggestion that petitions be referred to a standing committee. I was always under the assumption-it seems to me that it was a misapprehension of mine-that petitions were sent to the Ministers concerned. I had that misapprehension-if it was a misapprehension-reinforced because recently I received a letter from the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) saying that I had presented a petition of a certain type. His letter of two and a half pages stated why the petition was not necessary and gave a counterargument. It seems, in those circumstances, that that petition was referred to the Minister. But even if a petition is referred to the relevant Minister, it seems to me to be an advance that we will now refer all petitions to a standing committee. The Clerks who service that standing committee will be able to look at all the petitions to see whether any of them require a reference from that committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that we are in any way taking away the rights of the people in the electorate who sign petitions. I defend the rights of people to sign petitions and to have them presented here but I do not defend the right of individual senators to be able to hold up the proceedings of the Senate. Many honourable senators do not have any strong feelings about the petitions they present. In addition, I see that if an honourable senator has a strong feeling about a particular petition, he has the right at some later stage to highlight that petition. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention one other matter which I hope that the Standing Orders Committee might take on board at some stage. It is not a matter that has been mentioned so far in this debate. I refer to the actual counting of the number of petitioners whose signatures appear on individual petitions. I am not quite sure whether this is necessary. It is necessary under the Standing Orders, of course. Standing Order 91 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Every senator presenting a Petition to the Senate shall affix his name at the beginning thereof, together with a statement of the number of signatures. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not suppose that many senators actually count the number of signatures that appear on their petitions. They hand the petitions to the officers and some officer has to count laboriously the number of signatures on that petition and indicate that number on the petition. Honourable senators then accept that number as the correct number of signatories. I just wonder whether all that work is necessary. The fact that this does not happen in the other place should not be taken by us to mean that we also should not count the number of signatures. But does counting the signatures really achieve any purpose? I am not sure that it does. Senator Grimes told us last night of a petition that was presented in this place with 25,000 signatures on it. It would have taken somebody a long time to count those signatures. It gives an indication, if not of the strength of feeling, perhaps the amount of organisation, behind this petition. Senator Grimes also mentioned the petition signed by 75,000 people last century when people petitioned that Ned Kelly should be reprieved. Again, that showed the strength of feeling, or the organisation, behind the petition, but it was to no avail; Ned Kelly was not reprieved. </PARA>

I imagine that if honourable senators themselves had to count the number of signatures on a petition in order to show that number on the petition, when it came to petitions of the strength of 25,000 signatures we might change the Standing Orders quite readily.</PARA></TALK.START>

I had thought quite carefully about it, but after hearing Senator Colston I have now decided that I will support Senator McLaren. Senator Colston made a couple of statements to the effect that honourable senators do not have very much feeling for some of the petitions they present. I take exception to that suggestion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Colston did say that. I do not know whether he was referring to me or to others. I am just saying that because of his remarks I am now supporting Senator McLaren. I believe that petitions should be read in the Senate. I think it has been said by those who support the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders and by those who are against the Committee's recommendation, that people do not take much notice of petitions and not a great deal happens to them once they arrive in the Senate. Some honourable senators have alluded to the fact that people sign petitions without telling them that not much will happen to the petitions. I do not think that is the case , either. I think it is made very clear to the people who sign a petition that they have to understand that the Senate will not do a lot with it. But I believe that if a petition is read in the Parliament honourable senators will at least, if they are listening, hear it being read. I believe that if a petition is read on a number of occasions it has some effect of the relevant Minister. I refer to he Community Youth Support Scheme. When I first came to the Senate I noticed the number of petitions that were presented complaining about the Government's action in relation to this matter. I believe that one of the reasons the Government changed its mind was the sort of pressure that was continually put on it by the number of petitions that were presented not only in the Senate but also in the other place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Grimes may have done that, but I have not. The people who sign the petitions which I present do so because of what is stated in the introductory article that draws attention to the subject of the petition. I think it is fairly important that we should be exacting when we seek signatures on a petition. I believe that petitions should be read in this chamber so that the Senate and the Government know the contents of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point I wish to make is that those people who sign a petition do so because of its contents-not because a member of parliament has made up some story about it but because he or she wants support on a particular matter. They sign it because they believe it should be signed, because they believe in the issue set out at the beginning of the petition. For that reason I believe that we should not take away any rights of those people who sign petitions. I know that last night it was argued that people who sign petitions really do not get anything in return. I believe that even if nothing else happens to a petition, at least it should be passed on. I agree with Senator McLaren's suggestion that a petition should be read either by the Clerk or by the honourable senator who presents it. I think that is a reasonable suggestion. I believe also that the suggestion that petitions should be referred to a standing committee so that there should be some further action on them, is a good one. I do not believe that when people are asked to sign a petition we should have to say to them: ' The Senate has just passed a resolution accepting the Standing Orders Committee recommendations that petitions should not be read'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the amendment moved by Senator Robertson I request that when the Standing Orders Committee considers item 4 it looks through the Hansard at the documents that I have asked to be tabled from time to time. Today a Minister again quoted from a document. It is obvious that notice is given of questions from Government members to Ministers. I make the plea that members of the Standing Orders Committee have their research assistants or other assistants look back through the Hansard, not only to November of last year, the period to which the only documents I have relate, but also to the period since the Government has been in office. They should look at all the times when the Government has been called on to table documents. In some instances even the name of the senator who has asked the question is typed on to the answer. There is proof that some questions are pre-arranged. They are not questions without notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things we have been talking about in this debate on amending the Standing Orders is saving the time of the Senate. Ministers are able to save time because, if they have not got ready answers to questions from this side, they ask Opposition senators to put their questions on notice. When one of their own colleagues has given them advance notice-this applies particularly to Senator Carrick-they can spend 10 minutes giving an answer to something about which they have been forewarned. I make the plea that the Standing Orders Committee do some research on that issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some weeks ago I asked a question without notice of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister for Health ( Senator Baume) representing the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) seeking assurance about the continued functioning of the Australian Women's Broadcasting Co-operative. Substantially anxiety had been expressed throughout the nation after remarks which had been attributed to the newly appointed Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Professor Leonie Kramer, indicating that she was somewhat less than committed to the women's unit and its regular program, Coming Out. The Minister was unable to answer my question but a letter from Professor Kramer to the National Times on 4 April has since reassured us that she has been convinced that the programs fill a need and that they will continue. It seems appropriate to take this opportunity to place on record the rationale underlying the Australian Women's Broadcasting Co-operative . I quote from the submission made by the Co-operative to the Committee of Review of the ABC, the Dix Committee, in June 1980. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Women's Broadcasting Co-operative is a voluntary association of women employees of the ABC formed in late 1974 by women working mainly in the radio and television areas of the ABC in Sydney. The initial purpose was to further the aims of International Women's Year inside the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> During this first year the Co-operative initiated and organised a wide variety of informal, out of hours training workshops to enable some 200 female staff ( predominantly in typing and clerical and support positions) to acquire some basic skills and knowledge of radio and television production. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, ABC management was asked to provide time on ABC radio and television so that the aims of International Women's Year-and the developing women's activities around that year, could be presented, and so that female staff could utilise and develop their skills. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission agreed to a weekly radio program which was called 'The Coming Out Ready Or Not Show' (now 'The Coming Out Show'). In television women were permitted to make some twenty second 'fillers' around the aims of International Women's Year. </PARA>
<PARA> Five years later, the Co-operative is still a thriving and productive voluntary enterprise within the ABC which enables women within the organisation to provide one another with support in their work lives, experience in organisational decision-making, and the development of production skills. It also serves as a source of identity and identification for women who are a minority group within a large and impersonal bureacratic organisation. The focus is still in radio production, but a new group of women within the Co-operative has formed to develop their own television skills on a self-help basis. Small interstate groups have developed and contribute both to the radio program and on major issues, to Co-operative decision making. </PARA>
<PARA> We envisage that there will be a need for the Co-operative, or some other group with similar functions, while women remain a minority and disadvantaged group within the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The Coming Out Show' is broadcast on Radio 2 between 5.05 and 5.50 p.m. each Saturday and on the country network (Radio 3) at 7.15 p.m. each Friday. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC's own submission to the Committee of Review described it thus-we quote in full:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The weekly program ''Coming Out 80'' is prepared by women working for the department' (Radio Talks and Documentaries). </PARA>
<PARA> While strictly true, this description fails to explain the distinctive brief of the program and totally fails to acknowledge the contributions that hundreds of ABC women staff, a great many of them non-producers, have made to the program or the continuing involvement of the Women's Broadcasting Co-operative in determining program policy and content. </PARA>
<PARA> From its first broadcast on International Women's Day, 1975, the aim of the program was tied to the aims of International Women's Year and of the UN Decade for Women. </PARA>
<PARA>The initial submission of the ABC women on this subject to the ABC management summarised the aims of International Women's Year as set down by the United Nations and as supported by the Australian Government. They emphasised that one of the main aims of International Women's Year was the removal of discrimination against women. The submission continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The only way to make anything more than a token gesture towards this aim in programming terms is to establish a special unit which will take responsibility for providing a regular program output during International Women's Year and at the same time seek out and foster the talents of the many women in the ABC who have program-making potential but at present are denied opportunities within the ABC for developing their potential. </PARA>
<PARA> 'We believe that such a unit, by its active existence and the programs it produces, would help achieve the second aim of International Women's Year by '' emphasising women's responsibility and role in the economic, social and cultural development of our society'', and would go some way towards the eventual achievement of the first aim of IWY-''achieving equality of opportunity between women and men''.'</PARA>
<PARA>The production strategy for the Co-operative is carried out within the department of talks and documentaries. The submission continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The unit currently has three full-time staff: A Production Co-ordinator ( Program Officer Grade 3) who is responsible for co-ordinating overall production contributions, maintaining liaison with ABC women and freelance contributors interstate and overseas, with women's groups in the community, the administrative responsibilities of the unit, and the production training the unit provides women in the course of making programs. </PARA>
<PARA>In preparation for 1982 are some very interesting initiatives. They include the production of five one-hour features which will investigate the works of Australian women writers between the Wars. These programs will include as subjects Marjorie Barnard Eldershaw and Miles Franklin. In addition, a radio festival is being planned, a half-day seminar to expose women who seek to produce within radio and to take other creative and technical roles within the organisation to a huge range of broadcasting styles, using both Australian and international examples. This is a completely new departure; nothing of this sort has ever been attempted within the ABC or within any other broadcasting services in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Programs which have been to air in the five years between March 1975 and June 1980 were analysed for their content. I am able to identify international programs discussing the status of women in countries other than Australia as accounting for 10 per cent; women's contribution to literature and the arts, excluding music, for roughly another 10 per cent; women's music for another 10 per cent; and women's health, nutrition, sexuality and fertility control for a further 10 per cent. It is hoped that in 1982 regular national round-ups from Melbourne will be produced to give Victorian women a chance to participate and to develop their skills in the way that it has been possible in Sydney since the program started in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> An ABC task force of 1977 which investigated the employment of women within the ABC showed very clearly that women were concentrated in the traditional women's occupations and had very little opportunity of being seen as anything but part of the furniture. Young men joining the ABC in unskilled and semi-skilled jobs had a wide range of training options and access to promotional ladders. The whole question of opportunities had, and still has, nothing to do with intelligence or capacity. It had everything to do with indifference at best and blind prejudice at worst. Excuses that were then used to restrict women to their traditional supportive roles-lack of physical strength, a tendency to have husbands and babies and a lack of lavatories-are still being used, but no longer is it possible to argue that women are not acceptable as news readers on radio or television. It is no longer acceptable to argue, for example, as was being done in those days, in 1975, that James Dibble is the ideal news reader. It is no longer possible to argue that women lack creativity, technical skills or administrative ability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Women's Broadcasting Co-operative in its review in 1980 of the 1977 task force report updated the data, but sadly discovered little change in either staffing structure or administrative attitudes within the ABC. The general malaise which has had the effect of creeping paralysis on the ABC over the past few years has sadly inhibited long overdue changes which should by now have been apparent in the staff structure. The political and industrial pressures, the financial constraints and, above all, the deplorable lack of leadership and administrative skills in upper and middle management in the ABC have reduced a once promising and innovative institution to a shadow-an apology for a national broadcasting commission. To the degree that many of us continue to listen and watch, we do so out of loyalty, habit or distaste for the alternatives. We clutch at the occasional assurance of life in the old relative yet. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of recommendations in volume 2 of the Dix report-these are found on pages 631 and 632 under the heading 'Equal employment opportunity'-go towards the special responsibilities of the ABC as an employer and as a means of portraying realistically the groups in Australian society which have special needs or are in some way disadvantaged. We have been waiting a very long time for the Government to indicate just what action is to be taken on the review of the ABC. We hope that when eventually some action is indicated, this extremely important facet of the recommendations will not be overlooked. </PARA>

He raised the matter in the other place this morning by way of a question and subsequently put out a Press release; and I had some discussion with him about it. </PARA>
<PARA> To put the matter in its proper perspective, I want to read again the text of the telex which I received from Mr Davidge, who is the Chairman of the Ricegrowers' Co-operative Mills Ltd at Leeton. The telex states:</PARA>
<PARA> To: Senator G. T. McLaren, South Australian, Parliament House Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> %.: Ricegrowers' Co-operative Mills Limited, Leeton (No. 763 taped 1507hrs 28-4 -82)</PARA>
<PARA> Most concerned at sudden increase in importations of rice into Australia which do not meet high Australian standards and are threat under quarantine system to Australian ricegrowing industry. Western Australian industry supports our view. As member of committee of inquiry into quarantine safeguards, your support sought urgently for investigation into way that quarantine barrier around NSW ricegrowing area was broken and rice from China was put on sale. Further seek your support for declaration from quarantine service that in view of contaminated samples which have been identified by this co-operative and reported to quarantine service stringent controls should be placed on imported rice so that it meets the high standards of our export quality products. Understand ship due to leave Bangkok which may carry rice for Australia. Ship due to call at several southern ports and Fremantle. </PARA>
<PARA>That telex was sent to me as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources which inquired into quarantine. We received written and oral evidence from members of the Leeton rice growers' co-operative. Whilst some people might think that their main concern in regard to quarantine was just to throw a barrier around the importation of rice, they are more concerned than that. It has been said that their main concern about quarantine was that they did not want any rice imported into Australia because it might affect their own livelihoods. I disagree with that point of view. In discussions I had this morning I found that they are most emphatic that the quarantine regulations should be carried out at the most stringent level possible. As they point out in the telex, they want an investigation into the way in which the quarantine barrier around the New South Wales rice growing area was broken and rice from China was put on sale. That is something they want to know and I make that plea on their behalf in this place. They also want to see stringent controls placed on imported rice so that it meets the high standard of quality of our exports. I agree with them. The first thought of those people who support primary industry in Australia should always be to protect our own producers, in this case, the rice growers. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Mr Kerin, who asked a question of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) in the other place this morning, told me that he put out a Press release. The Press release by Mr Kerin, the shadow Minister for primary industry, reads:</PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that imported rice does not come up to Australian standards for milling and hygiene. </PARA>
<PARA> Foreign samples have shown unmilled grains which pose a disease risk to the $ 150m NSW rice industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that some parcels of rice have got through the NSW quarantine barrier is of utmost concern to the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry's answer to my question in the House of Representatives today indicated that he is aware of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> One trusts that he will take more positive steps than merely monitoring imports . </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition fully supports the Ricegrowers Association of Australia who will meet the Minister for Health today to gain assurances about stringent quarantine requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope it does not just seek assurances but that it in fact gains assurances. Mr Kerin continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In general, food imports into Australia are becoming an increasing concern for primary producers. References to the IAC and consideration of health questions are a slow way to decide what we should do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government needs to develop a policy towards food, and what level of food imports it sees as being in Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Far too much food produced by Australian farmers goes on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA>We know that is because we do not have sufficient markets. That is the context of Mr Kerin's Press release which has the full support of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party and, in particular, the Caucus resources committee of which I am a member. In asking for those restrictions to be placed upon any imported rice and that the strictest hygiene regulations be adhered to, we are not asking for anything that will hurt our exports to other countries. A matter that interests me is an article today in the Australian Financial Review from Glenda Korporaal in Washington headed: 'US expected to impose sugar quotas '' within days'' '. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The US Government is expected to announce the imposition of sugar import quotas within the next few days-a move which would be yet another set back for Australian sugar exporters. </PARA>
<PARA>One of our major exporters of sugar-Queensland-will have some import quotas placed upon it. The ricegrowers of New South Wales are not asking for anything which, in my view, could offend some of the customers. If the Americans, in their wisdom, are to place severe quotas on sugar exports from Australia, likewise the Australian rice growers-they are not asking for any quota system- will ask that the hygiene regulations are tightened up and that no rice of an inferior quality to our own and which may carry some disease can be brought into this country. As has been pointed out both by Mr Davidge and Mr Kerin, some unmilled grains have been found to contain foreign matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the people in the Leeton area. I share their concern as to what might happen to their industry. The people who live in the MIA, that is, the Murray Irrigation Area-not only the rice growers but the small business people and the people who want employment-depend to a large degree on the rice growing industry for a livelihood. Likewise, the people who live there and have small businesses have depended in the past on the wine industry. We know that that industry has suffered a slump in recent times. If the rice industry is to be affected by disease which could come in if the quarantine restrictions and the surveillance methods are not tightened up, this will not only add to the financial problems of people in the Murray Irrigation Area but also will show that the people in the country areas have a lot going for them as long as the governments of the day are prepared to protect them. That is one thing the Australian Labor Party will insist upon. We will endeavour to protect them. The assurance given by Mr Kerin shows that we have the interests of the rice growers in the Leeton area at heart. We hope that after those consultations today between the rice growers representatives and Senator Peter Baume as Minister for Health some statement could be made-I hope later today-to assure both the Senate and the rice growers that in fact measures are being taken which will protect their livelihoods. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity, on the first reading of these money Bills, to discuss what I consider to be one of the social tragedies of the 1980s; that is, housing in this country. I think it is fairly clear from the publicity that has been given to this matter that the Government' s policy on housing, and the way in which it has affected housing in Australia, clearly is not of any assistance to the young people and the older people in this community who are trying to obtain some sort of accommodation for their families. I believe this is fairly clearly shown in the census data reported in the 'Housing finance' section of the Australian Financial Review which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has traditionally been a nation of homeowners. Census data for 1976 indicated that 66.7 per cent of householders lived in dwellings which they owned or were in the process of buying. In 1966 the percentage was 72.5. </PARA>
<PARA> ABS sample survey figures compiled on a different basis indicate that home ownership declined from 73.3 per cent in 1978 to 71.9 per cent in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Government policies typically have tried to promote the ideal of home ownership . Grants for first home buyers, government provision of houses for private purchase and restrictions on mortgage interest rates are examples. </PARA>
<PARA>But it is quite obvious that the last two examples in particular are not working . The mortgage interest rate hike in itself is removing any chance of people being able to purchase their own homes. One of the major problems facing young people, elderly couples, single parents, low income and middle income families is trying to find suitable accommodation for themselves and their children. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that, next to unemployment, housing is one of the most serious problems facing this country today. It is nearly impossible for any young couple to buy their own home and in a lot of cases it is impossible for couples to retain ownership of their dwellings. It seems that with the continual hike in the interest rate young couples who have been fortunate enough to raise a deposit to purchase their own homes are now finding that it is totally impossible for them to continue to make the repayments to hold on to the home that they purchased some years earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The interest rate hike which has been allowed by this Government has caused many recognisable and unrecognisable problems for most home buyers-persons preparing to purchase a home and persons renting a house, a flat or a dwelling. The problems which are created are passed on to the builder and for that matter, on to the 26 allied trades tied to the building industry throughout this country . I suppose that if we look at that section of the legislation which relates to the mortgage rate and to the amount borrowed it is fairly easy to see that if young people were to obtain a statement at the end of the year from their building society or bank or from the area in which they borrowed their money, and compared the amount of money paid off the principal and off the interest, they would see that in a very short time they would be paying a terrific amount of interest and not much off the principal at all. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the high interest rate hike that this Government is allowing to take place that is causing the problems for the young people in the community. If the mortgage is a recent mortgage, one that has been taken out in the last couple of years, then I suppose that when those people look at the gap between the amount paid off the principal and the amount paid off the interest they would see that it was extremely large and they would find that they were in trouble. I think it has been shown fairly clearly that the increased interest rate has caused problems not only in repayments but also the non-availability of the same amount of money that was available prior to that increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I have before me a chart from the St George Building Society which demonstrates fairly clearly the problems with which people are faced when attempting to borrow money for a mortgage-those people who find that they do not earn a sufficient amount to be able to meet the requirements of the building society to borrow the amount of money that they need to purchase a dwelling. If someone were to borrow an amount of $30,100 at 12 1/2 per cent and the loan was taken out over a period of 15 years the repayments would be $371 a month. Total repayments would be $66,780, and total interest would be $36,680. If a person were to borrow the same amount over 25 years the repayments would be $328 a month. In other words, an amount of $328 a month over a period of 25 years would represent total repayments of $98,400. Total interest for that period of 25 years would be in the vicinity of $68,300. If a person borrowed the same amount, that is $30,100, over 30 years the repayments would be $321 a month-a very small amount less than the original amount to be paid over that term. Total payments over that term of 30 years for the $30,100 borrowed would be $115,560 and-wait for it-total interest over that period would be $85,460. It is only when one looks at the amount borrowed, the amount of repayments, the amount paid back and the amount of interest that one realises the sorts of problems facing young people and elderly couples buying a house or a dwelling in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased interest rate causes problems not only in relation to repayments but also in relation to the amounts that can be borrowed. I have before me an article from the 'Housing finance' section of the Australian Financial Review headed 'New interest rate cuts down borrowing power' which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The amount a sample group of middle-income earners can borrow from building societies will drop with the . . . interest rate rises by about $5,000 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That article refers to the original increase in the interest rate. There would be a further decline in the amount of money that would be lent by building societies to this group of people if they took into consideration the increases in the interest rate of recent times. This would add to the of $5,000 and would cut down the amount which they could borrow. Of course, the table to which I have just referred shows only the middle income earners. But look at the problems of those people who earn less than $270 a week, people with a take home pay of $170 or $175. What chance would they have to borrow money from a building society? What chance would they have to find the $320 a month to pay off a dwelling?</PARA>
<PARA> The situation is becoming increasingly worse not only for those people who are trying to purchase their own dwelling but also for those who are trying to rent a dwelling-people who cannot afford to raise a deposit. There is a gap between the amount being lent by the building societies or the banks and the weekly income people have to earn to be able to borrow money either from the building societies or the lending institutions. Those same people are now trying to obtain some sort of reasonable accommodation at a reasonable price. When they go to obtain accommodation, they find they have to take either second class or low class accommodation which is unrepaired, unpainted, unfenced and, in some cases, with no electric lighting, in order to be able to afford to pay the rent which has been asked by the landlords. The dwellings which I have just described are not all that cheap. In the metropolitan area of Brisbane and areas outside Brisbane those dwelling are at the moment letting from somewhere in the vicinity of $35 and $40 a week. The normal renting rate that is being asked in the metropolitan area of Brisbane is somewhere in the vicinity of $70 and $80. If we look at the better suburban areas of Brisbane we find that in 1981 the amount of rental paid in, say, a suburb such as Indooroopilly varied from $75 to $130. </PARA>
<PARA> I was talking to a member of the Real Estate Institute of Queensland this morning. He informed me that there has been a further increase in the rental charges in those areas. A person could now pay anything from $90 to $156 a week in the Indooroopilly area. What chance do people on the pension or those who receive a single income have of renting the type of dwellings that are being let in the Brisbane metropolitan area and throughout Queensland? They have no opportunity. One finds in some cases people finish up with about $5 left out of the Government payment after paying their rent. We now find situations in which two and three families live in the one dwelling. Two or three families have to live in the one dwelling to meet the rental payments. Of course, we have the social problems that develop out of a number of families living together because they cannot pay the rent asked by the landlord unless they pool their resources.</PARA>
<PARA> Keperra, in the Brisbane metropolitan area, was a former Housing Commission area, an area where low cost homes were constructed by the Queensland Government . Those homes are now about 15 or 20 years old. They have been sold and are now rented to people who require rental accommodation. This morning I had a discussion with a real estate agent from Keperra, an area where one would expect people on low incomes to be able to find some reasonable accommodation. The estate agent informs me that people renting in that area would pay between $60 and $70 a week for an ex-Housing Commission house, a house constructed for lower income families some 20 years prior to their being let to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening is that the increase in interest rates, the cut in the amount of money being lent by lending institutions such as banks, lending societies, building societies, et cetera, and the increased deposit which cannot be found by people mean that more and more people are being forced into rental accommodation that is second rate and accommodation for which they find they cannot meet the rental charged unless they have another family share it with them. This helps to meet the rent charged by the landlord. This situation will develop further and further. A Federal government housing policy has just been put forward which acknowledges problems in the housing industry. The Federal Government recognises the fact that there are problems in the housing industry and it has tried to do something about them. What this Federal Government has done is only a band-aid attempt to try to change the problems that will develop out of the housing situation in this country. The easiest way to explain the situation to the Senate and to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, is for me to read from an article in the Age of 26 March in which Dr Llew Edwards, the Deputy Premier of Queensland made some comments. I will quote from the article by Llew Edwards in which he stated very clearly-</PARA>

<PARA>QUEENSLAND LIBERAL LEADER HITS FEDERAL HOUSE PLAN</PARA>
<PARA>From David Broadbent</PARA>
<PARA> Brisbane-The Queensland Liberal leader and Treasurer, Dr Llew Edwards, yesterday said the Federal Government's latest housing scheme was a Band-Aid measure which did nothing to attack the real problems of housing finance. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Edwards' attack came on the eve of the Federal Government's $300,000 advertising campaign to explain the benefits of the scheme which has been enthusiastically embraced by the Victorian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Edwards strongly criticised the Federal Government's failure to control interest rates, saying he sometimes thought it was inclined to promote higher rates. </PARA>
<PARA> A Federal Government backbencher, Mr Cameron (NCP, Queensland) also expressed concern about record interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cameron, in Canberra, called on the Treasurer, Mr Howard, to ease the present tight liquidity by releasing some of the banks' 'frozen' statutory reserve deposits, or by allowing faster growth of the money supply. He later put in a submission to the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, and the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Edwards said the Federal tax rebate scheme on mortgages would artificially lower home-buyers' interest, but the decision raised costs for all other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> 'A subsidy scheme does not attack any of the basic problems', Dr Edwards said. </PARA>
<PARA> He said the problems faced by home owners and buyers were only symptoms of a very serious malaise affecting the whole nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The criticisms were made by Dr Edwards during a speech to Parliament on the state of Queensland's economy and were repeated later at a Press conference. He issued a summary of his speech in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Edwards said the timing of his attack on the housing scheme at a critical stage of the Victorian election was a coincidence. He said it had been planned 10 days ago. 'Anyway, it is the right of anybody to give an economic statement based on fact at any time', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'If my remarks had any effect in Victoria it would be the first time they have taken any notice of Queensland.'</PARA>
<PARA> In his speech Dr Edwards also attacked recent forecasts of gloom and depression from 'influential sources', saying he firmly believed that economic prophecies were to a very large extent self-fulfilling. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I believe these statements will impact on industry and the finance world in a way which tends to bring about the conditions which have been predicted', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Edwards denied that the timing of his statement would undermine Mr Fraser's leadership. He said he was convinced that Mr Fraser was the best person to be Prime Minister of Australia. However, senior Liberal Party officials in Queensland are expressing deep concern that the Federal Government has become so worried about a Labor victory in Victoria that it is losing sight of its own natural electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech Dr Edwards said the Federal Government's attitude towards tax sharing, capital funding, hospital costs, roads and specific purpose funding would continue to cause difficulties for all States. </PARA>
<PARA> These attitudes hurt Queensland in particular because the Federal Government refused to take account of its extraordinary population growth, its decentralisation and the vast areas to be serviced. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I reject completely the Federal Government philosophy that interest rates should be free of all control and set by the market place', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The money market cannot be the pacesetter in interest rate determination'. </PARA>
<PARA> 'What is happening to the home owner is only a symptom of the total problem. The high rates are seriously affecting the total economy and the Australian Government must accept its responsibilities and not abdicate them to a market place that is responsible to no-one'. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Edwards said interest rates should be firmly regulated by State and Federal Governments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use this debate at the first reading stage of a money Bill to refer again to a matter I initially raised on 11 March this year, what I call the Grace Bros rip-off. Briefly, it was in connection with the charges incurred on household goods being taken from the Hobart dock to the Grace Bros Transport Group bond store in a Hobart suburb and from there to the suburban residence of a migrant from the United Kingdom. The core of what I referred to was that because of the container system, where several clients share a container, that firm is able to tie up people and prevent them from obtaining more competitive prices in the market place. I went on to say that to me this seems a restrictive trade practice that should be investigated. Since that time representatives of the company from Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney have visited me twice in my office for long discussions. They wrote me a letter dated 25 March. So that their full statement can be published and not be subject to my selecting parts to quote, I seek leave to incorporate the four page letter in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>JFH:SH</PARA>
<PARA>Senator J. Coates,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, A.C.T. 2600 25th March, 1982</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> We believe it necessary to respond formally to statements you made in the Senate and recorded in Hansard on March 11th and March 16th, 1982 respectively. The statements in question are those pertaining to Grace Bros and the exploitation you allege of one of your constituents and of migrants in general. It is our understanding the constituent is Mr E. W. T. French. </PARA>
<PARA> Our first contact with Mr French evolved as a result of the receipt of shipping documents by us from Messrs Stewart &amp; Harvey-a shipping and forwarding agent based in London, England. Those documents reflected that Stewart &amp; Harvey had consigned to Grace Bros International in Hobart one steamship container containing the household effects and personal possessions of five separate customers of which Mr French was one. In each case we were directed to contact the customer and arrange clearance and delivery in accord with their instructions upon payment in Hobart of the charges due for those services. </PARA>
<PARA> As is our normal practice-a written communication was despatched to each customer outlining the documentation needed to effect Customs clearance and included in that first advice was our quotation of the costs involved in effecting a complete destination service. In the case of Mr French our all inclusive quotation totalled $755.00. Mr French queried the level of our charges and-on several occasions-spoke to our Manager in Tasmania on this subject. Due to the fact that he had chosen to have his effects shipped with other goods as part of a groupage container load, he was informed that Grace Bros must undertake the removal of the container from the docks and the unpacking and segregation of the various shipments therein into our approved Customs premises, and he would need to pay his share of those costs. He was-however-also informed that he could then make his own arrangements relative to Customs and Quarantine clearance and ultimate delivery should he so desire. The end result was your constituent elected to have us perform the full delivery service and paid the charges quoted. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to your involvement, Mr French also approached the Consumer Affairs Council in Hobart and they in turn made contact with us. A full explanation of the circumstances and charges involved was rendered to the Consumer Affairs Council and it is our understanding that no exploitation or unfair practices towards a consumer are in evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary that we point out to you the alternatives available to individuals who have a need to re-located their household goods internationally. At the point of origin they are invariably provided by their removal contractor with several quotations dependent upon the mode of transport and the services included and/or excluded. The purpose of providing alternative quotations at origin is to ensure that customers are made well aware of the total costs from residence in one country to a residence in another country before they enter into a contract. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have evidence that Mr French was made well aware of the extent of the charges which would be incurred in Australia before he placed his removal in the hands of his chosen contractor in the United Kingdom. The appended copy letters from Mr French to Foremost Air Sea Transport Limited and their reply dated February 8th, 1982 will be self explanatory. May we draw your attention to paragraphs 4 and 5 in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> By electing to have his effects shipped as part of a groupage container your constituent has saved considerable freight costs. Had Mr French elected to ship his goods as a single consignment in a standard size steamship container he would have been responsible for the freight payable on the whole container rather than part of it. Even utilising the latter mode of shipment there would be charges to pay in Hobart to the Steamship appointed terminal for unloading and handling prior to Customs clearance and delivery. Your constituent chose the cheaper method of shipment and was made aware before the very uplift of the goods that (a) an agent would be involved in unpacking and (b) the extent of charges he could expect to pay for the clearance and delivery of his shipment upon arrival in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> You stated in the Senate that the Commonwealth levies no charges in connection with the clearance of household effects and that statement is incorrect. May we also point out that the Commonwealth does not provide the bonded premises in which commodities of this nature must be cleared-the Commonwealth does not provide the labour necessary to unpack containers and make goods available for examination, and the Commonwealth expects someone to compile and process the myriad of documents needed before they will consider examining imported goods. </PARA>
<PARA> You have also stated that Mr French obtained three alternative quotes which were significantly under the charges levied by Grace Bros. We have ascertained the source of one of those quotes and have determined from that company that the request made to them-and the quote given-related only to a simple collection of goods from the wharf in Hobart and delivery to your constituents residence. There was no allowance made for any of the processes involved in Customs and Quarantine clearance, container unpacking fees or complete unpacking of an international shipment at residence. May we also remind you that Mr French was given the opportunity of employing another contractor for clearance and delivery once the goods had been unpacked from the steamship container in our depot. </PARA>
<PARA> Grace Bros International has been operating since 1911 and is now one of the largest and most respected companies in the international removal business in the World today. You will agree that status and longevity of providing services would not have been possible if it was our practice to ''exploit'' and ''rip off '' customers. We have been a leader in improving service standards within this Industry and many of our executives have and continue to hold official posts in every major National and International regulatory association. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1979 we led the World in taking up the cause of migrants who were being misled as to costs applicable in Australia and that is evidenced by the enclosed copy letter directed to the British Association of Removers. Mr French had the benefit of that action in the respect that his contractor provided him with alternatives and a door to door price. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past we have been commended by officials of the Commonwealth Department of Immigration for the part we played in assisting the many immigrants who were left stranded in Australia when two major British companies were declared bankrupt whilst still holding hundreds of shipments for which they had already been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> You are also in error in stating that potential immigrants ''may never have heard of Grace bros until they get a letter demanding what appears to be an enormous amount of money''. For many years we have maintained a liaison office in London and our resident manager is extremely active in advising intending migrants of Australia in general and our services in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> You will appreciate that your statements in the Senate and the subsequent media exposure have created considerable concern to our shareholders, employees and customers. However, you may not appreciate that those same statements have had an immediate and adverse effect on our level of enquiries and our business in general. </PARA>
<PARA> We can only trust that the facts presented will result in your understanding that the allegations made are without foundation, unfair and unjustified. We further trust that such understanding on your part will result in your making another statement in the Senate which will reinstate the good name of this Company. </PARA>

<PARA> Due to the fact that he--</PARA>
<PARA>The constituent who had come to me about the problem--</PARA>
<PARA>had chosen to have his effects shipped with other goods as part of a groupage container load, he was informed--</PARA>

<PARA>that Grace Bros must undertake the removal of the container from the docks and the unpacking and segregation of the various shipments therein into our approved Customs premises, and he would need to pay his share of those costs. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one point. The second one was: He was-however-also informed that he could then make his own arrangements relative to Customs and quarantine clearance and ultimate delivery should he so desire. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps at this point I should also refer to the reply I received from the Trade Practices Commission to which my office referred the matter. I think the Trade Practices Commission in its letter misses the point. I seek leave at this stage to incorporate the Commission's letter in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA>Ms L. Hornsey,</PARA>
<PARA>G.P.O. Box 284C,</PARA>
<PARA>Hobart, Tas. 7001</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Ms Hornsey,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 17 March 1982 and the copy of pages from Hansard setting out the matter raised by Senator Coates on 11 March 1982 on behalf of one of his constituents. Essentially the complaint concerns the price charged by Grace Bros Holdings Ltd (Grace Bros) for the transport of goods from the wharf at Hobart to the constituent's residence as a part of a contract with a company in the United Kingdom (U.K.) entered into by the constituent for the transport of his goods from his residence in the U.K. to his residence in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. I note you refer to other complaints against Grace Bros but there is nothing in the matter referred to in Hansard which indicates Grace Bros may have engaged in conduct which is contrary to the Trade Practices Act 1974. It is likely that Grace Bros is the agent in Australia of the company with which arrangements were entered into in the U.K. If there was not prior disclosure of the likely charges in Australia, that is a matter which the person involved should take up with the U.K. company. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Should you have any further information about this matter or other complaints of a similiar nature, I will of course consider the matter again. However, unless there is information to show that Grace Bros has engaged in conduct which was misleading or deceptive, the Commission cannot help. </PARA>

<PARA> Essentially the complaint concerns the price charged by Grace Bros . . . </PARA>
<PARA>My main point at the time was not about the price charged but about the lack of the customer's ability to obtain another contractor to do the job if he wanted this or if the price was better. Regardless of whether the price was competitive , he was locked in to using Grace Bros whatever it charged. I am sorry that the Trade Practices Commission missed that point because it concludes its letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . unless there is information to show that Grace Bros has engaged in conduct which was misleading or deceptive, the Commission cannot help. </PARA>
<PARA>My point was that the whole practice was restrictive in that people were not able to seek to contract in the market place because they were sharing a container with other people and unable to contract individually with anybody other than the firm that had the carriage of the container. In my view Grace Bros main defence to my allegation, when it is all boiled down, is that all firms do it. It is a standard and, apparently from what it says, necessary part of the international removal industry's practice. If that is so it is even more objectionable from my point of view. Perhaps firms ought not to be able to quote for carting goods only to the dock. If people choose not to have a total door to door move, they are quoted for carting goods to the dock in Hobart or whichever other city. Yet a person must use that firm for the next step because of the sharing of containers. Of course, the container systems does allow some savings compared with what the cost would otherwise be. But again, that is not the central point of the argument. It is the ability to choose that is the issue. Whether the charge is reasonable is less the issue than that, if the charge happens to be not reasonable whether the customer has any option about contracting at that price. So, I point out that freedom to choose is non- existent for the step in the process from the dock to the custom store. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is freedom to choose for transporting goods from the store to the residence which is the claim made by the firm. This supposed competition for that stage of the transporting job may exist in theory, but it is not a real freedom or choice because other firms tend to agree not to pick up the goods from the Grace Bros store. Grace Bros admit that it will not pick up goods from another firm's bond store. That, at least, is partly because of arguments about insurance and that sort of thing. I believe the whole issue needs further investigation. I suppose that the simplest way of dealing with it would be for removal firms to agree among themselves not to accept carriage of goods only to the dock or only to the bond store. If they did that voluntarily, I suppose there would be no need for further action. But the problem arises-the restrictive trade practice arises-because of firms, in this case Grace Bros, accepting contracts where there was no pre-agreed price. In theory they could have charged what they wanted or else the only alternative for the customer was to forgo the goods and leave them in the hands of the firm concerned. I am concerned that at each point in the process there is real freedom of choice and competition in the industry which does not happen under the system as it stands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the Excise Tariff ( Coal) Amendment Bill 1982 and the Coal Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1982. We are debating the first readings of Bills which the Senate may not amend. Because of this, like the previous speakers, I will speak on matters which are not relevant to the Bills. This is something that we are able to do in a first reading debate. I raise issues which are related to matters which Senator Jones mentioned only 10 minutes or so ago. In particular, I raise the problem facing people who want to build or buy a home in Australia at the present time. I confine my initial remarks to the interest rates with which people are faced. More and more people, especially young people, are finding it difficult to afford a home loan due to the soaring interest rates. These interest rates have occurred despite claims by this Government that it would curb any increases in interest rates. I give a couple of examples of statements which have been made in the past. I had a look at the 1975 policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to remind me of what he said. He made only passing reference to interest rates and did not really make any promises. But in 1977, in his election policy speech, Mr Fraser said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Interest rates have begun to fall and they will keep on falling. </PARA>
<PARA>That just has not happened. They have not kept on falling. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) in the same election campaign in 1977 was quoted in the Age of 26 November 1977 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I'll eat my hat if interest rates haven't come down a further 2 per cent next year. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only did interest rates not come down 2 per cent or anything like that but also, as far as I am aware, Mr Anthony did not eat his hat. What has happened despite the comments that were made by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister about what they would do with interest rates? In December 1975 when this Government came into office, the savings bank rate for new housing loans was 11.5 per cent. I believe that is about the lowest rate at which one can get a savings bank loan for a new house. In Queensland, however, the interest rates were slightly smaller if one had a look at the building societies' rate. Housing loans by Queensland building societies in December 1975 stood at 11 per cent, 0. 5 per cent below the savings bank rate. Between 1975 and about a year ago interest rates have fluctuated. But about a year ago they really took off. The March figures for this year show that the savings bank rate for new housing loans was 13.5 per cent. That was up 2 per cent on what it was in December 1975. The rates for housing loans by Queensland building societies-I mention Queensland in particular being a Senator for Queensland-was also 13.5 per cent, up 2.5 per cent. Although I mentioned the rate of 13.5 per cent, it is not unusual for those seeking home loans to be faced with even higher interest rates . I recently spoke to a professional person with a steady income and a good credit rating who was looking for a housing loan. The best rate that he could obtain for a housing loan was 15 per cent. If he had to pay 15 per cent other people with lesser credit ratings and less prospects of a steady income would probably pay more than 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to look at what the consequences of these high interest rates are. If we consider a $30,000 mortgage over a 25-year term with an interest rate of 11 per cent, a person would be paying $297 monthly in repayments. If the interest rate went up to 12 per cent those repayments would increase to $319. An interest rate of 13 per cent would require repayments of $341, 14 per cent $364 and 15 per cent $387. What this really means is that for every one per cent increase about this range of interest rate, approximately $5 a week more is repayable. So if there were an increase, say, from 14 per cent to 15 per cent, the home owner incurs another $5 a week just for interest payments. The consequences of these higher rates on home loans has been shown in some recent statistics. In 1980, 282,167 loans were made available to individuals for the construction or purchase of dwellings. In 1981 there were 250,167. </PARA>
<PARA> The percentages are probably a bit more revealing. The percentages reveal that from 1980 to 1981 there was an 11 per cent drop in the number of loans made available to individuals for construction or purchase of a dwelling. But that 11 per cent drop might not be the end of the story. There are indications that we will face decreases of a greater magnitude. The last three months for which home loan figures are available are December 1981 and January and February of this year. In December 1981, 19,047 home loans were approved. This compared with 23, 156 twelve months ago. That is a 17 per cent decrease. In January 1982 this year , 17,281 home loans were made available. This compares with the figure for the 12 months prior to that of 20,907 which is, again, a 17 per cent decrease over the 12 months. In February of this year there were 18,366 loans compared with 22 ,598 in February 1981. That was an 18 per cent decrease. Decreases of this magnitude in the number of home loans that are made available starkly indicate that many home seekers cannot afford the repayments associated with the high interest rates that we have at the moment. People who cannot afford these interest rates, of course, are seeking rented accommodation. But then they are caught in a further bind. Because of the increased demand for rental accommodation rents are increasing, making it even harder for potential home buyers to save. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just read the headings of a number of articles in the early part of this year on home rent. On 9 February the Australian Financial Review said in a headline 'Better to buy in Melbourne as rents continue rising'; an article in the Canberra Times on 27 February was headed 'Government tenants to pay more'; the Sydney Morning Herald on 2 March 1982 said in a headline 'Rental homes hard to find, and expensive'; an Age headline on 9 March 1982 said 'Agents tip big jump in rents'; the headline in the Age three days before, 6 March, said ' Hundreds face rent rises'; a headline in the Australian Financial Review on 10 March said 'Perth rent may jump $20'. These are the sorts of problems that people are facing when they cannot afford the interest rates and are looking for accommodation. They find that even the rents for the accommodation that they can get are soaring. All this is happening in spite of the Government's promise to contain interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask: What is the position of those who purchased before the interest rates explosion but whose interest rates have since soared? We know that most contracts nowadays have clauses in them so that interest rates can be increased as market forces increase other interest rates. I am saddened to hear of decent young Australians who have been forced to sell out because they could no longer afford the repayments. What sort of government is it that allows this to happen? I shall just read a letter which I received from a constituent. It is typical of the stories that come to me and, I am sure, to many other honourable senators as young people find that the interest rates in front of them are making it so difficult they have to think of selling out. This letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to advise you of the Government's lack of concern for the hard working home buyer. My husband and I purchased a home two years ago. It took us five years of hard work and budgeting our money to enable us to do this. The house cost $31,000 and legal fees $500. We had to obtain a loan of $18,000. We had previously owned an old home which we redecorated and updated. It took us 4 years of hard work and saving our money to do this. Our previous home was 25 miles from the place where my husband and I both worked so we had to drive 50 miles a day. </PARA>
<PARA> When we started to repay our home loan, it was $170 per month but now because of increases in interest rates it is $207. As I have given up work and we have our first child, we are finding it very difficult to keep up payments on the house. </PARA>
<PARA> Because we owned a house before our present house, we will not be eligible for the new Home Buyers Assistance Scheme which the Fraser Government has just ' dreamed' up. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are many homebuyers who have either been transferred in their jobs or have had to sell their homes because they have not been able to keep up the repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Fraser Government is completely out of touch with the ordinary hard working man who is paying off the 'Australian Dream'-a home. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should assist all home buyers who earn the average wage. My husband earns only $12,000 a year and because of the interest rate increases we may have to sell our home. It has taken us seven years to get our house and the Government will force us to sell because of their inadequacy and total disregard for the ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope you will give my letter your consideration and perhaps be able to help the many people who have major problems keeping a roof over their heads. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very hard for honourable senators on this side of the chamber to give such people the help that they require. The best help that we could give to them would be to reduce interest rates so that their monthly repayments are back where they were when they first took out their home loans. Another telling point in the letter that I read out is that these people shifted home because of difficulties that they were having with the location of their first home. The lady who wrote the letter pointed out that many people are transferred in their jobs and that, because they take a second home, they are not eligible for any of the measures contained in the home package that was brought down recently. This situation cannot be permitted to continue. If the Government continues to let this situation develop it is inevitably headed towards a spell on the opposition benches. Young people seeking to buy or build a home should not have to wait for a change of government to be able to afford the necessary repayments for a home. I urge the Government to tackle these perniciously high interest rates and honour its past promises in this important area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So that the next two or three speakers who are to speak in the first reading debate on this legislation have time to get into the Senate, I will use the opportunity, particularly as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) is here, to address a couple of points that have been worrying me for some time. The first one is to do with the matter of child care. I refer the Minister to a question that was asked this morning by Senator Teague. It related to the payment directly by the Commonwealth of child care benefits. The honourable senator's suggestion was that it should be directed through the States. I think honourable senators will agree that the Minister gave an excellent reply in terms of both quality and quantity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter to which I wish to address the Minister's attention relates to the competition that quite often occurs between child care centres in regional towns or suburbs of major cities. Many private child care centres that have been operating very efficiently with no assistance whatsoever from the Government are competing with child care centres that are subsidised by the Government and the privately run child care centres are finding it very difficult to compete. In my home town of Geraldton I know of one child care centre that has gone broke and a second one is very close to extinction. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggested to the Minister some time ago and to his predecessor, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, that the amount of support that is given should be allocated to the children themselves. These payments are made to assist disadvantaged children who cannot afford to attend child care centres without this assistance. My suggestion over the last few years has been that the payments should be made to the parents of the children concerned instead of to the child care centres. They can then choose themselves which child care centre they will attend. I urge the Minister to take another look at this matter. I have had the opportunity of having lengthy discussions with some of his senior departmental officers. I have had a good hearing but to date the points I have made, which I think are very valid, have never been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> A further matter that I wish to allude to relates to the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. I spend much of my spare time in pastoral areas and there I receive many complaints about the method of the Department judging whether a motor vehicle should or should not attract sales tax. The definition as I understand it-this may not be totally correct-is that if a vehicle is purchased for use on a farm it need not attract sales tax but if it is able to be used for private purposes it attracts sales tax. It is very difficult to explain to a person who needs, for instance, a four-wheel drive vehicle for the running of his station that the purchase of such a vehicle with seats in it attracts sales tax but purchase of the same type of vehicle without seats in it does not attract sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the many submissions I have received on this issue relates to a station that is well over 100 kilometres from Carnarvon. The station owner is forced to use roads to and from Carnarvon which at many times are not usable by anything other than a four-wheel drive vehicle. The model of vehicle he wanted to buy was a four-wheel drive vehicle with seats because when he goes into town-which is fairly seldom-to buy his goods, equipment and spare parts he also wants to take his family with him, which is quite natural. He finds it very difficult to understand the attitude of the Government and the Department. He could buy this vehicle without seats, fit the seats himself and avoid paying sales tax. The attitude which has been adopted is forcing him to do what he regards as being a cheat on the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity of this debate on the motion for the first readings to make some points on a subject on which honourable senators have heard me speak before. I trust that they will forgive me for bringing it forward again. I speak of the extent to which Australia will engage itself in the dismal and quite insane pursuit of a Will-o'-the-wisp, nuclear power. I raise the matter at this stage because I feel that there are indications that, in spite of all world evidence, some people in Australia and some people actually in government seem to believe that there is some kind of future for nuclear power in Australia. They seem to believe that this is a good or opportune time for us to be engaged in this enterprise which the Australian Democrats and I believe is bad at the worst of times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have not yet had any reassurances anywhere in the world that nuclear wastes can be given any kind of final storage. I think the point was made in the Senate by Senator Sir John Carrick recently that there are temporary methods of storing these dangerous isotopes, some of which last for many thousands of years. But nobody has yet worked out a final way of disposing of them. I heard honourable senators two or three years ago talk about the fact that glassification would be the answer. But in fact it is not being done anywhere in the world with any success. Certainly it has not even been postulated as a method of disposing of nuclear waste that could be of any value to anybody. </PARA>
<PARA> The proliferation of small fission weapons is becoming a major problem. In the last two or three years, it has become even more of a problem than it was before . There is every reason to believe that in Argentina there is probably use of the so-called peaceful power reactor-this term occurs again and again-to manufacture fissionable fuel for fissionable weapons. This point has been made quite recently. The Canadian Government has expressed its concern that the CANDU reactor being supplied there will be used for that purpose. The Argentinian Government has not given any assurance to the contrary. So, where do we go if we insist on this mad sort of lemming-like scramble into trouble? Surely we see right in front of us now an unstable situation in South America.</PARA>
<PARA> Thank God it did not occur at a time when that CANDU reactor was complete and the Argentinians had together some enriched U235 or the situation around the Falkland Islands and in South America could have been considerably nastier than we would have suspected. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we have in Australia now? We have people, including some honourable senators from South Australia, still saying that Roxby Downs will be of some consequence and that the uranium from there will be a bonanza. They are saying that it will create 10,000 jobs and all that kind of nonsense. At Jabiluka again , we are undertaking the madness of allowing the mine of Pancontinental Mining Ltd to go ahead in the full knowledge that it will be a major pollutant of the Kakadu National Park and in the full knowledge that Magela Creek and the East Alligator River will be contaminated by that mine the first time there is a summer monsoonal flood. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian Premier is talking of the desirability of having an enrichment plant in that State. The real point about enrichment is to what extent we will enrich. In a letter written to the Sydney Morning Herald by Professor Baxter, I was criticised recently for my views which I had expressed earlier on that subject in which he said that it was quite a simple matter. He said that there were two particular types of atoms in uranium. He said that one had a phial of gas in which one gas is slightly increased at the expense of the other. What he did not say in that letter was that the one gas that is being increased is, of course, a basic fuel for small, dirty, fission-type bombs. In Australia we are apparently completely oblivious of any information anywhere else in the world, incapable of reading and perhaps incapable of understanding what we do read, and we are thinking that we will go ahead with this great power for tomorrow industry which has been thoroughly discredited elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> To indicate that, I quote to honourable senators for the next few minutes an article from the Washington Post which was reprinted in the Melbourne Age recently. One would have thought that this newspaper is not completely inaccessible to honourable senators. In the article the Washington Post, which has a reputation for being a thoroughly reliable newspaper, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Financial realities have done what protestors never could. They have stopped growth in the nuclear power industry in its tracks. </PARA>
<PARA> No applications to build a new nuclear power plant have been filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission--</PARA>
<PARA>This is, of course, in the United States--</PARA>
<PARA>since 1978--</PARA>
<PARA>That is over four years ago--</PARA>
<PARA>and numerous projects have been dropped or deferred. </PARA>
<PARA> Supporters of the industry blame the shutdown on the general malaise in the economy and warn of a shortage of generating capacity in the future when demand grows. </PARA>
<PARA> But its critics blame at least part of the industry's problems on poor cost control and greater-than-anticipated operating costs in an immature industry. Utilities with nuclear power plants, for instance, have had to replace costly steam generating equipment that had been expected to last the life of the plants . In addition, considerable uncertainty surrounds future outlays, including the costs of waste disposal and what can be done with the units at the end of their useful lives. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress at this stage the point that there is no experience in the world about what we are going to do with nuclear power plants when they reach the end of their useful life. However, evidence is mounting fast that there will be an enormous problem with many tonnes of thoroughly irradiated material which will somehow have to be disposed of when a reactor is taken apart. We get some indication of what the costs might be when we look at the dismal story of Three Mile Island. The water which was supposed to be a safeguard-in other words, it was supposed to be a safety measure-in the event of trouble with the fuel rods, was to be used to flood the reactor. Indeed, that happened. This is a much- vaunted safety measure. We are left with huge quantities of radioactive water which it will take another seven or eight years to dispose of. The total costs, which cannot now be estimated, are still being put by responsible authorities at something more than $1 billion. These are the sorts of implications which I believe we should take into account in Australia. I return to an interesting point made in the Washington Post article which states:</PARA>
<PARA> In one of the most dramatic and costly cancellations--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, of nuclear power--</PARA>
<PARA>the board of the Washington Public Power Supply System announced two months ago that it would terminate work on two of five nuclear power plants under construction, writing off the $US2,250 million already spent. </PARA>
<PARA>If we cannot understand what that means, there must be something wrong with us. A responsible authority in the United States which has already spent over $2 billion on the first two of five nuclear power plants has decided to write-off the entire project and none of those plants will proceed. The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the WPPSS nuclear plants . . . construction costs of the five plants the utility had proposed building soared from $US4,100 million to nearly $US23,800 million. </PARA>
<PARA>Here, of course, is the problem-that what was supposed to be a cheap, economic form of electric power is not that at all. When one looks at these more realistic, recent costings, one finds that nuclear power is far more expensive than any other kind of power that could be produced in the world. We are still thinking and living in the world of 20 or 30 years ago; apparently nobody on the Government side has read a newspaper or anything since that time. We are still back in the days when nuclear power was thought to be cheap. Figures are cited in the article based on reactor costings which were old costings and certainly not based on the new ones which are realistic and which have led to responsible authorities in the United States not going ahead with the construction of plants that they had previously planned. The article in the Washington Post continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The month before that cancellation was announced, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission ordered that no further funds from customers of the Public Service Co . of Oklahoma be spent on the Black Fox nuclear power plant. The commission said that, notwithstanding $US200 million already spent on it--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Black Fox plant--</PARA>
<PARA>the plant was 'no longer economically viable'. </PARA>
<PARA> The same day Standard and Poor's Corp. reduced the bond rating of the Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, raising additional questions about the fate of one of its two nuclear power plants at Seabrook, although work is continuing. </PARA>
<PARA>The overall picture is that, in 1980, 16 reactors were cancelled and 70 were delayed, and in 1981, six were cancelled and 44 were deferred. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> So bleak is the outlook that General Electric has said it expects no more domestic orders this decade-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise, 'no more domestic orders this decade'-</PARA>
<PARA>for steam generating equipment for nuclear reactors. 'GE has not decided to abandon the nuclear market. The nuclear reactor market has left suppliers rather than the other way around', said a GE spokesman. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Nuclear power has become an investment with tremendous financial risks to utilities, and the utility industry itself is in such poor financial health it can no longer afford to purchase nuclear generating stations'. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made by a senior associate of a chemical engineering company at a meeting of chemical engineers last year. The same authority, Mr John O. Sillin, was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of a 1200 megawatt nuclear unit going into service in the early 1990s will be over $US3200m. </PARA>
<PARA>That is over $3 billion. That figure represents a nearly 10-fold increase in prices since the early 1970s. I suggest to honourable senators that many of the figures quoted in this place are based on old prices. They do not take into account what things are costing now. If we did take those figures into account we would realise we were chasing a chimera. Although it is dangerous to the environment and to health the biggest and most convincing argument against nuclear power at the moment is that it is thoroughly uneconomic and unsatisfactory. We are dealing with a crude technology, a technology which has not really been developed properly. I think everybody who has seen something of this problem realises that that is the case. If some day in the future we have something like nuclear power-possibly fusion-it will result only from nuclear physicists going back to their drawing boards for another 10 or 15 years and coming up with something that actually works over a long period, instead of coming to us like some of the so-called Australian authorities in this field, like mumbo-jumbo medicine men, saying: 'You people do not understand this, but this is a miracle'. That is not the case. It is a badly constructed, badly thought out technology which is essentially crude in its operation. That fact is showing up more and more as every day passes, as costs go up and minor trouble occurs with nuclear reactors. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this needs to be said at this stage, and I have said it, because it would be very dangerous for the Australian people now to be committed to any further advance into the nuclear fuel cycle. We do not want or need any of it. It is bad enough that we are exporting uranium from this country into a market which is already overloaded for a decrepit, broken-down and thoroughly uneconomic industry. We may try to justify that to ourselves in economic terms but I suggest to the Senate that it is evident even from what I have quoted today that it is impossible for that to happen. I appeal to the Government at this stage to take a more responsible view of this whole issue and not to go around saying that uranium is as safe as honey, coffee, and granite and that there is a great future for nuclear power and all that rubbish, when everybody knows perfectly well that it is not true. If the Government is going to say those sorts of things, I would like to hear somebody get up and justify those statements in terms of the facts. I would like the Government to consider carefully what I have said. I would like it to look at this article, to check it back and then to come back into this place and tell us in what way Australia will benefit from such an industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity in this first reading debate to comment on the problems that small business has in this community at present, particularly the lack of support that it receives from the Fraser Government. This Government is penalising small business. The fact that the number of business bankruptcies has risen from 1,243 in 1975-76 to 2,530 in 1979-80 is an indication of the great problems for people involved in small business in every possible way. The two particular areas in which Government policies have hurt small business are those of exchange rates and finance. Over the last five years the exchange rate has been particularly unstable. These fluctuations in the exchange rate have made it very difficult for small business , because small business is most vulnerable to alterations in the exchange rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Overseas markets for small business have been endangered. The effect of appreciation of the Australian dollar has endangered overseas markets and the lower prices of imports have put a special pressure on our own industry. We have also seen a rise in the costs of raw materials for our own small industry. The uncertainty has made it particularly difficult for small business to plan ahead. The intrinsic character of small business in itself is something that poses special problems. In the year 1980-81, the tax weighted index rose by 10 per cent-a rise which the Department of Trade and Resources thought should take 10 years to achieve. That is the sort of difficulty that small business people have had to contend with. The result of appreciation was an 8 per cent fall in the real value of exports. Conversely there was an increase of 9 per cent in imports during that same period. This latter jump obviously hurt small local manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems that small business has include the fact that banks and other lending institutions are unduly cautious and conservative in their assessment of the risk attached to small business projects and in the requirements they impose . In particular they are often reluctant to provide debt finance to small businesses, which are unable to offer suitable and sufficient collateral and which can point to only a brief period of successful operation where loans are made available. Excess security is often demanded, which in turn limits the capacity of business to raise additional funds in the future. So small businessmen find themselves in a catch-22 situation in attempting to develop. They find that because their businesses do not have longevity or the size, they have difficulties in attracting finance. The major financial institutions lack the necessary technical expertise or inclination to assess the prospects of small firms, particularly innovative firms and those at the establishment or development stage. This Government has spoken in support of small business, but unfortunately in practice its policies are not effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses do not qualify for an overdraft under $100,000 at concessional interest rates, yet have risk characteristics justifying lower interest rates than those charged by finance companies and other higher cost intermediaries. The ceiling on overdraft rates is consequently seen as creating a credit gap in the market for such small business. Long term debt funds at fixed interest rates are difficult to obtain for small businesses. These are some of the many problems that have not been resolved and are part of the reason why so many small businesses are being forced into bankruptcy. There are limited market facilities for the sale of equity shares in small business compared with the facilities available for large businesses, which tend to be listed public companies. There are very few institutional sources to which newly established and innovative small businesses seeking venture capital and innovative finance can turn. These are the problems. Trading banks have lifted interest rates dramatically in recent times and that puts a special pressure on people involved in small business. There is also less money around because of the Government's general policies which puts an additional squeeze on small business. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System did nothing for small business, at least it admitted that excessive capital inflows cause problems. I wish to quote from page 618 of the Campbell Committee report:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes that, within an overall policy framework of monetary restraint, higher rates of capital inflow (channelled into resource development) might entail a lower availability of finance for certain groups in the community , such as small businesses and home buyers. This in turn might create some social tensions. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Campbell report is implemented it will make finance harder to get and more expensive for small businesses and increase the instability in the exchange rate. This Government listens to big business, such as the multinationals and the banks. They profit and small businesses suffer at the hands of this Government. The only help offered in the Campbell Committee report is deregulation of banking and that will not help small business. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia has been scathing in its attacks on the Government. I quote from a Press release by the Council which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Action by the Government to agree to an increase in the bank rate for loans up to $100,000 will put yet another nail in the coffin of small business', the Chairman of COSBOA, Don Gibbons, said in Canberra today. 'Due to inadequate provision by both the Government and the Banks small business is already being starved of funds while large business and particularly overseas interests are syphoning off everything in sight and pushing up interest rates to intolerable and unnecessary levels', Mr Gibbons said. </PARA>
<PARA>That is typical of the reaction of small business people in Australia at present . The defeat of the Victorian Government recently was very much due to the difficulties that exist in Victoria. What happened in Victoria is a lesson to this Government because the Victorian people finally voted to defeat a government that was unsympathetic to small business. An article in the Australian Financial Review of 24 February 1982 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There were 917 small business bankruptcies in Victoria for the financial year ended June 1980. This was a sharp jump of 54 per cent on the previous year's figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1979 and 1980, total bankruptcies in Victoria grew by more than 60 per cent, as compared with the Australian average of only 28.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, even the figure of 28.9 per cent is very serious for all of us concerned with employment in the small business area, which is the lifeblood of employment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I am pleased that you are in the chair. I will give one example of what is happening because of this Government's policies. The example occurs within 10 kilometres of where we are in the Senate today. In Canberra itself the Government's policies have meant a tremendous cutback in the printing industry. It is typical of the way this Government has behaved that the cutback has occurred in a very unplanned way. There has been a cutting off of the finance available to the publishing and bookbinding industry. The lack of planning by the national Government has meant that small business in Canberra faces both sacking people and losing them. Unfortunately, people have grown used to doing special work in providing government services. It is a specialist area. People will be lost to the city and to this specialist area of work. </PARA>
<PARA> We are surrounded by books and papers. One small business organisation has found that the National Library of Australia has stopped all binding work for an indefinite period. For the small printer concerned this amounts to a loss in business of about $1,300 per week, approximately 40 per cent of the total output . The general reduction in printing is affecting the companies involved in book repair work. This highlights how foolish a cutback can be if it is not thought out. If this work is suspended for a period all the books that we are using will be destroyed earlier than they would have been. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately that is the problem. We are also supposed to have a concept of history in this place. If a book repair is not done expertly, valuable books will be lost to posterity. Book repair work is a specialist skill within the field of book binding. People who are fully qualified book binders finally take up the additional skills of book repair work. They are the people who will be lost to this capital if Government policies continue in the way they have been implemented. Money appears to be saved by cutting funds. Of course, the most difficult thing for small business is that the money is cut off in such a way that the small business cannot afford to carry the Government for very long. If it looks around for other work, unfortunately it will lose some of the people who have become skilled in doing the work which is especially related to Parliament and the library system. The company to which I have referred has several aspects of work. Other work to the value of $7,000 which it could do has also been stopped. It is not just one aspect of a small business's work that has been cut. This Government has very foolishly cut the money available across the board. I am afraid that that style of activity is typical of the sort of thing that is affecting small business. As I commenced by saying, the increase in bankruptcies during this Government's period from 1,500 to 2,500 is its epitaph to the way it has not looked after small business in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been persuaded to speak in this debate by the speech of Senator Mason, who is a colleague and a friend of mine. I found his speech dealing with the uranium industry quite incredible. I thought I had better make one or two comments in rebuttal of what he said. It seems to me that people coming from New South Wales have an 'I'm all right Jack' attitude with respect to the development of resources. I have never heard an honourable senator from New South Wales in this place point to the hazards of the coal industry with respect to health, death and so on. I find it quite amazing, whenever the question of energy is discussed, that people tend to home in on the nuclear industry because of the radon gas that is liberated from the mining of that resource. I have never heard anyone talk about the hazards associated with the radon gas that is liberated from the coal mining industry. That is as bad as , if not worse than, the radon gas liberated from the uranium mining. I am not one of those who want to inhibit the development of the coal industry because I think it is very important, having regard to the need for employment opportunities in Australia and the need to provide energy for other countries as well as for ourselves, that we should adopt a rational and sensible approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could mount an incredibly strong argument against the coal industry and the proliferation of fossil fuel fired power stations. Everyone in Australia requires one kilowatt year of energy in order to provide the lifestyle to which we have become accustomed. Perhaps in New South Wales the situation is a little hazardous at the moment because it has not taken sufficient regard of the need to protect the conventional power stations in that State. Nevertheless, every year each one of us requires one kilowatt year of energy to fuel our lights, our refrigerators and our air conditioning. If we produced that energy purely from coal-fired power stations we would have to burn three tonnes of coal for every person in Australia, and that liberates to the environment five tonnes of carbon dioxide and many kilograms of oxides of nitrogen and sulphur. People should have some regard to that because the proliferation of carbon dioxide in the environment is causing a gradual but sure increase in the earth's temperature. The oxides of nitrogen and sulphur find their way to the environmental shield, to the ozone layer, which inevitably over a long period will become thinner and more likely to cause the earth problems of increased temperature, increased subjection to the penetration of ultraviolet light and even death. </PARA>
<PARA> I find myself against the proliferation of coal and oil-fired power stations in the world. I noted that Senator Mason referred to the problems of the disposal of waste, but there again we do not seem to have made a firm assessment of the amount of waste that has accumulated in the world since nuclear energy was commenced in the middle 1950s. Since that time in England, for example, the total amount of accumulated radioactive waste would fill a house no bigger than a normal two-bedroom suburban house. The accumulated waste in the whole world would cover the Adelaide Oval to the depth of one metre. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Colston is one of the more sensible members of the Opposition in this place. He would research these environmental matters in a very intelligent way. I know that because he was on my Committee and we had some rapport with each other on many matters of mutual interest. Senator Mason also referred to the cancellation of nuclear power stations in the Western world, but he did not say anything about Eastern bloc nations. While the Western program is being slowed down, the countries of the Eastern bloc are increasing their programs in the interests of the conservation of oil and coal in that bloc. I read a very interesting series of two articles in the Adelaide Advertiser a few weeks ago. I commend them to the interest of the Australian Democrats in particular who seem to be trying to appeal to the minority fringe of Australian electors at the drop of a hat. I suggest that they have regard to what Brigadier Greville had to say in his articles. He made the point, through careful research , that while the nuclear program of Eastern bloc countries is expanding, the Western world's program is slowing down because Russian supporters in the Western world are encouraging the emotive conservationists. I am a conservationist, but there is a minority element which reacts very violently to these things. It is of course encouraged by the supporters of Russia and the Eastern bloc. I thought that was a very interesting couple of articles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the disposal of nuclear waste is concerned, the technology has improved considerably. The Synroc technology developed at the Australian National University has received worldwide acclaim as an answer to this problem. Of course, we are all concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I am , and I am sure the Government is. That is why we built into our safeguard provisions even greater guarantees than international requirements demand. I find it quite incredible that we are not recognising that Australia has a part to play in the provision of energy to overseas countries which are not endowed with the vast natural resources that we have. I believe we should reasses our attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Mason referred to South Australians being anxious to develop the uranium deposits in that State. Of course, we are, because we recognise that it is important to offer employment opportunities to the people in our State. At the moment the unemployment position is very serious and is worrying this Government and the South Australian Goverment, as it would be worrying all sides of the Senate. I believe it is very important for us to recognise that the uranium situation at the moment is making economic the future development in South Australia of deposits of copper, gold and iron ore to be found in the uranium deposit in that State. I, as a South Australian, feel that I have a responsibility to encourage the development of mineral deposits in that State in the interests of the economy of the State. I am not ashamed to admit that I would welcome the early exploitation of the deposit at Olympic Dam which is currently being inhibited by the attitude of the South Australian Labor Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA>EXCISE TARIFF (COAL) AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill forms part of a package of measures designed to raise additional revenue for the funding of the long service leave entitlement of employees in the black coal mining industry. The Bill proposes to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to increase from 15c to 25c the excise duty on black coal. In a few moments I will seek to introduce the complementary Coal Industry Legislation Amendment Bill. That Bill proposes to alter the proportions in which the revenue raised by the levy is allocated between the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund and the Coal Research Account. </PARA>
<PARA> The present excise of 15c per tonne is divided between the two funds, 10c per tonne being allocated to the Long Service Leave Fund and 5c per tonne to the Coal Research Account. The Coal Research Account was established by the Coal Research Assistance Act 1977 and is used to fund coal research. The Long Service Leave Fund was set up in 1949 to finance long service leave in the black coal industry on a national basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this scheme excise duty paid to the Commonwealth by the producers of black coal is appropriated to the Fund and claims are then made on the Fund by the producers for reimbursement of the cost of long service leave granted to their employees. The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Review of Commonwealth Functions that the Commonwealth withdraw its involvement in the long service leave funding arrangements. The Premiers of the States concerned- New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia-have been approached and negotiations are being arranged to achieve the Commonwealth's withdrawal from this field. </PARA>
<PARA> Pending termination of the Commonwealth's involvement, funding needs beyond 1 April 1982 have been assessed. It has been estimated that the long service leave component of the excise revenue collected needs to be increased to 20c per tonne to ensure adequate funding for the remainder of this financial year and for the 1982-83 financial year. I should stress that, except for certain administrative costs, all monies collected by way of the excise duty are returned to the industry for either coal research of long service leave payments for its employees. The amount of excise per tonne which is allocated to the Coal Research Account is not being varied by this package. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>COAL INDUSTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is complementary to the Excise Tariff (Coal) Amendment Bill 1982. I mentioned in my second reading speech on the Excise Tariff (Coal) Amendment Bill 1982, that the amounts raised by way of excise duty on the production of certain coal are allocated to the Coal Industry Long Service Leave Fund and the Coal Research Account. The purpose of this Coal Industry Amendment Bill is to amend two Acts; the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949 and the Coal Research Assistance Act 1977, to increase the amount of the excise revenue allocated to the Long Service Leave Fund to 20c per tonne in lieu of the present 10c. There has been no change to the amount allocated to the Coal Research Account and it will continue to receive 5c per tonne. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the Excise Tariff (Coal) Amendment Bill 1982 and the Coal Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1982. Their purpose is to increase the excise duty on black coal from 15c to 25c a tonne. The extra revenue from these Bills will be used for the funding of long service leave for workers in the coal industry and for coal research purposes. The endorsement of the legislation is qualified by the fact that it derives in part from the recommendations of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the razor gang, which recommended that the Government withdraw altogether from funding arrangements for long service leave for workers in the coal industry. That is effectively what has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was ironic that this cost saving proposal of the government was presented to the Parliament for the first time at the same time as $300,000 was being spent on a political exercise advertising the government's new housing policy and largely designed to have an impact on the Victorian State election. I hope that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) will answer the question I asked him a few days ago as to whether the Liberal Party in Victoria is going to pay back the Commonwealth in respect of those election advertisements on housing policy which were said by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to be election matter within the meaning of the Broadcasting and Television Act. The Minister might recall that I asked him a question about a fortnight ago, and I am not surprised that he has not answered it, because it is difficult. I would appreciate it if he would be good enough to get an answer to that question because I will be pursuing the issue next week. I simply make the point that it is a question of double standards in regard to the way in which the Government saves money on the one hand and spends it on the other on more blatant political purposes than the purposes of the coal industry and the provision of long service leave entitlements to the workers in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to one other aspect of the razor gang's activities which is not strictly relevant to this legislation but which involves the expenditure of $250 ,000 this financial year alone by the Department of Administrative Services as a result of the decisions of the razor gang. When one talks about cost saving one has to look at where the alleged savings are in fact being spent, and most of them are being spent on blatant political stunts by the Liberal Party. That is something which should cause you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as an impartial officer in this chamber, some concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to go on with those comparisons of expenditure and savings to which I have adverted, except simply to say on behalf of the Opposition that the decision to increase the coal levy for funding research and long service leave is not opposed by the Opposition. It could well be an important, seemingly rational decision of the razor gang which has the universal approval of the Parliament. To that extent we commend the legislation to the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one looks at the figures in relation to State elections one will see quite easily that a great gerrymander has been perpetrated. I might say , for the benefit of Senator Martin, that it has been to the detriment of the Liberal Party in Queensland. If there were a fair and reasonable electoral redistribution in Queensland one would have to say that it would be a lot fairer to the Liberal Party, the Australian Labor Party and the electors of Queensland. If we look very briefly-that is all I intend to do today-at the figures for Queensland and at what has happened in relation to the gerrymander we will see that the State has been divided into a number of zones. I think it is worth while reporting here that the Premier, without even referring to Parliament, can change the boundaries of seats within those zones, providing he does not cut across those zones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If senators are elected in Queensland by dividing the State into zones, the Premier and the Parliament of Queensland, if it remains the same under this gerrymander system, will have an opportunity further to gerrymander the State and probably have senators elected to this place on the basis of a gerrymander and not on the basis of a fair and reasonable redistribution. I believe that is the intention of this Parliament. If one looks at the electorates in Queensland, it is quite obvious how the gerrymander has been brought about. The Premier's electorate of Barambah, which is one hour from Brisbane, has 10,607 electors. Mackay, the Leader of the Opposition's electorate, is 600 miles and 7 hours travel from Brisbane and has 18,538 electors. If we look at the other electorates in Queensland we will find that for every Labor seat, or for every seat that belongs to a party which does not support the Premier, there are two National Party seats close by. Their total numbers are somewhere in the vicinity of one Labor seat in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that this power should be left in the hands of the State Government because of its ability to gerrymander the State of Queensland, particularly in respect of the State Parliament. If the Liberal Party in Queensland some day gathers some fortitude and decides to support the Labor Party in seeking a fair and reasonable redistribution we will have an opportunity to see a democratic government elected in Queensland and not have what we have now-a government elected because of a gerrymander.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate very briefly to speak to the Senate Elections (Queensland) Bill 1981. The present provision in the Constitution was a special provision at the time of the Federation of the semi- independent States. There was a belief that Queensland might not enter the Commonwealth of Australia and certain concessions were made to Queensland at the time with an eye to other things that might have happened in the future, such as the creation of new States. Provision is not necessary for the creation of new States. New States can be formed under other provisions in the present Constitution. Although there have been quite significant moves towards new States at different times within Australia, those moves have never culminated in success. Queensland has been in the Federation for over 80 years. Its Senate elections have operated on the same basis as in other States. I do not think any real objection can be raised to formalising the system whereby what operates in Queensland and, indeed, what operates for the rest of the nation, should not operate Australia-wide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware that some little concern has been shown in Queensland at the proposal on the basis that effectively Queensland is giving something away. That seems to me a rather sterile argument unless Queensland intends to use the provision that is there at the moment. I, and I know many other honourable senators, would not approve of any special usage of that provision for reasons other than what was intended. The reasons for which it was intended have gone. It is better that the situation be clarified. Of course, there is always the risk that the provision which is in the Constitution which would enable zones to be set up in Queensland for the purpose of conducting the Senate elections could be used mischievously in the hands of the wrong people. I, unlike Senator Jones, do not suggest for a moment that members of the present Government are the wrong people. The provision could be used at a time when, say, the Commonwealth Parliament was in recess. Therefore, it is better that it be formalised. I congratulate Senator Colston on bringing this Bill into the Senate to resolve the matter. It is probably a bit like motherhood. It is something of which we all approve but about which not all of us have got around to doing something. I am pleased to be able to support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering the Senate Elections ( Queensland) Bill 1981-Senator Colston's omnibus Bill-to reform one loophole in the Constitution. There has never been any serious suggestion that there be Queensland legislation to divide that State into zones. I do not think any legislation has ever been drawn up. The issue really came to light for the first time in recent years in the Sydney Morning Herald on 4 October 1979 and in the Australian Financial Review on 3 October 1979 when, suddenly, suggestions emerged that the Queensland Government was considering-this was more as a Press leak-the division of Queensland into zones. This came at a time when the coalition parties in Queensland were in disagreement as to whether they should be running a joint ticket or separate tickets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It appears that this issue arose primarily to bring the Liberals back into line so that they would accept a joint ticket. The threat was made: 'If you do not agree we will divide the State into zones'. Of course, it is very unlikely that this threat would have been carried out because the concurrence of the Queensland Parliament, in which the National Party does not have an absolute majority was needed. It is also fairly clear that, if the legislation came up, most Liberals in the State Parliament of Queensland, realising that the boundaries were being altered, would have voted against it. Senator Jones was correct in pointing out that when one is talking about moral fortitude and backbone the Queensland State branch of the Liberal Party-I am talking about the State parliamentarians-has not been particularly strong in asserting the viewpoints and the interests of the Liberal Party in that State Parliament. More often than not, on a variety of issues, such as the appointment of justices, redistributions, the demolition of hotels and scenic places, it has caved in to the pressure from the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> When this provision was put in the Constitution, there was no real conception that the Senate would be elected under proportional representation. So, if any Queensland government-Liberal, Labor or National Party-introduced legislation to divide the State into zones, we would have a situation where proportional representation would be deliberately negated. It is not very hard to see how it would be done by a National Party government. It would create two rotten boroughs, let us say, in the rural areas-I am not referring to these seats as rotten boroughs as such-in the Senate seats of Kennedy and Leichhardt, and then the rest of the State would vote as a whole for three senators. The likely result would be that three National Party senators would be returned which would almost double the ranks of the National Country Party here. One Liberal Party senator would be returned and-</PARA>

But if the National Party garnered 30 per cent of the vote in Queensland under those conditions, and here I am talking about the total vote , three National Party senators would be elected with 30 per cent of the vote-I hope that I am not putting ideas into the head of Senator Collard-we would have one Liberal Party candidate with 30 per cent of the vote and maybe one ALP candidate with 40 per cent of the total vote. Senator Martin could not think of any individual in Queensland who would be mischievous enough to devise such a scheme.

She has leave for the day. I have had discussions with her and she wishes to be associated with some of my views on the Senate Elections (Queensland) Bill 1981. However I cannot let some of the Opposition speeches go unchallenged. The debate has almost spread out into a Bill on redistribution. Senator Jones talked about gerrymander. It is the old hackneyed story which gets churned out every couple of weeks almost, about the redistribution in Queensland and the gerrymander. I suppose running true to the form of the Opposition, Senator Jones had to say those things because he has already issued a Press release and he wanted the chamber to get the matter on the record so that he could say he actually said it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, damn it, I have not. If I had thought the honourable senator would speak as he did, I would have. I do not have time to get tomorrow' s Press. But we hear this old hackneyed 'gerrymander' phrase all the time. The history of redistribution is that the zones under which we operate were introduced by the Hanlon Labor Government. What is more to the point, we have beaten the Labor Party all the way on its own zones. At one stage every seat in the western zone of Queensland was held by the ALP. We have fought and beaten it right along the line, under its own terms. Obviously when one is winning it is a right and proper redistribution-a zoned system that takes into account all the various aspects of the distribution of population. But as soon as one loses the whole thing becomes a gerrymander. As I have said, under the current boundaries we fought and beat the Labor Party all along the way. No matter how one would rearrange the boundaries in Queensland today the Labor Party would not have a hope of getting up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Queensland is such a bad State, and everybody holds redistribution in such terror, why is it that so many people are still going there, including people from Senator Robert Ray's State? They like Queensland. It is quite a concern in Queensland as to how Queensland will take all the Victorians now there has been a change of government there. What is more I understand the airlines are quite worried about the fact that they will have full loadings one way and only half full loadings the other way. We have all these problems in Queensland because everybody likes us so much. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the original purport of the Bill. I had intended talking for about three minutes but I could not resist the challenge which was laid down by Senator Jones and Senator Robert Ray. As has been indicated-I will not go over the ground too much-the provision for redistribution was laid down at the time the Constitution was formed. I find it ironic that some Queensland senators want to take away one of the privileges, shall I say, under the Constitution that accrued to Queensland at that time. Queensland, as we all know, is a large State . It is the most decentralised State and has industries scattered throughout it. That is one of the reasons for the decentralisation. In certain sections of the State, just as when one is in Brisbane one talks about the Deep South being Sydney and Melbourne, once one gets beyond Rockhampton there is almost a seige mentality-quite rightly I think-about Brisbane. There beats in the breasts of many people up there the hope that one day Queensland might be divided into two or three States. Quick and Garran point out at page 421 of The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth that this was one of the reasons why this provision was first put in the Constitution. Queensland probably would not have been one of the original States if that had not been taken into consideration. That provision was put there deliberately. I find it ironic and rather sad that a Queensland senator has seen fit to take away a unique privilege which accrued to Queensland at the time of the Constitution. I am quite sure that to many people in North Queensland his actions regarding this Bill will not go unnoticed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I would like to thank those honourable senators who have participated in this debate. Senator Macklin spoke on this matter last year. He made a thoughtful contribution outlining the historical background of this provision in the Constitution. He mentioned something which was mentioned only a few minutes ago-the possibility of a new State in the northern part of Queensland. I would just like to say at this stage -I might pick up a comment that Senator Collard made a couple of minutes ago- that the taking away of this provision in the Constitution or the providing otherwise by the Parliament will not make any difference to any new State which may appear in north Queensland or in any part of Queensland. There is another section in the Constitution which allows the Parliament to provide representation in the Parliament for any new State that may emerge within the Commonwealth. Indeed, this provision might become a little complicated if a new State did appear. One would not quite know to which State this provision referred. The people in north Queensland have nothing to fear from this proposal . If honourable senators read my second reading speech they will see that I referred to this matter. No part of Queensland has anything to fear from the removal of this section or the provision otherwise by this Parliament in regard to this section of the Constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume also spoke last year at great length late at night and I made a number of notes about the matters that Senator Baume mentioned. However I must admit it was not until today that I understood the Government's intention, through Senator Baume. I thank Senator Baume for mentioning today that it is not the intention of the Government to oppose the passage of the Senate Elections ( Queensland) Bill 1981. I also thank him for his response, by way of interjection , to Senator Robert Ray that the Government intends to allow this Bill to pass through the House of Representatives. I thank my colleague from Queensland, Senator Jones, for his remarks. One must remember that when Senator Jones made his perceptive comments about electoral boundaries in Queensland he spoke not only as a Queensland senator in this place but also as a former member of the Legislative Assembly in Queensland so he would have a very good idea of what the problems are in relation to boundaries in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Martin also mentioned new States. She made a comment which I found to be quite apt. She said that the reasons for this particular part of section 7 of the Constitution have gone and that because they have gone it is no longer relevant to retain it. Senator Robert Ray mentioned proportional representation and outlined how when this section was put into the Constitution proportional representation was not thought of or perhaps was not thought of as a method of election of senators. Senator Collard was the last speaker. I was amazed that Senator Collard commenced by saying that this debate seemed to have degenerated into one on boundaries in Queensland and then proceeded to debate that matter. However I mention again, in conclusion, that those people in north Queensland who are looking towards that part of Australia being a new State have nothing to worry about with the passage of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion which has been moved by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume ) in relation to the proposed Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege. The proposal from the House of Representatives is that it should be a joint committee consisting of 10 members equally divided between the parties but with provision made in respect of the Senate for representation from the minority Opposition parties. I hope that all honourable senators will support this motion because, since the turn of the century, abortive and feeble efforts have been made to change the procedures relating to privilege. For a variety of reasons they have been delayed, postponed or otherwise swept under the carpet, I presume , because other things have appeared to be more pressing. I put to the Senate the view which was put in 1908 by a committee of the Parliament at a time, I suppose, when Australia could be said to have been one of the more progressive social democracies in the world. At that time, conservatives and progressives alike came to the following conclusion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ancient procedure for punishment of contempts of Parliament is generally admitted to be cumbersome, ineffective, and not consonant with modern ideas and requirements in the administration of justice--</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that this was written in 1908. The committee continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It is hardly consistent with the dignity and functions of a legislative body which has been assailed by newspapers or individuals to engage within the chamber in conflict with the alleged offenders, and to perform the duties of prosecutor, judge and gaoler. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> All the . . . witnesses who gave evidence-</PARA>
<PARA>To the committee-</PARA>
<PARA>were agreed that it would be competent for the Commonwealth Parliament . . . to assign to the ordinary courts of law jurisdiction to deal with, . . . persons charged with and found guilty of contempt of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The article then goes on to deal with the way the tribunal proposed would exercise its function in these terms. The committee continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The new tribunal so exercising power could fairly be equipped with a greater discretion in the infliction of punishment than that possessed by either House. It could be authorised to punish libellers and slanderers of, and other offenders against, Parliament by imposing fines of a moderate or severe character, according to the heinousness of the offence or, in the alternative, imprisonment. It could also be authorised to impose upon the offenders the costs of the prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA>I make the point again that that was said in 1908. In 1910 a Bill was drafted to give effect to the recommendations of that committee, but the Bill was never introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter of contempt of parliament arose again quite recently in the so- called Laurie Oakes case in which that journalist wrote an article which suggested that some parliamentarians were drunks or drank too much or something of that kind. I do not wish to canvass the merits of the comments made by Mr Oakes except to say that they did not entirely miss. As a result, he was arraigned before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Privileges. I think that that incident, as nearly every incident relating to contempt of parliament including, of course, the notorious Browne and Fitzpatrick case, has done nothing for the dignity or standing of this Parliament in the community. It again reinforces the view that parliamentarians see themselves, somehow, as above the law or different in respect of the application of the law from ordinary citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> That problem which this Parliament has was exactly what the colour television incident of last week was all about in the minds of members of the electorate. It was not about the paltry question of a Minister evading duty or the equally paltry question of another Minister assisting his colleague in difficulty when he got caught. They are, in themselves, insignificant matters. The political importance for this Parliament of that issue was simply that parliamentarians were seen to be behaving in a different way from ordinary members of the community, were seeing themselves as being above the community and were seeing that different standards were applied to them in respect of these matters than applied in the community at large. That is exactly what the fundamental issue from the point of view of Parliament in the debate on privilege is all about: The way in which contempts of this Parliament are punished, the way in which alleged offenders who have allegedly committed a contempt are called before a committee of this Parliament and are dealt with in a way which involves members of the Parliament being judge, jury and gaoler, as the 1908 report said, in their own cause. That would not be tolerated anywhere else and should no longer be tolerated in this Parliament if it is to enjoy any respect in the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> It was with those fundamental matters in mind that I introduced into the Senate -I am not quite sure when, but it was two or three months ago-a Bill which was to be called the Offences Against the Parliament Bill 1981. I introduced that Bill into the Senate as a private member's Bill. It has not yet been debated. In introducing the Bill I made it quite clear that, in my view, it did not necessarily provide the perfect solution to the problem of contempt of parliament. It was introduced to provide a vehicle for discussion of this matter . As I wrote to every honourable senator and honourable member at the time, I would be very grateful for any amendments to that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> But I remind the Senate briefly of the terms of that Bill because it created offences involving interference with parliament, improper influence on members, molesting of members, disturbing parliament, defaming parliament or its members, falsely reporting proceedings, disobedience of orders of the House, interference with a witness and so on. Those sorts of offences are created by the Bill. The procedure is provided whereby, after an initial hearing, as it were, by a committee of this Parliament, the matter is referred to a court. It is the court which would deal with the matter and have the power to impose any penalty and to provide the appropriate rules of natural justice which should be accorded to anybody charged with any offence. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the recommendation that we establish a joint committee. I strongly recommend that one of the first things that the joint committee should do is to consider the terms of the private member's Bill which I introduced to see whether that would provide a proper basis and a basis upon which amendments could be made to provide a much better system of dealing with contempts in this Parliament which would bring, I think, a great deal of respect to the Parliament as a whole and prevent some of the outrageous incidents that have happened in the past. I commend the establishment of the proposed joint committee to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question of establishing a joint select committee to review parliamentary privilege has a fairly long history. As I recall it, in April 1978 the Leader of the House of Representatives, Mr Sinclair, wrote to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Withers. This suggestion was put forward. Mr Sinclair asked Senator Withers to refer the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges whose chairman at the time was Senator Drake-Brockman. Soon after he received this letter the honourable senator retired from the Senate and it was left to the Senate Standing Committee on Privileges to deal with the matter. We felt and recognised that to have a motion with respect to the changing of the privileges of the Parliament would require, according to section 49 of the Constitution, a resolution of both Houses. At that time the Committee, which was of a different character from what it is now, decided that it had no objection to the House of Representatives proceeding along the lines of making recommendations or a report on the question of privileges for our consideration. This was largely because at that time the Senate was offered half the number of places on the committee that would be given to the House of Representatives. We believed that it would be more profitable for us to examine the recommendations that flowed from that suggestion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We now, of course, are faced with a different proposition-it is proposed that the Senate will be represented equally with the House of representatives on the committee. I think in any joint committee situation-certainly, with respect to the matter of privilege-it ought to apply that the two Houses have equal representation. Senator Button is on the present Senate Standing Committee on Privileges. He speaks in a very legalistic way. He has referred to the Offences Against the Parliament Bill that he introduced into the Senate. Unfortunately, before he introduced the Bill he did not discuss it with me. I would have welcomed the discussion on it because there are some weaknesses in the Bill that I believe can be pointed out when a debate occurs on that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak as a lay senator who is Chairman of the Senate Committee. It seems to me that it is very difficult to codify privilege. Once we attempt to codify privilege we get a more inflexible situation. This was the conclusion, of course , that was arrived at by the House of Commons select committee in 1967. It pointed out the need to have maximum flexibility with respect to the privileges of parliament. I certainly recognise that there are difficulties such as those that occurred in the Laurie Oakes case. Personally, I would not have called Laurie Oakes before the Senate Privileges Committee. That would not have been my course of action. I thought it was a relatively trivial matter. That matter has been dealt with-perhaps as it quite properly should have been-in the House of Representatives. In fact, any matter associated with privileges in either House should be dealt with by the House concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Privileges Committee of this place has the capacity to refer matters from time to time, if required, to be dealt with by a court. Common law provides that courts can deal with these matters quite effectively. However, that is not what we are to discuss today. I, in common with the members of the Senate Privileges Committee, approve the establishment of this joint select committee to examine and report on this subject. I have one suggestion, however, to make. I transmitted it to the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair). My suggestion was that there ought to be a joint secretariat. I believe that on these matters a secretary should be appointed from the Senate and a secretary should be appointed from the House of Representatives so that the staff are informed and made well aware of the matters that are discussed and the decisions that are ultimately made. With those few words, I support the proposition before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I strongly support the establishment of this proposed joint select committee on parliamentary privilege to review fully, to report upon and, I hope, to re-write the law and practice of parliament in respect of privilege, law and practice that we have inherited from Great Britain and that continues to be, by virtue of section 49 of the Constitution, the law and practice which were applicable to the House of Commons as at the turn of the century. That will be the situation until we proceed to declare and attempt to codify the situation ourselves. I believe that the doing of this job-the re- writing of our own domestic Australian law of parliamentary privilege-is long overdue. In fact, it is 82 years overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been evident in my mind that for that long there have been serious weaknesses in the law, weaknesses, of course, that were never more obvious than in the notorious case of Browne and Fitzpatrick in the mid-1950s. The basic weaknesses of the present law and practice of privilege are numerous. I think they have been well articulated by Senator Button in his speech last year when he introduced the Offences Against the Parliament Bill to which he has referred again today and which I have no doubt will form quite properly and sensibly the basis for most of the proposed committee's deliberations in this area. I think those weaknesses can be summarised into two basic propositions-one is that for every class of privilege matter from the most serious right down to the most trivial this parliament acts as a prosecutor, judge and gaoler in its own cause. The second weakness seems to me the fact that an accused person has no inherent right whatsoever to be heard in his own defence, a right which is, of course, the most central and fundamental of all natural justice protections. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that somewhere along the road in the past-I am not quite sure when it was, whether it was in Britain itself before the turn of the century or in the terms of how the practice has been applied in Australia-we have tended to lose our way, to lose our sense of bearing in dealing with privilege matters, particularly insofar as we have continued to treat as actionable breaches of privilege actions or statements, which merely offend our dignity or are perceived to affect our reputations, which can be regarded as defamatory in some way but which do not interfere with or obstruct in any meaningful fashion, any understandable fashion, the operations of Parliament itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the treatment of privilege matters including, properly, matters of this kind reached its high point-or, as I prefer to put it, its low point-in the context of the Oakes affair last year when I was rather disappointed to find the House of Representatives acting with a spectacularly less degree of maturity, sophistication and, indeed, general commonsense and wisdom than was, in fact, demonstrated by this chamber on that occasion when the House of Representatives chose to make an issue of the Oakes article and when by contrast the Senate, reflecting I think much greater maturity, decided that it was quite absurd to do any such thing. I believe, in fact, that the conduct of the House of Representatives Privileges Committee and its report on the Laurie Oakes affair probably did far more to bring Parliament and parliamentarians into disrepute than the original 'bludgers and drunkards' article ever did. </PARA>
<PARA> In the majority report of the House of Representatives Committee-I do not want to be too harsh on it-I think there was undoubtedly a tendency towards what can only be described as pompous self-righteousness, double standards and indifference to the most basic principles of free expression and disciplinary fairness. I think that all round that was a most unfortunate affair. It is important to recall it because clearly the sense of unease that many members have had about the way that affair was conducted is very much the background to the motion before us today. As I have said, I think most of the things that went wrong in that case were a product of our failure to distinguish between things which merely go to dignity and things which go to the obstruction of the operations of this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not express any final and concluded view on this because I could well find myself being a member of this committee and I would certainly want to argue out the matter in that context and listen to everything that could be said on both sides of the argument but, as presently advised, I believe that the content of breach of privilege should be completely redefined so that anything that really does obstruct or interfere with the proper working of Parliament, such as bribery, corruption or physical interference, is briskly and severely dealt with while anything that merely offends our dignity, whether individually or collectively, or pricks our self-importance in some way is outside its scope. If material that is the subject of statements or actions outside the Parliament is inaccurate or unfair, as it very often is, in its reference to us as parliamentarians, I believe we have plenty of opportunities to redress the balance in Parliament and, indeed, occasionally in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The only reservation I would express finally about the exercise as it is presently contemplated is that the terms of reference proposed for this committee may, in fact, be a little too narrow. It is probably the case, for example, that as presently drawn they will not enable a reconsideration of the law and practice as it affects privilege under the law of defamation and in other associated areas outside the House for statements originally made within it. I am referring to a situation which arises in the context of the protection- or lack of it-for members who themselves circulate Hansard copies of the speeches they make in this place. I am referring to situations which arise when members and senators repeat outside the House statements which have made under the cover of absolute privilege, so far as the law of defamation is concerned, inside the House. I am referring to a number of quite tricky questions which have arisen in recent years about the appropriate law to govern the production of Hansard records in court in various kinds of proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> These are not strictly parliamentary privilege matters but they do relate in a very obvious and direct way to the granting of protections of various kinds in respect of things that are very closely linked to what, in fact, we do inside this place. I think there are a number of areas of the law which perhaps do need some further attention. At this stage I do not seek in any way to argue for the expansion of the terms of reference but it is a matter that could perhaps be drawn to the attention of the new committee. If necessary the committee could, as a result, seek the leave and the authority of the Parliament to expand its operations accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply repeat that the failure to define and declare our own privileges over the course of this century, our continued reliance on the original text of section 49 of the Constitution, which simply makes our privileges those that are applicable in the English House of Commons, has created a situation in which I think the law and practice of privilege has become quite spectacularly out of tune with what modern circumstances require and demand. I think that state of affairs has not contributed to the reputation and status of this Parliament. I look forward very much to the establishment of this committee and the serious- minded embarkation by this committee on the job of rewriting our law and practice of privilege accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose this Bill mainly because it provides grants to the States and the Northern Territory for the construction of roads. Whilst we would be very critical of the paucity of funding available as a result of this legislation, we would necessarily have to support it because it does meet part of the need of the States and local government to construct a decent roads system. As such we find it-as do the representatives of government throughout Australia outside Canberra-to be an inadequate Bill. In no way does it confront the problems of our national roads system. For example, it allows for increases in road funding of 7 per cent, 6 per cent and 6 per cent respectively over the next three years. It is an indictment of this Government that such a small sum of money be made available for the purposes of road construction, having regard to the growth and development of our country, the rate of inflation and the need to provide a better system of road construction than that which already exists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill ignores the fact that costs for road construction and maintenance are rising by at least 15 per cent each year. We are being built into a system of increases in road funding for the next three years in a period in which road construction costs are so excessive, rising half as much again as the general rate of inflation. One can understand the misgivings of the Australian Labor Party-I hope that this will be the majority view of the Senate-about the inadequacy of this Bill. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that a substantial supplementary allocation of road grants should be made available to the states, the Northern Territory and local government without delay to-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) reduce the backlog of established roads needs;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) accelerate the rate of road construction and maintenance works;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) improve the efficency of road transport services;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) reduce the incidence of road deaths and injuries; and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) assist local government bodies to meet road funding difficulties'. </PARA>
<PARA>The representatives of the State governments and the local government bodies in the respective regions will be looking to the Senate at least to express a point of view about the failure of the Commonwealth Government to listen to the various voices that have been raised strongly by local government organisations and by the various State Ministers for roads and transport. The Bill is a good example of the hypocrisy of the Fraser Government's policies of new federalism. Let us look at what the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch, said at the local government conference on 25 February 1982 when he explained the Government's federalism view. At this conference, which was specifically called for the purpose of dealing with the problems of road funding in our country, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> During the period this Government has been in office we have striven to develop a new spirit of federalism. It is not merely a structure concept but positively aims to prevent dangerous concentration of power in a few hands. Power and functions should be distributed to provide an effective barrier against centralised authoritarian control. That is our philosophical base. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a most remarkable statement for a Minister of the Fraser Government to make at a conference of local government authorities which were concerned about the need to provide adequate funds to construct a decent road system in our country and which are having grave difficulties in a period of rising costs. It is out of all proportion that local authorities should be hit with a statement of that nature, a statement of such arrant nonsense, suggesting that somehow or other there was a centralised authoritarian control over the way in which road construction should take place. All that the local authorities and the State Ministers wanted was enough funds to carry out their obligations and responsibilities. Despite the fact that Sir Phillip Lynch opened the conference, as the Local Government Bulletin of April 1982 indicated, he did so without giving any indication of a departure from present Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have this absurd approach of the Fraser-Anthony Government. We see the effect of its philosophy on the States. What an effect it has had. In every State of the Commonwealth there are difficulties in the areas of education, hospitals, road construction and public works, all because of the inane philosophical position of the Fraser Government and its so-called new federalism which, whilst it passes the obligations to the lower arms of government, does not give them the necessary funds to carry out their new responsibilities. Fraser's new federalism can only be described as placing an extra financial burden on the States while reducing the State and regional control over actual decision-making. If the States do not have adequate funding-unequivocally, that is the position-there is no point in suggesting that they should have the power to make decisions because they do not have the funds to implement the decisions that have to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an incredible state of affairs that this Government is so impervious, so obstinate in its philosophical approach, that it ignores public opinion and the strongly held views of all those associated with the obligations concerning road funding and road construction. The April edition of the Local Government Bulletin stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Twelve months ago half a thousand councillors and aldermen, engineers and clerks descended in force on Canberra for a special two day conference on roads and their funding. Nearly 120 councils from New South Wales were represented, and there were numerous delegates from interstate to emphasise the concern of local government across Australia at the inadequacy of funds for roads. </PARA>
<PARA>This year it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On 25 February 1982 delegates from nearly 100 councils-as well as representatives from interstate-met at the Lakeside Inn on the northern shore of Lake Burley Griffin. The importance of better roads to urban areas as well as country districts was evidenced by the strength of the contingent from western Sydney and other rapidly-developing regions. </PARA>
<PARA>One would have thought that the Government would at least have maintained the level of funding of the previous years, but what it has done has been to reduce it alarmingly, to a level disturbingly lower than it has ever been in Australia' s history. More money per capita was spent on road construction during the Depression years, when there was a shortage of funds, than is being spent in Australia as a result of this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the essential difference between the Budget allocations in the last year of the Whitlam Administration and those in the last year of the Fraser Government. The Commonwealth's share of total road funding has been reduced from 30 per cent to 22 per cent while in the same period the States' share rose from 27.6 per cent to 38 per cent. We have an absurd situation in which States are forced to increase their charges in order to make up that leeway of 10.4 per cent in the area of funding which the Commonwealth, under its so-called new federalism, has passed on to them and in which Ministers of this Government criticise the State governments for increasing their charges. How absurd and how hypocritical it is for them to take that view. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, the Government pushed through this Parliament legislation which abolished the State's discretionary power to decide which national road construction work should be undertaken and which should be put out to tender. This was opposed by all the States, including the National Party State of Queensland, the Liberal Party State of Victoria and the Labor Party State of New South Wales. All the political friends in Australia were opposed to what the Government was doing; nevertheless it continued with its own mad philosophical position. The piece of legislation to which I have just referred sought to give a sop to the private road contractors to disturb the whole process by which road construction had hitherto operated throughout Australia. We are aware, as you are, Mr Acting Deputy President, of the effect that has had upon a number of small decentralised areas throughout the States where an efficient road construction authority has been disbanded and handed over to private enterprise. No proof was given then and no proof is given now that private contractors would build better roads, more cheaply, than State or local governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I found it quite incredible during the Estimates committee hearings, when we were examining the work of the razor gang and the increased costs of a number of the decisions that were made by the Commonwealth Government over the past year to transfer services from the public sector to the private sector, to find this Government did not have a cost benefit analysis in respect of those transfers. The Government acts blindly on the basis of its own narrow philosophy. It is a philosophy that has been shown in the United Kingdom and the United States of America to be imperfect, narrow and hurtful to the health of those countries' national economies. It is hard to find anybody anywhere in our country, anywhere in the national Parliament, who can deny that the roads of our country are in an appalling state. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed from the business sheet for the House of Representatives that Mr Katter, this very day in that place, is complaining about the road carnage. There is no doubt at all that the state of our roads contributes to the road toll, the death rate; yet this Government ignores that very human factor. It also ignores the cost factor that must go with an inefficient road system. In its pursuit of its narrow philosophical view, it does not take into account any of the cost efficiency factors or human factors in order to operate in the best interests of the Australian people. The high road toll experienced in my State of New South Wales, for example, on the holiday weekend just passed, was due in no small measure, I am sure, to the state of the road system. In fact, it can be said that this Government, by pursuing its narrow policies, is contributing to the murder of its own citizens in the various States. Yet this Government admits -it is stated in the second reading speech of the Ministers for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner)-that increases in Commonwealth road grants have not kept up with movements in road building costs. Surely we are entitled to ask that very question. At a minimum there ought to be sufficient funds to maintain existing construction needs without necessarily increasing the amount of funding . Just to maintain the level of funding one would have thought would be the minimum that the Fraser Government could do. </PARA>
<PARA> The new cost index prepared by the Bureau of Transport Economics suggests that federal road grants were cut by 17 per cent between 1974-75 and 1980-81. We make no apology for increasing the amount of road grants in the period in which the Whitlam Government was in office. We do not believe it was a mistake to allocate funds for that essential public work. It provided employment and a better and safer road system. We will never be convinced that that was an inadequate and irresponsible approach to federal funding of road construction. The plain statistical fact is that in the six years in which the Fraser Administration has been in office there has been a cut of 17 per cent in real terms at a time when our population has increased and the importance of transport to a modern economy has increased. </PARA>
<PARA> One has only to drive on the roads of our capital cities, our urban roads and our country roads to see how vitally important it is to transportation that we have an efficient road system. Inefficiency must flow from an inadequate road system whether the roads be of a main or secondary character. This Government is supposedly concerned about reducing costs and building a more efficient society. It completely ignores its responsibilities in this area. It is prepared to spend money in other areas and ignore the basic human needs, requirements and obligations of other arms of government in this country. It makes a mockery of the so-called new federalism which was supposed to decentralise power. It was never suggested that it should be at the expense of adequate funding to carry out government functions. It has been suggested in this place over the last half a dozen years by Senator Carrick that the great octopus that exists in Canberra needs to be reduced and that the States and local authorities should be the a decision-makers. They can be the real decision-makers only if the Commonwealth, as the main collector of tax moneys in this country, provides adequate funds for those decisions to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that year after year there have been cutbacks in money for public housing, public works in the States, hospitals, education and roads. Insufficient funds have been allocated for a whole range of public sector activities. The public sector needs to be strengthened to take up the slack and to deal with the growing employment problems by providing job opportunities, which are fast disappearing as a result of the changes that are taking place in the international trade and ecomomic scene. Jobs are disappearing because of high interest rates and the policies being pursued by this Government. In the areas where jobs could be created the Government is taking steps in the other direction. It is reducing the amount of funds that could otherwise provide employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate does not have the power to alter a money Bill. We do not have the effective means to increase the allocation in this Bill because it is part of the Government's responsibilities and obligations. Nevertheless, the amendment the Opposition has moved expresses the Senate's complete dissatisfaction with the amount of funds that have been allocated to road construction in this country. We align ourselves with the many thousands of allies in the local government authorities throughout Australia and with the various States, whatever their political complexions. To a man, those States accept that the Commonwealth should provide additional funds so that they can carry out their obligations, not only in the wider areas I have spoken about but also in the area of road construction. I urge all senators who genuinely support the restoration of our road system and who believe that it should be efficient and that there is a relationship between road deaths and a bad road system to support the Opposition amendment. I hope the Senate will adopt it. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to inform the Parliament of certain developments affecting Australia's strategic circumstances in the world setting and of changes in the defence program necessitated by the nation's financial circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> In October last year when I spoke on defence in this place I said: 'Our circumstances and our responsibilities have changed greatly in the course of the past 10 years. We have a clear commitment to fend for ourselves and to contribute to stability in our own region. I find myself in complete agreement with that philosophical view which contends that men and women who have a preference for the estate of liberty must carry with grace the burden of protecting it'. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1980 in another statement in this House I said: 'There is scope now for crises deeper and more frequent than we have hitherto experienced . . . there will be few now who can confidently assert that wherever favourable opportunities may occur for manipulation, subversion and interference, including the Asian and Pacific regions, the Soviet Union will not exploit them. Uncertainty and instability everywhere are stimulated by this'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore appropriate to ask ourselves today: Is the world a safer and more secure place than it was then? Has the world been swept to a state of serenity in the interim? Are the risks to world peace higher now than they were seven months ago-two years ago?</PARA>
<PARA> Civilised mankind must ask those questions and ask then with all candor. In the search for an answer mankind must be equally candid. </PARA>
<PARA> This nation's perception of its role in this troubled world is clear. We cannot and must not assume the role of the unconcerned, uncommitted and disinterested spectator. </PARA>
<PARA> We are by world standards admittedly a middle power. It should not be overlooked, however, that we can contribute to the peace and security of the world and we can do this in a variety of ways. </PARA>
<PARA> By ensuring there is stability in our region we make a very worthwhile contribution to the struggle in the emancipation of men from the belief that differences can only be settled by conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that today we look out upon a world of increasing unrest, disturbance and conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> For more than a decade the Soviet Union's spending on strategic nuclear armaments has been three times that if the United States. The arithmetic of melancholy goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Soviet spending on conventional weapons in the same period has been about double that of the United States. The armed forces of the Soviet Union outnumber those of the United States more than two to one. </PARA>
<PARA> In many categories of weapons the Soviet Union produces and deploys more that the US. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of example more than 300 Soviet SS-18 missiles are now deployed, most with 10 warheads. </PARA>
<PARA> This missile has been designed to eliminate the retalitory capability of the United States missiles housed in their underground shelters. </PARA>
<PARA> About 300 SS-20 missiles are now operational and deployment of new launchers apparently continues east of the Urals. This Missile, with a range of more than 4,500 kilometres, can strike at targets in Europe from sites deep within the Soviet Union. They represent only the tip of the Soviet's awesome arsenal.</PARA>
<PARA> Can any person who comes into this Parliament with but a vague interest in the survival of the species, remain unmoved by the evidence of this potential for mankind to lurch or stumble down the nuclear path to misery and the ultimate holocaust?</PARA>
<PARA> These are not issues to be dismissed lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot hide from reality or from this potential horror under the shield of narrow self-interest and say, 'Oh, this is no concern of ours'. </PARA>
<PARA> It must remain civilised mankind's prime concern. </PARA>
<PARA> And while this goes on within the Soviet Union, there is undisputed evidence that that nation is using its increasing military reach to support its political influence. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been or is in the process of acquiring strategic lodgements in Cuba, the Middle East, Africa and Indo-China. It actively probes for opportunities in the Indian Ocean. </PARA>
<PARA> Soviet footholds in Afghanistan, Ethiopia and the Yemen pose potential threats to the interests of other nations-not the least to the free and secure flow of their oil supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> The commitment to world domination remains undiminished. </PARA>
<PARA> In the fact of this Soviet effort the United States has taken a series of measures to maintain strategic equilibrium. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the United States, and the United States alone, which has the capacity to act as a countervailing influence to the awesome power of the Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA> President Reagan has also launched initiatives for negotiations for arms reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> It must surely be the hope of all mankind that the two superpowers will be able to address these critical issues in a realistic and constructive way. </PARA>
<PARA> And all the while the Soviet Union remains in occupation of Afghanistan, a non- aligned neighbouring third world country. </PARA>
<PARA> The continuing occupation of that country and the brutal repression of its people represent a massive assault on the norms of international behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> Today there are 100,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan. There is no evidence to suggest that the Soviet Union will withdraw and restore to the Afghan people their independence. </PARA>
<PARA> On the contrary there is every sign that the Soviet Union will persist in its occupation and that other nations must reckon in the future with this advanced base for Soviet interference in neighbouring countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the primary area of strategic interest to Australia-that is, the regions of South East Asia and the South West Pacific-the government notes the continuing occupation of Kampuchea by 200,000 Vietnamese troops. </PARA>
<PARA> It notes too the Soviet Union's support for that occupation and the Soviet Union's access to military facilities in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence have made a very useful contribution to discussion of these matters in its report 'Threats to Australia's Security-Their Nature and Probability'. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the committee on the diligence and depth of its examination and on the general content of its conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> In due course I will present to the Parliament a detailed response to the committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> May I say at this point that in general terms I support the committee's critical assessment that: 'Overall the committee's conclusions as to the nature and probability of threats to Australia's security are cautiously reassuring'. </PARA>
<PARA> Drawing back from the global scene, common strategic concerns are the subject of bilateral discussion from time to time between Australia and ASEAN states. </PARA>
<PARA> We seek to participate in regional discussion on these issues and to improve our understanding of the defence concerns of our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end, senior service officers and officers of my department visit the ASEAN countries regularly and in turn are visited by their counterparts for professional exchanges. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the former chief of defence force staff held discussions in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> I visited Malaysia and Singapore in 1981 for defence discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> This year I have been pleased to receive in Australia Abang Abu Bakar, Deputy Minister of Defence of Malaysia, and Mr Howe Yoon Chong, Minister of Defence of Singapore, for similar talks. </PARA>
<PARA> This week the Philippines Minister of National Defense, Mr Juan Ponce Enrile, is visiting Australia. The Government has encouraged partners in the five power defence arrangements to hold combined multi-national ground force exercises. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981, a successful exercise of this type was held in Australia with troops from Malaysia, Singapore, Britain, New Zealand and Australia. This year another was held in New Zealand. This type of exercise, and five power maritime and air defence exercises, will continue to be held in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Outside of the five power arrangements the Government has encouraged bilateral exercising with several of our regional friends. We have also welcomed to Australia detachments of the Republic of Singapore Army and Air Force for training. By providing the use of our training facilities, we seek to build on relationships derived from other forms of co-operative training and professional exchanges with our regional friends. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already announced that in mid-1983, it will be necessary to re-deploy one RAAF Mirage Squadron from Butterworth to Darwin in order to prepare for the forthcoming re-equipment of the tactical fighter force with new fighters. This decision was taken on grounds of operational necessity. </PARA>
<PARA> This reflects no change in our priorities and no diminution of Australian interest in security issues of concern to regional countries. </PARA>
<PARA> By agreement with the Malaysian Government, Australia will retain the operating detachment of P3 long range maritime patrol aircraft at Butterworth. The future of that detachment will not depend on decisions about the future of the Second Mirage Squadron at Butterworth. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia proposes to continue to deploy aircraft to Malaysia and Singapore to take part in Air Defence exercises. This would include temporary deployments of the new tactical fighters after their entry into service. </PARA>
<PARA> While on the subject of combined and joint exercising, I would like to make particular reference to exercise Kangaroo 81, which many members of this Parliament were able to observe at first hand. The aim of Kangaroo 81 was to exercise participants in combined and joint operations in a conventional, mid- intensity conflict in a defence-of-Australia setting. This aim was achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the single most important lesson to emerge from the exercise was related to command and control arrangements. The practicality of the direct method of command from the Chief of Defence Force Staff to Joint Force Commanders in the field was tested. </PARA>
<PARA> Although limited by the requirements of peace-time planning, it provided useful lessons for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The continual exchanges and exercises which occur between Australian forces and those of the United States and New Zealand have been most effective in raising the level of operational compatibility with our allies. </PARA>
<PARA> A major dimension of our defence relationships with countries in our own area are our defence co-operation programs with our regional friends. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government expects to spend $42m this financial year on defence co- operation in South East Asia and the South West Pacific. The program has steadily expanded over the past few years and now embraces formal programs with 11 neighbouring countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the number of servicemen brought to Australia from ASEAN and South West Pacific countries for individual training in the various professional and technical military skills has continued to expand steadily. </PARA>
<PARA> The range of co-operative activities involves projects such as survey and mapping activities, an armed forces manufacturing workshop, aircraft maintenance and support assistance, the establishment of a defence research centre, and specialist training. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to financial considerations and to the defence program itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recently found it necessary to contain the growth in post- budget 1981-82 public expenditures. Along with other areas of government, defence has had to find offsets for price and wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in service pay announced late last year will cost $171m in this financial year. There has also been an increase in public service pay as well as price rises in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect in this year has been to divert investment expenditures provided for in the Budget away from real growth towards meeting higher wages and other costs . There will be flow-on effects in later years of the defence program. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently some planned objectives for the development of the defence force will not be achieved as early as originally intended. Other objectives have, however, been brought forward. I emphasise that while none are to be abandoned, their achievement in the intended time-frame will require high levels of defence expenditure to be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> The major acquisitions brought forward are the purchases of a carrier to replace HMAS Melbourne and of 10 new P3C Orion aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> The acquisition of HMS Invincible, which will be re-commissioned into the RAN as HMAS Australia, has met with doubts and criticism in some quarters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government carefully considered all views and decided that on balance it should proceed with the acquisition of Invincible which was on offer from the British Government on very favourable terms. </PARA>
<PARA> With Invincible, Australia is buying a ship essentially for its contribution to anti-submarine warfare, although it will also provide facilities for command and control or larger task groups and for transport of troops. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not being bought for its capacity to operate short take-off and landing aircraft. The ship will be used as a helicopter carrier and there should not be any expectation in present circumstances that we will be going beyond that.</PARA>
<PARA> Together with the Orion P3C fleet of 20 long-range maritime patrol aircraft, the Invincible and its helicopters will give this country a very strong capability for anti-submarine warfare, at a total investment cost of about $1, 100m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that an island continent and trading nation like Australia must have this capability and that protection of shipping from submarine attack must command a very high priority in Australia's defence investments. </PARA>
<PARA> The current commitments and the future of Navy's existing fixed-wing aircraft are being examined by a defence working party as a consequence of a Government decision that these aircraft are to be paid off as soon as practicable to provide early savings in expenditure. It is expected that there will also be consequent manpower savings. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I advised the House that we would acquire 10 new P3C Orion aircraft to replace the existing squadron of P3B aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the US Navy's decision to curtail its rate of acquisition of P3C aircraft, the total cost of the project is expected to rise to about $280m at August 1981 prices, subject to satisfactory contractual negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, in order to sustain an economic production rate Australia will have to take delivery of its aircraft much earlier than planned. Deliveries will have to begin in November 1984 and be completed by March 1986. This requires much greater expenditure in the early program years than was initially planned. In view of the importance the government attaches to this project, we have advised the United States of our decision to proceed with the order for ten P3C aircraft, subject to the negotiation of satisfactory contractual terms and conditions for the purchase of the new aircraft and the sale of the B models. </PARA>
<PARA> Significant relief from Budget pressures in 1981-82 has been provided by reductions in planned payments on purchases under United States Department of Defense foreign military sales arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been made possible following a review with United States authorities of the schedules of payments under current FMS orders and the cash-flow requirements from those orders. Relief is also anticipated in the early years of the new 5 year defence program 1982-87. It's full extent is still being assessed , but it will certainly help in accommodating expenditures on invincible and the orions without major dislocation of the defence program. </PARA>
<PARA> Though some re-scheduling is unavoidable, for the reasons outlined, this action should be measured against a background of other recent decisions involving substantial expenditures to augment the defence inventory of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> In this financial year alone, Australia will have entered into firm commitments for the purchase of new defence capital equipment worth more than $3,000m. by any measure that is a great deal of money. It is more than two-thirds of Australia's total spending on defence in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is acutely aware however that the sum in itself signifies very little. The important thing is the extent of defence capability represented by that money. It is, unfortunately, not as much as we would like. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a problem unique to Australia. It is common to every country which needs to have its defence forces keep pace with the rate of technological advance, even the much-advocated trading of quality for quantity, whatever its intrinsic merits or demerits, has little effect on the total costs involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred earlier to the burden which must be borne by the taxpayers of this nation. Some representative costs of defence activity are worth noting. </PARA>
<PARA> The FA-18, which will constitute the new tactical fighter force is about twice the price of the F-4 Phantom, an aircraft it is intended to replace and one which will still be in United States service for many years. This same pattern of cost growth generally applies to ships, helicopters, armoured vehicles and missiles. The complexity of modern equipments increases operating costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The F111, the backbone of our strike force, is almost twice as costly to operate as the Phantoms, which we operated for a period while awaiting the F-111 . Complexity also increases manpower costs. Highly qualified and skilled personnel are needed to repair and maintain new equipments. These skills in themselves are expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> The RAN's diesel-electric submarines must be refitted after every five years of running. The cost-$33m., including $1.3m. for replacement of the batteries, after 600 hours of operation of the atar engine in a mirage requires overhaul- the cost-$182,000 exclusive of spare parts. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of defence manpower has risen rapidly. In 1978-79 the average annual salary of a military officer was $17,200. Today it is $28,000-an increase of 63% . The average salary for a sailor, a soldier or an airman is now $18,800 p.a. compared with $10,800 in 1978-79-an increase of 74%. In addition allowances payable to servicemen now total $140m per year compared with $83m in 1978-79-an increase of nearly 70%. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same period defence civilian staff salaries have risen by an average of $4,200 from $10,800 to $15,000-an increase of 39%. Other civilian payments for overtime, penalty rates etc. now cost $22m compared with $16m in 1978-79. </PARA>
<PARA> Operational and training costs are substantial. </PARA>
<PARA> The services must regularly practice fire their weapons, both to ensure their operational readiness and to give operators experience of a kind which cannot be gained by practice drill and simulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Every live round fired by a leopard tank costs up to $670. Many rounds have to be fired in practice each year. Such expenditure is inescapable. </PARA>
<PARA> Enormous outlays are required for the development of facilities to support operational capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The modernisation of Garden Island Dockyard in Sydney will eventually cost about $200m. The alternative of relocating the fleet base and dockyard, even if practicable, would have cost in the vicinity of $1,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the F/A-18 fighter aircraft will require new support facilities and housing at Williamtown and Darwin totalling well in excess of $ 100m. </PARA>
<PARA> The $3,000m which I quoted earlier will be paying for the new tactical fighter, trucks for the Army, air-to-air missiles for the Mirage fighter aircraft, the new aircraft carrier and many smaller projects. </PARA>
<PARA> To those who believe that at a project cost of $478m the Invincible was an expensive purchase, I would like to point out that $3,000 million would barely cover the cost of a Nimitz-class nuclear carrier, with approximately the same amount needed to provide an air group for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this not because we have ever considered making an offer for a Nimitz -class carrier, but simply to illustrate that in looking at the cost of defence equipment, it is important to have a sense of perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> These new commitments will be funded from future defence budget allocations. In this context the Government has recently re-affirmed the importance of sustaining the momentum of the defence program and it is therefore determined to provide the level of funding necesssary to meet past commitments, on-going activities and at the same time provide reasonable flexibility for new investment decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Plans for the new tactical fighter aircraft are progressing to schedule. Eight formal letters of offer and acceptance, covering major aspects of this complex and expensive project, have been signed. </PARA>
<PARA> Work on the Australian industry participation program has already started and major Australian contractors are actively engaged in establishing production resources. Some orders for machinery and plant have already been placed by the Government. In addition, we are moving towards finalisation of the arrangements for the design and development, in Australia, of a new basic trainer aircraft for the RAAF. Negotiations for the purchase of a light training helicopter will commence shortly and I expect to announce the decision on this in the near future. Orders have been placed with Australian industry for over 9,600 Barra sonobouys and for Mulloka sonars for the destroyer escorts. These Australian- designed and manufactured sonar devices are amongst the most advanced of their kind in the world and are uniquely suited to anti-submarine operations in Australian waters. Australia recently accepted a letter of offer and acceptance from the United States for the supply of equipment to modernise our three DDG guided missile destroyers. Here again comparative costs are worth noting. In the mid-1960's, these three ships cost $115m. In constant dollars, three FFG guided missile frigates will cost us almost twice as much. To ensure that the Parliament and the people of this nation are kept informed of how the defence budget is to be spent, it is my practice to advise the House of important decisions as early as possible. I have already mentioned some changes to the defence program previously planned. I now outline other significant program changes agreed by Government:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not at this stage proceed with the acquisition of an additional five Fremantle Class patrol boats and the second underway replenishment ship;</PARA>
<PARA> The long-serving Canberra aircraft, which are currently used in the aerial photographic survey role and other RAAF support tasks, will be paid off. Until a new aircraft is acquired, any requirement for these capabilities will be met by other means such as chartered aircraft;</PARA>
<PARA> Re-examination of the defence integrated secure communications network (DISCON) has permitted initial installation to proceed with reduced user-access and hence savings are possible. The initial installation will, however, be capable of expansion;</PARA>
<PARA> The provision for expenditure over the next five years on follow-on destroyers will be reduced. The level of annual expenditure will be given detailed consideration along with the planned reforms at the Williamstown dockyard;</PARA>
<PARA> Automation of army map production facilities is continuing, but a proposal for yet further enhancement of these facilities will not proceed at this stage;</PARA>
<PARA> Planned expenditure of additional ASW helicopters has been deferred and program expenditure on other RAN and RAAF helicopters has been reduced;</PARA>
<PARA> There will be a reduction in the level of refurbishment of the Mirage;</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the lower priority facilities and infrastructure developments have been slowed down or delayed. Among the high priority projects, construction of a new airfield at Derby (WA) will begin as planned but the period of construction could be extended by up to two years;</PARA>
<PARA> There will be reductions in programmed expenditure for operating costs. This will be achieved by continuing economies already introduced in this financial year. It will mean restraint in the level of some training activities and the cancellation of others. Other areas affected include travel, equipment repair and general administrative expenses;</PARA>
<PARA> Planned fuel and other stockholding levels will be reduced and service activities, including Navy's steaming time, Army's utilisation of its armoured vehicles, and service flying hours, will be restrained. Each of the Mirage squadrons may have to specialise to some extent in either the air-to-air or air- to-ground role. This would demand less training time and weapon usage than at present, when all pilots train in both specialist roles. There will be no reduction in numbers of Mirage pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> The alterations to the defence program will also have a significant impact on planned manpower requirements:</PARA>
<PARA> Measures to improve manpower retention rates have been implemented, particularly in the area of service pay and allowances. Savings in recruitment, training and other overheads follow from improved manpower retention levels;</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to manpower savings from the early acquisition of Invincible, and savings on Skyhawk, Tracker and Canberra aircraft operations, futher manpower savings will be achieved by holding army strength for 1981-82 and 1982-83 at the June 1981 level of 32,850;</PARA>
<PARA> Defence civilian manpower has been progressively reduced in recent years, in line with Government policies of reduced public sector staffing levels and the transfer of functions to the private sector. It is planned to maintain civilian staff numbers close to current levels and to defer indefinitely the transfer of selected functions from the defence science and technology organisation to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to the defence program which I have outlined here today are, in the main, the consequence of the need to provide funds for the acquisition of the Invincible and the additional P3C orions earlier than planned, and to absorb to a significant degree the higher costs of manpower. </PARA>
<PARA> To have deferred these decisions on the carrier and the Orions to align with originally planned timings may well have resulted, at best, in the need for considerably higher expenditure in the future, and, at worst, in not being able to acquire the equipment at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The alterations made to the defence program will, of necessity, bring about some disappointment and dislocation in the short term. Of prime importance, however, is the fact that the orderly programmed development of defence capabilities will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also like to take this opportunity to announce further developments regarding the Williamstown naval dockyard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided, on the basis of the report of the advisory committee on the management and operation of the Williamstown naval dockyard, that sweeping reforms should be made to present dockyard managerial arrangements , including the appointment of new senior personnel who will be given appropriate authority and responsibility in the manpower, purchasing and financial fields. </PARA>
<PARA> I am now arranging for an industrialist with recognised management capability and a retired union official of appropriate status to be invited to serve as consultants to the Department of Defence on the implementation of these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA> Meetings are continuing between officers of my department, the ACTU, leading trade unions and job representatives to explain the administrative reforms and the improvement in work practices and performance which must be demonstrated if Williamstown naval dockyard is eventually to secure orders for follow-on destroyers. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken today of the prospects for the nation's continued security. We can have some confidence that in our immediate circumstances, developments continue to favour us. Both our geography and the political and defence relations we enjoy in our neighbouring regions support that confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The broader international prospect is less reassuring. I accept that the catastrophe of nuclear war exercises a powerful restraint upon the nuclear powers and is a critical factor for stability. But the tensions and conflicts are constrained, not dissolved. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot dismiss the facts of the Soviet Union's continued high rate of military development, of its continued occupation of Afghanistan and its continued efforts to exploit other opportunities that present themselves world- wide to improve its status vis-a-vis its rival superpower, our ally the United States. We cannot disregard the fact that Soviet activity jeopardises important interests of the United States, and many other nations. These nations are bound to react. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, we cannot underrate the potential for mismanagement and crisis. Who, a month ago, would have accepted that a British battle fleet would be moving against Argentina? We cannot calculate and foretell the interplay of our complex international life. </PARA>
<PARA> However sound our judgment that, at one extreme, conflict between the super powers is unlikely and, at the other, that our own regional security prospects are favourable, we cannot afford not to provide against unexpected changes for the worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's defence effort must continue. We must recruit and train and equip and support our defence force. We must invest in our defence infrastructure, both military and civil. We must support our international friendships and co- operation. </PARA>
<PARA> What I have stated are goals. They are national goals. They are and must remain proud national goals. </PARA>
<PARA> Liberty is not something which can be inherited and passed on. Liberty is not a chattel to be claimed under a will. It is something to be won by effort, by example and, yes, by sacrifice. I would feel a deep sense of shame if I were to say to comtemporary Australia that the cost of preserving our liberties and of making an effort to see peace in this world will not be high. It will be high. </PARA>
<PARA> It will mean the carriage of a burden. It will mean a sacrifice. It does not mean that despair is our lot. On the contrary it means that hope and determination must remain a part of our lives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This statement is pretty clearly Mr Killen's swan song. In order to make way for the long overdue reshuffle of the Government Mr Killen is undoubtedly about to shuffle off this parliamentary coil and this appears to be his parliamentary legacy, his testimony. Certainly it has all the characteristics and the hallmarks of a Killen production number. There is not much arid civil service language about the statement, at least not until we get to the arithmetic in the latter part of it. It has all the familiar bombast and rhetoric disguising the essentially hollow core. It has all the sound and fury, signifying nothing, that we have come to expect of the nation's defence spokesman over such a long period. It has all the tough talk disguising the fact that our defence capacity under this Government and this Minister has become steadily run down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no denying or disguising that there are major, effective and real cutbacks in the capital and recurrent expenditure for defence announced in this statement. Despite all the huff and puff about the bargain basement Invincible- if there is anything left of it; I suppose we might need to readjust our terminology and talk in future about the fire sale Invincible-with which this statement is replete and despite the speed-up in the purchase of the PC3 Orions, which is the other major affirmative side of this statement, it is obvious that almost everything else revealed by the statement is unmitigated disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement tries to fudge it but there is no concealing the fact that from now on we will have a navy with warships that we cannot, for the most part, afford to sail; we will have an army with armoured vehicles that, for the most part, we will not be able to afford to drive; we will have an army with Leopard tanks with guns that we will not be able to afford to fire; and we will have an air force with planes that we cannot afford to fly. We will have an air force with pilots who will be trained from now on in essentially only one functional role. They will be either air-to-ground pilots or air-to-air pilots, but they will not be both; and God help them if they find themselves in a situation where they need that other functional capacity. We will have a naval dockyard at Williamstown, despite all the money that has been spent on the recent exercise to work out reforms that are long overdue there, with no work to do. We will have a naval air arm with no fixed wing aircraft at all to fly. We will have an aircraft carrier without any fixed wing aircraft, even though--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the very visible lobbying of former defence chief Synott in recent weeks since his retirement, this is about as unequivocal a statement of the Government's at least present intention not to proceed with the fixed wing aircraft on the aircraft carrier-if, as Senator Haines says, we do eventually get it-as there could possibly be, despite the fact that the functional role of the Invincible is built at least as much around those STOVL aircraft as it is around the helicopters which are also part of its air capacity . Most scandalous of all in this litany, we will have Navy FFGs coming into service without helicopters aboard them as a result again of what is described on page 20 of this statement-the deferral of planned expenditure for additional helicopters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister says that there will be some 'disappointment and dislocation' caused as a result of this statement. That is a spectacular understatment. All of this list of miscellanous cutbacks and Budget economies has, of course, proceeded in this statement without any rational consideration of the overall strategic context in which Australian defence planning must take place. I say ' of course' because that has become the norm with defence statements from this Government. There is a desultory kind of round-up of world problems in the first four or five pages of the statement as seen through the tory eyes of Mr Killen, with much attention inevitably, and not always irrelevantly, being paid to the inquity of the Soviet Union in its recent military adventures around the world. But very little of this analysis, if it can be dignified with that description, is related to our own region, our own strategic situation and our own strategic priorities. Indeed, the description of the state of the world and the threats associated with it finishes with a little whimper of acknowledgement on page 5 of the statement that probably the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence was right when it concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Overall the Committee's conclusions as to the nature and probability of threats to Australia's security are cautiously reassuring. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is obliged to accept the truth of that analysis, a truth which is not concealed, as I say, by the rhetoric and the bombast with which the first part of the statement is so replete. It is obvious from even the most cursory glance-and I will be giving it only a cursory glance on this occasion, not least because the statement has been available to use for only a few minutes-that our strategic priorities have simply gone haywire in recent years and more particularly in recent months. All our eggs are now being placed, it appears from this and the previous run of recent defence statements, in the anti- submarine warfare basket without, on the one hand, developing an ASW capacity of maximum effectiveness in that area and without attention being paid at all to what are arguably greater strategic priorities for Australia than anti-submarine warfare. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that, to the extent that we do have an anti-submarine requirement, we did not need the purchase of a very expensive aircraft carrier to meet that requirement. The Orion anti-submarine partrols-they will, I concede , be much extended in their capacity to be brought into operation as a result of the speed up in the purchase of the Orions here proposed-the sonar buoys and the upgrading of air and naval bases in the Northern Territory and Western Australia , which were proposed, although I note that there has now been some modifications even in those areas, are all the sorts of things which, if anti- submarine warfare is our basic strategic priority, should have had higher priority than the purchase of the Invincible. The same can be said for the faster corvette class patrol boats which in this statement are also getting the chop. The carrier simply does not provide a quick reaction to attack situations in the north and north-west. As we have often said in this place and as anyone who has analysed the role of the carrier has said, how can it do so if it takes up to five days to steam into station in the event of any such attack or danger situation revealing itself?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good for parties on the quarterdeck, as Senator Mason says. The flag carrier role, the diplomatic role, the naval officer prestige enhancement role seems to be ultimately what the justification, the rationale, for this purchase finally boils down to. The point I am trying to make in a roundabout sort of way is that all the emphasis is placed on anti-submarine warfare when there are better ways of upgrading our anti-submarine ability than the purchase of an all eggs in the one basket Invincible. The indispensable components in the ASW capacity, such as helicopters on the FFGs and so on, are exactly the sorts of things that are being rubbed out by virtue of this statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other strategic point that I think cannot be reiterated too often is that really our crucial strategic priority ought to be the protection of our seaborne trade. Against that background it should be obvious that only a super-power is ever likely to be in a position effectively to cut off that trade. No other powers have the number of submarines that are necessary in that respect. Any power attempting to cut off our trade would have to be prepared to commit aggression against ships from many other countries since the overwhelming majority of our trade is carried in foreign bottoms. If that is all true and if that is all accepted, the conclusion that follows is that what we ought to be doing in terms of setting purchasing priorities for ourselves is buying more flexible equipment such as submarines, destroyers, helicopters and mine hunting vessels since they are much more likely to be able to be effectively deployed for protection of Australian shipping in ports and at other stricture points around the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The objection that the Australian Labor Party has constantly expressed to the carrier purchase is sometimes taken as suggesting that we have no real commitment as a party to the maintenance of, let alone any expansion of, real defence expenditure. Nothing could be further from the truth as, for example, the parliamentary leader of the Labor Party, Mr Hayden, has made clear on numerous occasions in the last few months, perhaps nowhere more so than in his very widely publicised speech to the Australian Institute of International Affairs on 9 November last year. Of course, the situation as far as we are concerned is that we have different priorities in our expenditure. We are concerned to ensure-this really distinguishes us from this Government-that the forward momentum is maintained in our defence expenditure. We believe that what we need more than anything else is a capacity for forward planning, for a rational rolling over of a degree of predictability, given the long lead times involved in all these kinds of purchases. This, more than anything else, has been the failure of the present Government. It is a failure which has been apparent and has been associated with the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) all the way back to the very first days when he originally became associated with the defence role. One thinks back to the 1970 situation when he, as Defence Minister, was responsible for imposing massive cuts in the 1969 Defence budget. Then, of course, there has been the administration under his Government of the 1976 five-year defence plan. That was announced with a great fanfare in 1976, rather overlooking the fact that most of the work leading up to that had in fact been accomplished under a Labor Government. But the present Government's role in respect of that highly rational, and innovative forward plan of 5 years' duration has been simply to scuttle it. The result has been that any pretentions we have had to maintaining the original priorities in that plan have long since been abandoned, and each passing year has seen the original set of priorities and original set of purchases proposed falling ever further behind. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 a 5-year program involving a 5 per cent increase in expenditure each year in real terms was announced. In fact the percentage increase has been something less than 4 per cent. Again in that period the Government was to dedicate 24 per cent of the total Defence budget for spending on capital equipment. In actual fact the figure has been only approximately 15 per cent. In last year's Budget the Government stated a concern to ensure that something like 7 per cent in real increases for the next 5 years would take place. That has fallen even further behind, of course, although we have not had the opportunity to do the detailed arithmetic as a result of this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980 we had a hiccup in this whole process with the announcement by the Government in the aftermath of the events in Afghanistan of a massive new defence program, practically nothing of which remains following this statement. It is obvious that Mr Killen and his Government between them have absolutely nothing to be proud of. Mr Killen leaves us, as it undoubtedly appears that he will in the very near future, essentially as he arrived-full of wind and water and without any positive contribution having been made to the real and substantial defence needs of this country. </PARA>

This is the most truly dismal of a succession of defence statements that have been brought to this Parliament over the last couple of years. This one truly takes the cake.

But the true message behind all the bombast is a clear indication that in relation to defence we are very nearly impotent, yet at the same time we remain bellicose.

<PARA> The Government talks in the first part of this rather lengthy statement about South East Asian regional co-operation. There is no real substance in this. There is a series of half truths, a series of general statements of which it is difficult to make any sense at all. One gets the feeling that we are tempted yet again to be drawn into regional wars in this area without having taken much note , I would suggest, of the disastrous effect of regional wars from the Malayan Emergency onwards, the Indo-China wars and matters of that kind. Page 6 of the statement refers to the Philippines Minister of National Defence, Mr Juan Ponce Enrile, who is visiting Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that it would be known to this Government that the brutal financial disproportion in the Philippines, its landlessness and the constant repression by the majority of the affluent of that country at the barrio level and every other one, its substantial refusal to promote any genuine form of self government in the Philippines and the withdrawal and destruction of the previous democracy in that country, are the causes of instability and violence in the Philippines and must go on being so. I was one of those, who, as a young man, witnessed on the ground the disastrous effects in Malaysia during the Templer emergency program of resettlement in new villages and observed up to the time of Malayan independence and the formation of Malaysia the bitter effect it left on the people at the village level and in fact the general level of that attempted program. It is appalling to find that in Mindanao now the Philippine Government is doing exactly the same thing; it is making exactly the same kinds of mistakes and causing exactly the same sorts of appalling problems to people as a result of that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to page 6 of the statement. I hope that the Government, for heaven's sake, will not confuse security with the reinforcement and encouragement of repressive regimes in South East Asia. If we do I suggest we support such governments at our own peril. If we have not yet learnt the lessons of the history of the last 15 to 20 years to that extent we will deserve the fate of those who do not understand history and who are perpetually condemned by fate to repeat their own errors. That is something we cannot afford. On page 7 of the statement the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) reiterated his announcement. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in mid 1983, it will be necessary to re-deploy one RAAF Mirage squadron from Butterworth to Darwin . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is a good idea. The Australian Democrats basically believe we should devote what forces we have to the defence of this country. The best way we can do that is to look at our own land area and see what we can do to defend it in the event of an emergency occurring in which we may well have to defend this country against some sort of external threat without help from our allies. That is something I hope that Government will keep perpetually in mind. On page 11 of the statement are the comments on Invincible to which Senator Evans has referred and on which I will briefly comment. The Australian Democrats have opposed the purchase of Invincible for a variety of reasons I have dealt with before and which I will not go over again. Basically, the rationale of the ship was that at least it was to use short take off and vertical landing aircraft. Indeed, the recently retired Chief of Defence Force Staff, Admiral Sir Anthony Synnot, made that point himself. He warned the Government in recent weeks that to buy that ship without that capability is nonsense. That, of course, is what we are now doing. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> With Invincible, Australia is buying a ship essentially for its contribution to anti-submarine warfare, although it will provide facilities for command and control of larger task groups and for transport of troops. </PARA>
<PARA>These seem to us to be very limited roles for a ship of this cost which is essentially our major naval defence unit. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not being bought for its capacity to operate short-take-off and landing aircraft. The ship will be used as a helicopter carrier and there should not be any expectation in present circumstances that we will be going beyond that.</PARA>
<PARA>This does not in any way reassure the Australian Democrats about the purchase of Invincible. I do not think it will reassure the Australian people. It will merely confirm that the Government has not known what it was doing in buying this ship, that it has perhaps listened to blandishments from senior naval people, which were perhaps respectable points of view if indeed the STOVL aircraft were included. But the Government, having abandoned that, has abandoned any attempt at rationality and any attempt to explain this purchase in any kind of rational terms. The point is-Senator Evans hinted at this-that it is the purchase of Invincible which has exacted these other heavy costs which he mentioned and which I will not go over again. I agree with every one of his words on that subject. The smiling litany towards the end of the destruction or the making impotent of other areas of our defence are being caused at the cost of the money which is going into Invincible. I think that is a lesson which we must all remember. I think we must constantly remind the Government of it. This is something it ought not be allowed to forget. I hope that at some stage we will get a response to that accusation. Page 16 of the statement states:</PARA>
<PARA> The modernisation of Garden Island Dockyard in Sydney will eventually cost about $200m. The alternative of relocating the fleet base dockyard, even if practicable, would have cost in the vicinity of $1,000m. </PARA>
<PARA>I say, as a senator for New South Wales and especially for the City of Sydney in which I live and in which a lot of other people live, that this is a nettle which the Government will have to grasp sooner or later. </PARA>
<PARA> It is tragic that an additional $200m is being spent on Garden Island. This will make it even more difficult to relocate the dockyard in future. It is quite mad in any world terms to have a fleet base and dockyard located right in the heart of the largest and most valuable city in the nation. It is ridiculous and absurd. It is something about which we should be considering long term policy. If we leave that installation there and develop it and we then find ourselves in a war situation it is certain, not just likely, that this area will become a military target. How do we value all that would be destroyed around that area? Certainly when one looks at it in that way the cost of $1,000m to move that dockyard would be small. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that some sort of rationality should be brought into this situation. The Government should bring forward some program, even a long term one, for moving the Garden Island facilities elsewhere. The spending of $200m on Garden Island and the raping of another section of Sydney's prime waterfront land by the Royal Australian Navy is probably avoidable. I ask honourable senators to pardon the metaphor. It is not strictly correct to say ' raping the land', but I am sure that honourable senators know what I mean. I would have thought that it would be possible to induce the Navy to say that some of these facilities might be moved away at this stage. We should look at it from a more rational point of view. We should get rid of the absurd situation which exists at present, apparently for the convenience of naval officers and so on. It is nice to be near the theatres and things like that. Apart from that consideration, which I admit is a real one and one of great value to naval officers and other people, it is quite mad to continue to have the Garden Island Dockyard located in central Sydney. I think honourable senators will find that most of the people in Sydney would agree with that proposition. It would be a major target in war and we will live to regret its presence there. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make one point concerning the matters to be found on page 19 of this ministerial statement. I will not go over the matters which Senator Evans covered in detail as he put them very well. He dealt with this dismal business whereby virtually everything of importance that we have in our Services area will be cut back, mutilated in some way or reduced so that it cannot work. The Australian Democrats greatly regret the Government's failure to proceed with the acquisition of the additional five Fremantle class patrol boats and the second replenishment ship which is underway. We can see how that ship was presumably fitted in some sort of way into the Government's program. We are not going to have that ship now and that will leave even more holes in the program than there were before. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had an opportunity to equip the Fremantle class patrol boats-having inspected one, I can say that they are first-class small warships-to be modern warships with missile capabilities instead of completely useless little ships which carry on the foredeck a Bofors gun which I gather cannot even attack a Taiwanese fishing trawler if it is tacking upwind. I add that this is not my opinion but the opinion of senior naval officers. We had that opportunity. In other parts of the world ships almost identical to these ones are being used for that purpose. There is a space in each vessel for command and control operations for a missile system. I would have thought that out of the rags and tatters of our defence policy the Government would at least have said that it will try to do something that the rest of the world is doing and provided us with at least a few attack ships with missile capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes one despairs of getting up and talking in this place because it seems that the Government is incapable of learning from the experience of other people and other nations that have probably put a great deal more thought and time into this matter and have much more experience than we have. But we go our own way regardless. The Australian Democrats deeply regret that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes available to me I wish to compliment the Government on the way in which it has grasped an extraordinarily difficult financial problem. Some of the figures given in this ministerial statement illustrate the enormous increase in both manpower costs and equipment costs with which we are faced in providing a defence force for this country. That is something to which no honourable senator opposite gave recognition. It does not surprise me because honourable senators opposite always have difficulty in adding up numbers and getting into the economic argument of things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not true to say, as Senator Mason said, that these changes are all coming about through the purchase of the HMS Invincible. They are coming about because we have to make an accelerated purchase of 10 P3C aircraft. Those aircraft are essential to Australia. I have actually flown in the P3B aircraft and the equipment in those aircraft is comparable to the equipment that was used at the end of the Second World War. They are no longer functionally adequate for Australia in any way at all. The problem arises because the United States of America is closing down its P3C production line at the Lockheed company in Burbank. To obtain these aircraft we have to buy them in a block and in a more advanced state than we had hoped, otherwise we will not get the aircraft. There really are no substitutes in the Western world for what we want. The figure of $ 280m against the $480m for the Invincible has to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> For the rest of it, I return to the initial point I made concerning the very high cost of defence. We simply do not spend enough on defence in this country. This ministerial statement illustrates in its cuts the things that we really should be doing. I hope that the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) will be able to convince the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the Budget discussions that this nation needs to devote more of its resources to defence. As the Falkland Islands situation shows, we do not get a letter beforehand indicating that trouble is coming. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate is of the opinion that a Committee of inquiry should be appointed to consider and report upon the possible planning, including terms of reference, for a national convention, to be held within two years for a ten-year indicative plan for the Australian economy, such convention to include representatives of all political parties, employers' groups, unions and government, to attempt to establish basic guidelines on which all could agree and which would remain constant regardless of changes of government, with particular reference to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the massive unemployment problem likely as a result of the growing use of computers and automation in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the flow-on of money to the community at large as a result of such automation, and other structural changes desirable in the society; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) possible new initiatives in Australian primary and secondary industry, with special regard to the export industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of basic concern to the Australian Democrats that the Government appears to pay scant regard to the need for a broad indicative plan for Australia's future. That, of course, is the basic purpose of the motion, although it addresses itself also to the special demand for planning because of the technological change revolution which, as we know, is of world-wide proportions and which is already beginning to affect this country and must increasingly do so in the future. In other words, we believe that, unlike the situation in the past where there was a relatively small mobility within the employment area-I say that advisedly-there will be a much greater one in the future. We must be equipped in some way to cope with it. There have been many warnings to this effect from experts of all kinds who say that, as the years go on, this revolution will increasingly affect Australia. We are concerned by the fact that there is not really any kind of government indicative plan for the future to deal with this matter or, indeed, to deal with Australia's future. It is obvious enough that the affairs of a business, a family or even an individual can benefit from some consistent and considered thought for the future. Indeed, in most of those cases, certainly in the case of a business, that would be considered essential. </PARA>
<PARA> I have observed that the Government parties have a curious semantic hangup about this matter. The word 'planning' seems to them, I think, to have sinister emotional overtones of socialism or even communism. If one wants to plan anything, presumably one is right off to the left wing. If this attitude actually exists, as it certainly appears to do, it is, of course, disastrous. Does it appear to exist? To us it certainly appears to do so. In Australia, there does not seem to be any real mechanism, such as the one that we are proposing, to monitor social and economic trends in co-operation and consultation with the community-we believe that to be vitally important-to provide a data base for indicative planning by representatives of all concerned. We believe it is not impossible to get a reasonable baseline of agreement between these different areas-political parties, unions, employers' groups and the Government. Surely it is possible for us to try to find out what is the common ground that at least these areas can share. Let them have disagreement. That is natural and normal in the democratic process. But if we establish at least that bench mark at which people can co-operate, we have a basis on which to build. Basically this motion asks for that. We do not underestimate the task. That is why the motion states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that a Committee of Inquiry should be appointed to consider and report upon the possible planning, including terms of reference, for a national convention, to be held within two years, for a ten-year indicative plan for the Australian economy, such convention to include representatives of all political parties, employers' groups, unions and government, to attempt to establish basic guidelines . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We do not underestimate the difficulties of that task. That is why we have said that it is a relatively long term project and something which will need a good deal of discussion, a good deal of planning and setting up merely to establish the basis on which these things can be discussed. But, as has been said, every journey starts with a single step. Our concern is that that single step is never taken and that, as time goes on, the necessity for the step and the journey become all the more urgent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The road does not lead to nowhere. The United States of America has the Brooking Institute; Sweden has the Secretariat for Future Studies; New Zealand, Canada and Finland already have similar non-partisan, broadly based institutions which are doing the sort of thing that we are talking about. Would the honourable senator say that those countries-the United States, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and Finland-are all represented by governments which do not know where they are going? I think that they probably do. Even if they do not, at least they are doing something that we are not doing. They are trying to find out where they are going. I think it is of essential importance that they should do that. We should give them due credit and not derogate what is being done in other countries and diminish the effort that they are trying to make. I have heard people talk about institutes of future studies and say: 'Oh, science fiction stuff'; but it is not. I have read some of their material. They make a genuine attempt to find out what is going on in the future and to make assessments in an area in which everybody agrees-I am sure Senator Martyr would agree-will be a time of very great change for which we must equip ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately in Australia our policy development remains short-term and piecemeal. That is not surprising when we have a government which single- mindedly pursues its restrictive economic policies with complete disregard for their disastrous consequences on Australia. I would have thought that this would have been the first thing that the Government would have observed. If one wants a healthy, viable society in the future, one must look forward to the next generation, to the young people now going through their education and entering the work force. One must look forward to the stage when they marry and establish a home and a family. These are the areas of the Government's most conspicuous neglect. It has not really given any planning to this area. If it had, it might at least tell us about it. If it has, one would hope to see some evidence of the results. The results are catastrophic and they are very serious for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate the point; it is an important one. Unless we look at the future, in terms of the people who will inhabit, and occupy this land in the future and inherit this country from us, we are really creating a disaster which will go beyond our generation and have tragic effects on the next one. Of course that is already happening by twisting the imagination, drive and energy of young people. They fear that they will not find employment that will be acceptable, reasonable and suitable to their capabilities. They have a general feeling of hopelessness about doing anything at all. I have friends who teach at secondary schools and they are appalled at the extent to which young people are becoming unmotivated because they are not sure what they want to do. They do not know whether any opening is ahead for them. They can no longer say: 'I would like to be a teacher . I would like to be an architect. I would like to be an engineer' and have any reasonable hope that those occupations will provide them with a living even if they do go through the lengthy and difficult task of getting the necessary education. If a country cannot lay a guideline ahead at least for its ambitious and most intelligent individuals, it has failed dismally. That is the first area we would like to see examined. </PARA>
<PARA> Employment levels in Australia will, according to the West German manufacturing expert, Dr Hans Warneke, continue to fall. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> The drop in employment levels was inevitable with the change to high technology methods of production. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion was originally moved over three years ago, at the time when I think this should have been a matter for consideration. The matter was never brought up-this is what sometimes happens to General Business-in the last Parliament. I renewed it in this Parliament and it has taken nearly four years even to get this matter to the point of consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is something in what the honourable senator is saying. It will probably take another 10 years even to get the matter seriously discussed. But let us return to the facts. There are three main ways in which, according to authorities such as Dr Warneke, jobs can be lost. The first is through the introduction of robotics. Robots already do many skilled repetitive jobs, which I will mention a little later. They are in genuine competition with people. That should not be so. A situation should exist in which they could be assimilated into the work place and into the industrial process so that they are the ally of human beings, so that they do things for people, so they make it no longer necessary for people to do the boring, dull, repetitive jobs. Robots should not induce some neo-Luddite response that these things should not go ahead or be destroyed so that people can have the jobs. It should be possible for the benefits of these things to go to the community generally. That is why we have mentioned point (b) on the notice of motion which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The flow-on of money to the community at large as a result of such automation, and other structural changes desirable in the society . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we cannot accept a situation in which an industrialist says: ' This is great. I can get robots, I can get automation; I can cut my workforce by a quarter and I can make a lot more money'. We cannot have that situation. We must have a situation in which this type of automation and robotism, which is as I say basically a good thing, is acceptable in the community. It will be acceptable to the community only if it sees that there is a flow on to it of its values. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How about a robot in the honourable senator's house to do the dishes? I am sure his wife would like that. That development is not beyond the bounds of possibility. This matter is being looked at now quite seriously. The other day I was reading an article about a house robot which cleans the floors and does the dishes but I do not think it irons shirts yet. However, it is capable of modesty. This is an interesting and exciting prospect for the future. It is very disappointing to find the neo-Luddite aspect is being compelled into the debate because of the refusal of the Fraser Government to do anything about this problem or to make any attempt at all to cope with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second area of job loss will come from the electro-mechanical components to integrated circuitry and multi-wire assembly pieces to silicon chip-based products. The third area is in the office where the word processor is only the beginning of the refinements made possible by the new people-replacing technology. Another area in which jobs can be lost-I have had some discussions recently with some friends of mine in the retail trade-is the automated shop. Already the first of these are being planned in Australia. A person can go to a supermarket, do his shopping, go from end to end and pay his bill without a human being being involved in that process. When that happens we will have another huge area of employment which will disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that we must change our thinking and say that this is another convenience to society. We have to look at definitions of work, and things of that kind, and see that this is a thing of value to the community and not to be cursed by people as something that takes people's jobs away. I think that, until we reach that point of view, we will have increasing industrial trouble, increasing enconomic trouble, increasing disillusionment, disappointment and unhappiness in our community, especially among our young people because they are being presented the unattractive evil aspect of this automation that it is something that takes the bread out of their mouths. It is something which indeed should be making our lives easier and better. Until we grasp the nettle and do something with it, government-whichever one it may be-is in for a very rough time, and rightly so. </PARA>
<PARA> Already taking place in Australia are signs that the demand for unskilled labour-of course this is where the blow falls first-are dropping steadily. Between 1947 and 1977 employment in the blue collar category declined by 10 per cent from 42 per cent to 32 per cent of the work force. That is a lot of people. In the same period, the category of professional, technical and related occupations more than doubled from 5 per cent of the work force to 13 per cent of the work force. That is a healthy tendency because that is the way that we have got to go. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some specific overseas examples. It is estimated that by 1990 about 40 per cent of Siemens' office work could be carried out by computerised equipment, centred in automatic writing machines linked to data transmission systems. German trade unions have calculated that this means a threat to the jobs of two million of Germany's five million secretaries and typists. I do not think Australia's secretaries and typists would be any different. I think that we can accept that figure as one that we can consider here as well. We should take it into account. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1972, production in Hitachi colour television plants rose by 25 per cent but the work force dropped from just over 9,000 to a little over 4,000. This corresponded with the 25 per cent increase in production between 1972 and 1976. I do not have more recent figures than that. Three of Volkswagen's robots working on car panels and spot welding can be reprogrammed and can replace 10 men on a two-shift system. One could go on increasingly with that kind of example. They are certainly common enough. The Federal Government unfortunately takes the view that while technological change will result in increased unemployment in some areas, it will create jobs in others and that it will have a positive net effect upon total employment. The Australian Democrats agree that this could be possible. But the Commonwealth Government does not tell us how it will do this or why it will happen. As a result it gets very little applause or hearing from us or from the community on the matter. I suggest that if it wants that to happen then it will have to do some of the things that I suggested earlier. It will have to take a completely different view of what is work and what is not and a whole new attitude towards the community and towards how production of necessary things, even luxuries, is carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> This view of the Department of the Treasury has been widely criticised. One could ask, for example, what would happen if companies import their new equipment into Australia thereby, of course, creating jobs overseas-this is happening-reduce production costs within Australia and take these principally in the form of higher profits and then remit these profits as higher dividends to overseas shareholders? This is the sort of economic effect that will happen in Australia. That has, in fact, been happening. Since the 1950s, despite massive increases in output, the proportion of the work force employed in manufacturing has declined in industrialised countries. Manufacturing and, indeed, service employment, as I mentioned earlier, are now seen as facing the major threat of the miniaturisation of computers and of automation. </PARA>
<PARA> The major advances in miniaturisation, which dramatically reduced the cost of integrated computer circuits and exponentially increased their capacity, have only been made in the last 10 to 15 years. The real effect of this is yet to come. The effect of silicon chips began to be felt during the 1970s and, of course, is definitely an ingredient in the fallen productivity in employment that we have seen already. But the real magnitude of unemployment problems from this is not expected to materialise until, perhaps, towards the end of this decade and the beginning of the next. If we are going to stop that enormous increase in unemployment at that time we have to be planning and legislating for it right now, not then. It is too late then. </PARA>

Is it rational or reasonable that we should, say, take a young person who has the ability to play the piano well or to play cricket well or to be a painter or to be a writer and say that that will be his occupation?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not necessarily. If we could harness the computer revolution we would not necessarily have to do that. If we can make it work for us these machines should bring us greatly enhanced wealth. It has to be done through some sort of planning. It is all very well for me to say those sorts of things, but not good enough, I suggest. We need the kind of community consensus and consideration of this issue which, after all, is one of the biggest issues facing this community and every other one. How absurd can we be? We talk about all sorts of things in this place from day to day and week to week and year to year, yet we do not do anything about the really important things such as this. That is all we are asking-not that any ideas of the Australian Democrats should be forced down people's throats, far from it; but that there should be an attempt to get a consensus from the community on what should happen and what our view of the work ethic should be and things of that sort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a need also to investigate further options available to redistribute the benefits of society at the moment. The Government is approaching this in some ways and, I agree, not without some problems. There should be an option, I think, that if people wish to retire earlier, on a voluntary basis, they should be able to. That is something that the Government might take on as a major policy. It goes back to the very human view that if a person wants to go fishing rather than continue in his job, why compel him to sit on in that job until he is 60 or 65? He will not be particularly productive during that time. He will be thinking about his fishing boat and what he will be doing in five years' time. Why not let him have the opportunity to retire early on reasonable terms, let him go fishing and let a younger man or woman get into that job and do it? That is a palliative. I agree that that is not a long term answer, but it is a good one that would help the problem, I suggest, now. </PARA>
<PARA> Another one to consider would be continued job sharing, where couples want to share jobs-in some private schools, for instance. I know of one case in Adelaide of a gifted young couple who are both graduates, who are both school teachers and who have a family. They, in fact, share the job. It is one teaching job and it is done between them. That provides them with all the income they need. They do have some other assets. That is the sort of concept which I think would be of great benefit and which would allow people to work who are not now able to work. I think it is very important that they should; not just because it is necessary or desirable or because of the protestant work ethic, but because it is good and valuable for as many people as possible to have some input into the creative processes of the nation. Therefore those options should be available to people. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I think we should legislate, as much as possible, for permanent part time employment. I think there are many cases. I have again spoken to lots of young married women with children, who work in factories. I have talked to the people who employ them. They have all said: 'We cannot keep these girls here. They are good but after a few weeks or months on the job they say their husbands do not like it.' The women are working a 40-hour week and they cannot look after their homes and families properly. The employer said: 'We lose them'. I said: ' You would agree, too, would you, that they should be given permanent part time work'. He said: 'Yes, if only we could get someone to get off his butt and get it organised. They would be much happier working two or three days a week. Then we could employ other people who are also looking for money and work'. The Australian Democrats suggest that that is another aspect that could be considered by this committee. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not want in any way to limit the objectives of the committee of inquiry but in conclusion I make a few suggestions. We think that there are areas of possible objectives that might be looked at. The first would be moving resources from declining to expanding industries. I think that is something which is not really being done or assisted by the process of government. We know that some industries are declining and some are expanding, but it is being left pretty much to the ad hoc roughness of the work place on the competitive market. It should be possible to assist this process rationally and constructively. Why should we not do that? We should be discouraging production in industries in which other countries are gaining competitive advantage. We should be removing the barriers to the expansion of exports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he is listening. I am glad to see Senator Martyr doing that. He is going to take all of these ideas to the National Country Party and Liberal Party room sometime. He will be right. I have great confidence in Senator Martyr . He is a man of intelligence and integrity and considerable brain power. He probably knows much more about this subject than I do. I go back to the list of objectives. I think we should adopt policies which will not hinder, but rather facilitate the movement of resources from stagnant to dynamic industries. That is, I know, saying a lot. But there are two very radical points of view and two very different points of view on it. Again, it is necessary for there to be some sort of consensus rather than a whole set of wets, drys and damps at cross purposes all the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another suggestion is that we should adopt policies to ensure that the cost of adaptation is not borne by the people who are required to adjust but rather is shared by society. I think that is most important. It is not good enough that we say to people: 'You are the ones who will be wiped out of the work force. You are the ones who will be re-located. You will have to carry the can for this. We know it is not your fault but it is an unfair world, after all.' I suppose that there is a certain justification for that point of view. But we should not be surprised if when we do that, we get unhappy, maladjusted and unmotivated people . I have made a suggestion about what we have to do. I would have thought that the principal task of government should be to see that its people are happy, motivated and productive. To the extent that a government ignores that aim it is a failure. We regard that as a very important human characteristic. We believe that we should be adopting policies to encourage firms to be innovative and invest in research and development. Yet, this year, as I understand it-I have not looked this up myself; my friend, Senator Macklin, assures me of it-the Government is reducing the amount of money that is available for this kind of innovative research. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then, of course, we can look at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other organisations. I drew attention to the CSIRO's annual report the other day in which we were told that we had virtually stopped any kind of research into solar energy and wind power although these are viable technologies which are doing extremely well in every other part of the world where wind generators are now operating and have been operating for some years, in the megawatt range. I think that only a half or a quarter of the working hours of a person is devoted to this important research. The Government says that it will encourage innovation but it does not encourage innovation at all. It encourages quite the reverse. By reducing grants to universities and so on the Government is forcing people who might become involved in speculative, bold and innovative research to go back to simple, safe programs in which they can apparently show results but which do not achieve very much. To the extent that we cut back research grants, we cut back the value per dollar that we get from that research. I think this is a lesson that the Government has not yet learnt. I think it probably will learn that over the next few years. The Government should ensure that there are effective arrangements for consultation between the parties involved and affected. If the Australian Democrats are about anything, we are about that-this need for consultation, this tremendous need for the community to be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not propose to mention every matter in this speech. I have been through them. I think the points that I have made would be the ones that I would like to leave in the minds of honourable senators at this time. I commend the motion to the Senate. I hope that it will be discussed by other honourable senators and that this matter is not something about which, having been on the Notice Paper for nearly four years, everybody breathes a sigh of relief and says that, like road accidents and a few other things such as that, this matter is too hard to consider, that we should put it away in the too hard drawer. We can say that things were said that are probably true and that maybe we should be doing something about it. But it is much easier to discuss important things like whether we present petitions ourselves-I know that I have spoken on that subject ; all those safe, comfortable little things-than to put this big dramatic, dangerous and challenging issue away in the drawer and forget it. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate calls for-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a review by the Administrative Review Council of all aspects of the administrative advice tendered to the Ministers for Veterans' Affairs, Defence and Health on the use of Agent Orange and other defoliants in Vietnam;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a clear and unequivocal assurance from the Government that servicemen thus affected will be fully compensated and that this compensation will include their wives and children; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) an independent judicial inquiry which shall ascertain-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the extent and range of disabilities incurred by Vietnam veterans and their dependants; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the effects of the continued use of these defoliants within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Notice of Motion No. 8 has been on the Notice Paper since August 1981 and had previously been on the Notice Paper and partially debated. We left it on the Notice Paper. I certainly do not apologise for raising the matter again as the problems facing Vietnam veterans, particularly as far as their fears about defoliants are concerned, remain as they did before. As a result of pressure from these veterans and Opposition members we have had some concessions from the Government. There is at least a recognition that these veterans have special problems in that counselling services have been established; an adequate epidemiological survey has been started. It has been much modified since it was commenced and the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment is having a look at the problems of defoliants as they affected those who served in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> All these concessions, however reluctantly granted, have been a recognition of the special problems. But we continue to believe that there is the need for an independent and a judicial inquiry so that justice is seen to be done for these people who served their country, as they saw it, in difficult times. Because the war was unique in that the community was divided in its attitude to our involvement there are even greater reasons to make sure that we look after these people properly. It is ironical that those who were so keen to send people off to this war are apparently those who are the most reluctant to have the results of our involvement in that war looked into. I believe this inhibition to look at the circumstances of our involvement also spills over into our reluctance to look closely at the effects of that involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> The men who fought were clearly not told the truth about the nature and the circumstances of our involvement. There is even more reason, therefore, to ensure that the truth of the results of their involvement is known so that the community can do the right thing by them. It is worth remembering, I believe, in the controversy about the alleged politicisation of Anzac Day, that it was Vietnam veterans who first used this day as a form of protest in 1980 by wearing pieces of orange ribbon with their decorations to show their disgust at the inaction of the Government and, at the time, the inaction of the Returned Services League to their problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will remember-I feel there is no need to go into the details-that defoliants, particularly 2,4,5-T and its dangerous contaminant, dioxin, were used in Vietnam to defoliate forests, to clear lines of fire, to make concealment harder, to destroy crops, to deprive insurgents of food and-let it not be forgotten-to force peasants into the strategic hamlets which were set up by the allies of the South Vietnamese army. The dangers of the use of these substances were well known. Since the 1940s when 2,4,5-T was, in fact, developed as a biological weapon in the United States of America there has been a long series of accidents-some 25 at my last count-involving the production and the use of these substances in many countries in Europe-including a large accident, in Lombardy, Italy-and throughout the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> The dangers of these substances involved in the use were known and subject to protracted litigation in the courts of the United States where large companies producing them used delaying, legalistic tactics to prevent and to delay hearings and to avoid paying the damages which ultimately many of them had to pay. They went through all sorts of courts including the environmental courts. There was this continuous story of delay and difficulties in getting justice. The United States National Academy of Sciences and many responsible scientists in the early days of the use of these substances in Vietnam warned of the dangers of their use in warfare and particularly the indiscriminate and widespread manner in which they were used in Indo-China. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects on the foetus when a pregnant woman is exposed are well known. Recent work in Vietnam has added a disturbing aspect to this feature of the known toxicity of these substances. The skin disorder, chlor-acne and various neurological and gastrointestinal disorders, are known to be associated with exposure but there are repeated claims of neurological and psychiatric disorders which need further documentation but which many eminent people believe are associated with exposure to these defoliants. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy of the position of the Vietnam veterans is that they had to fight so long to get recognition of the possibility that they had special problems and , in particular, that they had special problems dealing with their exposure to these defoliants. The Government for a short time at one stage, through the Minister for Defence in another place, Mr Killen, even denied that the Australians had, in fact, used or been exposed to defoliants in Vietnam. They faced an attitude of scepticism not only from the Department but also for a time from veterans' organisations. Altogether they had an extremely frustrating time in getting their case before the public, and for that matter before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It was this reluctance to listen to their claims, the evasions by government spokesmen and the scepticism of those who could not face the fact that not only our involvement in that war was misguided but also our methods were questionable which has left the legacy of bitterness and reluctance to trust authority which, I suggest, can be overcome only by an independent inquiry and a judicial one at that. Such an inquiry, in fact, could assess with scientific assistance the mass of evidence which has been accumulated over the years from many sources both military and civil. It could point directions for future inquiries and could look at the claims of so many veterans and their families. The incidences of unexplained disorders-various mental and psychiatric disorders-and the disturbing level of suicide and associated illness amongst Vietnam veterans on the face of it are much higher than they are in the rest of the community, and that disturbs us. Certainly we can get some idea of these incidences from an epidemiological study, but we need a much broader inquiry to look at the justice of veterans' claims. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many veterans of the Vietnam War who need reassurances that their wives and children face a secure future, that, if they do have problems, they will be cared for and that the community cares about them. Above all they want to know whether their problems are, in fact, linked to the use of defoliants and also why such substances were used in the manner in which they were used against evidence which was available at the time. They want to know how this situation arose, why there was such a prolonged attempt to avoid admitting that defoliants were used, that there were any problems and how Ministers and others came wittingly or unwittingly to mislead this Parliament and the public. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the basic outline of the reasons why I have moved this motion on several occasions. I have spoken to it on many occasions, as have other people, and I see no need to expand on it any more than I have. But I believe that we need to give these veterans the chance to know just what is going on and to be certain of where they will be in the future. I think this can be done only through an independent inquiry. In fact, that is why I persist with my motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to answer a few points raised by Senator Grimes, particularly those which seem to be somewhat out of the time frame of this situation. I think Senator Grimes would acknowledge that a great deal of the bitterness that may have existed at some stage or another in regard to this matter has, in fact, dissipated in recent times due to an acceptance by veterans of the actions of the Government in relation to the provision of care and, particularly as Senator Grimes mentioned during his speech, the provision of counselling services throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge that at this point of time we are only midway through our program of establishing these centres throughout Australia but, indeed, the success which those centres have been established are having amongst the veteran community is an object lesson in the kinds of developments which I think the Department of Veterans' Affairs would be looking to for the future in terms of dealing with all veterans. It is significant that the acceptance rate in the counselling centres has been quite substantial in recent times. At the moment we see a continuing use of those facilities. We hope that, when the new ones are opened in Darwin, Brisbane, Melbourne and Hobart, the same experience will occur . </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose I should acknowledge, firstly, that we do not expect that a great number will come forward. We are hopeful that, whatever disabilities people have , they are finding care and assistance through the normal facilities offered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Certainly there is the intention in the counselling centres to encourage people to come into the Department's framework so as to bring their experiences to the knowledge of the Department and lodge their claims for compensation and benefits in the normal way, as do any other veterans. As the system develops we will get a better appreciation of the problems of Vietnam veterans and be able to assist to an even greater extent, hopefully, because we will know more than we know at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the people who are staffing the centres are keen. They are certainly skilful in and well qualified for the work they are doing. Consequently I think there will be a great deal of success in their operations. I make the point again that the bitterness which Senator Grimes characterised during his speech I think has very largely dissipated. I could always appreciate that there will be individual problems and we will do our best to deal with those as and when they become evident in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> As to Senator Grimes's reasons for the need for the establishment of a judicial inquiry, I would like to make one or two points concerning that. Firstly, as he would acknowledge, a Senate committee of inquiry is being conducted at present by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment into the effects of exposure to herbicides in Vietnam and, indeed, into the much broader question of exposure to herbicides in the general Australian community. That offers a very good forum, being all-party, representative of Liberal Party members, the Australian Labor Party and, of course, the Australian Democrats, to ensure that there is a considerable amount of input from all sides of the Parliament into any decision that that Committee might make. the Committee offers opportunities to Vietnam veterans, to medical personnel and to persons who have a general interest in the whole area of herbicide exposure to have an input into the deliberations. I believe that has happened to a very significant degree. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the comments that have come to me, particularly from Vietnam veterans, are that they are very happy with the way in which the inquiry has been conducted and they look forward with a great deal of interest and pleasure to its outcome. Given that that is the ongoing situation and that the inquiry is being conducted, it seems to me to be quite untimely to seek a judicial inquiry while that process is going forward. For that reason, amongst others which I will come to in a moment, the Government opposes the establishment of a judicial inquiry. Senator Grimes alluded to the matter of whether broader questions to do with the reasons for the Vietnam war and would be exposed by a judicial inquiry. That seems to me to be irrelevant to the issue. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may have misunderstood what the honourable senator was saying but I thought that he was alluding to that point. Suffice it to say that certainly any decision which a juducial inquiry might make in relation to the question of exposure to herbicides would rely in the final analysis on scientific information. The collection of the scientific information has been an extraordinarly difficult task. It is one which the Government has undertaken with vigour in many ways in order to try to get solutions to the scientific questions that have been posed by veterans and by medical personnel advising them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For that reason, as Senator Grimes acknowledged, the Government established a major epidemological study to examine the problems. That study has since been modified and three other studies have been developed which focus on the particular difficulties of veterans. The first study relates to the question of birth defects, the second to the reasons for the death of veterans since they returned from the war and the third to specific illness problems of Vietnam veterans. Those studies are expected to yield results in a time frame much more compatible with what we might expect and wish than would the major epidemiological study which was going forward until February of this year. I think those facts demonstrate the Government's concern to obtain scientific answers so that we can establish the position clearly in the eyes of the people generally and, of course, in the eyes of veterans and so that the Department of Veterans' Affairs or any other Government department can take into account the evidence that comes before it. For that reason again the Government opposes a judicial inquiry. It believes that the scientific questions have to be answered and it is those questions which the Government is seeking to answer in as expeditious a manner as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes made the point that some of the substances that were used in Vietnam are toxic. That has never been an issue of any great doubt. The fact is that some substances-for example agent orange with its dioxin content-are known to be toxic. That is not the essential point. The question is the degree to which individual soldiers were exposed to herbicides of various kinds. That is the question which needs to be answered and at this point, as I pointed out earlier in terms of scientific studies, is an extraordinarily difficult question to find answers to. It is on the basis of the difficulty of getting scientific evidence that we believe that the studies now taking place will suitably yield the kinds of results we need. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to comment on one or two other matters relating to the motion. The first is that in paragraph (a) of the motion there is a reference to the Administrative Review Council. I think Senator Grimes was seeking an inquiry by that Council into all aspects of the administrative advice tendered to the Ministers who have had carriage of this problem. Clearly, that is outside the ambit of that Council. That body is not empowered by its enabling legislation to take that kind of action. It seems to be more appropriate for the Ombudsman to address himself to that kind of question. For that reason, the Government rejects that part of the motion. Paragraph (b) seeks to clear and unequivocal assurance from the Government that servicemen will be compensated. It is the object of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to provide compensation where there is an established cause of illness or incapacity on the part of the returned soldier which is attributable to war service. That, accordingly, is something which is being tested every day through the operations of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I again invite Vietnam veteran to come forward and present their claims so that they can be tested through the determination process of the Department. For all those reasons, the Government rejects the motion and will be opposing it. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) congratulates the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Mr John Bannon, M.P., for his special November issue of Opposition Report, which gives a comprehensive rundown on the many problems that have beset South Australia since the election of the Tonkin Liberal Government in 1979;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) recommends that every South Australian citizen obtain a copy of the Report from Parliament House, Adelaide; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) express concern that the Tonkin Government is closely following in the footsteps of the Fraser Government by its failure to honour election promises.</PARA>
<PARA>Since I gave notice of that motion in the Senate on 18 November 1981, things have not got better in South Australia. They have got much worse. With regard to paragraph (b) of my motion and in view of the fact that I gave notice of that motion there has been an extraordinary run on that special issue of Opposition Report. Many thousands of South Australians have read it. Having read it, they are now clamouring for an early election in South Australia because they realise how bad things are in that State. In a speech which I made in the Senate in 1979 after I came back from an Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference, I warned people that after several years of the Tonkin Government the people who voted for him would be having second thoughts and clamouring for an election. That is just what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote from Opposition Report because that is the subject of debate at present. It was put out by Mr John Bannon who, as soon as an election is held in South Australia, will be its new Premier. People are waiting with bated breath for Mr Tonkin to announce the election date so that we can get on with running the State in a proper manner, the way it was run under the Dunstan Government for so many years and for a few months by Mr Corcoran. The special issue carries the headline:</PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian economy after two years of Liberal Government</PARA>
<PARA>The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tonkin Government has now had two full years of office, and the opportunity through the presentation of three State Budgets, to fulfil the promises it made during the election in September 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> This special issue of Opposition Report concentrates on the economic performance of South Australia over those two years. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that it is now appropriate to look at the changes in key indicators over the two year period, and to compare those changes with developments at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition Report has always argued that our regional economy in South Australia cannot be separated from the national economic scene, but it is relevant to assess the degree to which we are falling behind national trends. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 2 a table under the heading 'Table 1' compares what happened in South Australia and Australia in 1981 and 1979 when South Australia was under the jurisdiction of a Labor government. In September 1979, Australia's population increased by 2.7 per cent, but in South Australia in June 1981, after 18 months of Tonkin Government, the population was decreasing. People were flooding out of the State. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not on the up. I hope the honourable senator has figures to prove what he says. In September 1979, there was an increase of 5.3 per cent in Australia's labour force. In South Australia in September 1981, after 18 months of Tonkin's jurisdiction, there was an increase of only 2.4 per cent. There was a decrease in the labour force of South Australia. The latest figures which I will cite at the end of my speech prove that the situation is getting worse. South Australia has the highest unemployment rate of any mainland State. That has been a continuing process since Mr Tonkin was elected. In September 1979, employment in Australia was increasing at a rate of 5.7 per cent. Now, under Tonkin, employment in South Australia is increasing at a rate of only 2.3 per cent. In September 1979, there was a decrease of 1.4 per cent in total unemployment in Australia and in September 1981 there was an increase of 3.9 per cent in South Australia. In August 1979 there was an increase of 5.2 per cent in job vacancies in Australia. In August 1981 in South Australia there was a decrease of 59.1 per cent. I point out that these figures were subject to a large statistical sampling error. They come from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. So, they have not been plucked out of the air by Mr Bannon. To save the time of the Senate, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the second page of the report which sets out some more ABS figures.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. On page 3 of the document, under the heading 'Economic and Demographic Indicators', Mr Bannon stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Changes in key indicators at the national level and in South Australia over the two years since the election of the Tonkin Government in 1979, are summarised in Table 1. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the table which I have incorporated. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA> According to every one of the indicators listed, South Australia's performance during the period of the Tonkin administration has been worse than the performance of Australia as a whole and in some important cases, against the national trend. </PARA>
<PARA> The total number of unemployed persons in Australia has declined over the past two years while unemployment has increased in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> For Australia, the number of new vacancies has increased while there has been a decrease in this State. </PARA>
<PARA> Registrations of new motor vehicles have grown throughout Australia while registrations in this State are below 1979 levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Building approvals for new dwellings have expanded at the national level but in South Australia there has been a slump of major proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> Table II summarises those South Australian indicators which have moved against the national trend. </PARA>
<PARA>In September 1979, just before the Labor Government went out of office, there were 45,900 people without jobs in South Australia. In the same period in 1981 there were 47,700 people out of work. To help the candidate in Todd at the time Senator Messner put out a Press statement about how Mr Tonkin was going to create 7,000 jobs overnight. Instead of creating that massive number of jobs, there has been a decrease of about 2,000. These are the ABS figures, so I am not using fictitious figures. In August 1979 there were 2,200 job vacancies; they dropped to 900 in 1981. They were provisional figures and subject to statistical sampling error, according to the ABS. For the three months to September 1979 registrations of new motor vehicles were 12,323 and for the same period in 1981 they dropped to 11,177. Again they were provisional figures. For the three months to September 1979 building approvals for new dwellings were 2,817; in 1981 they had dropped to 2,011. That was a massive drop of 600 approvals for new dwellings in the spate of two years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take note of your reprimand, Mr Deputy President. I now go on to the heading 'Population' and to a summary of the figures that I was citing. The document continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the life of the Tonkin Government, South Australia's population has grown at less than one half of the national rate. </PARA>
<PARA> If this State's population continues to grow at the current slow rate, it will be overtaken by Western Australia during 1982. This would be the first change in the order of State populations for many decades, and would make South Australia the least populous State on the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA>This document was compiled and produced in November of last year. The latest population figures show that we are very close to falling behind Western Australia. I would say that Mr Tonkin, whose counterpart in Western Australia is also a Liberal, will not be very happy about that after all the boasting he did during the 1979 election campaign about how he was going to attract industry and people to the State and provide jobs when in fact the reverse has happened, as I have proved by some of the figures I have cited. As I say, they are not my figures; they are figures compiled by the ABS. That is the institution that this Government relies upon. It did away with the Commonwealth Employment Service figures, particularly for unemployment, because they were giving us a clearer record of the number of people unemployed in Australia than did the ABS figures. That is something which we have debated in this chamber on many occasions. The ABS arrives at its figures by a sample, whereas the CES figures for unemployment are actual fact. The Government cannot deny that ABS figures that we cite are correct because that is the institution that it prefers to the Commonwealth Employment Service. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA> A major determinant of this State's low population growth has been the large net movement of persons from South Australia to other States. In the first 21 months of the Tonkin Government, the net loss to other States was in excess of 11,800 persons. </PARA>
<PARA>In the first two years of the Tonkin Government 11,800 people left South Australia for other States. That figure represents more than the populations of the cities of Port Lincoln and Murray Bridge. I think everybody knows that I live in Murray Bridge, and I am well aware of the population there. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> It appears that the greatest rates of population loss are occurring in the younger adult age groups, suggesting that a lack of employment opportunities is a key factor causing the exodus. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on in the document under the heading 'Labour Market' we find the following:</PARA>
<PARA> In analysing labour market trends it is first important to examine changes in the labour force, the labour force being that part of the adult population which either is working or is available for work. </PARA>
<PARA> Since September 1979, the Australian labour force has expanded by 5.3 per cent while in South Australia there has been an increase of only 2.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading of 'Employment' in the document we are debating, the following is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as the Australian labour force has increased by 5.3 per cent, employment throughout the nation has grown slightly faster, at 5.7 per cent. The combined effect of these two movements has been to reduce the total number of unemployed persons in Australia by 1.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> South Australia has not fared so well, however. While the labour force has grown by 2.4 per cent, total employment has increased at a lower rate, 2.3 per cent. The result has been a 3.9 per cent rise in the total number of unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>That has happened under a Liberal Government which promised through both Mr Tonkin and Senator Messner that it was going to create 7,000 jobs practically overnight if it assumed government in South Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have copies of the Press release which Senator Messner put out. I debated it here one day; the Minister could not deny it. I do not have it with me but I have it in my office. Employment growth in each State from September 1979 to September 1981 has been as follows: New South Wales 5.9 per cent; Victoria 4.5 per cent; Queensland 8.7 per cent; South Australia 2.3 per cent; Western Australia 5.5 per cent; and Tasmania 2.4 per cent. At the time I moved this motion even Tasmania, which is in some problems now, had a greater growth in employment than South Australia. It was 0.1 per cent greater. Yet we find now that the same trend in unemployment is appearing in all documents we can look at. South Australia still has the highest rate of unemployment of any State on the mainland. The document further states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that not only has this State had below average employment growth, but growth here has been the lowest in any State. </PARA>
<PARA> It is surprising that Mr Tonkin continues to claim employment growth as one of the achievements of his Government. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a graph in this document, which would be difficult to incorporate in Hansard, which shows that in June 1981 the unemployment figures in South Australia were the highest for decades. Of course the Tonkin Liberal Government is in office there. Inflation is mentioned in the same document. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> There was an increase of 20.8 per cent in the Consumer Price Index for Adelaide from the September Quarter 1979 to the same quarter of 1981. The local increase exceeded the average 20.2 per cent increase for the six State capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is surprising that Adelaide should have above average inflation when it is considered that South Australia has the worst unemployment rate. It would have been expected that high unemployment rates would reflect an economy in recession and therefore with reduced cost pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> Residents of Adelaide are experiencing the worst of both worlds. Not only do they face the worst jobless rate in the nation but they are experiencing above average increases in prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Consumer Price Index for the September Quarter of 1981 gives some insights into why prices are rising faster in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> In this latest Quarter, increased State taxes and charges made a significant contribution to inflation. Of the increase of 6.7 points in the Consumer Price Index, 1.6 points were contributed by fuel and light charges, public transport fares, and cigarette and tobacco prices. </PARA>
<PARA>I pause to say that since this document was compiled electricity charges have nearly doubled in South Australia and tram and bus fares have gone up at an enormous rate. This Government is using the costs of these commodities to the general public as taxing revenue to offset the money it gave away to its wealthy supporters when it abolished succession duties and gift tax. Mr Tonkin has really been caught out on that. </PARA>

Fortunately, Mr Bannon was there and was given the opportunity to reply. He nailed Mr Tonkin's lie to the wall and reminded him that he had stated in the Parliament some months previously that we would not do that. However, if Mr Bannon and I had not been there they would have got away with that.

I will leave that matter for now in case the other motion of which I gave notice happens to come on for debate later tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next matter I wish to raise is this: How did Mr Tonkin get into government? He got into government because South Australian businesses spent $100,000 on an anti-Labor campaign. I have stated this in the Parliament before. The Liberal Party falsely stated in its advertisements that the building industry in South Australia was on the decline under Labor. In fact, I was able to use the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures again to prove that from March 1979 until the election there was an upturn in the building industry in South Australia. Unfortunately for the building industry there is again a massive downturn. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to quote the latest unemployment figures available to us. If we look at the ABS document, catalogue No. 62010 issued at noon, 8 April, we find that the revised February figures for 1982 showed an unemployment rate in South Australia of 8.6 per cent and the provisional figures for March as 7.8 per cent, a small drop but still 0.3 per cent above the March figures for 1981. So there is no improvement in the unemployment figures. We can refer to that column of figures for every State and see that South Australia is far ahead of the other States. That gives the lie to what Mr Tonkin is saying about creating more employment for the unemployed in South Australia. The latest document we have is dated noon, 28 April-yesterday. We see that in South Australia 7.9 per cent of employable people are looking for full time work. There has been a 0.1 per cent increase since the figures were issued at the beginning of the month. At the end of the month the figure stands at 7.9 per cent. If we refer to all the other mainland States, we will see that New South Wales has an unemployment rate of 6 per cent. </PARA>

The figures for this period next year will be down under the Cain Labor Government which will bring about an improvement. Queensland has the lowest, 5.9 per cent. South Australia is 2.7 per cent higher, at 7.9 per cent, Western Australia 7.4 per cent, Tasmania 9.3 per cent, Northern Territory 6.9 per cent and the Australian Capital Territory 6.8 per cent. Apart from Tasmania, South Australia has the highest rate of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I pointed out before, it has the highest rate of unemployment of any State on the mainland. This is something we in South Australia have to be very concerned about. We will be faced with a desperate problem when we get back into office in South Australia because whilst the projected Budget deficit for this year will be in the vicinity of about $80m. That figure would look much worse if in fact Mr Tonkin had not been selling off the State's assets. He is selling off all the equipment from the Engineering and Water Supply Department, from the Department of Lands and from the Highways Department. He is selling off the land and selling off Monarto. Anything he can get a dollar for he is selling off. That money is going into general revenue and he says that he is running the State all right. But of course anyone can run the State if its assets are sold off. If one is hungry at home and one cannot feed the kids should one sell the house and have some money to buy food? But as soon as that food has been eaten one will not have a roof over one's head. That is the situation with which we are faced in South Australia because of Mr Tonkin's bad management in selling off the assets of the State. Next year, or perhaps later this year, when we can have an election and we get back into government we will be faced with the enormous financial problem of trying to put the State back on the rails. I commend my motion to the Senate. I hope that it is carried. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, you may not be aware, but Senator McLaren would be, of the somewhat affectionate nicknames for the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in South Australia-that of 'doom' and 'gloom'. That is the attitude which has been expressed in the Opposition Report dealing with economic indicators. Senator McLaren told us that it has been a very popular report. When I inquired of the Parliamentary Library today for a copy of that report the Library staff unfortunately had never heard of it. It must have been a very popular report elsewhere. That attitude of doom, gloom and pessimism is reflected also in the speech Senator McLaren made today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> South Australia had 10 years of a Labor government telling it what it could not do. We have heard time and again this sort of statement: 'We are too far from markets. There are too few people. Our manufacturing industries have no future', and so on. The objective of those statements was to downgrade people's expectations. It is infectious; it can work. People tend to look inwards. They tend to believe it. This is the same recipe that Senator McLaren used today. It is a negative recipe. But I have news for Senator McLaren. The news is that 2 1/ 2 years ago South Australia rejected that approach. It recognised that that had not been the case under the Playford Liberal Government. Under that Government, South Australia experienced a time of growth and prosperity. It again elected a Liberal Government bent on giving South Australia a fighting chance, bent on rebuilding it into the great State that it formerly was. I have a second piece of news for Senator McLaren. It is working. It is not coming easy but it is working. South Australia now has an imaginative and determined government led by David Tonkin. It is making progress. That is why we have this motion before us today. The Australian Labor Party cannot cope with that progress. It wants to get back to the old days of gloom and doom. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the opportunity to tell the Senate exactly what is being achieved in South Australia and what is happening today. My only regret is that the debate which is taking place today could not have taken place yesterday when we would have had an opportunity to express to a much larger audience the achievements of the Tonkin Government. When I have told the Senate what has been achieved and is being achieved under the Tonkin Government we will then look again at the Opposition report about which Senator McLaren has spoken to see whether it is a balanced report, whether it is simply another aspect of the gloom and doom recipe of the past, or whether it is designed also to lower the aspirations and expectations of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The third part of Senator McLaren's motion referred to election promises. I think it is worth while to get that matter out of the way right at the beginning . I remind Senator McLaren that although the Tonkin Government has been in office only 2 1/2 years it has promised and it has delivered. It has abolished gift and death duties. It has abolished land tax on the family home which I would have thought Senator McLaren would applaud and it has rebated stamp duty for first home buyers for the first $30,000 of the purchase price. It is interesting that that approach of rebating stamp duty for first home buyers is now being promoted throughout Australia as a method whereby governments can assist first home buyers at a time of high interest rates. The Tonkin Government has provided special payroll tax incentives to assist youth employment. Senator McLaren will recall that promise. I presume that he will applaud the fact that it has been put into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been the result of these reductions in various areas of taxation? I wish to refer to the 1980 Commonwealth Grants Commission report on relativities, which is the most exhaustive analysis that has ever been made of State government finances in Australia. It showed that, in terms of State taxes including mining royalties, South Australia is now well on the way to becoming the low tax State of Australia. On the statistics of the Commonwealth Grants Commission each South Australian now pays $93 less than people in New South Wales; $87 less than Victorians; $47 less than Western Australians; $6 less than Queenslanders; and $12 more than Tasmanians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is its 1980 report. The Grants Commission analysis shows that when mineral royalties are taken into account South Australians now pay 20 per cent less State tax than the average Australian. I presume that that is something that Senator McLaren would wish to applaud. How then has the Tonkin Government been able to do this? It has done this firstly through savings. I refer to the extravagences of the Labor Government that have since been wound up . Senator McLaren will be aware of the selling of the frozen food factory to private enterprise. The Tonkin Government has cleared the Monarto debt with the Commonwealth and it is now recovering some of the millions of dollars that were squandered on that ill-conceived development by selling off Monarto land. He would be aware also that the Tonkin Government is paying off the massive Land Commission debt incurred by the Labor Government. It is now cutting its losses by selling developed allotments through private enterprise which is proving far more successful. I can give honourable senators another example. The restructuring of the ailing South Australian Meat Corporation has reduced its operating losses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By good, practical management South Australia is finding that it is now able to save a considerable amount of expenditure that was previously being lost by an inefficient Labor Government. The Tonkin Government has been able to reduce the size of government. It reduced the number of persons on the public payroll by more than 3,000 without sacking one government employee. The recipe for success is that is smaller government, lower taxes and encouragement to the private sector. It is working whereas the previous recipe for the Labor Government- higher taxes, large government, stifled incentive-was failing. I invite honourable senators to look at some of the achievements that are occurring to show that the recipe of the Tonkin Liberal Government in South Australia is succeeding. If we could look firstly at the subject of investment which is a readily accepted guideline for progress. In October 1979 projected investment in manufacturing and mining in South Australia stood at $300m. In December 1981 the figure for committed expenditure was $3,481m-an increase of more than 1,000 per cent since the Government came to office. Let us look at one small achievement in the manufacturing industry-a matter which I was able to raise during Question Time today and which I am sure Senator McLaren would be willing to applaud-and that is the advancement of Mitsubishi to sell cars manufactured in South Australia to the European market. That company has been fostered and promoted by the Tonkin Liberal Government and it is something of which all South Australians should be proud. What effect will this major future investment of committed money have on employment? It is said that it will produce an extra 3,000 jobs in South Australia. If that is correct that must be something which Senator McLaren would be prepared to applaud. Let us look at another of the major indices of progress of a government which is heading in the right direction-the question of resource development in South Australia. Commitments to mining exploration have trebled since the Tonkin Government came to office. South Australia is experiencing, as anyone who is familiar with the State would know, the most widespread and systematic search for minerals in its history. There has been a significant increase in the exploration for oil and gas in South Australia outside the Cooper Basin. We know of the tremendous future that the Cooper Basin has for South Australia and Australia a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Credit should also be given to the Tonkin Government for promoting this increased resource development in a way that will give maximum benefit to the State. I refer, for example, to the indenture legislation relating to the Stony Point fractionation plant. The royalties expected from that Cooper Basin development-the liquid down the pipeline-are estimated at $20m a year. Let us reflect briefly on that major development in the Cooper Basin, which is a $1 billion project. Subject to current union disputes, it should be on stream by early next year. What potential does that offer Stony Point and Whyalla? They will have not only the fractionation plant but also the potential for petrochemical works and the potential we have heard spoken about in the Senate for a small refinery. It affords the opportunity for tremendous advances and developments in the future in South Australia. The greatest potential project of them all is that of Roxby Downs. That copper, uranium, gold and rare earth mining venture will be, by all estimates, of major world proportions. I remind Senator McLaren that at the moment $0.75m a week is being spent in the development of the Roxby Downs project. It holds a tremendous future for South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly cite some figures on the change in the development of mining exploration in South Australia since the Tonkin Government came to office. On- shore mineral exploration licences have increased from 123 as at June 1979 to 369 as at June 1981. The number of companies involved in mineral exploration has doubled to 70 and 420,000 square kilometres were involved in exploration in the last financial year compared with 145,000 square kilometres in 1979. Expenditure for exploration in this area has risen from $7.2m in 1978 to $31.1m in 1980. I am able to refer to other indices that indicate the advancement and progress that South Australia is making. Senator McLaren mentioned job creation at some length in his address this afternoon. In the two years from 1977 to 1979, 20,600 jobs were lost from the South Australian work force. As a matter of interest that is the equivalent of twice the work force employed by General Motors-Holden 's Ltd and Mitsubishi Australia Ltd in South Australia. But in the two and a half years of office of the Tonkin Liberal Government the new jobs created totalled 22,100. That is the figure to December 1981. That is why the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) interjected about the suggestion that the Tonkin Government has not met its election promise in relation to job creation. The figure for the stated period of 22,100 is far in excess of the 8, 000--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, they are Government figures. That is far in excess of the 8, 000 jobs that were promised in the election campaign. I want to mention the changes that are occurring in population, which was also referred to by Senator McLaren. The growth rate for the last financial year was the highest rate of population increase for three years. Migration to South Australia is at last again increasing. More people are moving to South Australia from interstate. With regard to population trends it has been a difficult time for South Australia but the important thing to observe is the reversal of the trend. With the continuation of the Government that we have in South Australia that reversal will proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLaren would be particularly interested to hear that these achievements of the Tonkin Government have occurred with good financial management. Only this week the Premier and Treasurer of South Australia was able to indicate publicly that he has reason to be confident that there will be close to a balanced Budget for 1981-82. That is an achievement of which any government in the Western world today could be proud in the current international situation . Let us compare this with the situation under a Labor Government in New South Wales. It is now projected that there will be a $200m deficit this year. Imagine the massive increases in charges that will have to occur in that State to compensate for the inefficient and incompetent government and the poor economic management. Fortunately that is not the position in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The amazing thing about the achievement of the Tonkin Liberal Government is not only that it is able to balance the books, to reduce taxation and to provide greater incentives to the private sector to get the State moving again but also that, at the same time, it has been able to improve government services. For example, I refer to education. Some of these examples, I am sure by no accident, were not mentioned in Senator McLaren's speech. He will not dispute that in only two and a half years of Tonkin Liberal Government we have achieved the best student-teacher ratio for primary schools in Australia and we have the highest spending per student at the primary level and the second highest at the secondary level compared with other States. Our spending on pre-schools is the highest in Australia. The honourable senator will be aware of the exciting new $ 19m city college planned for Light Square, which will give the best city in the nation further education facilities. He will be aware of the upgrading that is occurring in work experience and transition education in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the subject of housing. A little later this evening my colleague Senator Teague will have the pleasure to detail to the Senate the achievements of the Tonkin Liberal Government in housing. Everybody accepts that it is a difficult time for housing. The State Bank in South Australia has maintained its lending rate of 55 loans per week even though the average loan has increased. Some 2,750 housing loans, totalling over $85m, are approved each year. Average interest rates might interest honourable senators opposite. Interest rates under the State Bank of South Australia are 7.6 per cent, which is just over half that currently operating for normal bank mortgages. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren may be aware of the home buyers crisis scheme which was introduced by the State Government to meet emergency situations. Interest free loans of up to $1,500 are available there. He may also be aware of the priority being given by the Tonkin Liberal Government to providing quality public housing for the aged. The number of cottage flats in the metropolitan area this financial year is 338 compared with 64 in 1978-79. I presume that the Labor Opposition in the Senate would applaud such a hugh increase in such an important area which, I might add, is stimulated by Liberal Policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on for a long time talking about the achievements of the Tonkin Government in such a short time. Let us consider the achievements of that government in relation to Aboriginal lands. That achievement has now set the standard for the rest of Australia. Let us consider also the fact that 27 new public library services have been opened or upgraded since 1979. Senator McLaren would have to give credit to the South Australian Minister of Transport for his efforts in at last establishing a permanent container terminal at Outer Harbour which is on a regular run to England. That is something that has been wanted for so long. He should applaud the extension in domicillary care services that has occurred under the Tonkin Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In an entirely different field, legislation has been introduced to control the handling and use of radioactive materials. That is a difficult question with which the Tonkin Government has been prepared to grapple. It has set up the intellectually disabled persons' council. This is something which should be applauded. The South Australian Government is doing something about transport in the metropolitan area, whereas under the Labor Government all we heard was a lot of talk. But, under a good Minister of Transport, this transport system is on the way. A vast improvement in our national parks must be accepted. There are now more than 70 full time rangers compared with 46 when the Liberal Government came into office. The new international aviation facilities in Adelaide were another difficult question with which Labor was not prepared to wrestle in the 10 years it was in office. After two and a half years of positive action by the Tonkin Government, this is on the way. Anybody with an objective mind would have to applaud what the Tonkin Government is doing in relation to the technological revolution. Technology Park in Salisbury has been opened. That shows that at last we have a government in South Australia that is getting South Australia on the road again to prosperity and to a much brighter future. </PARA>
<PARA> The future for South Australia is an exciting one. It has a good Government which is playing a major role in that exciting future. Senator McLaren's pessimism will be rejected. South Australians are sick of it. They have heard it from the Labor Party over and over again. South Australians are currently applauding the Liberal Government in South Australia which is getting on with the job of making South Australia great again. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is a quite extensive document which details a great chronology of inactivity in South Australia. I am sure that Senator Hill would be interested to see the whole content of it. Senator Hill began by saying that Senator McLaren talked about the old days of doom and gloom, the old days of recipes of the past. He would know that full well because between 1975 and 1979 a leader in South Australia was preaching doom and gloom in a State that was progressing much better than the rest of Australia. That leader, of course, was David Tonkin. In those days he was Leader of the Opposition; he should be now. It is no wonder that Senator Hill talked about the old days of doom and gloom. He was referring to the days of the Liberal Party propaganda of Dr Tonkin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He said that, in 1979, South Australians rejected the approach of a Labor Government. South Australians accepted time and time again the approach of a Labor Government during the period 1965 to 1979. It is recognised by psephologists and by the observers of politics in this country that the aberration in the vote in South Australia at that time was caused purely by reasons which eventuated during that campaign and not from a long term growing rejection of Labor policies, Labor principles and Labor administration. The people of South Australia saw a government working effectively and efficiently. It was a government in which they had confidence. It was only a month before the election was called that the South Australian Labor Government was standing extremely high in the public opinion polls. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill went on to say that the Tonkin Government has reduced the public payroll without sacking people. Sack people it may not have done; but what it has done to the people of South Australia and to the children of South Australia is to deprive them of the opportunities which they had traditionally-to join the Public Service and to find employment, whether it be public employment or, because of public funding, employment provided indirectly through private enterprise. The Government has done that. All it can do is to gloat about the fact that it has actually sacked nobody. Senator Hill went on to say that the Tonkin Government has brought smaller government or a much more streamlined administration. Let us consider the situation. Let us consider the real facts involved in Senator Hill's allegation. What, if anything, the Tonkin Government has done has been to abolish 14 statutory authorities in its term. But in the same period it has created 29. If by some quirk that is abolishing and cutting government to a smaller size, I find that hard to understand. It has created 29 new bodies and abolished 14. There are eight more to come and there is one more to go. So much for that great achievement of the Tonkin Government!</PARA>
<PARA> He then went on to allege that the Labor Government stifled incentive and that the Tonkin Government is aiding industry and creating a situation for private investment. The whole of the Opposition Report is a testament to the fact that this is not the case. Any indicator that Senator Hill cares to choose will show that this is not the case. In building investment, we find that South Australia is far below the growth of building investment in any other State. In this respect I do not have to quote the Opposition Report which was prepared by John Bannon, the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia. I will quote the report of the Indicative Planning Council of the Housing Industry which was a joint industry-government report and which was tabled in this place towards the end of last year. In respect of housing in South Australia, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Net population loss through interstate migration is expected to average 6,000 per annum . . . This increased loss is attributed to the high level of unemployment compared with other States and to people moving to other States with better job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> This low population growth will be a major constraint on housing demand in South Australia. Furthermore, current economic conditions and prospects are expected to dampen the rate of household formation. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for increased incentive for industry! So much for the housing industry which was so instrumental in spending thousands of dollars in achieving a Tonkin Liberal Government!</PARA>
<PARA> We then go on to an indicator that the Premier himself continues to use and that is the foreign investment indicator. Just over a year ago when the Foreign Investment Review Board released its 1979-80 report showing overseas investment in South Australia totalling over $1100m compared with $17m in 1978-79, Mr Tonkin said:</PARA>
<PARA>The figures illustrated the growing confidence being shown in South Australia by investors. </PARA>
<PARA> Investment means new projects and new jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>What he did not say was that the $1,000m of the $1,179m was allocated to Roxby Downs. But in recent months the Foreign Investment Review Board has produced another report. That report has received no glowing response from the Premier, because it shows that the Foreign Investment Review Board identified only $13.6m of new overseas investment in the State in 1980-81. That figure for overseas investment was lower than the 1978-79 total. It accounted for 0.38 per cent of all overseas investment in Australia. It is little wonder that the Premier has been extremely quiet in response to the Foreign Investment Review Board's report a few months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We then, of course, turn to what has become traditionally the Liberal response to economic problems. The Liberals preach a resources boom. We have had it preached here, as I said yesterday, time and time again by Government spokesman after Government spokesman. It has gone out of favour in recent days-that must be admitted-but not in South Australia. In South Australia we have seen this amazing spectacle of the Premier falling over the Deputy Premier falling over the Minister of Transport to try to oversell Roxby Downs, a project which at one stage was going to give the State economy $100m a year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that these Ministers are not involved in the same way as the honourable senator is alleging. The initial estimation was that it would give to the State revenue $100m per annum within a decade. That estimation which came out of the Premier's Department, which came from the Premier himself and was reported out of the mouth of the Minister of Transport in his local newspaper-the Prospector in North Adelaide-has now been denied by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the Deputy Premier, Mr Goldsworthy, who now claims that it was all a mistake by the Adelaide Advertiser, that the figure that was produced from his office was incorrectly reported and that total investment in mining would net that amount to the South Australian economy. Once again we have a figure plucked out of the air, unsourced and unsubstantiated. We have the spectacle of Government spokesmen in total disarray in an endeavour to oversell the project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We had that disarray also when Government spokesmen were talking about the job prospects to be created by Roxby Downs. At one stage there was talk of 20,000 jobs in South Australia. Then we had an election and Premier Tonkin then promised South Australians 50,000 jobs. Since the election we have had once again Deputy Premier Goldsworthy talking of 20,000 jobs. Now we are down to the number 2,000. So, a resources boom which took two or three years to dissipate in the national arena has taken a mere two to three months to dissipate in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I take it as a compliment for the Labor movement that Senator Hill went on to discuss other major achievements which he claimed as being those of the Liberal Government. What he has done has been to go through a series of areas which we as a government and which we as a movement and as a party made acceptable and respectable in Australian politics. What Liberal governments were concerned about the environment before the Dunstan Government and the Whitlam Government? What Liberal governments were concerned about housing and welfare housing? None. What Liberal governments were concerned about education? None. What Liberal governments were concerned about the health and the education of their people? It cannot be denied that the major record of achievement of the Dunstan Government with its competent Ministers was in those areas. It is of little comfort now, I suppose, to hear Liberal spokesmen on the other side of the House claim that those areas are their areas of achievement. That is utter baloney. Expenditure in those areas has gone down and, as Senator McLaren showed while Senator Hill was speaking, group after group in South Australia is concerned at the decline of health services, at the decline of education services, at the decline with respect to the environment and so on. I need not go on spending much more time responding to the speech of Senator Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to Senator McLaren's motion. I support it for a number of reasons, the first being that in South Australia in our community there is a need for a report such as the one prepared by the office of the Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party, John Bannon, prepared I must say with the co-operation of a person who will be a senator in a very short period, that is, Graham Maguire, an economist who will, I believe, add as greatly to the economic debate on this level as he is doing on the State level in South Australia. The Opposition report provides for the people of South Australia a balanced assessment of the economic situation in that State. The only alternatives that they have at the moment to get access to information is the Adelaide News and the Adelaide Advertiser. The News is showing absolutely no respect now for balance, as was the case in the 1979 election campaign when a statistical assessment showed that for the whole four-week duration of that campaign the Adelaide News chose in a self-claimed balanced campaign to give 80 per cent of priority news-space to unfounded charges from the Liberal Party Opposition and its lackeys. The News has not improved. In the meantime the Adelaide Advertiser is not fulfilling its role as an information channel for the people of the State. So, there is a need for a report such as this. There is a need for a report which fully analyses the situation in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> The report that Senator McLaren refers to is one that has come out two years after the election to the position of Premier of David Tonkin. He has had time to govern. He has had time to make his policies felt on the South Australian community. We now can take the time to make him account for the effect of those policies. Senator McLaren lists in his motion a number of broken promises. We do not have to look too far back to the Liberal Party campaign promise of stopping the job rot. Spokespeople on the Government side will claim that employment has increased in South Australia over the period of the Tonkin Government. In fact, the Premier was quoted in the Adelaide Advertiser on 13 February this year as saying that the Government has created 22,100 jobs since coming to office. The claim cannot be valid in view of the fall in employment of 11,200 in the State recorded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics between December 1981 and January 1982. Mr Tonkin's problem-it is also the problem of Senator Hill-is that he compared different months of different years in order to make his claims. Once again we have the situation that Senator Walsh refers to of rubbery figures . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not doing it. I am sure Senator Teague would not either. We talk about unemployment. On a preliminary basis as at January 1982 South Australia had 49,100 unemployed-equivalent to 8.1 per cent of the labour force; the national unemployment rate was 6.4 per cent. So, what we have had over the period of the Tonkin Government has been record unemployment, the highest unemployment for any mainland State. It is a record which the Liberal Party in South Australia refuses to acknowledge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We then talk about job vacancies. We find that in that same period the figures show that in November 1981 there were 2,000 job vacancies in South Australia. That was, in fact, an increase on the number of job vacancies in November 1980- that can be acknowledged-and again an increase on the 1,700 job vacancies in November 1979. The problem that we face with the economy is that whereas only 2, 000 job vacancies were available in South Australia last November that is only 5 .4 per cent of all vacancies identified throughout Australia. The problem is accentuated when one looks at the fact that there is one job available for every 22.9 unemployed persons in South Australia compared with one job available for every 10 people who are unemployed in the rest of Australia. So, the promise of stopping the job rot is obviously one that has not been met. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk about-we talked about it before-the election campaign promise in 1979 to restore business confidence. We find that in South Australia in the three months to January 1982 a total of 11,949 new motor vehicles were registered-a rise of 9.1 per cent compared with January 1981. This is not even in line with national figures. If we look at the national figures we find that South Australia's share of national vehicle registrations has decreased from 8.4 per cent in the three months to the end of January 1980 to 8.18 per cent in the three months to the end of January 1982. One important indicator of business activity and of community confidence shows no confidence. I need not go much further with respect to this area. I look at a recent report of a survey of South Australian industry published by the South Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Inc in December 1981. It was a survey which showed great gloom about investment prospects. It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> Expectations of increased capital expenditure in the forthcoming 12 months plunged in the December quarter to their lowest level in the past year. Investment plans at best indicated a very static environment for South Australia in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>Overall, the Chamber concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> It is now likely that at least the first and second quarters of 1982 are going to reflect generally depressed levels of activity. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst we have claims of business confidence and promises of restoring business confidence we find that the South Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has absolutely no confidence in the economy in the short term. There are reasons for this, one of which was a promise which has not been kept. That is a promise about payroll tax made by David Tonkin before obtaining government. He claimed time after time that the State Government of Don Dunstan was taxing employment. But what has he done? His one opportunity, his one intervention in this area, has been not to raise the levels of exemption of payroll tax to comparable levels-in that respect, I mean comparable with levels to which we have historically compared the levels in South Australia, that is, the levels applying in Victoria. As a direct consequence of that we now find that 2,600 local small businesses are now under the net of payroll tax. They are now eligible to pay it whereas they were not during the term of the Labor Government . That is one direct effect on business activity and business confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I will close by referring to one point made by Senator Hill-that the Tonkin Government has been instrumental in decreasing taxation. The problem with that allegation is that once again the figures deny the allegation. The figures this time come from an official Treasury report which was issued by the South Australian Treasury in December 1981 and which was entitled 'Recent Trends in South Australian Public Finances and the 1981/82 Outlook'. The Treasury report forecasts a large 14.5 per cent rise in State collections in the current financial year. This is the largest growth in State taxes for five years. The actual increase would have been $62m and that, of course, came despite Mr Tonkin 's pledge in his 1979 election campaign when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will cut taxes and we can afford to do it. </PARA>
<PARA>We now have a situation in which, according to the Treasury paper, State tax collections per head of population have increased as follows: In 1978-79 they were $296; in 1979-80 they were $316; in 1980-81 they were $329; and in 1981-82 there was a massive increase of $46 per head which brought the total to $375. </PARA>

<PARA> (i) allowing the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, to continue with his Commonwealth home loan mortgage of $17,964 granted on 17 December 1964 by himself as the then Minister for the Interior, at a fixed interest rate of 4.75 per cent, and which at 1 October 1981 still had an amount of $15,005 owing, with the expiry date of the loan being the year 2009, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) allowing the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, to continue with his Commonwealth home loan mortgage of $30,352 granted on 28 August 1970 by himself as the then Minister for the Interior, at a fixed interest rate of 6.25 per cent , and which at 1 October 1981 still had an amount of $28,404 owing, with the expiry date of the loan being the year 2015,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) further condemns the Government for allowing interest rates in respect of the many thousands of young Australian home owners and potential home owners to escalate to the point where many are now in danger of losing their homes and many others are faced with the situation of never being able to obtain a home of their own; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) calls on the Government to request the Cabinet Ministers in question to immediately divest themselves of the loans mentioned above, or, aternatively, extend the generous terms enjoyed by them to every citizen now struggling to either keep or put a roof over their head. </PARA>
<PARA>Since I gave notice of that motion on 18 November and following the persistent presentation of petitions to this Parliament calling on the Government to take action we found some weeks ago in an answer from Senator Messner that Mr Nixon has seen fit to pay off his loan. I venture to say that had we not ferreted out this information in the Committee of the Whole during the last Budget session Mr Nixon would still be enjoying the very generous terms which were given to him by the Government when he was Minister for the Interior. I am not yet aware whether Mr Anthony has decided to do the honourable thing and divest himself of his loan . It is a most unfortunate situation because people are still suffering from very high interest rates on their home loans. I mention one person who is endeavouring to get the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to do something about reducing the interest on home loans. An article about the lady appeared in the Advertiser of 28 April. It was headed: 'Refuse to pay, says crusader'. The report comes from Canberra and the article is by Brett Bayley, the Advertiser correspondent. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> A South Australian woman wants home buyers to protest over high interest rates by refusing to pay their mortgage payments for one month. Mrs Glenys Lane of Reynella, said yesterday: 'There would be such a scream from the banks and the building societies that they would come back at Mr Fraser'. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that these people are complaining, when the person who holds the second highest office in this Parliament, the Deputy Prime Minister, has availed himself of a very generous long term home loan at a very low interest rate. People are saying that what is good for the goose should be good for the gander. The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Lane, who is facing eviction with her husband and three children because they cannot meet this month's payment on their house, travelled by bus from Adelaide to Canberra on Monday to see the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>It was falsely claimed, I think by Mr McVeigh, the other day, that Mrs Lane came to Canberra by aircraft. Such was not the case; she had to travel overnight by bus, in great discomfort. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> But Mr Fraser refused to see her yesterday and arranged a meeting with the Minister for Housing and Construction, Mr McVeigh. Mrs Lane vowed last night to stay in Canberra and to continue to seek an appointment with Mr Fraser. She said she and her daughter, 10, would check in at the YMCA. </PARA>
<PARA>She is very concerned that the Prime Minister did not see her. We see from an article in today's Advertiser that Mrs Lane literally ran the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, to ground on Tuesday. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> She travelled to Canberra determined to protest personally to Mr Fraser about spiralling home loan interest rates, but after a three-hour wait outside his office was 'fobbed off' to meet the Minister for Housing, Mr McVeigh. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Mr Fraser would not see me', she said last night. 'His secretary made the point even clearer: not next week, not next month, not next year.' As she continued her wait on the steps of Parliament House Mrs Lane saw Mr Fraser being photographed. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I approached and asked him why he wouldn't see me,' she said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I told him I hadn't come to see Mr McVeigh. He then turned his back and quickly walked off. </PARA>
<PARA> I chased him up the steps of Parliament House and all his Ministers gathered around him and they took off. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I am wearing sneakers now-I'm getting used to chasing people'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Lane went to Canberra as part of her campaign-which began in August last year-to try to force Government action for 'thousands' of home buyers struggling with mortgages. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the reasons why, not knowing that Mrs Lane had that problem, I first placed this motion on the notice paper and started presenting petitions about this matter to this Parliament from people who were very concerned that Mr Anthony, the Deputy Prime Minister and, as I said, one of the highest paid people in this Parliament, and his National Party colleague Mr Nixon, were able to get these very cheap home loans when people who were in financial trouble were not able to get them. It is no wonder that people will continually complain until such time as Mr Anthony does the honourable thing and pays off his very cheap home loan-Mr Nixon has already paid his off-and the Government goes a step further and reduces interest rates on home loans for people who are struggling to get a roof over their heads. I am not the only one who has complained about this situation. In the Canberra Times of Tuesday 2 March, Senator Reid, who was in the chamber tonight, was reported as saying that these loans ought to be paid off. She will probably rebuke me and say that she was not correctly reported, but I will read the article. Under the heading: 'Ministers' House Loans' it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Low-interest housing loans held by two Government Ministers in the ACT should be repaid, Senator Reid (Lib, ACT) said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I personally think it would be preferable if both Ministers concerned repaid the loans and refinanced their houses in another way', she said on radio station 2CN. </PARA>
<PARA> But she said the ministers could not be forced to repay what were 'quite legal mortgages and quite legal interest rates'. </PARA>
<PARA>I have never disputed that fact. What I have said all along is that the loans are morally wrong in view of the fact that many people cannot get a home loan and those who can get a loan are being forced out of their homes because of the high interest rates. The article went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, has recently paid off his loan at a fixed interest rate of 6.25 per cent, according to a spokesman for Mr Nixon. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources, Mr Anthony, was still repaying his loan at 4.75 per cent, a spokesman for Mr Anthony said. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a scandal that two Ministers-persons who should be responsible-have availed themselves of these loans. One of them is still in possession of a loan. As I said, with the salary that he gets he could well afford to pay it off. The fact that he paid off the few thousand dollars that are owing certainly would not help the Treasury, but at least it would set a moral standard for the Ministers of this scandal-ridden Government. It would do something to uplift the Government's standards in the eyes of the people and show them that there were Ministers in the inner Cabinet who were prepared to do the honourable thing and not take and keep unto themselves these very cheap home loans. As time is getting on, I think the opportunity should be given to members of the Government to vote on this matter to see whether they are in agreement with these very cheap home loans or whether they will do the honourable thing and support my motion, which calls upon the Government to ask the one Minister who still has such a home loan to divest himself of it. I call upon the Senate to support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak in regard to this motion I shall touch firstly on the general question of interest rates which Senator McLaren has seen fit to introduce as well as discuss the reason for the motion itself. Senator McLaren referred to Mrs Glenys Lane from Adelaide who has been getting a great deal of publicity in South Australia with regard to her stand on interest rates. On odd occasions she has organised marches and various protests in parts of Adelaide. I have had the opportunity of meeting her and her group on one or two occasions to discuss the problem of interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very easy thing to stand in any place-in the Senate, for that matter, as Senator McLaren does-and make points about interest rates and the problems that they cause. It is another thing entirely to take a point of real concern and discuss the very real issues that lie behind the causes of high interest rates. Senator McLaren did not address himself to that at all. He seems to regard it as a foregone conclusion that governments have some magic wand with which they can control interest rates automatically. That, of course, is demonstrably untrue. He has only to refer to the histroy of his own government from 1972 to 1975 to note that that is not the case. He knows that during that period interest rates rose very rapidly and caused enormous difficulties and dislocations in the money markets. I think all of us recall very vividly the effects of those policies in the June period of 1974 when, overnight, money cost more than 24 per cent under the guidance of the then Treasurer, Frank Crean. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will explain to the honourable senator the reasons for this. He would know through his own experience the difficulties with which governments are faced in trying to finance their deficits and how interest rates tend to rise to such high levels. It is true that there is a very close linkage between the rate of inflation and interest rates as they apply generally. If we do not acknowledge that fact and try to control the rate of inflation interest rates will skyrocket even further. This Government's policies are directed towards the control of inflation in order to ensure that interest rates are kept as low as possible in the circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fundamental reason why interest rates rise is that there is a demand for money. That demand stems from various sources. It stems from people seeking to borrow for the expansion of their businesses, to buy consumer durables or, perhaps, to buy a house. Those groups are affected by rising interest rates. In addition, larger firms go into the money markets seeking to borrow and, of course, the Government goes into the money markets seeking to gain funds for expenditure on public works and matters of that kind. It is axiomatic that the greater a Government's deficit-that is, the difference between what it gets in by way of taxation revenue and the amount that is expends on its various programs-the greater the amount of money that is required to fund it. If it is not funded inflation occurs. In order to contain inflation as much as possible money is borrowed from the general public to ensure that it comes from a source which can be afforded by the community. This means that the Government is, in effect, competing with other groups in the community, such as homebuyers, those who want to buy a new car and businesses which are seeking funds from banks or through the stock exchange. That competition effectively increases the pressure on interest rates in an upward direction. For that reason the Government's deficit grows larger. Consequently interest rates will be higher. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a fundamental fact of life which applies to countries around the world. We know of the situation in the United States at the moment. It has extremely high interest rates. The Government in that country and the Federal Reserve face difficulties in trying to contain the rate of inflation and stimulate economic development. We know that interest rates in the United States are of the order of 17 per cent or 18 per cent while inflation is relatively low at present-about 8 per cent. The reason is that the Government has a deficit approaching $120 billion-an enormous amount of money which has to be funded from borrowings from the general community. As a result, the impact on interest rates in the United States economy is enormous. It is a classic case of the argument I am putting that governments do not automatically have control over these things. They can attempt to contain interest rate rises by ensuring that they keep their deficits low. That is one of the chief objectives of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had hoped that the Minister for Finance ( Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street), might have been in the chamber tonight. I refer, firstly, to a question which I asked in this place on 25 February and in which, in part, I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact that $35,000 had previously been embezzled from the Australian Embassy in Tehran? If so, what action was taken on that matter?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, in her reply, said:</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the second matter-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the matter I have just referred to-</PARA>
<PARA> I would need to seek information from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I will do that as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>That was on the Thursday of that week. On the Friday, I think in the afternoon, I received a telephone call from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street, to my electoral office in Warrnambool. He said that he was somewhat taken aback by the question and he informed me that immediately he became aware of the question he had contacted his Department, which had assured him that there was no evidence whatsoever of embezzlement from the Embassy in Tehran. He said that he would forward to me a letter to that effect. I have a copy of that letter, which was dated 5 March, and in it Mr Street said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> My Department is not aware of any embezzlement from the Australian Embassy in Tehran and a careful check of the post's financial transactions has not revealed any discrepancy. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable senators to take note of that. On 24 March, I received a second letter from Mr Street:</PARA>
<PARA> Dear Senator Primmer</PARA>
<PARA> On 5 March 1982 I wrote to you, following your question without notice on 25 February to the Minister for Finance about whether there had been an embezzlement from the Australian Embassy in Tehran, to inform you that my Department was not aware of any embezzlement from that post and that a careful check of the post's financial transactions had not revealed any discrepancy. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I wrote that letter, an officer of my Department has informed me that he has some information relevant to this matter. I have asked the officer to provide me with any information which he holds and have informed him that this will be referred to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall inform you of the outcome as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely A. A. STREET</PARA>
<PARA>On 22 April, last week, I again asked a question about this matter of Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. She informed me in quite a lengthy reply that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had requested her and her Department to commence investigations concerning the allegations. She said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> All the documentation relating to the matter and held by the Department of Foreign Affairs is available to the Minister. The investigation, the Minister for Foreign Affairs understands, has been assigned to a team headed by a senior officer of the Department of Finance. If the officers of the Department of Finance consider at any stage that it would be appropriate to seek the advice of the Attorney-General's Department on any aspect of the matter, they will do so. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me give the facts, as I understand them. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ivor G. Bowden was Ambassador to Iran in the years 1974 to 1978 and, on his return to Australia, was promoted First Assistant Secretary. According to the 1981 Commonwealth Directory, he still holds that position. Before he went to Tehran, Mr Bowden brought to Australia by ship an English nanny to work for his wife, and the Australian taxpayers were billed for her fare out. In Tehran, Mr Bowden got away with between $10,000 and $15,000 by various mechanisms, including the following: One, he claimed for a phantom servant and pocketed the wages; two, he paid Embassy moneys to his grown-up son; and three, he made false claims on entertainment allowances and other malpractices. In all this he has been protected by his Department Head, Mr Henderson. I understand that both attended Geelong Grammar and Oxford University together. Anybody who has been around this place or around the Department of Foreign Affairs for any time at all would know that there is alleged to be within the Department of Foreign Affairs a well-known faction, namely, the Geelong Grammar mafia. Mr Bowden was protected to the point that, on 5 March, the Minister for Foreign Affairs sent me the letter that I read previously, proclaiming that his Department was not aware of any embezzlement in the Tehran Embassy. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Minister was lied to and as a result lied to me. I ask: Who in the Department sent that letter? Was it part of the cover-up that has gone on within the Department over the last five or six years? I also ask Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle: How many officers within her Department have been assigned to the investigation set in motion? Are there sufficient to ensure that a report on this matter is made to the Parliament before we rise for the winter recess? Or is the Government, and most assuredly the Department of Foreign Affairs, hoping that any announcement can be made during the forthcoming winter recess? Of the Minister, Mr Street, who by now, in view of the letter of 5 March, must be extremely dubious of any letter or information he receives from his Department, I ask: What does he intend to do about both Mr Bowden and Mr Henderson? I believe that, in view of the charges I have made, both these senior officers in his Department should at least be suspended from duty pending the results of the current or any further inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I further ask: What has been and is the position of, I understand, several honest officers within the Department who have sought over the past six years to have this malpractice brought out into the open? Have they been denied promotion , maligned from on high as to their work capabilities, and so on? I suggest that they have. I believe we have here evidence of white collar crime right within the heart of the Government and one section of the Public Service, accompanied by a massive cover-up by people entrusted with taxpayers' funds to do an honest job. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind myself that the sort of people I have pointed the finger at tonight are the people responsible for the conduct of our foreign affairs. They are the people whom the Government relies on for advice from abroad on many issues. They are the people who fed the people of Australia misinformation during the Vietnam War and also, I suspect, on the East Timor issue. Yet, in my view, some of them cannot be trusted with even the petty cash tin. Finally, late this afternoon I received a further letter from Mr Street, dated 29 April. In part he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me repeat again that I regard very seriously any suggestion of embezzlement or other financial impropriety. I also believe that anyone, including Members of Parliament, who becomes aware of, or retains in their possession, any information which might facilitate the investigation of this matter is under a clear obligation to make that information available to the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely A. A. STREET</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter Senator Primmer raised is, I take it, now a matter of urgency. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts is already in the process of investigating a matter in the United States, a matter which is concerned with the misappropriation of funds. We are now faced with another matter raised by Senator Primmer in relation to the misappropriation of funds at the Australian Embassy in Tehran. I do not wish to add to that because the Public Accounts Committee will possibly get both matters before it. At least it cannot refer to the Washington Embassy matter without also referring now to the Tehran matter. I therefore do not want to go into the subject matter at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All I wish to say is that what Senator Primmer said tonight, in view of the allegations concerning Washington, makes this an extremely serious affair which the Government, I take it, cannot ignore. Although the Government cannot respond tonight in depth, I believe it ought to respond as quickly as possible and take all necessary steps to investigate the matter so that the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is a particularly important Department, is not discredited. It would be unfair to the mass of people employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs if the matter were to remain in doubt for too long. All I can say is that as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I am now very much concerned about these further allegations and I think the Government ought to give them the highest priority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time on 21 April I asked a question in relation to the Cessna Citation jet which may be purchased by the Queensland Government. In general I asked whether the Cessna Citation would have to have two pilots. Senator Messner, representing the Minister for Transport, said, amongst other things, that no decision had been made by the Department of Transport in relation to a proposal by the Premier that only one pilot be used on the Cessna Citation but he thought the Minister for Transport would feel that the Premier deserves no lower standard of safety than any other member of the general community, indicating that probably the response would be that two pilots would be required on the Cessna Citation. Yesterday I read an Australian Associated Press bulletin which stated that two pilots would be required. That bulletin states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Department of Transport has rejected a request from Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen that he be permitted to operated a twin-engined Cessna Citation aircraft with only one pilot. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier had been told the Department was not prepared to waive the rules for him, a spokesman for Transport Minister Ralph Hunt said today. </PARA>
<PARA> 'No grounds have been established for a lower standard of safety for the Premier or others who might travel in his aircraft than is available for the community at large,' he added. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision had been communicated to Mr Bjelke-Petersen last Friday. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Premier was reported to be 'not happy' with the decision and to want to put his case personally to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> But he cancelled an appointment he had made to see Mr Hunt in Canberra today before flying off to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hunt's office said there were 12 Cessna Citation aircraft in the country, including one other of the particular model ordered by the Premier. </PARA>
<PARA> Some models were allowed to be crewed by one pilot in the US depending on the circumstances of the operation. But these arrangements could not be directly related to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Spokesman said that all operators and Cessna agents in Australia had been told in July, 1979, that Cessna Citation aircraft of all models operating in this country would require a minimum of two pilots. </PARA>
<PARA>In this morning's Courier-Mail there was an article which was appropriately headed 'Canberra props on Joh's Jet'. The article goes over the ground in that AAP bulletin and then reports this comment by Mr Bjelke-Petersen:</PARA>
<PARA> But Mr Bjelke-Petersen last night insisted Mr Hunt 'still has to make his decision'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bjelke-Petersen then added:</PARA>
<PARA> He hasn't decided yet-I have to meet him personally before he makes his final decision. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bjelke-Petersen said yesterday's announcement that Mr Hunt had informed him of the decision last Friday was 'out of date'. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner): Has a final decision been made? If it has been made, what is the final decision?</PARA>
<PARA> I shall mention one other matter which is altogether different from that last matter. I will not require a response from Senator Messner on this matter but I wish to raise it in the Senate. I was dismayed yesterday to read another AAP article which received some prominence in some of today's newspapers about an incident in a South Australian school. Some honourable senators may be aware that I am involved in an organisation called Parents and Teachers Against Violence in Education. It was because of this that my attention was drawn to this bulletin which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian Education Department has called for an urgent inquiry into an incident in which a teacher allegedly poured methylated spirits on a student' s hand and set it alight. </PARA>
<PARA> A student at Christies Beach High School, Shaun Riley, 12, suffered minor burns when methylated spirits ignited during a science lesson. </PARA>
<PARA> The teacher has been suspended. </PARA>
<PARA> School principal Dick Arnold said today it was alleged methylated spirits had been placed in the boy's hand and ignited. </PARA>
<PARA> He said a first aid assistant had taken the boy home. </PARA>
<PARA> ''Later that day his mother contacted one of my deputies and I questioned the teacher. </PARA>
<PARA> ''I was aghast and appalled by what had happened. The Education Department shared my dismay and displeasure to the extent that it has taken disciplinary action.''</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Arnold said the incident was ''extremely embarrassing for the school and completely out of character for the teacher.''</PARA>
<PARA> Shaun's mother Mrs Susan Riley said the teacher had told her the incident was a practical joke. </PARA>
<PARA> She said the teacher had said he had earlier poured methylated spirits on his own hand but had not ignited it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Riley claimed that immediately before the alleged incident the teacher had asked her son: ''Do you know what happens to kids who don't do their homework?''</PARA>
<PARA> Education Department Director-General John Steinle said: ''If the matter is as reported then the Department takes a very grave view of it.''</PARA>
<PARA>If the matter is as reported, I think many people would take a very grave view of it, but I would not like to make any suggestion that the incident was as outlined because sometimes incidents like that are not reported well. A lot of people have taken a great deal of interest in this incident. I hope that the Education Department in South Australia will make available the findings of any investigation it makes into the matter so that people are aware of the actual incident and what action has been taken. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was stated in 1981-82 Budget Paper No. 1, Budget Statement No. 2, on page 47 that 'Australia's inflation rate is now shaping to rise as fast or faster than the average for our major trading partner countries in 1981'.</PARA>
<PARA> There are several ways of comparing the inflation rates in different countries.

<PARA> To answer the second part of the honourable senator's question it is necessary to refer to a comparison of consumer price indexes as these are the only recent data currently available for Australia's trading partners. This comparison is necessarily imperfect because of differences in coverage of consumer price indexes across countries. But for what it is worth, the comparison shows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Over the 12 months to the December quarter, the consumer price index rose by 11.3 per cent in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Over the 12 months to the month of December, the weighted average consumer price index for Australia's major trading partners is estimated by Treasury to have risen by about 8 1/4 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) and (5) My Department is co-ordinating an intensive investigation into the involvement of Australians in the atomic weapons tests program to establish what levels of radiation exposure could have occurred to those who were in radioactive environments after the explosions.</PARA>
<PARA> The investigation will include a survey of all Australian personnel who were involved in the program and can be traced.</PARA>
<PARA> Evidence suggests that before each test thorough precautions were undertaken to avoid causing unacceptable exposure to Aboriginals and others. Nevertheless, as part of the investigation, my Department is assisting the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and other Commonwealth and State authorities to follow up any claims or suggestions that particular Aboriginals may have been affected as a result of the tests.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) Claimants for compensation are not classified according to their racial origins.</PARA>
<PARA> As at 13 April 1982, the Office of the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation had received a total of eighty seven claims arising from illnesses alleged to have arisen as a result of involvement in the atomic weapons tests at Maralinga, Emu and Monte Bello. Of these claims, liability had been proved in four cases, liability denied in twenty-two cases, sixty cases were still under investigation and one claim had been withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Twelve: see reply to question No. 2883, House of Representatives Hansard, 23 September 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) See Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council (AIRAC) reports Nos 4, 5 and 7 tabled in the Senate on 30 May 1979, 13 November 1979 and 21 August 1980 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Provisions of the Crimes Act, 1914, the Atomic Energy Act 1953, the Public Service Act 1922 and Regulations, and the respective Service Acts and Regulations control the disclosure of official information by Commonwealth officers, Service personnel and other persons. Generally, it may be stated that official information, whether classified or not, is not to be disclosed to any person unless the disclosure is authorised.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the disclosure of information related to the atomic tests would not contravene this legislation if:</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth officers presently employed and present members of the Defence Force possessed an appropriate authorisation or direction to disclose such information; and</PARA>
<PARA> other persons possessed a clear written authority from an appropriate officer.</PARA>
<PARA> Where necessary my Department will assist to obtain the appropriate authority.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 March 1982 (Hansard, page 1029) Senator Ryan asked me a question without notice concerning what assistance the Federal Government will give to the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust to raise $70,000 towards the cost of taking the production of Richard Merritt's play The Cake Man to the World Festival of Theatre in Denver, Colorado, in July 1982 and subsequent performances in the United States and Canada. In my answer, I indicated that the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment had referred the matter to the Australia Council, the Government's principal adviser on the arts, to seek comment and advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Council has advised me that apart from an initial contact in January 1982, at which time the promoters of this project were encouraged to submit a formal application, there was no contact by the promoters with the Aboriginal Arts Board of the Australia Council until mid-March 1982 and a formal application was not received until 22 March 1982. I am further advised that the Aboriginal Arts Board's normal requirement is at least 12 months notice of such a major project. I am informed also that uncommited funds available to the Aboriginal Arts Board for the remainder of the current financial year are insufficient to provide assistance at the level sought.</PARA>
<PARA> I am further informed that the earliest opportunity for the Aboriginal Arts Board to formally consider the project will be at its next meeting in May 1982.</PARA>
