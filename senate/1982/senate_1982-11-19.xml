<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Ordinance absolves both the Building Controller in the Australian Capital Territory and the Commonwealth from all liability for actions by the Controller as long as the Controller acts in good faith. The Committee was concerned that conferring such a wide immunity would alter very substantially rights at common law. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) has now given the Committee an undertaking to amend this Ordinance so that liability for actions by the Controller, and other building inspectors, will be accepted by the Commonwealth. I seek leave for a more detailed explanation to be incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> When giving Notice of Disallowance of the Building (Amendment) Ordinance (No. 2 ) 1982 on 16 October 1982, the Committee indicated that section 7 (3A) of the Ordinance appeared to absolve the Building Controller in the Australian Capital Territory from all liability in respect of any act or thing done by him, provided that it is done in good faith. The Committee put to the Minister that the conferral of such a wide immunity on the Building Controller would alter personal legal rights under the common law very substantially. </PARA>
<PARA> In his response to the Committee, the Minister advised that the Committee's understanding of the effect of the Ordinance was correct, and that neither the Building Controller nor the Commonwealth was liable for the Controller's actions under the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister has pointed out:'' . . . public policy and principles of equity would demand that the Commonwealth be liable for any damage to persons or property arising out of the actions of the Building Controller, Deputy Building Controller or inspectors.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has therefore given an undertaking that a further amendment to the Building Ordinance 1972 will be made to provide:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) immunity from legal action for the Building Controller, Deputy Building Controller and inspectors appointed under the Building Ordinance, in their personal capacity while performing their duties pursuant to the Ordinance; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) for liability for actions of these officers to be accepted by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has also indicated that the amendment will operate retrospectively to the date of effect of the Building (Amendment) Ordinance (No. 2) 1982 so that persons' rights will not be adversely affected. On the basis of this undertaking , the Committee has decided not to proceed with the Notice of Disallowance. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In answer to questions earlier this week the Minister has indicated that any proposal for the introduction of prices control is a matter for the States. Did the Government on Monday decide, as reported in the Age this morning, that the Commonwealth opposes proposals from the States for the imposition of prices control or prices surveillance? Will he indicate whether the Government will support or oppose prices control at the Premiers Conference?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure whether Senator Ray said 'did the Government make that decision on Monday' or 'if it makes that decision on Monday '. Any decision made on Monday would be a Cabinet matter and, of course, Cabinet discussions are private discussions until announcements are made. I repeat that the fact is that prices control is constitutionally a State matter and it is perfectly competent for any State to use its powers.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator should allow me to decide whether or not the Government has a view. Members of the Australian Labor Party will be disconsolate this morning because it has been isolated in its opposition . Even the three Labor Premiers have found that there is merit in what we are doing and they will basically support it. Everything that the Labor Party has said in recent days has shown that it alone, of all Australians, is not willing to come into a consensus to help the people who are unemployed or who are likely to be unemployed. That is the basic fact; the Opposition is now isolated. I plead with it again to join the consensus and to try to help those who are unemployed or may become unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the specifics of the matter, the Government has made it clear, as it ought to be known to everybody, that prices control is basically a matter for the States and the States may operate as they wish in that regard. If the States believe that by applying prices control they can do some good, then they as sovereign States can take such action. It is not for us to comment on that. It is for them to make their value judgments. What we have said and what is now being recognised by every Premier of Australia, including all the Labor Premiers , is that there must be wages restraint if inflation is to be controlled, if unemployment is to be steadied down and if we are to prepare ourselves for the time in the future when the recession lifts. Against that background I would have thought that the Australian Labor Party would have cut its losses, come on side and would be supporting what is now a growing and a massive Australian consensus.</PARA>
<PARA> I answer the question specifically by saying that the power for prices control lies with the States. Any discussions that the Commonwealth Government has had or any statements that it has made have indicated that we recognise that it is within the competence of the States to act on prices control if they so desire. In the past the people of Australia have indicated that they do not want centralised prices control in the Commonwealth. Therefore, with respect to the indications of the people, constitutionally the States have that power.</PARA>

They are voluntary organisations. Their strength and their quality depend upon individual public support, both physical and financial. They must be carrying an enormous burden these days.

He is reported in the National Times of 28 October as saying that he regarded the exercise as 'economically irrelevant' and, further, that the 'old man'-in this instance he was referring to the former head of Treasury, Mr Wheeler-'had a rush of blood to the head' in pursuing the proposal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health whether any progress has been made in arrangements between the United States of America and Australia on bluetongue disease which would indicate that changes may be possible in the importation of bovine semen for introducing new blood lines into Australian beef herds?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2569" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="EDUCATION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that there is some advantage in introducing new bovine semen to upgrade the national herd. The existence of bluetongue disease has made it difficult for people to get permission to introduce some of this semen. A fair amount of work has been done on diagnostic methods to ensure that any North American animals which donate semen for Australia, or any animals being imported from North America, are free from bluetongue disease. Although the animals have to be quarantined at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands quarantine station, the development of diagnostic methods to try to tell us whether they are free of the disease is continuing. At present bovine semen can be imported only from Canada and then only if it is from animals which were born in Canada and have been continually resident there or in another country which is free of bluetongue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Archer's question stems from the fact that the United States is not free from this disease. I am advised that officers of the Department of Health have visited North America and have undertaken extensive consultation. They have done this with a view to assessing whether bovine semen could, with safety, be imported directly from the United States. It has not been possible up to this stage to make satisfactory arrangements. Of course, until those arrangements can be made there is no question of introducing the semen. At the same time efforts have been made to assess whether semen from American-born bulls or Canadian bulls which have visited the United States could be accepted for importation. No decision has yet been reached on that matter. I take it that until officers are quite convinced that there is no danger to the Australian herd the matter will have to be one for continuing negotiation and consultation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for that question from Senator Colston because it gives me an opportunity to confirm what I have confirmed to a pensioner group that has made an inquiry of me and what the Treasurer has confirmed to a pensioner group which made an inquiry of him-namely, that it is no part of the Government's proposal that there should be any effect on pensions and benefits. In other words, the provisions for automatic twice-yearly indexation of pensions and benefits which determined the rises which many pensioners and beneficiaries have received over the last few weeks and which would provide a rise next May are not to be interfered with as part of this proposal. So pensioners and beneficiaries will not be affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that it is very much in the interests of pensioners and beneficiaries , as it is for other members of the community, that there should be the sort of wages pause which has been recommended by the Government and which is to be considered at the forthcoming Premiers Conference. Often raised in this place is the fact that when average weekly earnings are shooting ahead of the cost of living those pensioners and beneficiaries whose increases in income are restricted to cost of living adjustments suffer on a comparative basis. I believe that it is in the interests of all Australians but not least those on fixed incomes and those on pensions and benefits that the Government should pursue the course which it is currently pursuing. I hope that all honourable senators will take the opportunity, as I will, to calm any concerns which might be felt among those particularly vulnerable groups that what the Government proposes is directed to them. It is not.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst I did not see the article in the Australian Financial Review, what I have always understood to be true is that all basic elements of the Russian mercantile fleet are part of the total naval-military concept of the Russian Navy. If there is need to correct that in more modern times, I will certainly get information and let the Senate know. My full understanding is that in fact the various ships, including the fishing fleets, that operate in our waters and extensively in the Indian Ocean are part of the Russian Navy. Therefore one can presume that they are part of an intelligence gathering unit. It is true, of course, that the Russian Navy today in all its elements is by far the largest and the most modern navy in the world and, if that is so, it must constitute a basic threat in any major rearmament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government is joining with the governments of the free world in attempting to get multilateral disarmament throughout the world so that people can look towards peacetime pursuits. No one wants to have permanent enmities in this world. No one wants to have to apply more and more funds to armaments. The Americans, who are second to the Russians in the strength of armaments, have found it necessary to spend more money to get parity. It is a great pity indeed that there should be an arms race in this world; nobody wants it. It is true that, under the recent regime of Brezhnev, the Russian Navy expanded enormously and has become, as I said, the largest and most significant navy in the world, with very significant elements in the Indian Ocean. As to whether, because of these things, one would move to prevent the flag carriers coming to Australia, I would imagine that the Government would not seek to do so, but I will refer that question to the Minister concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Scott has orally raised this matter with me on a couple of occasions and the point that he makes in asking that question is, of course, a valid one. The cost of labour is affected by penalty rates. If the cost of labour is a factor in what employment there is, the relationship is established. The Government certainly believes that penalty rates are inhibiting employment opportunities generally and that their removal would boost employment opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The available evidence, which I sought because of Senator Scott raising this matter with me, is that in fact work or employment outside normal hours has contracted. The proportion of employees who work in the evening or night in their main job fell from about 25 per cent in November 1976 to about 20 per cent in early 1981. The proportion of people who work on Sundays fell from 9 per cent to 7 per cent in the same period. I have not been able to obtain full information on all of the matters raised by Senator Scott. However, available information suggests that higher penalty rate payments are incurred in the entertainment, accommodation, hospitality and community services areas, in retailing, transport and agriculture, in the manufacture of food, beverages and tobacco and in mining. Tentative estimates suggest that penalty payments comprise 10 per cent to 20 per cent of total wages in the entertainment, accommodation and hospitality sector and 4.5 per cent to 9 per cent of total costs. The percentages in the other sectors identified are below that.</PARA>
<PARA> At a time when excessive labour costs are having their effect on employment, if we could get a reduction in costs that obviously would make a contribution to improving employment opportunities. I do not think it is possible to give a quantitative figure, but I think that must be so. There have been expressions of concern on behalf of the Government by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. But, of course, in Australia the determination of wages and employment conditions is a matter in part for agreement between the employer and the employees and in part for decision by arbitral tribunals. The Commonwealth does not have the direct constitutional power to alter these conditions in general. But, in terms of creating greater employment opportunities in Australia, certainly the matters raised by Senator Scott have merit as matters which could expand employment across a range of industries.</PARA>

Whether she is or not, does she agree with Sir William that the proposed Commonwealth taxes on bank cheque accounts will push up substantially the cost of operating personal cheque accounts-by 100 per cent in some cases-that this will lead to many accounts being closed and a retrograde shift back to cash payments and tax evasion which the Commonwealth Government has gone to great lengths to destroy; and that the tax is a multiple tax since sales tax and other levies are already included in the price of the goods being paid for by cheque?

The Bill is clear, as will be shown when it is debated in this place. If the Democrats choose to delay the passage of one of the Bills to raise revenue for the Budget by suggesting that it will result in such an increase in the cost of transactions or in a reversion to the cash economy, I think that when the Bill is debated in this place that will be shown to be an utterly spurious argument. I am not aware of the effect that Sir William McMahon has attributed to the passage of the Bill but the measure provides for the imposition of only a very small charge on banking transactions. To suggest that it will increase costs or have any other effect overlooks, I think, its provisions, which we will debate probably next week.</PARA></TALK.START>

They have negotiated a four-day working week in return for a promise that 170 of their members will not be retrenched. They have been told by their Federal union that, despite the workers being 500-odd versus eight in favour of their plan, the Federal union will step in and prohibit them from carrying out their agreement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disappointing to hear of a Federal union taking the attitude which has been described by Senator Walters. Clearly, where management and labour can enter into consensual arrangements which have the effect of preserving jobs and, perhaps more importantly in this case, in which the actual amount of work is not affected but its distribution among employees is, this attitude is particularly to be regretted. Where people in a work force are prepared to make common sacrifices in the common interest rather than see some of their number disappear, they are to be congratulated on putting into operation the sorts of principles to which I think the Prime Minister was appealing when he made a statement on leaving hospital. Australia is going through a difficult time. I would have thought it was a time when we should all be trying to pull in the same direction and seeking some equality of sacrifice.</PARA></TALK.START>

Professor Clark's report, completed in February 1973, included a detailed analysis of the Delaware River Basin Compact of 1961. The Delaware Commission was brought into existence through the deliberate voluntary sacrifice of sovereign rights by the respective State parties. This and other models, including the Tennessee Valley Authority, established with lesser powers by the unilateral action of the United States of America Federal Government, were examined during the negotiations between the four governments which led to a new River Murray Waters Agreement.

But, in any case, although I think the question is a valuable one, because the Delaware experiment is an interesting one and should have been studied as it was, the fact is that my Government and I and the States concerned are confident that the recent River Murray Waters Agreement is such that it has made very significant advances, particularly in water quality control, and that, with goodwill by all four parties to that Agreement, it can function as well as any Federal-State body controlling water anywhere in the world.

The principal gains are the retention of jobs for those who presently have them and the improved prospects offered to those who are presently unemployed. If we are talking about the capacity for spending power, the fact that there could be more people employed and fewer people at risk of losing their jobs would mean that the full effect of the wages freeze would be to increase activity and not to reduce it in the way that was suggested by Senator Foreman. If we are to look at the package that is proposed by the Commonwealth Government, and which now seems to be supported by those State governments which met yesterday, we would have to accept that any reduction in salaries and wages in the public sector would be re-employed in other capital works and other government programs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am able to advise the honourable senator that the Minister for Transport and Construction received on 16 October 1981 the proposal put forward by the Rotary Club of Moruya prior to the development of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. His reply to the Rotary Club proposal on 15 December last year was in the context of road funding arrangements at that time. As honourable senators are aware, the ABRD Program was announced in the Budget this year. Legislation providing for this program will be before the Senate shortly. There will be a full opportunity to debate that. The program represents a major initiative by the Government towards improving Australia's road systems-national, arterial and local. It will involve expenditure of $2, 500m by 1988 and is conservatively estimated to generate at least 20,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities. The Minister has asked all State governments to provide, for his approval, indicative six-year schedules of road projects. The Minister expects to receive the New South Wales schedule shortly. I understand that the Rotary Club of Moruya has forwarded its proposal to the New South Wales Government. It is the responsibility of that State Government to recommend the proposal for inclusion in the Commonwealth's program. The honourable senator will, of course, be aware that the imposition of a toll on what would be an arterial road would be entirely a matter for the New South Wales Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

If we want to get the maximum benefit out of this report we should look at that finding and work out what we can do to improve retention rates and participation rates by Australians in educational activity. We need this, of course, for national purposes to get a trained group of people to fulfil a whole range of functions in the years to come. If Senator Harradine is pursuing that kind of outcome, I think we are in agreement. His question, though, relates more specifically to the fact that many people at school undertake part time employment. They do this to get themselves some discretionary income, some pocket money, money to spend. The Government has not, in the context of the learning and earning report, paid any attention to that question raised by Senator Harradine. It really stands apart from the report.

But I would not be inclined to overemphasise the down side. I do not believe the participation of school kids in activities to earn themselves a bit of money will have any major effect on overall employment opportunities. I will certainly put under study the points raised by Senator Harradine. I come back to where I began: The learning and earning report is of major importance to all of us. I would like to hope that we can develop policies from it to increase student retention rates around Australia-perhaps to the level they are in the Australian Capital Territory or to double them-so we will end up with a better prepared and a better trained work force and nation.</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask him, in view of the freeze which will be imposed on those who have to meet increased payments for home loans, whether the Government would not consider entering the market-place with a level of interest that would substantially freeze interest rates throughout Australia. Would the Minister not accept that it is unreasonable to impose freezes of the nature that have been suggested by Senator Scott in the Senate today-freezes on penalty rates and overtime-and agreed to by Senator Chaney?

<PARA> Opposition senators interjecting--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important issue and I intend to give the answer despite the interjections because the public of Australia are entitled to know. Let the Australian Labor Party shout. Let the public understand why Labor Party senators are shouting. They are trying to stop the answer being given. A deficit can be funded in one of two ways. It can be funded by printing money which is absolutely directly inflationary or it can be funded by going to the public and asking it to subscribe to bonds and, therefore, to draw off that amount of money and thus reduce inflation. If the second course is to be taken the public must be willing, at a particular interest rate, to subscribe to those bonds. This is not a closed economy. Interest rates in Australia are influenced enormously by overseas interest rates, which have been extraordinarily high. Because of those high overseas rates, if Australian interest rates are not sufficient there will be an outflow of money and the bonds will not be subscribed. Senator Georges is saying that we ought to keep interest rates down and yet the policy of his political party is to so inflate the deficit that it would either have to print money or go into the bond market in an enormous way. If it went into the bond market in an enormous way it would drive interest rates up further and further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not possible to get bonds in Australia subscribed to by freezing interest rates. The fundamental way to get interest rates down is first of all to get inflation down. Inflation will always bear a relationship to interest rates. If interest rates are to be real, clearly they have to have a margin above the inflation rate. If Senator Georges wants to get interest rates down he must get the current level of 12 per cent inflation down so that the real margin of interest rates will fall. If he wants to do that-I have no hesitation in answering this question at length as it is a serious question-he should subscribe to the wage freeze as everybody except the Labor Party has agreed to do because that wage freeze will bear down on inflation and therefore on interest rates. I repeat: The suggestion that we should freeze interest rates comes strangely from a Labor Party that is seeking to inflate the deficit enormously and therefore to go into the bond market in an enormous way and compete for scarce money. Interest rates cannot be frozen when external forces have a major influence. If they were to be frozen there would be an outflow of capital from Australia, undersubscription of the bond market and an upward surge in inflation because we would be printing more money.</PARA>

I say that with the best of good will and I say it because the original question deserved a full and lengthy answer and got it. Two influences force up interest rates in Australia. I itemised them. The first is the pressure of interest rates overseas -every economic commentator makes that point-and the second is the relationship between interest rates and the inflation rate. Quite clearly, if the rate of inflation were 12 per cent interest rates would be higher, otherwise they would not be real interest rates. If they were 12 per cent or lower they would be moving into the negative phase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat, the way to keep interest rates down is to keep the deficit as small as possible. The Government has sought to do that. The Australian Labor Party argues that the Government was wrong in so doing; that the deficit the Government proposed ought to be of perhaps twice that order. We do not intend to put on the bond market and interest rates any more pressure than is necessary. Unfortunately, drought relief has added to the deficit some $350m, plus the effect of unemployment. Nobody ought to object to that. We will strive to keep the deficit within limits. The Labor Party wants the deficit to burst beyond bounds. If money cannot be raised in the bond market through an interest rate that will attract interest-nobody can force people to subscribe-we will have undersubscription. We will have to print money, which in turn will cause inflation. Mr President, I ask that further questions be placed on notice.</PARA>

In my answer I stated that the Government's import parity pricing policy would remain in place and I reiterated the logic behind the policy. I did not in any way refer to a possible rise or to the possible extent of such a rise. I have nevertheless been reported in some parts of the media as appearing to be confirming that there would be a petrol price rise of 4c to 8c a litre as a consequence of our import parity pricing policy. That is wrong and it is a misinterpretation of what I said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to make the true position clear. The Government will maintain its import parity pricing policy. The practice under that policy is to review the price of crude oil every six months and to make any necessary adjustments to the price on 1 January and 1 July. Adjustments in the past have been down as well as up. The intent of the policy is to maintain the price of crude oil used by Australia at parity with world prices. Since 1 July, the last adjustment, the posted price of Saudi Arabian light crude-the marker crude-has remained unchanged at $US34 a barrel but the Australian dollar has depreciated against the US dollar. The price of imported crude has, in consequence and because of freight rates, risen in Australian dollar terms. I can say, however, that Senator Sibraa's guesstimates much exaggerated the position. If the present prices and exchange rates were to be used to calculate a new import parity price, this would, I am advised, result in an increase which would be somewhere within the range of less than 2c-not 4c to 8c-and slightly less than 3c a litre . I do not want to speculate on posted oil prices overseas, nor on the strength of the Australian dollar as it might be on 1 January next. That must wait. I just make the important point that the Government's import parity pricing policy will remain.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented in a personal explanation made yesterday in this place by Senator Macklin. Senator Macklin's was one of a number of rather nervous personal explanations made by honourable senators yesterday morning in response to an unfortunately worded Australian Associated Press report which suggested that the Constitution Alteration (Fixed Term Parliaments) Bill 1982 had accomplished the removal from the Senate of its powers to block Supply and that that Bill had in fact been supported by the honourable senators in question. In the course of his personal explanation Senator Macklin said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However I do not necessarily, as Senator Missen said, blame it on the reporters . I think it is possibly more likely that it was a mischievous Press release from Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA>I leapt down the corridor into the chamber yesterday to correct that statement but I am afraid I missed my cue. I take this opportunity to quickly put the record straight. I put out no Press release at all yesterday following the passage of the Bill the night before. The only Press release or statement that Senator Macklin could possibly be referring to is one which was made the previous week, on 11 November, in which I made it perfectly clear, as I have in all oral briefings I have given to the Press, that there is no such provision in the Bill as it finally emerged to directly deny the Senate's power to block Supply. Indeed, it would be quite unwarranted wishful thinking on my part to imagine that the Bill in its final form would have such an effect. The only thing I have said to various people which might conceivably have been the source of the misunderstanding is that the Bill in its final form will undoubtedly operate as something of a practical deterrent to the Senate's exercising that power to block Supply, as it will to the exercise by the government of the day of its double dissolution triggering power, simply because the Bill in its final form does provide that if an early election is triggered for any reason the government so elected would hold office only for the duration of the original three-year term. So it will be a considerable disincentive to Opposition forces in this place or anywhere else, exercising the powers they may be able to mobilise, to pull on any early election, the disincentive being that an early election would only result in a rather limited term for the government in question. I hope that clarifies the record and that Senator Macklin will no longer be under any illusion that I have been conspiring to embarrass him or anyone else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These Bills should never have been required. They are a function of the sustained gross negligence of the Treasurer (Mr Howard), the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and his Department, and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The sorry history of ministerial and bureaucratic sloth-what is at best sloth-is fairly well known and I do not propose to repeat it now. What is not well known is the degree to which the Government has surrendered to tax dodgers since the first version of these Bills was introduced in the Parliament on 23 September. That is not known because a slothful, negligent and incompetent Press resiled from its fundamental responsibility to report the news. With the very limited exceptions of the National Times of 26 September, the Australian Financial Review of 27 September and a feature article in the Age of last Monday, the Press-I include the electronic and the written media-has failed to report the addition to the original Bill, the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill, of sub-clause (12) of clause 3, let alone the implications of that clause for the revenue, for the credibility of the Government and for the logic of its taxation policy. Sub- clause (12) decisively testifies to the corruptibility of this Government and its craven subservience to vested interests through this partial surrender to the recipients of stolen money-to use the Prime Minister's one-time term. What is sub-clause (12) of clause 3? In the reasonably simple language of the explanatory memorandum I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sub-clause (12) is designed to ensure that the legislation will not operate to recoup unpaid company tax where the funds of a target company were removed- rendering it unable to pay tax-on the basis of an objective view as to the efficacy of a post-sale tax scheme designed to reduce or eliminate tax liability . </PARA>
<PARA>The second reading speech goes a little further and states:</PARA>
<PARA> The third category--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the third category of companies-</PARA>
<PARA>is different, as it can fairly be put that, because the avoidance scheme could not be said to be part of the arrangement to leave the company unable to meet its tax liabilities, an element of fraud is not present. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, there is a specific provision in the Bill to the effect that if the target company was the subject of a post-sale attempted avoidance scheme which, objectively viewed, would have had reasonable prospects of succeeding in its purpose, and the scheme is not part of, or associated with, the stripping arrangement so that the arrangement carried no purpose of rendering the company unable to pay, there will be no recoupment tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech are framed in relatively simple English-relative, that is, to the lawyers' gibberish or gobbledegook in the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill. The second reading speech further states:</PARA>
<PARA> In line with that, the recoupment legislation will also not apply where there was a pre-sale avoidance scheme--</PARA>
<PARA>This goes beyond the explanatory memorandum-</PARA>
<PARA>which, though ultimately shown to be unsuccessful, might reasonably have been expected to have worked, if at the time of the sale the commissioner had not raised an assessment rejecting the claims made under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>In simple English, what all that means is that if individual shareholders of a company with current year profits themselves put the company into a tax avoidance scheme and then kept the company, and the Commissioner of Taxation or the court struck down the avoidance scheme, those shareholders will have to pay. If they put the company into a tax avoidance scheme and then sold it to Brian Maher, or somebody like him, instead of keeping it themselves, and Brian Maher then sold it to a painter and docker, to use the shorthand term, and the Commissioner or the court then struck down the avoidance scheme, nobody has to pay the tax; nobody! On the other hand, if they sold it to Maher with the current year profit and Maher put it into an avoidance scheme and the avoidance scheme was struck down by the courts or rejected by the Commissioner, and Maher sold it to a painter and docker before that happened, again nobody pays the tax. According to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) in the House of Representatives on 28 October, and his assertion was not contradicted, clause 3 (12) merely restores the original intention of the legislation as announced by the Government on 25 July. This is very important. Mr Sainsbury said:</PARA>
<PARA> The other point I want to make is that clause 3 sub-clause (12) is a matter of faith by the Government on the basis that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his 25 July statement made it quite clear that this legislation was meant to catch cases of the nature of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. It was well known when the first draft of the Bill came out and we examined it that there were many other cases that would be caught, cases which would extend well outside the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. That was never the intention of the Government. If that had been the intention of the Government then I should think we would want to be debating that quite separately under a separate Bill. This has brought the Bill into line with the original intention. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to sub-clause 12 of clause 3. If that is correct, tax avoidance schemes, subsequently struck down, of companies which are flogged off to painters and dockers are not precluded by the 1980 Crimes (Tax Offences) Act. If Mr Sainsbury's interpretation is correct-and I stress that it was not contradicted-what is to stop somebody with a current year profit company now selling it to a new Brian Maher who puts it into a tax avoidance operation, flogs it off--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was the honourable senator not listening? Sainsbury said that the Bill in its original form would have caught cases which were not caught by the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act and therefore sub-clause (12) of clause 3 was introduced so that only those arrangements which would be caught by the 1980 amendment were in fact caught. So what we are talking about here are, according to Sainsbury's uncontradicted statements, arrangements outside the scope of the 1980 Act. If that is so, what is to stop someone with a current year profit company selling it today or next week to a new Brian Maher who puts it into an avoidance scheme which ultimately fails but, before the ultimate failure, flogs it off to a painter and docker? What is to stop anyone doing that if Sainsbury is correct?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A possible answer, Senator Watson, which may be tried is section 86 of the Crimes Act. But if section 86 is adequate to stop that sort of arrangement we do not need this legislation, and never did. Why, if that is the case, is not section 86 of the Crimes Act being used against all the people who indulged in these arrangements instead of a tiny fraction of them, instead of those who just sold the companies straight on to the painters and dockers without putting them through at least the pretence of a tax avoidance operation? A possible answer again for the Government might be-this was hinted at in the Treasurer's original statement of 25 July-that, yes, the money could be recovered under section 86 of the Crimes Act but it would take a long time to do this, it would be extremely difficult and we need legislation like this to get the money quickly. If that is going to be the Government's defence, it has been undermined to a very significant extent by the Government itself-firstly in giving those who actually receive assessments up to 12 months to pay the tax and secondly in reducing the interest which accrues for late payment from 30 per cent, as proposed originally , to 20 per cent. Both of those deviations from the original Government proposal will slow down the collection of whatever residual revenue will be left if the Bill in its present emasculated form is passed. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of illegality, fraud and illegal acts-the sorts of terms that pop up throughout speeches of Government members on this matter-is always a difficult one to handle because if the acts referred to or covered by this legislation were fraudulent and illegal at the time they took place, logically there is no need for the legislation. If it is already illegal why do we need to make it illegal twice? A review of the history of the last five or six years shows that it does not matter how many Acts there are if we have an Attorney- General and an Attorney-General's Department at the best slothful and negligent, by the most charitable assessment, and not enforcing the laws which already exist. There were always logic and credibility problems for the Government. Following the insertion of sub-clause (12) of clause 3, there is no way in which the Government can escape from the dilemmas which it has created for itself. No matter how much the Government wriggles and contorts it cannot provide a coherent rationale for this Bill. Every escape route is a blind tunnel. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government obviously had a good reason for deviating from the original Bill and inserting sub-clause (12) of clause 3. It did have a good reason. This is the Horgan amendment, inserted to enable Denis Horgan and other powerful Liberal Party tax dodgers to avoid repaying the money which the Prime Minister two months ago was saying they had stolen-$7m in five years. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald a couple of months ago was headed 'How Horgan Dodged $7m in Five Years'. He went on to give the details of the Metro group of companies. I say that this is the Horgan amendment because there is an account in the McCabe-Lafranchi report of the disposal of Treamog Ltd. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The purchases made by Romera Fleur included the purchase of shares in a public company, Treamog Ltd.--</PARA>
<PARA>Sixty per cent of which was ultimately owned by Denis Horgan-</PARA>
<PARA>which was previously Whiteway Sign and Lighting Co. Ltd. That transaction took place on 10 August 1977. Treamog Ltd is the only public company involved in this investigation--</PARA>
<PARA>The McCabe-Lafranchi investigation, of course. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In December 1976 shares in Treamog were purchased by the dealer for a total consideration of $6,180,533. Following those purchases, minority shareholders in the company still had a total of 6,064 shares. The dealer took steps to wipe out the current year profits of the company and later, on 28 February 1977, sold the shares to interests associated with Colin Coghill. Hurley alleges the company was then dividend stripped--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, stripped of accumulated profits-</PARA>
<PARA>by the Coghill organisation without regard to the interests of the minority shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> The shares in Treamog were later repurchased by the dealer on 30 June 1977 and then sold to Romera Fleur on 10 August 1977. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on, but I have read the important part. The important part is that the dealer, who was Maher, purchased the company and took steps to remove the current year profits through a tax avoidance scheme. He purchased it in December. In February it was sold on to Coghill, repurchased by the dealer in June 1977 and sold to Romera Fleur, the shorthand name for the painters and dockers, on 10 August 1977. That series of transactions fits the exemption described by sub-clause (12) of clause 3. </PARA>
<PARA> These are some additional points. Very rarely did the Maher organisation bother to go through the exercise of putting the current year profits through some sort of tax avoidance or attempted tax avoidance arrangement. Maher's methods usually were much cruder. The second point is that Treamog was a public company, about 30 shareholders of which, incidentally, were utimately defrauded of any equity in the company because of the actions of Horgan, Maher and company. But because it was a public company there was an extra reason for being careful in the way in which the transaction was handled. There were minority shareholders who might let other people know what was going on. As it turns out, they did not, but that was an additional constraint. The very fact that it had to be sold on to Coghill to strip the accumulated profits of the company after the current year profits had been stripped means that the books had to be in reasonably good order, otherwise a number of people could have been in legal trouble. Then the company was sold back to Maher before finally being dumped on the painter and docker. </PARA>
<PARA> A few months ago, the Prime Minister had a very puritanical view, not only of tax evasion, but also of tax avoidance. On 30 August, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> In a real sense the recipients of those funds--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, from tax evasion or tax avoidance-</PARA>
<PARA>have in their hands stolen funds whether you want to say stolen from the Commonwealth or stolen from other taxpayers it doesn't matter very much. </PARA>
<PARA>On 27 September, nearly a month later, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the law together with an ethical attitude of society to the people with whom one does business, that makes this country and if we have to legislate for every wrongful act that people might have in mind, then we will be so subsumed in legislation of every kind Sir Lawrence Street and every judge in the land will have to work overtime and never get a Sunday off because so much would have to go to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the Fraser public posture a couple of months ago. The reality is that the Fraser Government writes a clause into this legislation which enables Denis Horgan and others to keep the money which the Prime Minister asserted a couple of months ago they had stolen. We have been given notice that Senator Crichton- Browne and others want a total surrender to the tax dodgers disguised as an innocence clause which would allow all of them to keep the stolen money forever. That will be the subject of debate in the Committee stage. In relation to the revenue implications of clause 3, the Australian Taxation Office estimates that some 700 companies would be exempted by it. That is about 15 per cent of the total. But because many of the companies exempted by that clause were big companies, the lost revenue is likely to be a great deal more than 15 per cent of the estimated loss. It is more likely to be 30 per cent. Treamog is one of the companies whose transactions will be exempted by this clause. At the time of the sale, Treamog had current year profits of $3.7m. Therefore, it had a current year tax liability of $1.7m. That is just one company; there are about 700 of them. Treamog Ltd may be the biggest; I do not know: There are probably people in the Taxation Office who do know. But it was certainly a very big company in terms of the amount of tax avoided and many of the other 700 companies, if not most of the other 700 companies are likewise large. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has said that money for capital works for the relief of unemployment and the alleviation of the present disastrous slump has to be found elsewhere; it cannot be obtained by increasing the Budget deficit. It has to be found by cutting Government expenditure somewhere else. The immediate suggestion is by freezing Public Service wages. But it has probably written off $200m in revenue by the insertion of clause 3 (12). That has exactly the same effect on the deficit, ultimately, as increasing the Budget deficit by $200m to finance capital works. The Government will write off $200m of revenue to oblige Denis Horgan. It has the same effect on the deficit as spending an extra $200m on public works to alleviate unemployment. The public, of course, does not even know that this has happened. It does not know-I repeat-because of the sloth, negligence and incompetence of the Press, whose members apparently would rather devote all their time to chasing each other's early election rumours around the corridors of Parliament House than fulfil their fundamental responsibility to report the news. In the Committee stage, the Australian Labor Party will move to amend the Bill to remove clause 3 (12) from it. I trust that we will get support from the other non-Government senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Before commenting on the innocence clause, I refer again to the letter of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) of 8 November to Mr Willis in response to an earlier inquiry from John Dawkins, who was the acting shadow Treasurer a couple of months ago. The Treasurer gives the most recent estimate of the revenue likely to be recovered by this legislation-a total of $620m. The figure keeps creeping up, which is not surprising as more information comes to light. But the point is that that letter apparently makes no allowance for the loss of revenue pursuant to the insertion in the original Bill of clause 3 (12). The letter goes on to state that there is probably $1,280m in other than current year profits in companies sent to the bottom of the Harbour-dry Slutzkins, which used to be, according to the Prime Minister, morally identical to wet Slutzkins, but since Mr John Reid was caught red-handed being involved in a dry Slutzkin, the Prime Minister says that dry Slutzkins are all right but wet Slutzkins are still thoroughly reprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically the argument put forward by those who support the innocence clause, is that affected by this legislation will be people who did not even know that the transactions were taking place. That may even be true. I do not think that it would be true of many, but it could be true of some. But that is not the point. They are not being subjected to any criminal sanction. All that a few of them-by no means all of them-are being asked to do is to repay the money which they should not have got in the first place. They innocently got the money and they should innocently pay it back, just like the age pensioner who might be overpaid by a clerk in the Department of Social Security and who, when that mistake is discovered, must pay the money back. I agree with that. It was not the pensioner's fault that he or she was overpaid, but the money still has to be paid back. So it should be in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest I forget, I will move the amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill which has been circulated in my name. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) condemns the abject failure of the Treasurer and the Government, knowing of the existence of straw company tax evasion schemes since at least 1978, to respond quickly and effectively to the massive tax evasion occurring through the use of such schemes;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) is of the opinion that the Bill is grossly inadequate in that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) it deals only with company and undistributed profits tax remaining unpaid on current and prior year profits and does not recoup personal income tax lost in relation to accumulated after-tax profits disposed of by vendor shareholders in the same transactions,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) fails to recoup sales tax evaded by the use of straw companies,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) allows for non-recovery of a substantial proportion of the company and undistributed profits tax lost by use of the scheme because of the deliberate exclusion of an important category of use of the scheme, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) provides for more leniency to tax evaders in respect of the time allowed to pay their assessed tax irrespective of the degree of hardship being experienced;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) notes that because of the Bill's deficiencies the sum to be recouped will be far less than that which has been lost through straw company tax evasion schemes; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) calls on the Government to amend the Bill and associated measures so as to ensure that all the tax lost through straw company schemes will be recouped'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has assiduously promoted the myth that it is tough on tax dodgers . I do not have time to quote from some of Mr O'Reilly's letters, written between the middle of 1978 and the end of 1981, but any perusal of the telephone book of documents and Mr O'Reilly's increasingly frantic appeals to the Treasurer to do something about this matter will establish beyond all doubt that this Government was not tough on tax dodgers, and the way in which it has watered down this Bill establishes that it is not tough on tax dodgers. I want to clear the Australian Taxation Office and the Commissioner of Taxation of any culpability. The only legitimate criticism in my view which can be made of the Taxation Office is that it made the mistake of trusting the Attorney-General and his Department. I guess that is a defensible sort of mistake for another government department to have made. The increasingly frantic appeals of the Commissioner of Taxation through 1978, 1979 and 1980 were futile because the Government refused to act, except in one respect. The Committee of which the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), and I believe the Treasurer, were members decided that it would cut back the staff of the Taxation Office thereby making it even harder for it to catch the limited number of tax evaders against which the state of the law, the sloth of the Treasurer the Attorney-General, and, to put it kindly, the incompetence of the Attorney- General's Department, had enabled it to act. The Taxation Office laboured under a host of difficulties that were not of its own making. The same, of course, cannot be said for the Treasurer, the Attorney-General or the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental reason for the Government's continuing negligence in this area is its ambivalent attitude to tax evasion. The Canberra Times of 26 November 1977 published an article headed 'Trust used to minimise tax, Anthony says'. Mr Anthony admits that he has a family trust to minimise, that is avoid, tax. The Prime Minister had a trust which he has publicly admitted he set up to avoid paying probate duty. When he abolished the trust he issued 40,000 company shares to each of his four children. I would like to know the reason for that if not to avoid taxation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I will try to finish in less than five minutes. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to speak a little longer because I think this matter is quite important. Senior members of this Government have always had an ambivalent attitude to tax evasion and tax avoidance. The Prime Minister's shuffling and prevarication in the last couple of months over the retrospectively discovered differences between dry and wet Slutzkins is a case in point. In the item, to which I referred briefly, from the Canberra Times of 26 November 1977 it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, said yesterday that his family trust was used to minimise tax payments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's trust, as the Prime Minister said, was established to minimise probate duty. That is tax avoidance. The trust was ultimately abolished , he said, because probate was abolished. But then, in the case of the family company of Fraser Properties Pty Ltd, immediately after the winding up of the trust, 40,360 shares were issued to each of his four children which makes them together the majority shareholders in the company. </PARA>
<PARA> What of the Government's attitude and its retrospectively discovered difference between dry and wet Slutzkins? The difference was not at all apparent to the Prime Minister on 27 September or 30 August; they were all the same then. We were not ruled by mere law; we were ruled by law plus ethics, so the Prime Minister said. That was so until, of course, Mr John Reid, whom he had just appointed to head an inquiry in to the Public Service, was caught red-handed for involvement in setting up, on behalf of his mates, I know, a dry Slutzkin operation, which, on the admission of Mr Moore, avoided the payment of $45,000 in tax. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the first time. There are matters on the public record for some time before that to show Mr Reid's attitude to tax evasion. For example, on 23 June 1978 the Australian reported a tax accountants' conference in Perth at which the Treasurer was condemning in public 'successive blatantly artificial schemes unrelated to financial or commercial reality.' He was condemning them publicly yet in private he was ignoring the increasingly frantic pleas of the Commissioner of Taxation to do something about it. The Australian article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In response, Mr Reid, of James Hardie Asbestos Ltd, said he was disturbed at Mr Howard's comment. </PARA>
<PARA> Accountants should not be asked to become the ''watchdog'' of society. It was up to the framers of legislation and those in power to draft regulations that adequately managed this role rather than to criticise accountants. </PARA>
<PARA>The newspaper article reports that Mr Reid was loudly applauded which in Perth, the tax dodgers' capital of Australia, is not really surprising. After five years of neglect, inertia and incompetence, two months ago the Government finally moved to recover a tiny fraction of the billions of dollars of tax that had been evaded because of that negligence, inertia and incompetence. The Bill originally introduced on 23 September has now been watered down very seriously. We will seek to amend that Bill to remove the clauses which watered it down. I hope we succeed but, if we do not, we will still vote for the Bill because it is better than nothing-but only just. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.8)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the words of the second reading speech incorporated by the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick), the matters to which the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982, the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax-Vendors) Bill 1982, the Taxation ( Unpaid Company Tax-Promoters) Bill 1982, the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) ( Consequential Amendments) Bill 1982 and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1982 relate have been the subject of considerable public and political debate. Two years ago the Parliament passed the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 which had the effect of outlawing schemes to avoid the payment of company tax by the use of straw companies and straw trusts, schemes that were designed to put a company in a position in which it would be unable to meet its debts. Although that legislation may not have been necessary-we have all read the conflicting opinions of Queen's Counsel in recent times-it was nevertheless effective. The Act was in fact one of many introduced by this Government to curb what might be called artificial schemes of tax avoidance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has put through over 30 pieces of legislation directed against tax avoidance. I mention this aspect because this legislation must be considered in the context of a government that has committed itself to the task of reducing taxation avoidance. To all intents and purposes it is succeeding. Not only has it succeeded in knocking out artificially contrived schemes but also I believe it is the first government in Australia's history to attempt to wrestle with the massive evasion taking place through the cash economy by the scheme that it is proposing for deductions at source of an amount on account of tax in respect of certain payments for labour and services. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with its philosophy, which I applaud, when closing a loophole, it has not been the practice of this Government then to legislate retrospectively to recover tax previously avoided by the use of that loophole. It did not so act in relation to the 1980 Act which outlawed bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Interestingly, there was no public outcry at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the publication in more recent times of certain reports-the McCabe- Lafranchi report and the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union-has very dramatically illustrated the gross impropriety of these schemes and the very large sums avoided by companies which were ultimately scuttled. It is not suprising that both the public and the Government should be incensed that there are within the community those who are prepared to evade tax by stripping a company, transferring shares to non-existent men or men of straw and then burning, shredding or dropping to the bottom of the harbour its books and records. The Government decided in view of these particularly unsavoury circumstances and the objective that the taxation system must be seen to be acting fairly in relation to the total community, and bearing in mind the extent of the avoidance, to introduce this special recoupment legislation. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our normal and general reluctance to introduce legislation having any retrospective element has, on this occasion, been tempered by the competing consideration of overall perceptions as to the equity and fairness of our taxation system and the distribution of the burden. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus, after some initial wavering, the Government acknowledged the retrospective element of the legislation and decided on the balance of principles. I respect the decision the Government reached. It is a position that I would have liked to support. Honourable senators know that on a number of occasions I have spoken of the need for fairness and equity in the taxation system. However, when I weighed the principles I reached a contrary conclusion which I intend to explain and to which I hope to persuade others. One of the great benefits of being on the Liberal side of politics is that one is not forced by the discipline of Caucus to compromise principles. In closing the second reading debate on this subject in the other place the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal Party is the stronger for being able to accommodate within its ranks a healthy and honest debate on matters of principle. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, we will never know the true views of all honourable senators on the other side of the chamber in relation to this subject because of their limitations. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We simply will not know that because once the Caucus has made its decision that decision is final. The vast proportion of the tax avoidance took place by shareholders selling their shares in companies which had an actual or contingent tax liability to a purchaser who was prepared to pay a price that did not discount the value of such shares by the contingent tax liability except by a modest sum-modest in percentage-of perhaps between 5 per cent and 20 per cent of that liability, which was then referred to as the commission. The purchaser or the promotor of the scheme then stripped the company of the commission and scuttled the shell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In weighing principles it is therefore necessary to look at the position of the vendor shareholders and of the promoters, and to look at them separately. The promoter's action is clearly improper, according to all reasonable standards. Furthermore, as far as it is related to the destruction of company books and accounts, failure to lodge returns and so on, such action is illegal. It may be that the action of stripping the company of its assets and putting it in a position in which it is unable to pay its debts is also illegal. Certainly it was the advice of Mr Brinsden, Q.C., to the Commissioner of Taxation as far back as 1974 that such was the case. Certainly the potentials for both criminal and civil proceedings abound. Sections 47, 231 and 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, sections 124, 367 and 374 of the Companies Act, and section 86 of the Crimes Act, to which Senator Walsh referred, come readily to mind. It appears, however, that despite affirmative advice being given back in 1974, no such proceedings have yet been instituted.</PARA>
<PARA> The position of vendor shareholders is more complicated. On a very literal approach it might be said that the vendor shareholder avoided no tax at all, being protected by the corporate veil. However, the shareholder is substantially better off than if the company had paid tax and distributed profits, or even if it had not distributed profits. The ultimate financial position of the shareholder is that by converting the income profit of the company into a capital profit for himself his position is substantially improved. It is, of course, impossible to say what the motive was for the sale by each and every shareholder. It seems reasonable in the circumstances, however, to assume that the motive for many was the financial gain to the shareholder of being able to sell for a price which did not take into account anticipated company tax. The vendor must have then assumed that either the purchaser was a fool or, alternatively, that he had a means of using, offsetting or avoiding the company tax liability. I remind the Senate that before 1978 such schemes abounded. </PARA>
<PARA> The first question to be asked is whether the vendors acted illegally. If they were a party to the ultimate intentions of the promoter, as no doubt in some cases they were, it is very likely that they were acting illegally. Proceedings have not, however, been instituted. If they were not a party to the ultimate intentions the consensus of opinion would appear to be that they were not acting illegally. Whether the Commissioner could have set aside the transaction under section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act was not tested. In these circumstances the Government decided to act to recoup that company tax which the company would have paid if it had remained in the hands of the vendor plus undistributed profit tax. From the vendor it is to recover a sum related to the consideration he has received and from the promoter that sum related to the commission he received which is fixed at 20 per cent of the total tax liability. Recoupment is to take place in transactions which relate back as far as 1972. </PARA>
<PARA> What is imposed is clearly a retrospective tax. A new taxation liability is imposed where it did not exist before. As a matter of principle I object to retrospective tax laws because of what I see as the inherent injustice in such laws. It is no coincidence that the Liberal Party platform is opposed to taxation adjustments having retrospective effect, that retrospective laws are prohibited by the American Constitution and, I think, also by the French Constitution and that in statutory interpretation there is a presumption that laws are not intended to have retrospective application. Together with many judicial expressions over the years they reflect the injustice that can be done to individuals by retrospective legislation. I would have thought that all honourable senators would support the rule of law-the right of certainty before the law and the reasonable expectation that the law will protect those who have acted within its confines. The importance of the need for a degree of certainty, for orderly conduct of business and individual affairs go to the heart of the argument against retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not dispute the power of this Parliament under the Australian Constitution to pass retrospective taxation law. I have, therefore had to consider the arguments advanced by the Government as warranting such drastic action in these particular circumstances. The argument that appears to be most often put forward is that it is manifestly unjust that this avoidance should take place, that the rest of the community has as a result suffered and should be reimbursed. This fairness argument comes in different guises. Some argue that the shifting of the taxation burden by artificial schemes is unfair. Others say that the vendor is only losing a windfall profit, that he is simply holding the tax, albeit in the form of a premium. As I indicated earlier I have some sympathy with these arguments but fairness is a very subjective notion. </PARA>
<PARA> Is tax avoidance via the so-called artificial schemes more unfair than the use of trusts, companies, superannuation funds and partnerships to minimise tax through simple splitting methods apart from others? Is it fair to impose a recoupment tax upon a vendor shareholder because he happens to sell to a promoter who dumps the company as opposed to a promoter who succeeds in legally avoiding the tax-the lottery that the vendor appears to have faced unknown to him at the time? Is it fair when the courts have endorsed a legalistic approach and where vendors first sought legal advice which confirmed the legality of the proposed sale? Is it fair, when we are taught as a matter of law that it is the right of every person to organise his affairs to pay a minimum of taxation, that the rules should now be changed and backdated ten years? What of those people who aid and abet the cash economy-a straight fraud on the revenue? Should they not be required to repay the community? The only distinction is that it is more difficult to determine their identity. In other words, what I am saying is that fairness is a very vague concept to be weighed against what, to me, is a clear and unambiguous principle-the inherent injustice of the imposition of new obligations by retrospective taxation laws. Unfairness is not one-sided. I do not accept the argument put by Senator Walsh that the proposed law involves only recoupment and not penalty. When people organise their affairs according to the law they obviously suffer if they are asked to repay moneys years later-moneys which may have been reinvested and since lost in the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is also important to recognise that there has been a change in tax morality. Bruce Pascoe, President of the Taxation Institute of Australia, said when referring to 1978:</PARA>
<PARA> It is, perhaps, not going too far to say that the tax paying community in Australia almost went mad in its rush to become a party to a tax avoidance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure that the so-called new found tax morality goes much beyond artificially contrived schemes. But even at that level, is it fair to impose today's tax morality on yesterday's tax avoiders? Is it not true that if tax decisions are to be made on the basis of moral judgment about what is fair, the very need for a tax Act is negated? Is not the Government making a subjective judgment to the effect that for the past ten years some people have been morally wrong in their actions and the Government now proposes to pass retrospective legislation to correct their sins? Is not the next step to pass the role of assessing moral standards from the Parliament to the Taxation Commissioner and give him a greater discretion to impose what he sees subjectively as fair? Even Mr Justice Murphy has advised against such a step. I cannot accept the argument that it is fair because the sums concerned are large. Where is the line to be drawn? The principle is the same whether the sums are large or small. The morality of taxation within the law is a personal thing. Even the judiciary exhibits differing standards of tax morality. Viscount Simon in Latilla v. Inland Revenue Commissioners said:</PARA>
<PARA> Judicial dicta may be cited which point out that, however elaborate and artificial such methods may be, those who adopt them are 'entitled' to do so. There is, of course, no doubt that they are within their legal rights, but that is no reason why their efforts, or those of the professional gentlemen who assist them in the matter, should be regarded as a commendable exercise of ingenuity or as a discharge of the duties of good citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA>His views on tax morality are made clear. On the other hand, in Commissioner of Stamp Duties v. Byrnes, Lord MacNaughten said:</PARA>
<PARA> No one may act in contravention of the law. But no one is bound to leave his property at the mercy of the revenue authorities if he can legally escape their grasp. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same case Lord Clyde also said:</PARA>
<PARA> No man in this country is under the smallest obligation, moral or otherwise, so to arrange his legal relations to his business and property as to enable the inland revenue to put the largest shovel in his stores. The inland revenue is not slow to take every advantage open to it under the taxing statutes for the purpose of depleting the taxpayer's pocket . . . The taxpayer is in like manner entitled to be astute to prevent, so far as he honestly can, the depletion of his means by the inland revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>The attitude of those two judges also is apparently clear. The famous New South Wales Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Jordan, looked at these two conflicting views on the morality of taxation in the estate of William Vickers, deceased. He commented. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt those who, like Viscount Simon, regard it as a patriotic duty to pay the largest amount of taxes lawfully exactable will so arrange their transactions as to attract a maximum of liability . . . and those who, like Lord MacNaughten . . . recognise no such duty, will order their affairs so as to incur liability for no more than is legally necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the law is the law. Individual tax morality is something different. Perhaps the greatest indictment of the call for this legislation, for the call to override the principle against retrospectivity, is that we do not even know whether it is necessary. We have only just set up a special prosecutor to pursue criminal and civil remedies. It may well be that another principle is to be sacrificed unnecessarily. The Taxation Institute of Australia stated its views in a recent publication. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> There can never be any justification for retrospectivity of the kind proposed. Such retrospectivity seriously undermines the rule of law, which is the fundamental cornerstone of our democracy. It can and will undoubtedly be used as a precedent for further reprehensible legislation in times to come. </PARA>
<PARA>Such will certainly be the case if the Opposition comes to power because at least to some extent retrospectivity is within its policy. But even the Opposition has difficulty in drawing the line. When I asked Senator Walsh whether the Australian Labor Party planned to include family trusts in retrospective legislation he declined to answer. It depends on a subjective, moral judgment. I have no wish to impose my moral judgment on taxation matters upon anybody else. I do not agree with the Institute that there can never be any justification for retrospectivity, but when the claimed benefits of this Bill are weighed against the injustice of retrospectivity I find the scales firmly fall on the side of the latter. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to end by referring to the need for tax reform. I have accepted before what Professor Mathews said: 'Personal income tax is a voluntary tax for the rich non-salary earner'. The taxation system must be seen to be fair from the outset, not retrospectively made fair. I have argued before that if it is better balanced it can be both more easily enforced and more just. The taxation consequences of a business decision should not depend upon the vehicle used, be it trust, company or partnership. Income tax rates should not be at a level which discourages initiative and incentive and encourages elaborate and contrived tax avoidance. If not anything else, this debate should be a spur to all of us to press ahead for a more equitable, simple and efficient taxation system. </PARA>

He can go down that pathetic little track that he has made if he wants to. I will come back to the issue of fairness versus retrospectivity in a moment. Having stated that I am opposed to the legislation, I now state for the record, as one of the facts of life in this place: 'Be thou as pure as ice, be thou as chaste as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny'. Senator Martyr will realise in a flash that that quotation comes from Shakespeare. I am totally opposed to tax cheats and to those people who, because of their privileged position can avoid tax, whereas pay-as-you-earn wage and salary earners cannot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard tax evasion as, among other things, not stating income earned, understating income or overstating expenses. These are clear-cut cases of evading tax properly due. Then there is the second category of tax avoidance. I am not quite sure what 'tax avoidance' means. One can get clear examples that are quite legal and quite proper. It is not improper to avoid paying a certain amount of tax by inviting one's wife or one's brother to join in a partnership which is earning income. That is an honourable institution that goes back almost to the beginning of English law. That is a tax avoidance mechanism used in many cases. It is perfectly proper and perfectly legal. Every person who has been in business has been advised by an efficient accountant at one stage or another that when his level of income reaches a certain point it is better, for tax- purposes to form a private company than to continue paying tax as a private person or as a partnership. Quite apart from the protection that a company gives a person operating a business, that advice is normally given essentially for the purpose of minimising tax. The minimising tax and avoiding tax mean the same thing but certainly they are not illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> I can remember some very smart life assurance salesmen conning me 25 years ago into paying a hefty insurance premium which I certainly could not afford. But I signed on the dotted line. The thing that finally swung me was the fact that by signing a policy to mature at the age of 60 or 65, I would be receiving a handsome benefit and at the same time I would be avoiding tax. I remember the salesman's words. He said: 'If you sign this the tax man will pay half your premiums'. Are we getting to the stage where we say that that is improper? It is certainly tax avoidance. I have a great deal of confusion in my mind as to when an arrangement made by a taxpayer is proper or improper. This is where the subjectivity referred to by Senator Hill in his excellent speech becomes a problem. If we take fairness as the criterion of whether retrospective legislation should be applied, the fairness will depend on the judgment of the government, the Treasurer or the Prime Minister of the day. What might be fair to one person might not be fair to another. </PARA>

I have no problem identifying that and saying that it should not be allowed to go on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A great number of schemes are entered into which one could well argue are proper. Senator Walsh referred to the Prime Minister's family trust schemes. I have not one, but I cannot see anything terribly improper in a situation where a person is able to minimise his or her income tax. One of the great problems in this area, in my view, was caused by Sir Garfield Barwick and his then colleagues on the High Court of Australia when they virtually torpedoed the powers of the Commissioner of Taxation under section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act which in effect said that if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, a contract was entered into essentially or primarily for the purpose of escaping tax, the Commissioner had the power to declare it void. It was unfortunate that the Barwick decision torpedoed that sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> One could argue also that the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, as we know them, no doubt were artificial and should not have been permitted. They should have been stopped as soon as they were discovered. When that was we do not know because the Government will not produce the documents to the Senate that have been asked for by Senator Evans and the Australian Democrats. We still have not given up hope of obtaining those documents, but it would seem fairly clear that as early as 1978 the present Government did know about bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and no action was taken. I suggest that this would have made it unnecessary for these particular Bills to be brought before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> What is a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme? I place on the record my oversimplistic concept of such a scheme. Subsequent speakers may for the record and for people who will, no doubt, devour as a study of what is right and what is wrong every word that is spoken in this debate by honourable senators correct me if I am wrong in my judgment of it. Let us assume that a man and his wife are in business and call themselves Melbourne Bakeries Pty Ltd. Let us assume that last year they made a profit of $100,000 and that a Mr Maher, or some other unscrupulous crook like him, approaches the couple who have no knowledge of law, no knowledge of tax and are barely literate; but they have run a business, the Melbourne Bakeries, for many years. The promoter gets them to sign a few documents, forms another company called Melbourne Bakehouse Pty Ltd-a company very similar in name, with the same address-and transfers all the assets, including machinery, ovens, goodwill and furniture, from Melbourne Bakeries Pty Ltd to Melbourne Bakehouse Pty Ltd. But he leaves $100,000 in the bank account of the original company, Melbourne Bakeries Pty Ltd, which fortuitously, to make the example easy, represents the profit that the couple made last year. On that $100,000, the company owes $46,000 in tax which it has not paid. Before the assessment comes in Mr Maher offers the couple $80,000 for the company. They grab the offer with alacrity because they are elderly and they see an opportunity to take $80,000 and buy a little shack at Gosford, on the Gold Coast , or in some other pleasant place, in which to live out their days. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation, as I understand it, will reclaim $46,000 from that couple who did not mean to do anything crooked and who were advised correctly by their lawyer or accountant that in 1972 what they were doing was legal. Now, 10 years later, when they are 67 years of age, they suddenly receive a demand from the Australian Taxation Office to pay $46,000. The Prime Minister talks about fairness and the Treasurer talks about equity. That does not seem terribly fair to me. That is why in the Committee stage I will move an amendment-the celebrated so-called innocence clause. This clause has two components; namely, the onus will be on the taxpayers to prove, firstly, innocence and, secondly, hardship. If they can prove those two things, I believe that they ought to escape the provisions of this legislation. The bottom-of-the-harbour scheme that I have just mentioned was good for that couple because they received $80,000 for something which virtually was worth $54,000. The very good point might well be made that surely, if someone offered them an amount which was so far in excess of what the company was worth they should have smelled a rat. They should have said: 'What are you after?'. That is a fair point. But had they done so, they would have then said to their lawyer or accountant: 'Look, I don't want to do anything shady. Is this legal?' In many cases this kind of scheme was legal. There is no question at all about that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a very good interjection by Senator Walters. If they did not know about the transaction what they did was not immoral; if they knew, it was immoral. I am saying that provision ought to be made for those people who did not do something which they knew to be immoral or improper but something which was legal. I do not think that the purpose of this Parliament is to legislate for morality. I do not want to score a point off Senator Walters because she and I have many tussles on the question of morality and the capacity or place of parliaments in legislating for morality. I have said for many years, since I was Minister for Customs and Excise, that parliaments cannot and should not try to legislate for morality. They should make the law and people who abide by the rule of law should be able to live unencumbered by governments or their instrumentalities. Under this arrangement the promoter does very well, too, because he obtains $100,000 cash to put in his bank account. He has paid only $ 80,000 for the company, so he is $20,000 in front. The old couple who own the bakery also do very well out of it. I have no sympathy whatsoever with the promoter in regard to what is done to him. That would be all right with me. I am worried about the innocent and the principle involved. In answer to the interjection by Senator Walters, I say that the actions of the promoters and of those who knowingly went into bottom-of-the-harbour schemes was contemptible but nevertheless legal. One asks: Why has the Fraser Government changed its attitude ? I quote the Prime Minister, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> How can we cope with artificial schemes? I do not know whether there is merit in the suggestion put forward in respect of these schemes because one has to be fair to Consolidated Revenue and taxpayers generally and to individuals who have been advised by their accountants or lawyers that a tax avoidance scheme or a tax minimisation scheme is proper. If somebody's lawyer or accountant says to him: 'If you do this you will minimise tax', how is he to know whether a future government, be it Labor or Liberal, will not go back five years and say: 'We are going to undo what you did in 1982; we are going to legislate retrospectively'? That sort of thing is not satisfactory for governments; it is not satisfactory for individuals. Is it not possible to have an arrangement under which a taxpayer who is advised by his accountant or lawyer that a scheme is legal is able to notify the Taxation Commissioner of that scheme and the Taxation Commissioner has to refer the matter to the government of the day and within three months and the government has to come back and say that the scheme is all right or that if that person goes ahead with that scheme, which the government regards as an aritifical scheme, the government will legislate to make it void. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp concentrated on retrospectivity but ignored the question of fraud, and I think that is the downfall of his argument. I will come to that matter in a few minutes. We are debating the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982. I think it is most appropriate at this point to quote Oliver Wendell Holmes, who said: 'Taxes are the price we pay for a civilised society'. I believe that those words bear thinking about. Nobody likes to pay tax but we all like to live in a civilised society. I believe it is just and fair for everyone, according to his means, to pay his share for the privilege of living in the civilised society which we so proudly call our home.</PARA></TALK.START>

I cannot accept the example put up by Senator Chipp of a business couple who ran such a good bakery that they made a very large profit at the end of the year and, when offered $25,000 more than that business was worth once it had been stripped of all its assets, did not think anything was wrong, did not ask any questions and did not think that anything was going to happen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Senator Chipp will not get time to say so. He has certainly thrown me off balance. I return to those so-called 'innocent people'. As most people would know Eric Risstrom and the Taxpayers' Association spoke out early in the piece, saying that they could not support the retrospective legislation on any account. The Association made some comments that I found most interesting. I will read a small passage from the November 1982 journal. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although no one likes legislation with any smell of Retrospectivity, it would certainly be surprising if the legislation isn't passed in the form that's just been announced. We feel any 'innocence clause' would find everyone innocent!</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Eric Risstrom was saying that everyone would make some sort of claim that he did not know, he did not ask questions, he was treated as though he were completely dumb. I believe it is very similar to the situation on a street corner when one is offered a watch at half its value. One is told: 'Do not ask any questions as to where it came from or I might tell you it fell off the back of a truck. You can have this watch at half its value so long as you pretend you are dumb enough. You do not have to admit to yourself that you might be acting in some sort of collusion'. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to deal now with the matter about which Senator Chipp was most concerned -the retrospective side of the legislation. I wish to make it perfectly clear that this is not a new tax. It is new legislation to implement machinery to collect legal company tax that has not been paid. The retrospective nature of the Bills is that the machinery will enable the collection of tax payable as far back as 1 January 1972 and up to December 1980 when the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was passed and successfully put a stop to all bottom-of-the- harbour schemes. There has been a lot of heartache in regard to the retrospective side of this legislation. Some of my colleagues cannot bring themselves to vote for these Bills. I respect their feelings on this matter. It just happens that I do not agree with them. The Commissioner of Taxation has already stated his opinion. He has said that while the law exists to prosecute these tax offenders, the machinery does not exist to allow collection of the money. That is what Senator Chipp has ignored. The Commissioner of Taxation has said that the legislation exists to prosecute these people, but we want the money. No machinery exists to enable the collection of that illegally evaded money. Senator Chipp kept saying that it was legally evaded money. He would not admit to the fraud side of this matter. It is only because of the existence of an element of fraud that the Government has gone along with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are simply putting forward machinery legislation to enable the collection of illegally evaded tax. I think that is the crux of the whole of this legislation. The Government must protect all taxpayers. It must not allow the situation to develop in which one section of the community, just because its members are taxed under the pay-as-you-earn system, ends up paying its fair share of tax while those who are not in the PAYE system, who believe they can indulge in these immoral, smart-Alick tricks, can end up bragging at the end of the year-I have heard people do it-'Look, I haven't paid tax for years'. The tax system must be fair and just. This Government will not allow that situation I have mentioned to develop. </PARA>
<PARA> From the moment it took office the Government has focused on tax avoidance legislation. Senator Walsh was critical that the Government has not acted quickly enough. I admit that this was a very slow and a very complex issue that had to be undertaken. It took time. It took longer than I would have liked it to take. But the Opposition cannot tell me that there was no tax avoidance in the Labor Government's era. The Labor Government was just not interested. It did not ask the Australian Taxation Office for any estimates of tax avoidance between 1972 and 1975. It was just not interested. There was one instance when Mr Crean, the then Treasurer, put out a news release in December 1974 relating to the Curran scheme that was then costing the taxpayer a considerable amount of money. He said he would bring in legislation in the autumn session of Parliament to close that loophole. That was in December 1974. The autumn session came and went , the spring session came and went and by December of the following year, when this Government took office, that Labor Government still had not brought in any legislation to cover the Curran scheme. That is the whole record of the Labor Government against tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition now says that this Government did not bring in legislation soon enough and that we have not done enough. It seems that, with its past performance, this sudden show of interest in tax avoidance and this sudden concern that legislation was not passed earlier, is very touching. I seek leave to have a document outlining my Government's record incorporated in Hansard. This document shows the Government's record from 1977 to the present day. It shows that the Government has indeed saved the taxpayer about $3,000m.</PARA>

He was quoting Mr Risstrom who said that he believed that tax avoidance and evasion was costing Australian taxpayers $7,000m per annum. Of course, Mr Risstrom was referring also to the cash economy. He said that $4,000m of that total amount was due to the cash economy that Senator Hill spoke about today. But Mr Hayden ignored that aspect altogether.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Let us now turn to the method of collecting the tax. When the Government first introduced the legislation in September, we had only the vendor shareholders of the company being liable. This has now been extended to include the promoters. The inclusion of the promoters is one of the most important aspects of the amendments that the Government brought in. I again quote from the Taxpayers Association. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inclusion of a 'promoter class' in the legislation will put a chill into many who were on the sidelines of the tax-avoidance industry. There are some very significant changes and, perhaps far more than anything else to date, they will spell the virtual end of artificial tax-avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA>Bearing in mind that the Taxpayers Association is basically against this legislation, I believe that that will explain better than anything else can that by including the promoters, the people who go around seeking these illegal actions, they can take note, and it will spell the virtual end of artificial tax avoidance schemes. The Association goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Not only are the 'promoters' and their associates going to be liable for one- fifth of the company tax unpaid, but now . . . any one of them (and no matter how small or insignificant their role) can find themselves liable for a share of the company tax unpaid. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Walsh was very crtitical and he said that we had watered down our legislation. Apart from Government members not agreeing with him-and I do not think that any Government members would agree that in any way this legislation has been watered down-the Taxpayers Association, and Mr Risstrom in particular, say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill hasn't been watered-down. The changes merely recognise that in many cases it would be impossible for the vendor shareholders to sell enough assets quickly enough to avoid crippling interest hitting them harder. It isn't an amnesty-that suggests a pardon if you own up within a nominated period. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not an amnesty at all. I think that Senator Walsh is just being political in talking about watering down. I should like to finish by clarifying the situation as I see it. The Government is not introducing retrospective tax. There is no new tax. The retrospectivity applies to the machinery legislation that enables the illegally unpaid tax to be collected right back to 1972. The tax is legal company tax, often already assessed, applying to profit already made, which has been illegally evaded, which has not been collected, and which has been illegally avoided. The Government is introducing machinery legislation to collect that unpaid tax from those who illegally avoided it and those who set up illegal artificial schemes and who were paid to do so. I believe that all those who collected as a benefit the money that rightfully should have been paid to the Commissioner of Taxation should be made to pay that, and that is all that this legislation will do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982 and four other related Bills which are primarily concerned with imposing retrospectively upon certain vendor shareholders a new taxation, equivalent to the amount that has been evaded by subsequent shareholders who purchased the companies from either the vendor shareholders or shareholders who purchased from the vendors. My first fundamental objection to this legislation is that which I have to any legislation which retrospectively imposes a penalty. My second objection is that the legislation, in imposing this new and retrospective taxation, does not seek to distinguish between those vendor-shareholders who received a benefit as a result of evading taxation and in so doing committed an offence under a number of present laws and those vendor-shareholders who acted strictly within the law and committed no offence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been said by Lon Fuller that King Rex's bungling career as a legislator and a judge illustrates that the attempt to create and maintain a system of legal rules may miscarry in at least eight ways. There are eight distinct routes to disaster and one of those eight ways is the abuse of retrospective legislation which not only cannot itself guide action but also undercuts the integrity of rules prospective in effect since it puts them under threat of a retrospective change in the future. It has been reasonably argued that a total failure in any one of these eight directions does not simply result in bad law. It results in something that is not properly called a legal system at all. Certainly there can be no rational grounds for asserting that a man can have a moral obligation to obey a legal rule that does not exist or that comes into existence after he has acted. The United States Constitution provides that no Bill of attainment or ex post facto law shall be passed by the Congress. Part 5 of section 23 of the New Hampshire Constitution of 1784 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Retrospective laws are highly injurious, oppressive and unjust. No such laws therefore should be made, either for the decision of civil causes, or the punishment of offences. </PARA>
<PARA>Retrospectivity is outlawed also by the French code, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which has been ratified by Australia. So strong was the principle against retrospectivity that when the American Constitution was being drafted two framers of that Constitution who later became judges of the Supreme Court of the United States urged that prohibition against ex post facto laws was unnecessary. One of those gentlemen was moved to observe, during one constitutional debate, that there was 'no lawyer, no civilian who would not say that ex post facto laws were void of themselves'. The courts have over very many years expressed grave concern at retrospective legislation and have consistently ruled that only when legislation specifically and categorically states the intention of retrospectivity can it be read as retrospective. This concern has been expressed particularly when it relates to taxation and commercial transactions. If the law is not certain commercial transactions cannot be carried out in an atmosphere of certainty and men will not be able to arrange their affairs to achieve the legal result which they intend. Lord Simmons in Russell v. Scott had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> My Lords there is a maxim of income tax law which, though it may sometimes be overstressed, yet ought not be forgotten. It it that the subject is not to be taxed unless the words of the taxing statute unambiguously impose the tax upon him. It is necessary that this maxim should on occasion, be reasserted and this is such an occasion. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement of the legal position has also been reinforced in a number of cases and the rule which, according to those authorities, is to be applied is thus clearly defined in Maxwell's On Statutes. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a fundamental rule of English law that no statute shall be construed so as to have a retrospective operation, unless such a construction appears very clearly in the terms of the Act or arises by necessary and distinct implication.</PARA>
<PARA>Maxwell goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps no rule of construction is more firmly established than this, that a retrospective operation is not to be given to a statute so as to impair an existing right or obligation, otherwise than as regards matter of procedure, unless that effect cannot be avoided without doing violence to the language of the enactment. </PARA>
<PARA> If the enactment is expressed in language which is fairly capable of either interpretation it ought to be construed as prospective only. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The courts have held that it is chiefly where the enactment would prejudicially affect vested interests, or the legality of past transactions, or impair contracts that the rule in question prevails. Every statute it has been said, which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, or imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability in respect of transactions or considerations already past, must be presumed, out of respect to the legislature to be intended not to have a retrospective operation.</PARA>
<PARA>As I say, the reason why the courts have taken such a position is their strong opposition to retrospectivity, particularly where it imposes an additional and new burden or penalty. As the courts concede, where the Act specifically states its intention to have a retrospective character, there is nothing that the courts can do but to interpret it accordingly. But their opposition to retrospectivity is manifest in their comments and the strict interpretation that they impose upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> While the courts do all that is possible to ascertain the meaning of a taxing Act, they regard the imposition of a tax as of such importance as it is incumbent upon the legislator to make the Act's intentions clear beyond doubt. To quote Dr Gerard Nash:</PARA>
<PARA> Once retrospectivity is accepted the decision as to where to draw the line is totally subjective. The disease can spread to laws of criminality, contract, land ownership or any other area of activity. All people should be subject equally to the law, including Government, but retrospectivity puts Government above the law, not under it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very profound observation from Dr Gerard Nash. The Liberal Party is not the only party that in the past has expressed grave concern and reservations about the element of retrospectivity in taxation legislation. I refer the Senate to an article by Brian Toohey in the Australian Financial Review of 12 April 1978 which discussed the likely fate of the Curran scheme legislation. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many Opposition members are uncomfortable about appearing to side with wealthy tax dodgers even if they don't like the idea of retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Referring to the same subject in the Age of 17 April 1978, Michelle Grattan said :</PARA>
<PARA> When the legislation was announced the Opposition Leader, Mr Hayden said he did not like the retrospectivity . . . Labor opponents of retrospectivity are in a bind. They are very much in favour of getting money from wealthy tax dodgers, but they fear retrospectivity could set a precedent later used in other areas and so endanger civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same subject, in the National Times of 22 April 1978 Paul Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA> One group of opponents to the legislation--</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the Curran scheme legislation-</PARA>
<PARA>were opponents to the principle of retrospectivity, a position to which Bill Hayden is sympathetic. </PARA>
<PARA>We were also told later in the National Times that:</PARA>
<PARA> Leader Bill Hayden has told colleagues that he is strongly opposed to retrospectivity on principle. </PARA>
<PARA>That doubt-that concern-that temporary integrity-seems to have been washed away with his unbridled ambition to seek office. </PARA>
<PARA> I am moved to question why this Government has chosen now to introduce this tax recoupment legislation. What new knowledge has come to the Government since 27 June 1982 when the Treasurer (Mr Howard) told us that the Australian Taxation Office and the Government have known of the full extent of such schemes since 1979 or 1980? It was the knowledge of these and other activities that prompted the Government to introduce the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act of 1980. If there was any question of the laws in place in 1978 being effective to prosecute the guilty and recover the tax evaded and according to Costigan and a number of other authoritative and eminent legal opinions they were effective, then the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act of 1980 certainly provided the Government with all the necessary legislation it required to put these schemes to rest. The very purpose of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 was to deal with and to stop those schemes now described as bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The very nature of the Treasurer's response on 27 June to the McCabe-Lafranchi report leads me to question the reason for or the need to have this legislation presently before us . When responding to that report, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the most unfortunate aspects of the publication of the report is that it was used to create the false impression that this was new information or new schemes with dramatic new revenue losses. This clearly is not the case. In fact the only new feature of the report was that for the first time tax avoidance and evasion of this kind was personalised as individuals and companies were identified by name . . . without wanting to labour the fact that neither details of the schemes nor the revenue losses involved came as a surprise to us, it is worth recalling some of the things that I said at the time of introducing our remedial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have so frequently said in recent weeks the practices described in the schemes outlined in this report were the target of the Crimes (Taxation Offences ) Act passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in December 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>That legislation took two years in its preparation, drafting and presentation. The reason that legislation took two years is that the Government was particularly concerned and the Treasurer, to his everlasting credit, took great care to ensure that that legislation was impeccably fair and reasonable. The areas of prime concern to which the Government was directing its energies were to ensure that no innocent people should be accidently caught by the provisions of the legislation and, particularly, that there should be no shifting of the burden of the onus of proof onto the taxpayer. These are the areas of concern that taxed the Department of the Treasury, the former Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Australian Taxation Office for nearly two years. Of course, at that time there was absolutely no thought of introducing any element of retrospectivity. Great care was taken to ensure that it was to be excluded. The Treasurer tabled the various documents in the House of Representatives, pursuant to a resolution of the Senate of 9 September. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There was particular concern and care about the onus of proof provisions. I make no apology for having evidenced such concern. I personally felt considerable care should be taken to ensure the protection of the innocent. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is worth recalling that such was the concern of the Federal Government, notwithstanding a very clear and broad knowledge of company stripping and trust stripping, to ensure that the law was not draconian in its application or retrospective in its effect and mindful of the seriousness of the steps being taken, it was prepared to sacrifice two years of lost revenue to ensure that it did not implement bad legislation. Now we have legislation that not only has absolute retrospectivity as an element but which also removes the onus of proof. The Government has legislated to ensure that there is no innocence at all. The Treasurer in explaining, quite properly, the various reasons for the delay until 1980 in introducing the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill made the very reasonable point that until that time community attitude was one of tolerance towards tax avoidance and tax minimisation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The point is that public attitudes against tax avoidance were only in their formative stages at the time the schemes described in the report were reaching their peak in 1977 and 1978 and were, therefore, nowhere near as pronounced as they are today. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> These attitudes have of course, hardened considerably in recent years. Public hostility has grown, as tax avoidance practices have received considerable publicity and as the Government has intensified its campaign against them. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Hence without wanting to downplay in any sense the significance of the schemes covered in the report, it is clearly important to recognise the considerable different state of mind of public opinion towards tax avoidance that existed at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>If, as the Treasurer said, prior to 1978 tax avoidance was tolerated and that was one of the fundamental reasons the Government did not act earlier, are we now to condemn or condone-honourable senators can make their own choice- retrospective morality? Is the Government saying that it is now legislating to impose today's values on yesterday's attitudes? As I understand the Government's logic, it perceived during the 1970s that the community did not frown on tax minimisation or tax avoidance; that because they had the moral imprimatur of the community they were perfectly legal. Accordingly, the Government felt that it did not have the community's support, or a mandate from the electorate, to make illegal, what was then legal. However, as the community's view changed the Government was able to legislate in accordance with its perception of the newly evolving attitude of society towards tax avoidance. In 1980 the perception was that tax avoidance was immoral and ought to be outlawed. Therefore, the Government acted accordingly. Now, in 1982, the Government is decreeing that according to its perception of the community view a very harsh and heavy financial penalty should be retrospectively visited upon people who, in some cases as long as 10 years ago, acted within the law of the land and within the framework of society's standards and values. The Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The significant shift in public attitudes in recent years has been most welcome and it is in no small way due to this Government's concerted campaign against tax avoidance and tax evasion practices. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe all liberal senators share that view. However, I would be very concerned if I thought that this Government were a willing party in joining with the Opposition in arousing passions, indignation and anger amongst the community by extravagant and inflammatory statements in order to be able to implement retrospectively confiscatory legislation. That is an unhealthy way to govern. History has many sobering reminders of its danger. Perhaps, while contemplating the Government's response to changing community views, we ought to draw a distinction between society's views on tax avoidance and society's views on retrospectivity. I refer the House to a survey conducted in past weeks by the Gallup poll organisation. By and large those polls are pretty precise in reflecting judgments. The survey shows that 58 per cent of Australians are opposed to retrospective legislation, that only 34 per cent are in favour of it. What I find interesting also is that 67 per cent of those polled drew the conclusion that most Australians do not declare their full taxable income on their taxation returns each year. One can only speculate, but I think it is reasonable to assume, that that 67 per cent figure reflects the present state of the cash economy, which has been variously judged to be costing the Federal Treasury between $10 billion and $13 billion a year. </PARA>

In fact, as has been conceded by both the Government and the Taxation Office, had that Office been given the proper legal advice prior to 1978 we would not now have on the statute books the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. It would never have been implemented. We are told that one case of company stripping came to the attention of a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation as early as 1973. The Commissioner of Taxation and his Office ought to be commended for their unrelenting pursuit of tax avoiders, tax evaders and company strippers. They sought in every way possible to ensure that the proper laws of the day were implemented. But they were denied the opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1975 Mr Brinsden, Q.C., now a judge of the Supreme Court of Western Australia-stated in respect to a stripped company that grounds existed for prosecution under section 67 of the Companies Act and section 86 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act; that proceedings could be initiated under section 367B of the Companies Act. Nothing was done. In 1978 Ormiston and Spry, Q.C., gave advice that there were available to the Commissioner of Taxation arguments which would enable him to recover taxation from a stripped company. In 1978 there was a further opinion from Traile, Q.C. In September 1978 Webb, Q.C., advised that those involved in stripping could be liable for a criminal conspiracy at common law or, alternatively, a specific offence under the Commonwealth Crimes Act and that the tax liability could be recovered. In November 1980 N. H. M. Forsyth, Q. C., of the Victorian Bar gave advice that proceedings against company strippers could be initiated under a number of Acts, which would include the recovery of tax liability. He observed:</PARA>
<PARA> It passes my comprehension why proceedings of this kind have not been instituted under the existing law. </PARA>

<PARA> Nor is it clear why, despite the existence of such provisions as S231 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and of relevant provisions in companies legislation and in the Crimes Acts of the Commonwealth and of the various States and Territories, prosecutions were not commenced against any persons who were responsible through illegal acts for preventing the recovery of tax which was due to the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>The very great tragedy is that not one of these opinions was tested in law by way of a prosecution and all were offered prior to the introduction in 1980 of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. It is not without significance to note that the only prosecutions that have been implemented against certain individuals in respect of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes have been launched under 86E of the Crimes Act-an Act which was available in 1972. The Treasurer, in his statement of 25 July, conceded this:</PARA>
<PARA> The Solicitor-General has now advised, in relation to a particular case, that action is available primarily against people other than the vendor shareholders under Commonwealth and State laws--</PARA>
<PARA>That is present State and Commonwealth laws-</PARA>
<PARA>that offer avenues for recovery through procedures under the Companies Act whereby funds could be restored to the stripped company to enable it to meet the as yet unsatisfied income tax assessments that had been raised on it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The appropriate authorities will, no doubt, wish to consider whether in this and the numerous other cases that have occurred the evidence that is or becomes available warrants civil or criminal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>That confirms my view on those matters which I have referred to during my speech . In my view this legislation is not necessary. However, in respect of this legislation the Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the revenue implications and having regard to the fraudulent nature of the scheme, the Government has concluded that, in the public interest, it must act to provide a simple and more certain avenue of recovery of the evaded company tax by way of the vendor shareholders who benefitted from the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>To me that is a very inadequate, poor and unreasonable course of action to be taken by the Commonwealth Government. The long and the short of those paragraphs from the Treasurer's statement is that in the cases so far examined no action rests against the vendor shareholders, presumably because they have committed no offences, and the Government now fully concedes and recognises that existing laws are more than adequate to satisfy its intentions. However, it wants the money quickly and it wants the money from those people from whom it can quickly get it, irrespective of their responsibility or any illegality or irrespective of any offence they may have committed. This is all in the name of public interest. What the public interest is has not been made clear. I have always thought that a miscarriage of justice, against an individual or in a collective sense, is contrary to the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> As we learn from Costigan, Q.C., in his report, he was advised by a senior officer of the Taxation Office that as a consequence of false advice from the Perth Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office-which claimed in essence that the current laws were not adequate for prosecution or recovery of evaded tax in the case of company stripping schemes-two years were spent preparing and introducing the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act of 1980, which should never have been introduced in the first place. Mr Costigan said:</PARA>
<PARA> Thus the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia was induced to enact new criminal laws of great breadth and scope when all that was required was the enforcement of the existing laws. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The only reason why the former laws were not effective to inhibit their breach was because those laws were not enforced. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not in any way condemn, criticise or downplay the magnificent contribution and role that this Government, over seven years, has played in pursuit of tax avoidance and tax evasion. It has closed more loopholes than any other government since Federation. That is highly commendable. I in no way criticise the Taxation Office which, as I said, in unrelenting pursuit, has endeavoured, with concern and anxiety, to collect that tax which is available to it under the existing laws. It is very regrettable that it was provided with wrong, poor, inadequate and incompetent information which in very many ways inhibited the proper implementation of the laws. I find it very regrettable that the Government has not chosen to apply the full force of the existing laws but instead has chosen the expedient and dangerous path of introducing this legislation now before us. </PARA>
<PARA> If I am going to refer, as I have, in a very unkind way to the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth I remind the Senate also-there have been suggestions made in this place and in another place, by an unfortunate creature, that the Liberal Party had some role in this-that the only solicitor in that Office who has been identified so far, a Mr Bercove-whom we have read about so often-is a member of the Australian Labor Party. He signed an advertisement, as a member of the Australian Labor Party legal fraternity, supporting the ALP. I hear all about people on our side but not one of those people in the Perth Crown Solicitor's Office is a member of the Liberal Party. The Opposition ought to look a bit closer at Mr Bercove and what he is supposed to have done. I intend to say no more about the question of innocence. I would have been delighted to have dealt with those rather disappointing and inadequate observations of Senator Walters in respect of innocence but I will save them for when I move the amendment on the innocent clause, of which I have given contingent notice. </PARA>

It had all the enthusiasm of Custer's last stand on behalf of the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party. His speech was largely devoted to the strippers who, I understand, were part of the business of Mr Bercove when he operated from the Attorney-General's Department in Western Australia in pursuit of the State motto of 'Relax in a State of excitement'. I really find it extraordinary that the debate should be reduced to the level to which it has been reduced. It really is about some fairly simple sorts of issues. I understand Senator Crichton-Browne to be saying that there was a whoopee period in the middle of the 1970s when the Government did not pursue tax evasion or tax avoidance, and that some change in community attitudes has been brought about by this Government and therefore this retrospective legislation is being introduced.

<PARA> I begin by reminding the Senate of the importance of the issue of tax evasion and tax avoidance. I do so by quoting from a speech by Professor Russell Mathews , a Government adviser, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if the same enthusiasm were to be shown by the Commonwealth for controlling revenue collections as for controlling Government expenditures, higher rates of taxation would not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> In an earlier paper, I have estimated conservatively that something like 20 per cent of personal income tax nominally payable is being lost to revenue through avoidance and evasion, usually by high-income taxpayers other than wage and salary earners. Quite apart from the unfortunate effects on the distribution of the tax burden, this revenue loss has had a direct impact on the size of the public sector Budget deficit, the level of Government borrowing, the rate of growth of the money supply and the level of interest rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is Professor Mathews, a Government adviser, on the question of tax avoidance and evasion, which is the subject of the legislation now before the Senate. On Monday of this week the Government announced that in order to get out of its economic difficulties, as it perceives them, and in order not to increase further the size of the deficit, it would implement if possible a wages pause in the public sector and use public sector wages to provide employment creating schemes. It suggested further that that pause should flow through to the private sector and, indeed, to all sections of the community. I am very skeptical about whether that will happen and I am even more skeptical about whether it would work. What is important about the Government's suggestion is the recognition that this country is in a time of economic crisis and that people will be called upon necessarily to make sacrifices in order to contribute to a solution of that crisis. That is a vastly different atmosphere from which existed in the late 1970s and in 1980-81 in connection with tax evasion and avoidance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problems which Professor Russell Mathews identifies as being basically wrong, structurally, with the Australian economy are, in his view, largely attributable to tax evasion and tax avoidance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator listens to what I am saying he may be able to put it all together himself without getting into the difficulties he is getting into. It is in that context that we approach this debate. These Bills represent a very limp response to one of the greatest tax scandals, and economics scandals, that this country has known. From the very beginning this Government has been spineless on the issue of tax fairness. Senator Crichton- Browne keeps talking about fairness for tax evaders and avoiders. He ought to look at the distribution of tax in this community, at the income tax burden now as distinct from what it was when this Government came to power, and talk a little about tax fairness in that area as distinct from tax fairness for those who have broken the law. Senator Crichton-Browne says the only successful prosecutions have been launched under section 86 (1) (e) of the Crimes Act. I do not know how successful they have been, but the section says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A person who conspires with another person . . . to defraud the Commonwealth or a public authority under the Commonwealth, shall be guilty of an indictable offence. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a provision which has not been used very much. Senator Crichton-Browne suddenly finds it very attractive compared with the present legislation. Of course it ought to have been used and of course the provisions of the 1980 legislation ought to have been used. These provisions have not been used because in this whole sorry episode there has been a reluctance of will to use them. What we are talking about in this context is an issue of fundamental public morality. That is the issue we are talking about, not nice little legal loopholes and how they can be plugged or unplugged. That is something that this Government has been pretty weak on because it cannot go to people in this community and say that they cannot have a pension rise or that they have to have a wage pause or any of these things if it has tolerated this sort of thing for the period over which it has tolerated it-that is, from 1977. One has only to read the telephone book of documents tabled in this place when the Government finally got caught on this issue to realise the Government's knowledge of this matter over a long time. That is the fundamental question which has to be debated. A government cannot with any credibility ask people on low incomes to make sacrifices, to make hard decisions, unless its own house is in order on this fundamental question of collecting revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole sorry episode has illustrated the extent to which the Government has been prepared to preside over, and indeed engender, inequities in this country. This Government has not governed on this issue in the interests of the many. It is the interests of the few that have been looked after and are still being sought to be looked after in the context of this debate. In the course of debate on this legislation we have had evidence of culpable negligence by senior Ministers, such as the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard). We have had evidence of criminal delays in Government departments, including sections such as the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth. We have had evidence of gross tax dodging activities by senior Liberals, such as Mr Horgan. We have had prime ministerial fudging and hypocrisy on this issue, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has changed his view on whether this question involves the recovery of stolen money or whether the various categories of stolen money have to be looked at, and we have had the extraordinary growth of cunning tax lawyers, corporate accountants and the like who have fed and fuelled this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> What does this legislation do to try to rectify this dreadful situation? First of all, it provides for basic conditions under which promoters and shareholders become liable for unpaid company taxes and undistributed taxes. These provisions are retrospective. I have no concern about these provisions being retrospective, because while every honourable senator ought to be concerned about retrospective legislation it should not be a veil behind which cowards hide. Surely a greater social morality than that is involved in this matter. For every judgment of the House of Lords that Senator Crichton-Browne can dig up in support of his case I can dig up another dozen which put a quite contrary view in relation to retrospectivity in tax legislation. This is not a question that bothered the Government much when it legislated retrospectively in relation to the Curran schemes-not to the extent that it bothers it now-and the reason was that not as many prople in the Liberal Party were caught up in Curran schemes as have been caught up in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. That is why the question of retrospectivity really bothers some supporters of the Government now and becomes a veil behind which they try to hide in dealing with this fundamental question of public morality and ethics. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the things I have mentioned this legislation imposes liabilities on promoters for 20 per cent of the tax liability. It provides for increased late payment penalties. But the legislation is deficient in a number of respects . Firstly, it deals only with company and undistributed profit tax which remains unpaid. It does not recoup personal income tax lost in relation to accumulated after tax profits disposed of by vendor shareholders in the same transactions. The Bills provide a totally unjust exemption for some classes of tax dodgers. I refer to clause 3 (12) of the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill which was added later in a rather sneaky concession after the tax debate commenced in the House of Representatives. That clause lets the really efficient , conspiratorial tax dodger off the hook. The tax dodger who mucks it up, as it were, as a result of bad advice or is not so experienced in his efforts, gets caught under this provision. Of course, the legislation also fails to recoup certain sums of sales tax and provides for greater leniency to tax evaders in respect of the time allowed to pay their tax. I do not object to that but of course again it introduces a double standard. That leniency is not available to the ordinary taxpayer; it is available to those who get caught in tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the deficiencies in this Bill it is clear that the sum to be recouped will be far less than that which has actually been lost and which the Government expects to recover. Indeed the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) admitted this in answer to a question I asked her on 26 October this year. The Treasurer has also admitted that some $500m of tax will be lost because of a failure to recoup personal income tax involved as well as the watering-down provisions of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to canvass in great detail the provisions of the Bill. I simply wish to point out some of the massive inequities that are involved in the tax debate in this country. The great issues about which we have to be concerned as a parliament are the inequities and so on which have developed in the tax debate illustrated by standards in propriety in ministerial behaviour, the inequalities which this Government both perpetrates and tolerates and the extent of tax avoidance to which I have already referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I quoted earlier from what Professor Russell Mathews had to say about the extent of tax avoidance and evasion and its effects on the economy of this country. Not only Professor Russell Mathews has made those sorts of comments but also the Commissioner of Taxation has pointed out the extent of the problem in a number of his recent reports. In the sixty-first report for 1981-82 $1,035m was owed by participants in identified tax avoidance schemes and $465m was owed by stripped companies. In both cases the money was owed as at 8 October 1982. What was this Government's response to reports of the Taxation Commissioner from 1977 to 1981 which pointed out the growth of tax avoidance and evasion in this country year by year? What was this Government's response to pleas from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation for additional resources to deal with the problem? What was its response to the request for prosecutions from the Attorney -General's Department under the existing law? Pleas of the kind made by the Commissioner of Taxation were ignored by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of providing additional staff to deal with tax evasion and avoidance, as the Commissioner repeatedly requested year after year, what did the Fraser Government do? It cut the staff available to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation . When the Commissioner asked year after year for additional staff to deal with this problem the Government cut staff numbers. That was the response he got from this Government. How can we say that this Government has any bona fides at all on this issue when it behaves like that? That was the pattern of condonation, connivance and collusion in which this Government engaged in protecting the tax avoidance industry in this country. One looks at the reports of the Taxation Commissioner to see the extent of that. One looks also at independent commentators such as Mr Risstrom of the Taxpayers Association who for one has put the figure of revenue lost as high as $7,000m. Under this Government tax avoidance has flourished and the consequent tax inequities have become greater and greater. It should not be forgotten that tax avoidance costs every household this country $30 a week. This $30 goes into the profits of those who have engaged in this sort of activity. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation attempts in a rather lame way to come to grips with one of the grossest forms of tax avoidance-the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. It should be remembered that this legislation would never have seen the light of day without the report of Commissioner Costigan-the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union-and its damaging findings and without the McCabe-Lafranchi report. Senator Crichton-Browne could have sat back waiting for somebody to do something under the existing law. He would have been waiting in vain as he would have waited for the last seven or eight years for something to happen under the existing law since that prosecution first went astray in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's office in Perth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to misrepresent the honourable senator. This Government has talked more about dealing with tax avoidance and evasion than any government in Australia's history. That is true. The problem has got bigger and bigger under this Government because people involved in tax evasion and avoidance have known that it is all talk and no action under the existing legislation. I will deal with that matter in a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation would never have been necessary but for the fact that the Government was caught by Commissioner Costigan and the McCabe-Lafranchi report. Government inaction in this area has been almost criminally negligent. There has been overwhelming evidence from the Australian Taxation Office and expert legal opinions available to the Government as early as 1976 but no attempt at all was made to outlaw these schemes until 1980. There was very little action until the legislation which was inroduced in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer initially claimed that he was unaware of the full extent of these schemes until 1980. That claim has been proved to have been fatuous and false by the evidence contained in a set of documents the size of a telephone book which has been tabled in this Parliament. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister of this country knew in 1977 of the growing extent of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. It is quite clear also that the Taxation Commissioner emphasised from the outset that action was needed in relation to these schemes. He did not get action from the Attorney-General's Department or from the Deputy Crown-Solicitor's office but he knew that it was needed. No less than 18 calls were made by the Commissioner of Taxation to the Treasurer of this country for action on these schemes before the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was finally passed in 1980 outlawing such schemes. There were 18 calls from the Commissioner of Taxation to this Government urging action in relation to the collection of revenue from the people involved in these schemes-18 calls asking for action which were ignored. At the same time, as Professor Mathews would no doubt point out, the Government was spending a lot of time talking about cutting government expenditure, razor gangs and all those sorts of things. The money was not coming in because the Commissioner of Taxation was being ignored by a slothful government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to express a legal opinion on the 1980 legislation . I think it might have been helpful if it had been used effectively, just the same as part of this legislation may have some effect if it is used effectively. I think the legislation which the Government has introduced is all very much in the same sort of basket; it is seen to be doing something. That is what the legislation is about. A series of prosecutions for criminal fraud should have taken place in the mid-1970s under the existing law. That is what it is- conspiring to defeat the revenue of this country. None of those things happened. This Government could have acted a lot sooner and it did not. It could have stopped tax avoidance earlier on and it did not. When it was finally embarrassed by the Costigan and McCabe-Lafranchi reports it acted with totally uncharacteristic speed in introducing this legislation. It did it for political reasons-that it had to be seen to be doing something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This debate has to be seen also in the context of tax fairness generally in this country. This Government's attitude to tax avoidance is indicative of its attitude to tax inequalities in the community at large. Since 1975 when this Government came to power, the proportion of tax paid by low income earners has increased enormously when expressed as a proportion of total pay-as-you-earn tax collections. In the 1981 Budget alone the proportion of tax paid by PAYE taxpayers increased by 22 per cent alone in that year. At the same time Professor Mathews says that 20 per cent of the revenue of this country is being lost in tax evasion and tax avoidance by people, as he put it, on high incomes. At the same time, the burden of taxation is being shifted to the ordinary wage and salary earner by a factor of 22 per cent in 1981 alone. The proportion of tax paid by high income tax earners has diminished and the proportion paid by low income tax earners has increased. The Government should recognise that a major effect of its delay, its unwillingness to take firm measures against these schemes as they appeared is to increase the degree of cynicism in the community about the whole taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not, like Senator Martyr, attempt to use expressions like 'moral fibre', but that sort of thing is destructive of the moral fibre of society. The Government shifts the tax burden to the poor, it alleviates the rich in terms of the tax scales and, at the same time, 20 per cent of the tax revenue is forgone as a result of tax avoidance. There is a perception in the community that the taxation system is unfair, that the wealthy are being allowed to have a go and have been allowed to have a go at avoiding tax and have opportunities to do so that are denied the ordinary, average taxpayer. When the Costigan Royal Commission reported on this issue and the Government got caught and was prompted into some sort of activity, I had a lot of conversations with taxi drivers and various people in the community who complained to me that they had been hounded by the Taxation Office in respect of a $70 claim for chemist bills for which they could not find the receipts. Officers of the Taxation Office are pursuing people for those sorts of amounts. Then we have a fellow like Mr Denis Horgan in Western Australia evading $7m in tax in three years, and nothing was being done about it by the Government. Why was nothing done about it? It is because Mr Horgan was a functionary of the Australian Liberal Party of Australia. That is how the argument goes and how the perception in the community goes about about this sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax system, in those circumstances, is not perceived to be fair. It is most important that the tax be seen to be administered according to a fair system. The present tax system is not fair because of widespread avoidance and the loss of confidence as a result. Is it any wonder that Professor Russell Mathews, whom I quoted from before, had this to say in January of this year about the taxation system in Australia. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian taxation and social welfare system, far from contributing to greater equality in the distribution of incomes and wealth, has become a major instrument for redistributing incomes from the poor to the rich and from wage and salary earners to other income recipients, as well as a major cause of the budgetary problems of all Australian governments and a source of growing social, business and economic instability. </PARA>
<PARA> If Governments were to set out deliberately to design a taxation system which would redistribute income from the poor to the rich, which would substantially relieve the rich of the cost of financing social welfare transfers and public services, which would consciously discriminate against wage and salary incomes in favour of other incomes and capital gains, which would distort the pattern of consumption and production, and which would provide a major stimulus to wage inflation and industrial conflict, it would be difficult for them to develop a set of tax arrangements that would be more successful in meeting such perverse objectives than the existing Australian system. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Professor Mathews said and that is really what this debate is all about. What we need, more than anything else, is a government determined to enforce the present capital gains provisions and, if necessary, introduce stronger ones; a government determined to redistribute income through reform of the taxation scales and a government which is prepared to crack down hard on tax avoidance with a thorough retrospective program, if that is necessary. These things are needed in this society if we are to retrieve ourselves from the current economic crisis and the current social crisis which now grips this country. These issues are of fundamental importance. The present Bills give no confidence that the Government is prepared to bite the bullet on these issues, nor does the past behaviour of the Government give any confidence that tax fairness will be achieved in this country while the Fraser Government remains in power. </PARA>

If anyone ever had any doubts about the value of a parliamentary back bench in either House, I think those doubts now should be resolved. Every now and again-for that infrequency as a government senator I am grateful, because I do not like voting against the Government-there comes a time when, irrespective of party discipline or public and private abuse, members and senators are called upon to respond to their consciences. It seems that it is only back benchers who can do this for the reality, it is sad to say, of a Cabinet Government is such that if there are any differences in the Cabinet that are carried forward by Cabinet members into either House, the Cabinet member in question has to resign. What I am saying is that I cannot believe that every member of this Cabinet believes absolutely in retrospective legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that the Bills we are debating now are about the worst of a retrospective kind that I have seen. These Bills are the mechanism for making illegal that which, until now, was legal. The Government is using incredibly bad means-that is, punitive retrospectivity-to achieve what everyone would regard as a reasonable end; that is, fair taxation. My difficulty is not with the end, but with the means. I can never justify an improper means to a good end. For me the end must be good and the means must be good. </PARA>
<PARA> We can argue endlessly in this chamber that what was done by those who avoided tax was not avoidance but evasion-forbidden by the present law. If this is true, why have they not already been charged under existing taxation law? It is said by the Government that the present taxation law is inadequate to gather what the Government says is owed. If this is true, why has it been necessary for the Government to create a new tax and apply it retrospectively? Senator Walters does not accept this. She gave an example which, in all charity, I say was fairly primeval, of the sale of a stolen watch. This example bears no relationship whatsoever to the retrospective Bills that we are debating. The watch that she talked about was clearly stolen and receiving stolen property is clearly against the law. Therefore, no new law is needed to cover that type of offence; the law is already there. In the case that we are speaking about the tax avoidance was clearly legal. </PARA>

Senator Watson may have sympathy with his Tasmanian colleague, but I have none. There are many Bills and pages of explanatory memoranda but, in brutal essence, after all of the legal obfuscation, the truth lies in two sentences in the explanatory memorandum of the Treasurer (Mr Howard), which states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>If the Government had been completely frank it would have inserted the word 'new ' before the word 'tax'. Any discussions with officers in the Australian Taxation Office will verify that the word 'new' should be inserted. It is a new tax.

<PARA> In order to make the legislation apply only from a time shortly before these schemes came to be practised on a wide scale, the Bill is expressed to apply to schemes entered into on or after 1 January 1972. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the word 'new' should have been inserted. That can be easily verified with officers from the Taxation Office. I am sure that the vendors of shares who are to be the subject of the new tax engaged in perfectly legitimate transactions-as they were-which they certainly would not have contemplated had they known that in several years a new tax would be imposed upon them as a result of the actions they had taken. It is grossly unfair for respectable citizens to be taxed as a result of transactions which they legitimately entered into years ago because other persons have committed offences as a consequence of which the Commissioner of Taxation has not been paid. In recent months the Liberal Party in Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia, as well as the National Party of Queensland and the National Country Party of Western Australia, have opposed this legislation. Mr President, I seek leave to incorporate a document which shows what the Western Australian Liberal Party had to say about this matter on Saturday, 7 August 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>RE: RETROSPECTIVE LEGISLATION</PARA>
<PARA> Motion passed by the State Council of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, Saturday, 7 August 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> That this Council:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Advise the Federal Government that it strongly opposes retrospectivity in laws creating offences and imposing penalties on individuals on the grounds that such retrospectivity is:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) An offence against natural justice and human rights, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Contrary to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory, and which Australia undertakes to respect. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Strongly requests the Federal Government to suspend action on proposed laws imposing retrospective tax liability on individuals and companies, because such laws would:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Wrongly take away basic citizen rights, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Wrongly impose penalties for actions that were lawful when taken. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Strongly requests the Federal Government to continue its fight against tax evasion by fair means. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Strongly commends the Federal Government for its consistent opposition to tax evasion, and its effective closure of tax loopholes on a non-retrospective basis-especially by the introduction of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 which imposed penalties of five years gaol and $50 000 fines, and stopped ' bottom of the harbour' evasion by buyers and strippers of companies. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Strongly warns the Federal Government that there is mounting evidence that the retrospective proposals it has been considering could destabilise the financial affairs of individuals and companies, leading to thousands of bankruptcies and a substantial increase in unemployment. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ7">Senator MARTYR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Law Council of Australia has come out strongly against the Government proposal. I do not recall any professional organisation in Australia favouring what the Government is doing. An article which was published in the Herald on Saturday, 6 November 1982, with regard to a public opinion poll, reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fifty-eight percent of Australians oppose respective tax legislation, says the Gallup Poll. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> The same poll shows that 65 percent of people oppose retrospective legislation generally, that is, any legislation that makes new laws apply from dates in the past rather than from now. </PARA>
<PARA> Twenty-five percent are in favour of retrospective legislation generally and ten percent are unsure. </PARA>
<PARA>I have no doubt at all that that reflects a very strong reaction from the public to this disgraceful legislation. If Senator Haines is listening I hope that she comes into the chamber to verify that her Human Rights Bill 1982 is strongly against retrospective legislation. Section 27 (1) of that Bill is strongly against retrospective legislation. I expect that she will be with those of us who oppose this dreadful legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned also that the Costigan report indicates quite clearly that a stand may have been taken as far back as 1975 against those people who were involved in illegal activity concerning so-called bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. I know that there is contrary advice to this, but I also know that everyone would agree that those persons who appear to have broken the law and who, after a professional investigation, are thought to be guilty of tax evasion, and fraud relating to tax evasion, should be prosecuted under the existing legal remedies available. I refer in particular to the Crimes Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Companies Act, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we are all totally opposed to respectable members of the community being penalised because of the fraudulent acts of other persons who remain free and who have not been brought to account for their actions. I hope that people will not be misled by emotive rhetoric about the public being ripped off. Any of us who have any practical experience of government know that very little in the end will be recovered from the attempts the Government is making. There will be an enormous increase in the Public Service, computer usage and consultants. In the end I doubt that there will be any profit for this Government or for anybody else. I do not think that people ought to be misled- particularly the lawyers in this place-about the totally out of context quotations of senior English judges which have no bearing on the legislation with which we are concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ones which the honourable senator quoted were right; the ones which the Opposition quoted were wrong. To sum up why I will be voting against this legislation, I believe that these Bills destroy certainty before the law. Surely this certainty is more important than any other principle. For instance, the so-called principle of equity and fairness means nothing unless there is certainty before the law. I know that there are oversophisticated smart -Alicks-they are probably lawyers too-who will say that no one has any certainty before the law and that that is the purpose of the legal profession, to achieve that certainty. In answer to those people, I maintain that there are basic certainties of tax law. If these certainties were reinforced by legal decisions, citizens are entitled to feel certain that what they did was legal. I refer in particular to the decision of Sir Garfield Barwick in the much publicised Slutzkin case in the High Court of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had nothing to say so far about the morality of what was done to avoid tax. All I know is that what was done was legal at the time. I note that my learned friend Senator Button had something to say about public morality and making moral judgments. This is truly a death-bed repentence for the Australian Labor Party. Between 1972 and 1975 the ALP created the vast gulf between morality and public policy-a gulf which I believe will not be bridged in my lifetime. It made nonsense of firmly held traditional moral views. So it is not much good members of the Labor Party, in this year of 1982, bemoaning the fact that there is a vast gulf between public morality and public policy because they created it. </PARA>

That was really not a decent thing to do because there has been no trial and no charges laid. The aim of naming people here is undoubtedly to shatter and destroy their reputations. All those who have been accused and named in this Parliament are innocent. Why are they innocent? Because the only means that the Government has used to get what it alleges is owed to it is a new tax retrospectively applied 10 years. So certainty before the law has suffered a shattering blow in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give a few quotations about the importance of certainty. I quote from the evidence of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence's Sub- Committee on the Pacific Basin and from such authorities as Mr William John O' Reilly, Commissioner of Taxation, and Mr Samuel Stuart McBurney, Assistant Secretary, Taxation Policy, in the Department of the Treasury. On page 980 of the evidence, Mr O'Reilly complained quite justifiably of the 'unacceptable level of uncertainty' in certain taxation arrangements between the United States Government and the Australian Government. Later, Mr O'Reilly said:</PARA>
<PARA> So in this day and age in my view-it might be a personal view but I think it will be shared to a large extent by Mr McBurney and the policy formulators-the main benefit gained from double taxation agreements is that of certainty, of having delimited in an agreement between the two countries, in a document which becomes part of the law of those two countries . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr O'Reilly then said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the certainty that your taxes are going to be 15 per cent of gross of dividends or 10 per cent of gross of royalties;</PARA>
<PARA>And so on. It is quite clear that he regards the principle of certainty as being vitally important in taxation agreements. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I would say only that one of certainty I think. Businessmen do look for certainty. Insofar as at the margin or somewhere, Mr McBurney and I have made the same point. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McBurney said:</PARA>
<PARA> As Mr O'Reilly said, it does affect the certainty in the businessman's mind. It is not only written down what is agreed but the agreement puts some limits on each country's right to change its law in the future while the agreement lasts. That is an additional element of certainty in their minds. </PARA>
<PARA>One can see how bad retrospective legislation could be in this context. I asked Mr O'Reilly about these matters because naturally they were of interest because this debate was coming up. I asked him:</PARA>
<PARA> Would you say that in all taxation agreements or all taxation law anywhere certainty is the most vital component?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr O'Reilly replied:</PARA>
<PARA> It depends on your definition of 'certainty'. There is going to be a lot of certainty about this new law. </PARA>
<PARA>I then told him:</PARA>
<PARA> That is just my problem with it, I might tell you. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr O'Reilly replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Certainly certainty is a desirable thing, but exceptions prove the rule and circumstances alter cases. </PARA>
<PARA>To which I replied:</PARA>
<PARA> And hard cases make bad laws. </PARA>
<PARA>I think I can safely say to the Senate that here we have an example of some hard cases being responsible for some very bad laws. If it would not tax the patience of the Senate, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the quotations from Mr O' Reilly. I have not circulated them but they are quite unexceptionable, I think. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On this point I might mention that a recent report prepared for the United States Congress by the Government Accounting Office in relation to the United States Treasury regulations setting out guidelines for United States transfer pricing legislation asserts that the existing complex guidelines create an unacceptable level of uncertainty and significant administrative burdens for both taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> So in this day and age in my view-it might be a personal view but I think it will be shared to a large extent by Mr McBurney and the policy formulators-the main benefit gained from double taxation agreements is that of certainty, of having delimited in an agreement between the two countries, in a document which becomes part of the law of those two countries, the full extent of the responsibilities each has in relation to the taxation of a transaction which straddles the two or an organisation which straddles the two; the certainty that your taxes are going up by 15 per cent of gross of dividends or 10 per cent of gross of royalties; the definition of what royalties are so that you know which of your transactions are going to involve royalties; the definition of what dividends are; the definition of what interest is; the fact that there is going to be only a 10 per cent tax on interest; what constitutes a permanent establishment, because without a permanent establishment, without real presence in a country, that country cannot reach out its tax tentacles to you. So you know what is likely to be determined to be a permanent establishment, bringing in its train some tax consequences in a country where you are operating, that sort of certainty. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr O'Reilly-I would say only that one of certainty I think. Businessmen do look for certainty. Insofar as at the margin or somewhere, Mr McBurney and I have made the same point;</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr McBurney-I would think any effect on the amount of the flow would be fairly marginal. As Mr O'Reilly said, it does affect the certainty in the businessman's mind. It is not only written down what is agreed now but the agreement puts some limits on each country's right to change its law in the future while the agreement lasts. That is an additional element of certainty in their minds. Probably it also leads to a slightly more orderly arrangement for the actual administration of tax by the tax collectors in each country. The overall effect on amounts of flow I would think would be pretty marginal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I have the greatest respect for Mr O'Reilly and for Mr McBurney. They are honest, diligent and conscientious public servants . I had the privilege of watching and listening to Mr O'Reilly answering the inquisition of Opposition Senators Evans and Walsh at a meeting of Estimates Committee C. In my view the Australian Taxation Office is entirely blameless in this whole matter. It has done its duty and done it well. I do not know that the Government can be fairly blamed for its reluctance to spring into action on these matters. It seems to me, in fairness, as I contemplate the issue that the Government was reluctant to act because it kept being forced back all the time to this awful concept of retrospectivity. That is enough to make any government hesitate. I wish it would overcome its difficulties by test cases. As I have said before, there were other ways of overcoming the difficulties, but I give credit where credit is due. I am sure it was the contemplation of this dreadful practice of punitive retrospectivity which made the Government hold. I am sure that there are other ways and I wish that they had been implemented. What is being contemplated is the destruction of certainty before the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having destroyed certainty by declaring illegal what was legal, the Bills also destroy, along the way, the principle of being assumed innocent until proven guilty. With these Bills-if I may use crude terminology-someone is fingered immediately and with not much chance of proving his innocence, because the new law is absolutely certain that what he did all those years ago is now illegal and he must pay what is assessed. It has been suggested that because some of us who feel as strongly as we do about our opposition to retrospectivity supported a strictly limited retrospectivity in the case of Curran we are somehow inconsistent. I well remember the legislation in question. I was a member of the House of Representatives at the time. We were promised after Curran-in that case there was only 11 months of retrospectivity-that no more retrospective legislation would ever be presented to either House. We supported the Curran legislation because we believed that if the Treasurer gave a warning in the House of Representatives to those people who he believed were doing the wrong thing and said that they would be apprehended and that the purpose of legislation he was to bring down was to apprehend them it was reasonable to make the legislation retrospective to the time of his announcement, bearing in mind that it takes quite some time for legislation to go through both Houses and to be proclaimed. We believed that this was reasonable to stop smart-Alicks from exploiting something when they had been warned not to do so. In that case the period of retrospectivity was only 11 months. Some of us, having gone down the road of retrospectivity at that time, did not like what we saw, did not like what we had to do even though it seemed like abundant common sense at the time. But to jump, as this Bill does, from 11 months-call it a year in round figures if you like-to 10 years is more than we can take. That is why we will vote against it. What we feared then has happened. Retrospectivity, once used in seemingly quite a normal, legitimate and logical way, is now being used in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's argument for punitive retrospectivity can be made to apply to anything, making things illegal which were legal and punishing those presumed guilty. I ask people to recollect what Senator Chipp has had to say about this. The points he made are quite relevant. Because of what the Federal Government is doing government in New South Wales is seriously contemplating how it can have a retrospective stamp tax. As Senator Chipp said, they want to go back upwards of 60 years. That is absolutely incredible. I hope that there is some sort of resistance against that legislation in New South Wales. But that is not our problem here. Our problem is to try to stop the legislation here. In Victoria, the new Labor Government of Mr Cain is seriously contemplating and has seriously contemplated retrospective land tax. I know that there has been opposition to this in Victoria as there has been oposition to the stamp tax in New South Wales . I hope it is successful. We can clearly see what the example-the example that we as a Federal Government are setting-is doing to the country. It is a bad example and it will be followed by others. As I said, once the door to these practices is opened there will be no closing it. I cannot help but be anything else but nervous when I see that Senator Evans, leading the debate for the Australian Labor Party in this matter, is so totally dedicated to this principle that, in a statement in the Sunday Observer of 7 November this year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We pledge ourselves, in office, to wage a war on tax evasion and avoidance that will make all the activities of the present Government look like minor skirmishes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If the major activity of the present Government is to employ a new punitive retrospective tax that goes back 10 years-and Senator Evans says that activity will look like a minor skirmish compared with what the Labor Party will do-must not everybody in this chamber and everybody who is listening to the debate be terrified of what we are promised will be done? This is absolutely scandalous. I hope that people who have contemplated this retrospective legislation will see what a dreadful, damaging and demoralising thing it is. It is something to which no government should resort. It is wrong in that it destroys the certainty before the law that is absolutely essential for subjects to have. </PARA>
<PARA> I will vote-there will be others voting with me-for certainty. We do not want any misunderstanding on the part of the Government or anybody else about what we are voting against. We will vote for all subjects' certainty before the law. Take that certainty away and nothing else will mean anything. I insist: It is not a question only for today. When we in this chamber vote against punitive retrospectivity, we will vote for what is right today, but we will be voting for those who are to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that, until now, the debate has not been met. In a sense, whilst proposals have been put in relation to the retrospectivity of the legislation, those in favour of it spoke almost entirely in relation to whether a person will support tax dodging, tax evasion or whatever. Not one person to whom I have listened so far in this debate who is opposed to this legislation has expressed any sympathy for the activities of people who have been ripping off the country for quite some time. What has been made exceptionally clear is that, if at any stage a person was acting against the laws of the Commonwealth in a fraudulent way, he or she ought to have been acted against by the Government. I will refer later to the types of advice that the Government said it has received on this issue. I believe that the central issue in this debate should be this: What justification can possibly be offered for making a person suffer on account of actions which were legal? That is what this legislation is about. It is seeking to make people suffer on account of actions that were legal. Senator Walters put the proposition that this is not retrospective taxation and that there is no new tax in this Bill. That is a highly idiosyncratic view, and indeed I do not expect it to be voiced again in this debate. That view has been voiced by nobody else in the community and, presumably, is held by Senator Walters alone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is-it is not disputed even by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-that people will be liable to pay tax on the basis of acts which, when performed, did not attract tax consequences. I think that is beyond doubt. The point that Senator Walters was endeavouring to make-I think it is an important one and needs to be met-is that many of the vendor shareholders who are to be taxed under this legislation certainly were aware at the time that for the sale price that they were receiving the person they were selling to must in some way be avoiding tax. I believe that in almost the majority of cases that was probably so. I do not say that in respect of all cases because I believe it is impossible to assert that. Indeed I had representations from people who were able to convince me that at the time they did not know. But let us take it that in the majority of cases they knew that the company or the person they were selling to would in some way be avoiding tax . </PARA>
<PARA> The point at issue is whether they could also have genuinely believed that those people were able to avoid tax legally-in other words, whether they could engage in a variety of activities which would legally give them relief from that tax. I shall mention some procedures which are currently available to anybody who wishes to do that. For example, if one sought to enter into a scheme which is accepted by the Department of the Treasury to pay interest to an overseas organisation the position is that the interest paid by an Australian company is fully tax deductible and only 10 per cent is payable to the Australian Taxation Office on behalf of the overseas recipient. That procedure is perfectly legal today, and it is unaffected by this Bill. A person could sell a company for more than its value and know that the purchaser would not pay tax on the transaction. Under the provisions of section 23 (jb) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, if that friendly overseas financier happened to be a superannuation fund which is not subject to tax in its own home country-and that is often the case-no Australian tax is payable on any amount of interest or dividends paid to it. This section became effective on 1 January 1968 and is still operative. </PARA>
<PARA> The Income Tax Assessment Act also exempts from tax the dividends received by public companies from private companies. Thus, if the shareholders of a private company wished to avoid tax legally on the accumulated profits of previous years , they merely had to find a public company to buy their company. This procedure is still available and is unaffected by this Bill. In other words, there are legitimate ways by which a purchasing company could have a reasonable expectation of avoiding tax. Surely, it is not possible for the Treasurer to maintain that everybody who went into such a scheme was engaging in a fraudulent act. Let us allow that that was the case; we still run into what I believe is an extremely important principle. And it is a very simple one. If what the person was doing was fraudulent, that person too is entitled to his or her day in court . After all, we even allow murderers and drug runners a day in court; yet in this case we are introducing legislation which will state: 'You are guilty'. In other words there will not be the opportunity for a person, in meeting the requirements laid down in this Bill, to be able to say that he or she is innocent. We find, for example, as will be the case in the Committee stage, some extremely odd and idiosyncratic drafting which we cannot find in other Commonwealth Bills and which makes it almost inevitable that the person appearing before a court will be declared guilty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have denied, on behalf of the Government no doubt, that they had any knowledge prior to 1977 of the form of avoidance which is dealt with by this Bill. Yet, this legislation is to be retrospective to 1 January 1972 because the Treasurer says that these schemes were practised on a wide scale shortly before that date. Quite frankly, if that does not condemn out of his own mouth the chief taxation officer of this land and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) I do not know what does. We have, on the one hand, the proposition that this tax avoidance was being practised on a wide scale and, on the other hand, a denial by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of any knowledge of it. Surely those two statements cannot go together. Surely they are incompatible. Yet officers of this Government-the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-are seeking to maintain a holier than holy stance. They say that it was nothing to do with them and certainly they knew nothing about it at the time. What precisely could be defined as a wide-scale practice if it never came to the attention of the Department of the Treasury?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh drew an analogy between people who avoid tax and a pensioner who is overpaid. He made the point that the pensioner who is overpaid, through no fault of his own, is required to repay the money. Although such a practice might be hard, it is fair and I think it is accepted within our community. However, that is not a fair analogy. We are not talking about an illegal action. We are talking about a piece of legislation which seeks to make illegal an action which was legal at the timne it occured. If the act was illegal, surely a law must have been breached. If a law has been breached a prosecution ought to be made. But, quite apart from considerations of social morality, greed or whatever else one wants to consider, if the act was not illegal the person concerned was entitled to engage in it. </PARA>
<PARA> Notable upholders of civil liberties in this place, such as Senator Button and Senator Evans, would be considerably put out if we were to debate other immoral and unethical matters. For example, some people believe it is immoral to smoke. Some others believe it is immoral to drink. Others believe it is immoral to use contraceptives, others to have blood transfusions and others to work on Sundays. There is a wide range of beliefs in this country about morality and ethics. The law, except where it explicitly seeks to take a moral stance, does not apply to activities which may be considered immoral. I think it is incontestable that if there is no law governing a particular action, a person is legally entitled to engage in it, whether it is morally supported or not. </PARA>
<PARA> I, and I believe, most honourable senators condemn tax avoidance actions as being against the best interests of the Commonwealth and the citizens of Australia. Nevertheless, I could not vote for a law which now seeks to make illegal actions which were legal at the time they occurred. I believe that every person in this community is entitled to know the legal consequences of his or her actions at the time he or she undertakes them. That seems to me to be a principle that we ought not to go past. </PARA>

Indeed, it would probably be more just to bring into this Parliament a Bill to confiscate the property of members of the Cabinet since 1972 to pay some of the bill for the lost revenue. I am sure that members of the Cabinet would speak against such a proposition as would probably every member of the Senate. But that is the type of legislation that we are talking about. It affects citizens outside this place. The people in power in this land are protecting themselves by introducing legislation that will hurt others. They are quite happy to stand up everywhere and proclaim that what they are doing is fair. That is the hypocrisy of the whole exercise we are considering today. The actions of this Government and the Cabinet reek of hypocrisy. They are seeking to blame others in the community so that they can rescue themselves from the results of their dereliction of duty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government was unwilling to charge those people who were, on the say-so of the Treasurer, engaged in fraud surely the Treasurer and the Prime Minister must stand condemned. There can be no other explanation. The explanation that the Government has sought to give cannot be accepted. The Government proclaims that it had legal advice that such action was not possible. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have denied publicly to every vendor shareholder the claim that the taking of legal advice is a justifiable excuse. As a result they have destroyed their own single argument as to why they should not stand condemned. If the Senate could get hold of the documents which have been denied to it we would undoubtedly find within them that the Government had strong advice that it ought to have taken legal action. I believe that is why this Government has sought time and again to prevent the Senate from getting hold of those documents . The Government seeking to cover its own shameful acts in the past. That it should then seek from honourable senators an acquiescence to this law I find not only reprehensible but also shameless. </PARA>
<PARA> A most disturbing aspect has been raised in the debate that has gone on in the Parliament and in the rest of the country. We are now seeking to visit on every citizen who may have engaged in a particular act the consequences of the doubtless wrongs that some have undertaken. We have had here-thank goodness we have not had it in this debate today-an attempt on the part of a number of honourable senators to say that anybody who would raise his or her voice against this retrospective legislation must be a friend of tax dodgers and tax evaders. The hysterical pronouncement on national television by the Prime Minister attempted to do precisely that. A memorandum drafted in August 1936 by Adolf Hitler, which became the basis of the infamous Nuremburg laws, laid down the principle that the Jewish community as a whole should be responsible for any damage done to the German economy by individual Jews. Not one voice was raised when that law went through. I am pleased to be able to argue in this place against this retrospective law. I am also pleased that we live in a country where other honourable senators also have been able to argue against such a law. At least this debate suggests that democracy is still alive in this country and that people are willing to stand up and fight for principles no matter how unpopular they may be. </PARA>
<PARA> I come finally to the point that is the sticking point for me. I do not wish to vote for a law unless a person is able to be innocent, and to proclaim his innocence, of breaking it. Retrospective legislation is not that type of legislation. Whilst the government, by enactment, may reach backwards, the vendor shareholder is not likewise entitled to reach backwards and change his or her action. If that were to be permitted, if the vendor shareholder could opt to change his or her action retrospectively, we would doubtless have equivalence. This legislation enables the Government to reach back to 1972, but does not enable someone who engaged in a certain action in 1972 to reach back and say: ' If that is now to be the consequence of my action, I will choose another'. Surely that is the effect of the legislation that we are now proposing to enact. We are now proposing to say: 'What you did I now declare wrong. I also declare that you shall not be able to change it'. When any other law is enacted in this place we say: 'This is wrong and if in the future you undertake that action you will be penalised'. That enables every citizen contemplating the legislation to say: 'If I do that, these will be the consequences'. In other words, every citizen will know the legal consequences of his or her actions. This legislation will affect a group of citizens who, between 1972 and 1980, were unable to know the consequences of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government's motivation in introducing this retrospective legislation is quickly to collect tax from vendor shareholders without having to prove them guilty of fraud. I believe that to do such a thing by legislative fiat is objectionable, abhorrent and against the good order of the Commonwealth. I do not say that all retrospective legislation is wrong. Indeed, in many cases it could be legitimate and those to whom it applies could accept that fact. Honourable senators will remember the second last pay rise we received. We passed a piece of retrospective legislation because all of those to whom it applied, in this place and in the other, said: 'Yes, we'll pay back that extra amount of money'. In other words, there are cases where retrospective legislation can be legitimate. But it cannot be legitimate when it applies to citizens who did not wish their legal actions to be deemed illegal. I hope that the Government, even at this late hour, will look again at this legislation. I have no doubt whatsoever that it will be effective, but lynching is extremely effective also. I am not disputing the effectiveness of this legislation; I am disputing its justice. I believe it would be far better if those who supported it actually said that in this instance they were supporting injustice and gave their reasons. Then at least we would have an honest debate in this place and would all know where we stood. </PARA>

We cannot predict the economic consequences. All honourable senators are probably aware that many in this country will become bankrupt as a result, that many will be forced to fold up their companies, that many will become unemployed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support justice and equity. Therefore I support these Bills. Currently we are debating five Bills cognately. These Bills involve the collection of tax from vendor shareholders and promoters and the levying of tax. The principal Bill, the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill sets out the basic conditions of liability and contains some necessary machinery provisions. These Bills also impose a rate of tax. It is necessary to have a separate Bill relating to promoters to bring them within the scope of this legislation. The Bills seek to recoup tax which is legally payable. The Government is seeking to recoup tax from people who derived a taxation benefit; nothing more, nothing less. The Bills relate to the period from 1972 to 1980 because since 1980 we have had on the statute books the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act and Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The latter legislation has proved particularly effective in wiping out a whole host of tax avoidance in this country. But, I repeat, the basis of this legislation is to provide taxation equity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our opponents to this legislation have asked why we have not acted under existing legislation. Let us look at the existing legislation under which, according to our opponents, we should have tried to bring people to justice. Firstly, it was suggested that we use the companies Acts. The relevant section of the Victorian Companies Act is section 374 which deals with offences. The first part of that section deals with officers. The penalty for offences against Division 1 is imprisonment for three months or a $500 fine. Is that adequate to deal with offenders who trade in millions of dollars and who cheat the Commonwealth of millions of dollars? Indeed, the Commissioner of Taxation may have been able to make out a case against a vendor of shares where that vendor knew or ought to have known that the only way the sale of a company could proceed, in economic terms, would be with the Commissioner being a creditor and with that creditor being defrauded. But such cases would have had to be dealt with State by State under the various companies Acts. Such a course would have been completely inadequate in dealing with fraud on this scale. </PARA>
<PARA> The other legislation mentioned is the Commonwealth Crimes Act. Every honourable senator would be aware of the Western Australian case. The advice that was given to the Commissioner of Taxation in respect of that case was that a prosecution would not succeed. In other words, there was a high risk or a great doubt about that case succeeding. Is this the sort of legislative basis upon which tax evaders should be prosecuted? What happened? The Commissioner asked that that matter be reviewed. Again what happened? On further advice this Parliament set up the position of Special Prosecutor and already one individual, named Maher, has been charged under that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> A question was raised about recovering tax under existing legislation. There is a difficulty because the existing companies have been reduced to a shell and there are no assets from which to pay. It was not one of the normal complicated taxation schemes such as the Curran scheme. It was a relatively unsophisticated scheme whereby a company which traded during the year and had a current year's profits had, by its directors, been reduced to a shell. That shell represented nothing but cash on the one hand and on the other hand unappropriated profits, which included profits for the current year. The directors sought a purchaser. That purchaser then acquired the company, in most cases, at a price which excluded a tax liability on that current year's profits. This is something like getting $150 for $100 cash. It is the same sort of thing. Who missed out? The taxpayers, the people of Australia, missed out. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet we talk about justice. These people have got away with hundreds of millions of dollars. Senator Chaney, the Minister for Social Security, is in the chamber. I ask him: What would have happened to pensioners who had been overpaid? They would have been asked to return the money. In many cases some of them have been taken to court. This legislation seeks to provide a reasonable base of certainty under which taxation revenue, legally due to the Commonwealth, can be collected on a fair basis, State by State, across the board, irrespective of whether the taxpayer is a primary producer, farmer, businessmen or whatever. I think it is an injustice that ordinary pay-as-you-earn taxpayers in Australia have had to carry a taxation bill disproportionate to their means while others have been allowed to get away without paying tax. This Government seeks to remedy that. In seeking to remedy that it has drawn a fair amount of flak. </PARA>
<PARA> Some time ago I placed on notice two questions. During a subsequent speech I raised four further questions. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the questions and the answers which were provided by the Australian Taxation Office. I think it is very important when considering this complicated and technical legislation that people know where they stand in relation to what I call fairly common situations. I have shown these documents to the appropriate Minister and the Opposition Whip. They have agreed to their incorporation. I now seek leave to have those documents incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>3118 SENATOR WATSON: To ask the Minister representing the Treasurer-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) How would the vendor shareholder be assessed, under the provisions of the tax recoupment legislation before the Parliament, in the actual case of a company which earned $100,000 over nine months and was then sold; $46,000 primary tax was deducted from the purchase price but not the tax on undistributed profits; the purchaser then lent the cash at interest and earned $ 50,000 in the final three months, making $150,000 taxable income for 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) How would the vendor shareholder be assessed if, in the above case, a loss of $50,000 had been made in the last three months instead of a profit. </PARA>
<PARA>NOTES FOR RESPONSE TO QUESTION FROM SENATOR WATSON</PARA>
<PARA> The recoupment tax legislation applies equally to ordinary company tax (that is tax on a company's taxable income) and undistributed profits tax (that is additional tax under Division 7 of the income tax law on the undistributed income of a private company). </PARA>
<PARA> In the example given (and assuming the year of income is 1979-80 and all the income up to the date of sale was trading income) the contingent undistributed profits tax liability of the company at the date of the sale of the company would have been $8,100. The undistributed profits tax liability of the company for the whole year, assuming no dividends were paid by the company in the prescribed distribution period would be $20,250 (a private company must distribute at least 90% of its after tax income from interest to avoid undistributed profits tax). </PARA>
<PARA> A vendor shareholder who held 100% of the shares in the company would, if none of the company tax were paid, become liable under the proposed recoupment measures for vendors recoupment tax of $8,100 in relation to the unpaid undistributed profits tax liability of the company. </PARA>
<PARA> A liability would, prima facie, arise in relation to ordinary company tax of the company up to the date of sale, if this had not been paid, but if the promoter had taken off with the whole of the $46,000 set aside for ordinary company tax the Commissioner would be empowered to cancel that prima facie liability. </PARA>
<PARA> If the company had incurred a loss after its purchase of $50,000, the vendor shareholders could (depending on the circumstances) get the benefit of that loss in any calculation of their recoupment tax liability. It is not possible to determine precisely what that liability would be unless the nature of the loss is known and the effect that the current year loss provisions of the income tax law have in relation to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Companies 1 and 2 have provided for all income taxes currently accrued up to the date of sales. These taxes were passed on to the purchaser, thus giving the vendor shareholders no benefit in terms of primary taxes payable only. These have been regarded in the past as usual business transactions. However, companies 3 and 4 took into account no accured income tax liabilities, and obviously the vendor shareholders in these companies received a benefit equal to the unprovided primary income tax payable. Such share sales therefore, in my view, would be naturally suspect as abnormal transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in relation to this series of companies, the balance sheets of which I am about to incorporate into Hansard, I ask whether the Minister, at the appropriate time-not now-could outline the nature and extent of the liabilities for tax and penalties of the company, the vendor shareholders, and the promoters . I seek leave to incorporate the balance sheets in Hansard rather than reading out the detailed figures, because I believe that this will give the Senate and the outside community an opportunity, without having to pay an outside service such as Commerce Clearing House Australia Limited, of understanding what we are intending in a practical way by putting legislation through this House. I therefore seek the incorporation in Hansard of the balance sheets of companies that I have nominated as Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4. </PARA>

<PARA> The 'excess consideration' test in proposed paragraph 5 (1) (d) of the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982 requires that the company's contingent Division 7 tax liability in respect of income derived up to the time of sale be deducted in arriving at the value of the company's net assets. That contingent liability is to be ascertained on the assumption that the only dividends which might be paid by the company after the time of sale are those dividends which were in fact paid by the company after that time (see sub-paragraph 5 (7) (c) ( iii) and sub-clause 5 (9)). </PARA>
<PARA> Because the consideration for the shares as not diminished by the amount of the company's contingent liability for Division 7 tax in relation to income derived during the 1977 income year and during the first 7 months of the 1978 income year, the ''excess consideration'' test will be satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes evaded Division 7 tax (i.e. undistributed profits tax) in relation to income derived up to the time of sale within its scope (see paragraphs 5 (1) (e) and (g) of the Bill) and the former owners will, in the same way as in relation to other evaded company tax, be called on to pay their respective shares of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Assuming that the remaining tests of the legislation are satisfied, the vendor- shareholders of No. 1 Company Pty Ltd will be required to pay vendors recoupment tax in relation to the company's unpaid Division 7 tax for the 1977 and 1978 income years unless they make a request under clause 16 of the Bill to be taxed as though the company had paid to them enough in dividends to eliminate its liability for Division 7 tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Promoters Liability</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As the whole of the provision for income tax for the period 1 July 1977 to 31 January 1978 was paid over to the promoter, those persons who constitute the eligible promoters class would become jointly and severally liable for promoters recoupment tax for an amount equal to that provision, i.e., $92,000, under paragraph 7 (1) (k) of the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, those in the eligible promoters class would become liable under paragraph 7 (1) (j) of the Bill for an amount equal to 20 per cent of the unpaid Division 7 tax for 1977 and 1978 unless the vendor shareholders make an election under clause 16. </PARA>
<PARA>No. 2 COMPANY PTY LTD</PARA>
<PARA>Vendors Liability</PARA>
<PARA> The 'excess consideration' test will be satisfied because no provision was made for the company's contingent Division 7 tax liability in relation to current year profits derived prior to the time of sale (refer to explanation concerning No. 1 Company Pty Ltd). </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the vendor-shareholders will be required to pay vendors recoupment tax in respect of that evaded Division 7 tax, unless the option available under clause 16 of the Bill is invoked. </PARA>
<PARA>Promoters Liability</PARA>
<PARA> As with No. 1 Company Pty Ltd those persons who constitute the eligible promoters class would become jointly and severally liable for an amount equal to the provision for income tax by virtue of paragraph 7 (1) (k) of the Bill and, in addition, under paragraph 7 (1) (j) for an amount equal to 20 per cent of the unpaid Division 7 tax for the period up to the date of sale unless the vendor- shareholders make an election under clause 16,</PARA>

<PARA>My dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA> In the first reading debate on the Customs Tariff Bill 1982 on 14 October 1982, you took the opportunity to have incorporated in Hansard a series of questions. </PARA>
<PARA> These questions sought advice on the nature and extent of the liabilities for tax and penalties of the company, the vendor shareholders and the promoters in respect of four separate and unrelated companies. </PARA>
<PARA> In providing a response to the questionss, it is essential to point out that the administration of the tax laws is vested in the hands of the Commissioner of Taxation. Therefore the Commissioner of Taxation would in the first instance be responsible for any interpretation of the legislation in respect of a particular case. It is important to recognise the response related to a hypothetical situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is within this framework that I provide the attached response which has been prepared by the Australian Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely MARGARET GUILFOYLE</PARA>
<PARA>Senator J. O. W. Watson,</PARA>

<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT 2600</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are really two types of schemes. I have outlined the general nature of what is known as the current year's profits schemes which are the subject of this legislation. In some cases the directors, having been directors of a company that traded during the year, had no further use for that company. But in selling that company they deducted from the sale price the tax liability for the period in which it operated. It would appear from this legislation that under those circumstances the only liability that the vendor shareholders would have to meet would be the Division 7 tax. I think this is one of the unfortunate features of this legislation. I think a lot of businessmen may have sold such a company, after having deducted the primary tax, genuinely thinking they could have sold it to, say, a public company. If it had gone to a public company the dividend that would be required would be fully rebateable under section 46. The end result would be that there would be no further tax liability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, one of the tragedies is that these people, having done the right thing under the legislation, are caught up with those who knowingly operated companies for a period during a year and paid no recognition to their tax liability when selling that company. Obviously they had criminal or defrauding intentions in mind. It is regrettable that both these classes of directors are unfortunately caught within this framework and are labelled by some in the community as cheats , liars, tax defrauders and so on. But I wish to point out that this legislation does not seek to provide or impose a criminal liability. All that it seeks to do is to recoup tax. So perhaps that charge that is laid is a little unfair. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the other unfortunate feature of the legislation is that it does not distinguish between tax evasion, on the one hand, and tax avoidance, on the other hand. Many people think that there should not be a distinction, but in law I think that there is and always will be a distinction. But we are now creating a precedent whereby, effectively, in this legislation there is no distinction between tax avoidance and tax evasion. That is one of the unfortunate fall-outs. Nevertheless, we must be guided by the overriding consideration which is that in this legislation we seek to provide tax equity and tax justice to make sure that tax can be collected from all those who have had a tax benefit by some sort of arrangement, either deliberate or otherwise, during the relevant period. So the legislation seeks to recover the tax from the companies themselves, if people care to try to reconstruct them, from the vendor shareholders who benefited, and from the promoters and their agents. There are also tracing provisions, because many of the promoters acquired a debt in minimising their tax liabilities to enable it to be traced through trusts and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the legislation is inherently fair. It does not seek to challenge the small man, because where the assessments are less than $100 the Commissioner of Taxation will not be seeking recoupment. The legislation is very fair in that the people who have got the benefit have had a generously long period in which to pay the money back. For example, there was a possibility that two companies could have been stripped in 1975 but the Commissioner may not have issued the assessment notices on the same date. There could have been three or four years difference. Had we not agreed to issue copy assessments on which the liability for both cases will be due on the same date, we could have unfairly had a situation in which one person's penalty at 20 per cent could have commenced two or three years or more before another's, and at 20 per cent that would have been a high price to pay. But we are issuing copy assessment notices which will apply from a common date for all classes of people involved under this legislation. What could be fairer than that?</PARA>
<PARA> Because of liquidity problems that it could force upon some businesses and others, the legislation has generously provided a period of 12 months in which to pay without penalty. So it will not be necessary to force quick liquidations of stock at uneconomic prices. It will not be necessary to close down businesses or to sack people in order to get the cash in hand. They are being given 12 months, and I have been told that that is a generous and most reasonable exercise, remembering that these people have had interest-free money for a number of years. But it is not penalty-type legislation at which we are looking. We are looking at legislation which is inherently just and inherently fair. </PARA>
<PARA> I was rather disappointed that Senator Button felt that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) had not acted with due expedition. Senator Button asked what the Government was doing when all this was happening in 1978. The allegation, essentially, was that the Government was protecting the tax avoidance industry. It is only fair to try to protect the Treasurer by giving one or two dates to show what he did in this period. I shall go only to 1978, because the record is continuous. On 8 February 1978 the Commissioner of Taxation advised the Treasurer of the High Court decision in what is known as the Cridland case, which involved exploiting the averaging provisions and involved a potentially large revenue loss. On the same date, the Commissioner also advised the Treasurer in relation to trafficking current year company losses involving significant losses of revenue. On 10 February the Commissioner advised the Acting Treasurer of share trading schemes that had come under his notice. On 31 March there was further advice in relation to Curran schemes, and the figures quoted were up to $2,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> But in response on 7 April, in the same year, the Treasurer introduced legislation against averaging, share trading and Curran schemes, and he informed the House that the Curran schemes provisions would be made retrospective to the 1977 Budget day. Again, he acted very quickly. At the same time, he forshadowed to the House that current year loss schemes in the area of avoidance would attract remedial legislation, and legislation was introduced on 16 November 1978 . On 19 April 1978 the Treasurer foreshadowed legislation against pre-payment schemes. On 24 May 1978 the Commissioner advised of problems in relation to trust stripping schemes. On 9 June the Commissioner advised of the retention of carry forward losses generated by Curran-type schemes. On 11 June the Treasurer foreshadowed legislation against trust stripping schemes. On 27 July the Commissioner advised of expenditure recoupment schemes. On 1 August the Commissioner advised of the Nilsen Development Laboratories Pty Ltd schemes, which involved a revenue loss of $600m. On 7 April the Commission advised of amounts involving $3.9 billion on a variant of the expenditure recoupment scheme . The action came on 24 September of the same year, when the Treasurer foreshadowed legislation against recoupment schemes and the latest trading stock adjustment schemes. On 27 September the Treasurer foreshadowed legislation which would have remedied the problem in the Nilsen decision. On 3 October he foreshadowed legislation against Curran schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the record. The amounts quoted in some cases were horrendous. In one case it was $3.9 billion. To allege that our Government has done nothing in that period against tax avoidance is to deny the truth of what John Howard has been fighting desperately against ever since he became Treasurer, as did his predecessor, Sir Phillip Lynch. I think that there have been between 16 and 19 Acts involving nearly 50 sections being added to legislation with the intent of overcoming taxation avoidance. So the record is there. I have given just one year's record. I have not cited all the cases. The record stands, and it is one that Australian taxpayers should recognise. It is that we as a Government have been in the forefront in combatting tax evasion. Some of the opponents of this legislation intend to introduce an innocence clause. I submit that the introduction of an innocence clause would serve the purpose of completely wiping out the effectiveness of this sort of legislation. What are we trying to do? Are we behind the Government in trying to overcome all these problems in relation to tax avoidance or are we not? We are genuine. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation has been extended to cover a liability on promoters. When it was first mooted the legislation was designed to recover money from the vendor shareholders who benefited. But it was felt unreasonable that the people who were the real perpetrators of these schemes should not get off scott-free. So we looked at what was the average remuneration to these people. It was something like 12 1/2 per cent on profits. The legislation contains provisions which impose a recovery of 20 per cent of the tax outstanding which represents something like 12 1/2 per cent on profits. But that 20 per cent recovery from the promoters and their agents-which is important-will be deducted from the liability of the vendor shareholders so that no more than 100 per cent of the tax owing will be recovered from any transaction. To overcome some of the complications a class of shareholders is set out whereby a representative group is selected to whom the assessment will be issued. The legislation provides a means whereby a vendor shareholder, if he wishes, can pay his tax liability notwithstanding that others within the company arrangement or other shareholders may object. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this is important, because of the complexity of this legislation, that the people involved-the vendor shareholders and promoters -have been given this 12 months in which payment can be made. The legislation also covers situations in which not all the shares are sold. These shares are mortgaged and the tax avoiding arrangements of this implication are to avoid stamp duty, particularly in South Australia. The company then defaulted under the mortgage and that was the tax avoiding arrangement. This legislation seeks to cover that type of situation. Not all voting rights attach to shares. Some attach to the officeholder, principally to a governing director. In this case, under the legislation, the governing director is assessable on the basis of the consideration that he received. What could be fairer? The whole purpose of this legislation is to provide justice and fairness. If there be anything said against this legislation it may be that we have bent over backwards to try to make it fair. We have made it perhaps a little too complicated to achieve fairness and I do not think this is unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation extends to what is known as blind trusts to cover eventualities and to enable tax to be assessed at what is known as a secondary level. In the limited time available to me let me summarise the legislation. The law will apply only to those who have derived a tax benefit, to a promoter or his agent who have received a consideration under the scheme. Fraud does exist. What the legislation will do is allow money which is owed to be collected. There are essentially machinery provisions but there are also necessary taxing provisions. On page 98 of the Costigan report on the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The object of tax avoidance schemes is to avoid the payment of company tax on a company by leaving only a shell of a company with no assets to pay that tax.</PARA>
<PARA>How else is the Commissioner of Taxation expected to collect money when there are no assets from which to pay the tax? I repeat that the Government has bent over backwards to make the law fair to all. No assessments will be issued for small amounts of less than $100 thus missing out on what might be called the innocent little people; so the small people will not be affected. There is equity in the legislation because copies of the provisions will be issued on a common date. Penalties will operate only when the taxation that is due has been evaded. I think the legislation is inherently fair. I mentioned that in 1980 we introduced the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill, which provided severe penalties- a $50,000 fine or 5 years gaol-and since 1980 this has effectively wiped out the sort of thing that we are seeking to recover in respect of the period 1972-80. May I quote from a letter of 31 August from Dr Forbes, Federal President of the Liberal Party of Australia. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Executive does not like the element of retrospectivity involved in proposed new legislation, but accepts the inevitability of this in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>The circumstances were so horrendous, so unusual, so much revenue was lost and so many people benefited at the taxpayers' expense. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> It believes it is an occasion when the pursuit of tax evaders-and a fair go for the community as a whole-is the most important of the competing principles. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this is the basis on which this legislation has to be judged. I support the legislation and wish it a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Previous Australian Labor Party speakers have made it perfectly clear that we will support this legislation but if ever legislation justified a description of too little, too late it is this package of measures. I say that for three reasons. Firstly, there would never have been legislation at all if the Government had not been embarrassed into it by the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the Costigan report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Secondly, the legislation would never have been necessary if the Government had been doing its job properly in the mid 1970s and had moved quickly in that period to choke off the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme promoters before their activities became rampant the way they subsequently did through that inactivity. The third reason we say this legislation is too little too late is that it simply will not succeed in recovering the money that it should be recovering from the people it should be recovering it from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are gaping loopholes in the way in which this legislation has been constructed. Although a macho front has been to some extent maintained and reported in the media the reality of this situation has been that there has been a quite craven capitulation to some of the Government's closest supporters of the tax avoidance industry. An extraordinary impression seems to have been gaining ground in recent weeks that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has turned the tax argument around. Far from his Government being seen as producing the problem through its scandalous inactivity it is now seen, some people say, that the Government is legislating with salutary toughness and as a result putting itself beyond effective criticism so far as tax avoidance and evasion are concerned. I think it needs to be said, as it was said rather less politely by my colleague Senator Walsh earlier, that if this impression is gaining currency then that represents a massive failure of perception on the part of those who report and analyse events. The reality is that this Government's reaction, here as everywhere else in its alleged campaign against tax avoidance and evasion, has been belated and feeble and it deserves not congratulation but condemnation for that record. </PARA>
<PARA> I will substantiate those claims, beginning with the belatedness of this legislation. Of course, the background to it is what has been described on numerous occasions as the greatest failure of public administration in the history of this country. I am talking, of course, about the tax avoidance and evasion explosion which took off in the mid 1970s, in circumstances where tax avoiders got cheekier and cheekier. As the Government's inactivity on some of these schemes grew unbelievably protracted, the schemes in question grew cruder and cruder. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom-of-the-harbour chronology is now very well known. It has already been adverted to by a number of speakers in this debate. Back in 1974 the first of the straw company evasion activities was identified by the Australian Taxation Office and in Perth a clear cut test case came to light in that year which seemed to be a model opportunity for full scale investigation and quick enforcement action. </PARA>
<PARA> That investigation was mounted efficiently by the Taxation Office, opinions were sought and obtained from learned counsel, Mr Brinsden, late in 1974 and early 1975, suggesting clearly that there were grounds for proceeding both by way of criminal prosecution and civil recovery through the law of misfeasance. By August 1975 things had proceeded to the point in relation to that fundamentally important Perth test case where the Australian Taxation Office had authorised the Deputy Crown Solicitor to proceed to prosecute the people involved under the conspiracy provisions of the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA> But there in August 1975 the matter rested. A year later there was a police report which confirmed, in the view of the police, the ability of criminal prosecution to succeed. From time to time other opinions were obtained in relation to other cases, all of them pointing in the same direction. But absolutely nothing happened as a result of the default of the Attorney-General's Department which has been the subject of so much debate, quite properly, in this place. By March 1978 the Crown Solicitor was finally prodded into action by the Commissioner of Taxation's giving oral advice that in his view he did not think there was sufficient evidentiary foundation for this matter to proceed. That oral advice was followed, over a year later in April 1979, by written advice- advice still not tabled in this Parliament so that we can see for ourselves its quality, but advice which we are told did in fact occur. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been further led to appreciate that for the whole of the period from March 1978 when the Government finally turned its attention to this particular problem until December 1980 when it finally succeeded in legislating effectively -or apparently effectively-against bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, we had an unbelievably protracted, leisurely decision making process taking place so far as the drafting of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was concerned-a protracted , leisurely period in the course of which neglect and default to prosecute those immediately involved in the loss to revenue has been calculated at certainly hundreds of millions and possibly thousands of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> The constant theme in this debate has been that the Australian Labor Party's record was not any better so far as tax avoidance and evasion was concerned during its period in office. It is useful to diverge for a moment or two to scotch that particular canard with some new figures that have emerged that make it perfectly clear what the reality of the situation is. One point that has been made constantly is that the notorious Curran tax avoidance scheme was identified and was the subject of a statement by the Treasurer in 1974, but that no legislation was in fact enacted before we were bundled eventually, unceremoniously, out of office in November 1975. It is fair comment that legislation should have been enacted rather than the matter being left in the hiatus that it was. But it is equally fair comment that the incoming Liberal Government, keen if it was to act in these areas, should have, given the lapse of time, been prepared to legislate immediately. But, of course, no such legislation was introduced-not for 12 months, not for two years and not in fact until 1978-against that scheme. So the one criticism with any tinge of reality or force about it collapses so far as that experience was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The best evidence of the comparative default of the respective governments in this area comes from the figures in successive reports of the Commissioner of Taxation recording the number of identified participants in tax avoidance schemes. The Commissioner of Taxation records in his recently tabled report in the 1981-82 financial year there were 28,366 individuals identified as having taken part, not just in understating their income or things of that kind but in identified tax avoidance schemes. That represented a 27 per cent increase on the number of people so involving themselves in the previous financial year 1980-81. So much for the effectiveness, one might think, of the Income Tax Assessment Act Part IVA amending legislation in that financial year. On the Taxation Commissioner's assessment, the loss to revenue involved in those schemes was at least $1,500m. </PARA>
<PARA> The really interesting exercise is to compare the number of participants I have mentioned, 28,366 in the last financial year, with the number in the last period of the Labor Government in 1975-76. The comparable latter figure is 861. In other words, there has been a 33-fold increase over the period between 1975-76 and 1981-82 in the number of identified participants in tax avoidance schemes. That is a difference between hundreds-861-in the last months of our period in office and 28,366 in the most recent financial year. The implications of this utter and humiliating failure to act in the whole tax avoidance and evasion area are, of course, well known. </PARA>
<PARA> In our assessment, in figures that we have quite often repeated, the failure to confront the industry of avoidance and evasion has meant that the ordinary taxpaying household in this nation is up for an extra $30 a week on average as a result of that failure to act. The credibility of that figure has been constantly challenged by Mr Howard and others. It might be useful to mention again what the basis of that calculation is so that people can understand the force of what we are saying. It is very simply this: All the best estimates, including that of Mr Eric Risstrom, are that the combined loss to revenue of both tax evasion and tax avoidance, in both cases encompassing schemes and arrangements of a crude as well as a sophisticated kind, is a total of something like $7,000m split roughly down the middle between evasion and avoidance. If we take into account the fact that there are just over 4.5 million households in this nation, the most simple arithmetical calculation will produce the result that the cost of that loss to revenue each year, running at around $7,000m, taking into account all the different forms of avoidance and evasion, is what we have so often stated it to be. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been the Government's legislative response to this tax avoidance and evasion nightmare that has been evident for so long? Of course, through most of the 1970s and until very recently the Government's response simply took the form of a series of piecemeal measures-50 or so in total; quite a lot of them-against particular tax avoidance schemes, but always belatedly, always after the event and always in circumstances where the schemers were allowed to get away with at least one year, often two years, of profit to themselves by virtue of the inevitable belatedness of this machinery in catching up with them. There was no general anti-tax avoidance or anti-evasion measures passed until 1980, with the passage eventually at the end of that year of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act -at least three years too late, given the state of affairs that I have referred to before-and in 1981 the passage of the alleged general anti-avoidance provision, the new Part IVA of the tax Act-at least four years too late given the track record that the High Court had been putting up for that period. </PARA>
<PARA> There the Government rested with those sorts of measures and those sorts of legislative strategies. There the Government would have gone on resting had it not been for the McCabe-Lafranchi and Costigan reports jolting it out of its complacency. The Government has had a profound distaste for the constructive attempts that the Labor Party has been making over the last three or four years to bring forward an alternative approach to the problem of tax avoidance and tax evasion. Firstly, that approach has involved-I will not spell it out in detail as I have done so on other occasions-retrospective legislation against those avoidance schemes that can properly be characterised as blatant and artificial. Secondly, it involved a proper general anti-avoidance provision not just confined, like the present Part IVA to blatant schemes but one which in its application is wide enough, like the old section 260, to pick up many more ambiguous forms of tax avoidance where it is necessary to have the Commissioner' s discretion operating in a not very tightly constrained set of guidelines as under Part IVA. In relation to criminal legislation for crude evasion we have adopted a bipartisan approach with the Government. That is certainly part of the armoury. The fourth element in our approach has, of course, been something which the Government has steadfastly refused to do; that is, to produce a massive upgrading of the resources of the Australian Taxation Office to ensure that the legislation in the books will in fact mean something in the way it is administered in practice. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, nothing occurred from the Government by way of a willingness to talk through these issues in a sensible and constructive way, to think about ways of generating better anti-avoidance legislation than Part IVA, or to think about the circumstances in which retrospective legislation might in fact be appropriate as the best means not so much of recouping revenue but of deterring this kind of activity in the future. That kind of legislation was dismissed as crude, unprincipled and unworthy of attention by this Government. But now, of course, everything has changed. What has changed has not been any intellectual conversion on the part of the Government; it has been a political conversion forced upon it by the embarrassment of the McCabe-Lafranchi and Costigan reports . The embarrassment has gone to the extent of forcing the Government, in the now immortal words of Mr Michael Baume, into a situation of 'having to be seen to be doing something'. As Senator Button said earlier, that is exactly what the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very difficult Bill to summarise because of its complexity. It is complex, indeed, to the point of unintelligibility in many respects. This is illustrated by the way in which it is full of drafting difficulties because of the obvious haste with which it had to be thrown together to accommodate the then election timetable of this Government. To the extent that one can summarise it, one can say, of course, very simply that it provides for recoupment of unpaid company tax assessed and due where this is unable to be recovered as a consequence of some fraudulent stripping and dumping operation on the part of the proprietors of the company concerned-a stripping and dumping operation which , of course, in many cases as we now know involved the appointment of sham directors with criminal backgrounds and stripping and dumping operations which involved in many cases the quite literal destruction of the records by tipping them into the sea or otherwise disposing of them. In every case, as everyone now knows, the company was reduced to a mere shell so far as its assets were concerned and, while retaining a formal liability, it is in fact unable to be recovered against. </PARA>
<PARA> Confronted with that situation, what this Bill does is to seek to recoup moneys from a particular class of persons-the vendors and the promoters who encouraged the vendors to dispose of their companies in a particular way. The Bill basically does three things to operate the recoupment that is involved. In the first place, it does of course impose a retrospective liability on vendors and, to some extent, on promoters as well. Despite the melodrama with which Senator Macklin invested his contribution to this debate, it is probably fair to say that this legislation operates not so much to make illegal what was legal at the time so far as the vendors were concerned but rather it operates to make them pay rather a lot of money which, at the time, they did not have to pay and which they thought they had got out of paying. That perhaps simply is a semantic quibble. It is undoubtedly retrospective legislation. There is no point whatsoever in trying to hide the fact that people are being subjected to a liability which would not exist in the absence of this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second element in the legislation is the requirement that those who have to pay up have, in effect, to pick up the full tab of the unpaid company tax. There are all sorts of formulae for adjusting the contribution between the vendors and the promoters. What is involved is vesting in the vendors and, to a lesser extent, the promoters, the full liability for paying the unpaid company tax which has been assessed and making them pay tax which is otherwise unrecoverable . </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining aspect of the legislation which has generated so much interest, and in some breasts excitement, is that it does not allow any general claim of innocence to be made. There is a particular context in which an innocence claim can be made. That is the notorious Horgan clause to which Senator Walsh referred and which will be the subject of a good deal of debate at the Committee stage. Generally speaking, it is the case that a general claim of innocence cannot be made in such a way as to avert liability on the part of the vendors. The position is that they cannot claim, in effect, that they knew not what they were doing when some Father Christmas came along and said: 'You have a company with $ 100,000 worth of cashed-up current profits that you want to sell and on which you would have to pay $46,000 in tax to the Taxation Office at the end of this financial year if you didn't sell it. Don't worry, I will give you $90,000, taking $10,000 for myself, because we have got a magic solution, some black box through which we will pass this particular company of yours which will ensure that no taxation liability does in fact have to be paid'. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Bill does not take seriously the claims of innocence on the part of vendors who found themselves the proud recipients of Santa Claus treatment of that particular kind. It proceeds on the assumption-an assumption which we in the Australian Labor Party find attractive-that the vendor shareholders in question who sold their companies in these circumstances were very substantially financially advantaged by their participation in those particular sales at that particular time, that if there was any innocence on their part, if there was any ignorance on their part as to what was subsequently going to happen to those shares and to the company in question, then that innocence, that ignorance, was of the constructive or calculated kind. They must have known that, at worst, the companies they were selling were going to end up at the bottom of the harbour or , in some other way, stripped of their assets in some fraudulent scheme. At the very best they must have known that the only way the liability to tax could have been evaded was through the operation of some blatant, contrived, artificial avoidance scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> In either case, I would suggest that the moral position of the vendor shareholders is identical. They are not, as a class, in such a moral position as I think ought to attract the serious sympathy of any senator in this place. It is not a matter of imposing retrospective penalties on anybody; it is a matter of requiring vendor shareholders-who made a nice big fat financial killing as a result of their greed at the time in question when confronted with the opportunity to participate in these kinds of sale arrangements, who benefited from that greed and who ought now to pay the price that the rest of the community has had to pay-to pay the taxes that would otherwise have fallen due. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a continuing debate, of course-it has recurred again in some contributions today-about the necessity for this legislation doing all those things. The argument is put: How can one say that it is necessary when one also wants to say that the government was at fault for not actively pursuing these people in the mid-1970s when it did have machinery and it did have weaponry at hand with which to pursue them? How can one simultaneously advance both those propositions-that the weaponry was there and was not used and yet, at the same time, say that it is now necessary to employ new weaponry? It might be a conundrum to some people-I can understand it being a conundrum to someone like Senator Chipp, whose grasp of these matters is not notorious for its dexterity or its extent-but the answer is really very simple. There was a remedy. We would better understand it if the Government would continue to table the papers for which we have called setting out the legal opinions on this. I do repeat Senator Chipp's statement that we certainly have not abandoned that particular enterprise of obliging the Government to table the papers in question. One can accept that there was a liability at law, both criminal and civil, such that could have been deployed in the mid-1970s. That deployment of litigation resources in the mid-1970s would have had to be mobilised against only a handful of companies because that is all we were talking about numerically at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> The law in question-that of criminal conspiracy on the criminal side and that of misfeasance on the civil recovery side-is rather technical, is rather cumbrous and is rather difficult to apply. It is the cased now that with not a mere handful of companies involved but some 4,600 companies involved it would as a practical matter be quite inconceivable that this law could be applied systematically across the board so as to recoup successfully the amount of money that seems to be here involved. I note that the Government is, of course, mobilising teams of special prosecutors to ensure that some prosecution activity goes on and that some people at least end up getting their just criminal desserts. But it simply is nonsensical to say that the kind of weaponry which would have been very successful indeed, had it been used effectively in the mid- 1970s, would now be successful in doing the full range of the thing that this legislation purports to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I have talked about what the legislation does and why in general terms it is justified in seeking to do that. What I have not yet said anything about is what the legislation does not do. I think it is important if one is making out a case , as I want to, for the feebleness basically of this legislation to draw attention to at least some of the more obvious weaknesses. Many of the points that I want to make can be made, of course, much more elaborately and sensibly in the Committee stage debate. But I think this is an appropriate time to summarise at least what the Bill does not do. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing that the Bill does not do is that it completely fails to recover the money that has been cheated in the same transactions as the bottom- of-the-harbour sales that we are talking about by way of unpaid personal income tax as distinct from unpaid company tax. The present Bill is designed to recover , we are told, something like $620m in unpaid company tax. But it does not operate to do anything by way of recovering between $3000m and $511m worth of unpaid personal income tax that would be payable had the accumulated profits that were also brought into account into these transactions been brought into account and made part of the proper scope of this legislation. Very simply and quickly, something like two-thirds, I understand, of the 4,600 companies which have so far been identified as participating in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes such that they were ultimately stripped, dumped and reduced to shells-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it does not. I am talking about circumstances where Division 7 tax has been paid. We are talking about net residual accumulated profits, what is left over and what is legitimately in the hands of a company and could legitimately stay there without being taxed until such time as it is distributed . We are talking about accumulated profits on which tax is payable only when they are distributed and in the hands of the shareholder. In something like two- thirds of the 4,600 companies that are so far involved there were accumulated profits of this residual kind as well as current year profits involved. What has happened is that in the hands of the purchaser strippers those accumulated profits were equally neatly stripped out of the company and distributed but not in such a way as to attract a personal income tax liability, the standard technique for this purpose being the Slutzkin scheme as it operated in the hands of the promoters. That was the more sophisticated way of doing it. The less sophisticated way was for the purchaser-promoter simply to take the money and run. Either way there was a situation where a good deal of personal income tax remained unpaid in relation to accumulated profits that were passed over in the very same transactions as current year profits were passed over by some hungry vendors to the promoters and purchasers involved in these schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to be heard to be suggesting that in every single case where accumulated profits are stripped out of the companies there is necessarily a tax avoidance motive of a blatant, contrived and unambiguous kind such as would properly attract retrospective legislation of this kind. I think it can be argued that sometimes accumulated profits strips occur in the context of legitimate company rationalisation in circumstances where there is no tax avoidance motive. That is another argument for another day. But in the context of these transactions where it is pretty evident, by virtue of the way in which the vendors were disposing of accumulated current year profits, that there was a very clear tax avoidance motive I do not think the moral position of those vendors is any better in relation to their accumulated profit component that they shoved in their pockets than it is in relation to the current year component of the profits they shoved in their pockets. The Australian Labor Party believes this legislation should be extended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The second basic weakness in this Bill is, of course, that going back to current year profits simply does not cover that field completely. There is a massive loophole now in the Bill by virtue of clause 3 (12)-the Horgan clause, as Senator Walsh has so properly described it-which will be the subject of detailed attention in the Committee stage debate. It is a disgraceful capitulation on the part of the Government to have made that particular concession-a widely unreported capitulation-and I hope that circumstance changes after the debate here in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing that the Bill does not do is cover the field in terms of making life difficult for the current year profit vendors. I am referring in particular to the back-sliding that went on between the first and final drafts of the Bill. Four or five particular areas of back-sliding can be briefly summarised as follows. We had the companies originally being subject to penalty tax for failure to lodge tax returns and for late payment but those provisions were, of course, dropped and the liability was not passed on in that respect to the vendors. We had the late payment penalty being reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. Then we had the Bills being further sanitised by a provision allowing the tax dodgers involved 12 months to pay without penalty-a concession that is simply not nearly so generous in respect to other ordinary and less favoured classes of vendor. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a further provision in the latest draft of this Bill reducing or taking away the capacity of the Commissioner of Taxation to name those persons involved in these schemes-again an obvious endeavour to protect well-known Liberal Party identities and supporters from disclosure. We have an extraordinary provision now which enables promoters, for income tax purposes, to claim deductions for the moneys that they pay out by way of their contribution to this recoupment tax . Apart from all these areas of back-sliding we have a failure, as the amendment also states, to deal with other areas of tax evasion involving straw companies. This is, despite all the hairy chested huff and puff that has going on with it a feeble and belated piece of legislation which simply does not deserve the wholehearted support that is being sought for it by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a long speaking list for this debate on a parcel of retrospective tax Bills. Those 10 speakers who have preceded me have contributed much to the debate. In fact, the speaking list on this legislation is longer than any other I can remember for any other Bill coming before this Senate. To avoid repetition and to keep my contribution brief , I will avoid debating the points that have been raised by my opponents in this matter. However, I say to Senator Evans that he is wrong in his basic assertion that the Government has done nothing about tax evasion. No government in the history of Australia has done more than the present Government to close off tax loop-holes. The fundamental problem is the nature of the Income Tax Assessment Act. While we have a document like it we will always have people going through it and beating it. We will not solve the problem until we get a simpler tax Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret that I cannot support these Bills. I cannot support them because they are unashamedly and undisguisedly pieces of retrospective legislation. The fact that they are retrospective means that they will have a major and an unfair impact on some members of the Australian community. They will make some actions which were perfectly legal 10 years ago illegal today. Retrospective legislation , except in very exceptional circumstances, is avoided by all governments for it undermines the very basis of the rule of law, the basis on which democratic governments operate. It is banned under the Constitution of some countries. It is specifically against the philosophy of the Liberal Party. It sets a very dangerous precedent. As Senator Martyr so eloquently showed this morning, the opportunities that it provides for the Australian Labor Party to come in with a whole swag of restrospective legislation is quite frightening. For this Government to bring in such legislation shows the level of ignorance in the Executive level as to the difficulties under which the business world operates. The business world simply cannot exist with retrospective legislation. Life is made not only difficult but also impossible if we keep changing the rules under which a company raises its finances. </PARA>
<PARA> Running a company is far more difficult and complex than running a family. As companies get larger and larger there are very involved procedures in staying alive in today's environment of high inflation with consequential high interest rates. In the light of legislation as it stands at the present time it is utterly untenable, if we are going to keep people employed in this world, for us to be changing the rules under which companies make decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, I do not wish to debate the details of the Bills because they are not important. We cannot get away from the central point that the legislation is blatantly retrospective. No amount of dissembling can avoid that. I do not take a position of stating dogmatically that I will never support retrospective legislation. However, I would need exceptional circumstances to do so. I am not convinced by any of the arguments advanced in relation to these Bills that exceptional circumstances apply to them. As a legislator I find it is difficult enough to get people to conform to the law as it stands today without having them worry about what we might do to the law as it existed 10 years back. The ordered social and commercial life of this country would become impossible if we started to do that. Just as no government can legislate to bind a future government as to what its actions from legislative point of view might be, so no government can go back in history and say that what is right in former times is wrong today. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it very clear at the outset that I have no truck at all with tax evaders . They have broken the law and there is no penalty too heavy for them. Every Australian should contribute his share, within the legal requirements, to the running and fair cost of living within this country. There is no argument about that. I am very conscious of the political opprobrium that comes from taking a position contrary to that of supporting these Bills. It is not at all a position of support for the wrong-doers. They have got my unbridled contempt. I hope they suffer the penalties for their wrong-doings. Quite clearly, the short-term gain is in supporting these Bills. That is the simplistic view which the public adopts as the correct thing to do. Unfortunately, in the longer term, the security of Australia means that the Bills must be opposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Society has to be governed by a rule of law to be fair and just. People who live in the society must obey those laws. There is nothing sacrosanct about laws . They are man made and often imperfect. They are imperfect because people such as us make them. Sometimes they are badly constructed; sometimes they are badly thought through. Of course, quite frequently laws that were once good become inadequate because the circumstances that led to their introduction have now changed. In that situation the correct remedy is to change the laws through parliamentary procedure and to have the change apply to the situation from then on. It is perfectly proper for a Minister or Executive government to introduce a Bill to alter a law which is not achieving the intention of the law when it was passed through parliament. Here, this Parliament clearly is being asked to enter into some retrospective legislation. Having due regard to all the circumstances, I believe that it is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that we are covering up for a lack of appropriate action at the time by the Executive and the Commissioner of Taxation. The Commissioner is a person who already possesses the widest powers of anyone in the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the rule of law. Liberty is possible only within the rule of law. The alternative to that is a state of anarchy-the rule of the strong, which in practical terms means the rule of the most brutal and the most unprincipled. Therefore, society has to have laws and furthermore society must believe those laws will be applied. As Senator Martyr said, the certainty that the law will be applied is a fundamental part of that doctrine. The certainty that the law will be applied carries with it a presumption that those who conform to the law are safe within the law. Therefore, it is utterly untenable that after the event the law should be changed-in this particular case, up to 10 years after the event. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the rationalisation of those who support this legislation to be quite untenable. Broadly, their arguments fall into two classes. The first is that the amount of money involved is so great that it has to be recovered irrespective of the principles involved. I think the assumption is that there is a great deal of money around but I will be very surprised if much money is recovered by this legislation. Perhaps only $200m or $300m will be recovered. Secondly, those who support the legislation frankly concede that it is wrong but they say they are going along with it because it is happening on only one occasion. Both those arguments are intellectually and morally bankrupt. Of course the Australian Labor Party is not inhibited in any way by retrospectivity. Senator Evans has indicated on many occasions what the ALP will do, if it gains power, in regard to retrospective legislation on tax matters. In one statement attributed to him he said that the present legislation is only the thin edge of the wedge. As I said earlier, business cannot live with retrospective legislation with respect to its financing. Of all the people on the Opposition side, probably only Senator Walsh has a glimmer of the truth of that statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move some amendments in the Committee stage. I do not wish to go through those now but I make some general comments about the legislation. Broadly, the vendors of companies who will be affected by this legislation fall into two groups. The first group of vendors knew full well what was going on. They very clearly set out to defraud the Commissioner of Taxation. The second group of vendors really did not know what was going on and they had no intention to defraud the Commissioner. They did not know that tax would be avoided. I do not know the ratio of the two groups but, at a guess, I would say that those who knew that they were defrauding the Commissioner of Taxation made up the major group and those who did not know were clearly in the minority. However, they would still form a substantial minority. But numbers do not determine justice in our system. Whether only six companies, or even one company, were involved, it would be wrong to penalise one innocent person because the other 99 were guilty. We operate under a rule of law which gives the benefit of doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> The people in the first group were involved in a deliberate, fraudulent practice. I have no time for them or their advisers. Fraud is always a criminal offence and it should be prosecuted with the full force of the law. It could have been prosecuted under the law as it existed at the time, for there are and there were laws to cover this fraudulent practice. The point is that neither the Commissioner of Taxation nor the Government took any action under the existing legislation against those people. Royal Commissioner Costigan made a strong case in his fourth report on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union that charges were possible on the grounds of conspiracy. He put forward a very closely reasoned case. But that was never tried. The only example I know of a conspiracy charge being laid against promoters, operators or vendors of companies, is the recent charging of Maher and Faint. I am advised that there may well be difficulties with that charge because there seems to be a view in legal circles that it is very difficult to prove a charge of conspiracy. I would have thought that section 231 of the Income Tax Assessment Act provided an opportunity for the Government to move against fraudulent people in the income tax world without any difficulty at all. Section 231 is in black and white. In part, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> 231. (1) Any person who, or any company on whose behalf the public officer, or a director, servant or agent of the company, by any wilful act, default or neglect, or by any fraud, act or contrivance whatever, avoids or attempts to avoid assessment or taxation shall be guilty of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> Penalty: Not less than Fifty dollars, or more than One thousand dollars and, in addition, the Court may order the person to pay to the Commissioner a sum not exceeding double the amount of tax that has been avoided or attempted to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very simple provision of the Act. I believe that in 1959 Mr Justice McTiernan, in the High Court, used that provision to convict an evader. Apart from that I am not aware of the Commonwealth resorting to the use of section 231 on any occasion since. It seems to be a very simple clause, one that is much simpler to apply than is the charge of conspiracy. It has the great beauty of doubling the taxation penalty. I would have thought that if section 231 had been resolutely applied it would have meant sudden death to all these tax avoidance schemes over the years. But nothing along those lines has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the second group-the people who are very disadvantaged by this legislation. They simply acted within the law as it stood at the time and are guilty of no crime whatsoever. Most of these people took professional advice and acted on it. It is quite wrong in such cases to attribute improper motives to their professional advisers because those advisers were bound by law to so advise their clients as to maximise their financial interests. I am very much indebted to Senator Macklin for the way in which he went through some of the examples relating to why people sell companies. Quite simply, in the commercial world there is a whole range of very valid reasons why companies should be sold and disposed of. One simple reason is that the company could be used in primary production or oil exploration and taxation benefits could be legally and legitimately claimed on those grounds. It is quite wrong to attribute to owners or vendors of companies in this category any attempt at tax evasion. In today's commercial world one is often under pressure to operate as efficiently as one can. There seems to be in this Parliament no conception of the great difficulties experienced in times of high inflation, where one is dealing with inventories worth millions of dollars, trying to stay alive, pay income tax and employ people. Equally, there seems to be no appeciation of those difficulties by the Commissioner of Taxation. It is very difficult to trade, to stay in business at the present time-as indeed it has been for the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed legislation would have many consequences. One of the most striking would be that shareholders of a limited liability company would be liable for the debts of that company. That is quite revolutionary. It negates the purpose of having a limited liability company. This means not only that the shareholders are now liable for the debts of that company, namely, a notional income tax, but also for a notional income tax in respect of a company that they no longer own- that they have sold to someone else or that has been sold to several other people. To say the least, this is a most revolutionary move in Australian commercial law. It is rather like a case in which a new car dealer sells a car. It is subsequently sold several times and eight years later is used in a bank robbery. The original dealer then finds that he is charged before the courts as an accessory after the fact in bank robbery. It is just nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA> There are certain fundamentals on which society operates. There are bonds of unconscious trust that hold a society together. One is the expectation that other people will obey the rule of law. People who sold these companies quite honestly could rightfully expect that the people who bought them would live within the rule of law. For example, if one went out to drive a car on a public road one would do so always with the expectation that the other road users would obey the rule of law; that they would drive on the correct side of the road and would not kill one in a head-on collision. As taxpayers we all pay our taxes to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. We do that in the expectation that he will bank the money in Consolidated Revenue and not sock it away for a holiday on the Gold Coast. We would not pay our tax if we thought the Commissioner of Taxation was not honest. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential point is that the law was altered in December 1980, nearly two years ago. It stopped dead this particular form of tax evasion. It is regrettable that action was not taken before 1980, but a contract was made between the Government, the Commissioner of Taxation and those people. We have to live, as members of the Government, with the contract that existed up to the time of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act of December 1980. The whole matter has to be seen in perspective. Bad and all as it might have been, it is only part of the taxation evasion scheme in Australia. The black economy, the cash economy, is probably a far bigger factor than the tax evasion schemes applying to companies. Figures officially quoted for the black economy range between five and 10 per cent. Some figures indicate that it ranges up to 20 per cent of the gross domestic product of Australia. That is really a huge factor. When one gets to figures beyond 10 per cent of the GDP one is getting far beyond the wildest estimates of Senator Evans as to what is happening with these forms of company tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, the basic problem here is the Income Tax Assessment Act. It has now reached a stage where it is beyond reasonable comprehension. It can no longer be fiddled with or fine tuned. It has become the major vehicle in tax raising in Australia. I would like to give honourable senators an example. In 1955-56 personal income tax accounted for 38.4 per cent of Commonwealth Budget revenue. In 1982-83, this fiscal year, it is expected to account for 55.8 per cent. It has now become the major vehicle for financing Federal Budgets. Furthermore, it has an uneven application. In 1954-55 the maximum marginal tax rate began to apply at almost 18 times average weekly earnings. By 1969-70 it began to apply at eight times the average earnings. By 1975-76 it applied at 2.8 times average earnings and the figure for 1982-83 is expected to be two times average earnings. The whole of the Income Tax Assessment Act is moving against an equal and fair distribution of the taxation burden in this country. We cannot fix it under the present system. We must reform both the Income Tax Assessment Act and the mix between direct and indirect taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> I was always an advocate against increasing indirect taxation. When I first came into the Senate I spoke against it. But having had the opportunity over the years to see the effect of the present taxation system with relation to personal income tax, I am well aware of the great defects, the unfairness and the sheer impracticality of the present Income Tax Assessment Act. I believe there are unfair elements in indirect taxation, but I do not believe they are beyond the will of man to be compensated for. The great advantage of indirect taxation is that it is harder to evade than direct personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to direct income tax, I believe we have to throw out that Act and start again. I would go so far as to say that any political party in Australia which produces a simple, innovative rewriting of the Income Tax Assessment Act would win the next election on that issue alone. I say that because there is such a public outcry against the impracticality, the unworkability and the unfairness of the present Income Tax Assessment Act. I do not know what form the new Act should take, but I certainly have no objection to the proposition that we have a flat tax. I am well aware that if it were imposed in a direct substitutional way for the present Income Tax Assessment Act, gross inequalities and unfairness would be involved. But just as with indirect tax, this can be resolved on a fair basis. All it needs is a bit of thought. The great advantage of an indirect tax is that it would have a degree of simplicity that this present document, which is about two inches thick, can never have. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what it costs to administer the Income Tax Assessment Act. Some people have spoken today about the poverty of funding given by the Government, to the Commission of Taxation, saying he should be able to employ more assessors to implement this Act. Surely it is wrong to have a tax Act which needs to be administered by an army of people. The administrative costs deny to the people of Australia the benefits of raising income tax. We are not in the business of keeping tax assessors in work. We are in the business of providing services to the people of Australia. If we had a simple tax Act we could reduce dramatically our administrative costs in collecting tax. I do not know the answer to the problems with the present tax Act. But while we have the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 we will always be behind the eight ball because there will always be smart and unscrupulous operators who will be able to pick holes in it, no matter how extensively it is amended. We will always be behind the action. We can never get in front of it. The only answer is to have a different structure. My time is nearly up. I regret that these Bills were ever introduced into this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment by the Australian Labor Party to the motion for the second reading of the Taxation ( Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982. I indicate that in the event of the amendment not being supported we will substantially support the Government's position. We disassociate ourselves from the contributions that have been made by those rebel members of the Government who are clearly speaking on behalf of those who have spent a great deal of time in recent months lobbying against the Government's retrospective legislation. I wish to raise several matters concerning tax avoidance and evasion-I referred to it earlier as tax aversion, which I think is a very appropriate description-because it is clear that the tax avoidance and evasion that exists in the Australian community has special application to a small group of people. I refer largely to those in the business sector who have taken advantage of decisions made by the Barwick High Court to avoid meeting their responsibilities and avoid making their contributions to an equitable tax system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our amendment condemns the Government's dismal record in confronting tax evasion and avoidance. The Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982 is determined to try to close those loopholes which have clearly existed. We have seen divisions within the Government parties and within the Australian Democrats . I am pleased to say that there is no such division within the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> We will take every step available to us to make sure that we have an equitable tax system in Australia and that those who earn more, whether as a result of speculation, business acumen or labour, pay their due share of tax. I refer to the comment by Senator MacGibbon that many people who will be caught by this legislation acted in accordance with the law. He went on to say that they went to their lawyers or accountants for the purpose of avoiding tax and they were often given information which enabled them to evade tax. In those circumstances the Parliament is entitled to take whatever steps it deems necessary to rectify that evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that this Bill would never have come before the Parliament had it not been for the decision of the Victorian Parliament to establish the McCabe- Lafranchi inquiry. The report of that inquiry gave emphasis to what the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union said about the problem of wholesale tax evasion in Australia. Those reports would have blown this Government away in a gust of popular anger at the tax evasion and avoidance rip-off, if the Government had not acted as it has been forced to act in presenting the Parliament with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment seeks to condemn this Government which has not been persuaded to take the sort of action over the years that would have realised the income of additional millions of dollars that has been lost to general revenue and found its way into the pockets of tax cheats, both shareholder-vendors and scheme promoters. No one can justify these people not being forced now to pay their due share of tax-a huge amount of money. It is difficult to be sure how much is involved, but it certainly must run into billions of dollars which have been lost to the vast majority of people in Australia who pay their tax and who, as a result of that, have found themselves paying higher taxes. This lost revenue has gone into the pockets of the unscrupulous, many of whom are supporters of and office-holders in the Government parties. It needs to be said that the average taxpayer in this country has been forced to pay between $32 and $35 a week more as a result of the activities of these tax cheats. That means that the average person in Australia paying his tax through the pay-as-you-earn system has been paying something like $1,800 more than he should have paid because of the unscrupulous attitude taken by numerous people concerned as they were with avoiding their tax responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The vendor-shareholders have received capital gains and avoided their tax liability. They did so by utilising the expertise of lawyers and accountants for that purpose. Of course, they were aided in this process by one of the chief tax evaders in this country. I refer to the former Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick, whose judgments clearly have been designed to make the job of the Australian Taxation Ofice in this country more difficult, if not impossible in respect of collecting the tax that was due to the Commonwealth of Australia on the basis of an equitable system. That is why we condemn the Government's inactivity and its protection of its social and economic base over the years 1978 at least, to 1982 until it was forced out of its burrow to bring legislation before the Parliament in order to establish in the public mind that the Government could not but condemn what has been going on surreptitiously over recent years. The point I want to make is the neglect on the part of the Government and the fact that the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes dealt with in this Bill were first detected way back in 1973. Commissioner Costigan said in his report:</PARA>
<PARA> This scheme was first detected in a wide spread manner by the Australian Taxation Office in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, in the early days of this debate the Government sought to suggest that there was some omission on the part of the Labor Government in the year 1974-75 when these matters were brought to the attention of the Government, ignoring the fact that we had taken action to institute administrative steps that would have overcome the problem. That was fouled up in the Perth office of the Crown Solicitor. Initially the scheme was found to be operating in Perth and Mr Costigan, as we now know well, detailed this particular case. A decision was made by the Taxation Office to prosecute the persons involved in one scheme; that is, it was decided that a test case should be run. But unfortunately, as we now know, that was stopped, and the proceedings for prosecution under the Crimes Act for conspiring to defraud the Commonwealth never got off the ground for the reasons outlined in Mr Costigan's report. Both the Crown Solicitor's Office and the Taxation Office were clearly negligent in that repect. Of course, when we consider the political atmosphere in the country in 1974-75 it is clear that people realised that the conservatives generally were destabilising the political processes to such an extent that they were able to sit down and conspire to bring these schemes to fruition, schemes which then began to grow in the early years of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the numerous submissions that the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr O' Reilly, put to the Treasurer (Mr Howard). In the tabled documents we see a letter dated 19 January 1978 to the Treasurer suggesting 60 legislative proposals. During 1978-on 13 February, 11 April, 24 May, 1 June and 6 June- memoranda were sent to the Treasurer by Commissioner O'Reilly. What happened on 6 June 1978? The Cabinet could not agree with the submissions and so they were stalled as a result of the inactivity of the Fraser-Anthony administration. Mr O 'Reilly again had to write to the Treasurer on another 11 or 12 occasions over the succeeding three years in order to try to convince the Government of the need for legislative action. He also had to write to the Attorney-General ( Senator Durack) pointing out the lost revenue as a result of these schemes and the need for legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not until 1980 that certain legislation, which had as its objective a closing down of a number of these schemes, was passed. As we know from the documents tabled in the Senate some time ago, this delay went on as a result of the Government's own procrastination. While this was going on, bottom-of-the- harbour schemes mushroomed. After a series of legal opinions which clearly advised the Government that recommendations for prosecution could be successful, and after some 18 months of communication from the Taxation Office to the Government, action was finally taken, as I said, in the legislation passed in 1980 in the form of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party and I believe-I am sure people outside the Parliament believe this-that this delay was inexcusable and irresponsible and that it amounts to a complete misuse of taxpayers' funds and electors' trust. This Government's neglect and inaction gives the lie to the 1980 election promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He was quoted at large as saying: 'We are clamping down on tax avoidance'. That is what he said at the last election and yet he knew quite well that the years of procrastination by the Government in the Cabinet room were responsible for the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of revenue due from companies and those associated with the shareholding area. What a thing for a Prime Minister seeking re- election to say after he and his Government have let at least $600m in tax-this is admitted by the Treasurer-slip away due to bottom-of-the-harbour schemes over that vital five-year period. This is the Government's own admission. It is suggested by rebel Liberal and National Party senators that we should turn a blind eye and forget about legislation which seeks to recover that large amount of money. That suggestion comes at a time when there is uncertainty in the community, rising unemployment and when States are cutting back their expenditure because of the lack of assistance from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Costigan and McCabe-Lafranchi reports give us some idea of the magnitude of the problem that was allowed to develop in those years by this very neglectful Fraser Administration. Costigan gives the following figures on the growth of the pre-tax profits strip, or the wet Slutzkin schemes as they have been described and as identified by the Taxation Office. In 1973 only 27 companies were involved; in 1974 the number had grown to 65; there were 117 in 1975; and in 1977 the figure grew to 507; in 1979 there were 622; and in 1980 there were 1, 412. So we see the growth in the number of people avoiding their tax responsibilities. Of course Mr Costigan cautioned against the use of these figures, indicating that the extent of the problem may be far worse. The Labor Party believes they are far worse and that that is probably only the tip of the iceberg. Mr Costigan stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It should not be assumed that the Taxation Office, even today, is able to prepare an exhaustive list of all companies involved . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, the New South Wales Government's attempts to look at the problem in the same way as the Victorian Government have resulted in the disclosure of a considerable number of companies in my State which have been involved in these nefarious schemes. Mr Costigan goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I am confident they have done their best to find out. Unfortunately, the current investigative techniques are not up to the task in hand. </PARA>
<PARA>So here again we have an area of gross neglect by the Liberal and National Party governments. McCabe-Lafranchi alleged that at least 3,000 companies were involved in these schemes. The Tax Office now admits that it believes that at least 6,000 companies were involved in these subversive and nefarious activities . </PARA>
<PARA> This is the sort of tax cheating that has been going on while the Fraser Government looked in another direction, concerning itself always with legislation against workers, with attacking everybody else in the Australian community, attacking royal commissioners, the Taxation Office, the Public Service, workers and salary earners-attacking everybody else but itself until finally it has been forced by public opinion to bring this piece of legislation to the light of day. This legislation will be passed only with the assistance of the Australian Labor Party in the Senate. If McCabe, Lafranchi and Costigan had not been diligent in their work and if these reports had not been handed down and the extent of this cheating exposed, we would still not know and this Government would still have been able to avoid and ignore its responsibilities in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation Office has been given no help in the difficult task of tracking down these cheats. I well recall that Mr Howard, the Treasurer, on his return from overseas attempted to shift the blame for this difficulty on to the Taxation Office. The facilities of the Taxation Office have been allowed to run down as a result of direct decisions of this Government to cut back on staff. Between 1975 and 1981 the total number of staff employed by the Taxation Office fell marginally by 90-that is by 0.7 per cent. However, over the same period the total number of returns lodged increased by 12 per cent. This meant that the number of staff per thousand returns fell from 1.6 to 1.42 over this time-a fall of 11 per cent. At a time when these tax cheats were accelerating their activities, when our population was increasing, when the Australian economy was booming, this Government took steps to restrict the capacity of the Australian Tax Office to collect the tax that was due from one section of the Australian community. Let us have no doubt about it, pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, who represent more than 90 per cent of the Australian people, are not able to avoid their tax responsibility. Mr Deputy President, you, a wage earner, a Commonwealth or State public servant, a local government employee or any worker outside cannot avoid taxation responsibilities. Tax is taken out at the point at which salary is received. So only one section of the Australian community-those people involved in professional activities and company activities-have been taking advantage of the lethargy of the Fraser Administration over the years that it has been in office from 1975 to 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> So at the same time as the Taxation Office staff level fell the work load of the Office increased dramatically, as is demonstrated, in the figures to which I have referred. Also, the level of tax avoidance exploded and many new concessions were added to the taxation system. Of course, it is hardly surprising that Professor Russell Mathews, Australia's foremost tax expert, summed up the taxation system as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the problems and their consequences, tax authorities, governments and the courts have allowed tax avoidance to flourish on such a scale as to make personal income tax a voluntary tax for the rich non-salary earners. Despite the emphasis which has been given to vertical equity in the design of the Australian income tax system, the essential problem is not to make the rich pay higher rates of tax, or even more tax, than the poor: It is to make the rich pay any income tax at all. There has recently been some discussion about the potential for a tax revolt in Australia. It must be recognised that a massive tax revolt has already taken place: but it is a revolt of business taxpayers against wage and salary earners, of the rich against the poor. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Fraser Government's overall tax record is consistent with its neglect in the area of tax evasion and avoidance. Clearly that indictment by Russell Mathews is one that ought to cause the heads of members of the Senate, especially those of the 10, 11 or a dozen government rebels who are to vote against this legislation when it is finally put to a vote, to hang in shame at the failure of the Government to accept its responsibilities. The Government's record confirms and extends inequity and unfairness and which places the burden on the wage and salary earner. Since Mr Fraser assumed office with the proclaimed aim of lowering of the tax burden and a commitment to tax indexation he has allowed the greatest tax burden ever to fall on the Australian people. This matter of tax avoidance and tax evasion-I emphasise the words 'tax evasion' -is the greatest tax scandal to hit this country this century. </PARA>
<PARA> The scandalous taxation record of the Government is very relevant to the Senate 's consideration of this legislation. The Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Bill is claimed to be confirmation of the Government's determination to enshrine fairness in the Australian taxation system. Mr Fraser has suggested so much in his address to the nation. He is hanging his hat on this legislation, despite concerted division and opposition in his own ranks. He will need the support of the Australian Labor Party in this chamber to get this legislation adopted. There is nothing fair about the overall taxation system he presides over. It rips the people off. This year, for example, total tax collections by the Commonwealth will represent 25.5 per cent of gross domestic product compared with 23.1 per cent during the last year of the Whitlam Labor Government-and this Government claims that it is a low tax government. The burden of this massive increase in taxation has not been spread evenly over all taxpayers. Ordinary wage and salary earners have been forced to bear the brunt of rising taxes. Tax collections from wage and salary earners, pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, have risen from 41.7 per cent of total tax receipts in 1975-76-the year of the last Labor Budget-to 45.4 per cent under the present Budget. At the same time taxes collected from the business sector, from individual non- PAYE taxpayers-those with incomes from business, properties and dividends and professional persons and companies-have fallen as a proportion of total tax collections. Surely that would have excited the interest of the Government if it were concerned to have an equitable tax system. But no, it asked no questions of the Australian Taxation Office. It accepted the figures it was given without asking any questions. A table I have shows the proportion of total tax collections attributed to PAYE and non-PAYE taxpayers and companies. It has been prepared by the office of the shadow Treasurer and incorporated in the House of Representatives Hansard. I seek leave to incorporate that table. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These figures give a clear picture of the basic tax policy of the Fraser Government. It is a redistributive tax policy, one that distributes away from the low and middle income earners. Consequently, it ought to be condemned. In addition to Mr Fraser's regressive income tax policies we have seen indirect tax collections rise by $2,774m in the last two Budgets alone. Sales tax as a proportion of total tax collections has risen from 6.5 per cent to 8.7 per cent in that period. Indirect taxes, of course, fall most heavily on those on lower incomes. They are particularly prone to avoidance and evasion, as recent reports have indicated. This inverted position flows from the failure to collect tax from certain sections of the business community. I concede that most sections of the business community have not been involved in these schemes and that only a small percentage have taken advantage of these nefarious schemes to rob the average Australian taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the background to the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Bill. In summary, this background traces a history of scandalous neglect on the part of the Fraser Government towards tax cheating and a history of regressive and dishonest tax moves by that Government. Now with that history behind him, the Prime Minister is asking the Parliament and the people of Australia to believe that the Bill before us makes up for the years of neglect and for the years of failure to collect the due proportion of tax from a significant section of the Australian people. We say that it does not absolve it from those responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Bill is supported by the Opposition. Nevertheless, it is inadequate for a number of reasons. The inadequacies in the Bill have been outlined by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Evans. Basically the Bill falls short because of these factors: It fails to move to recoup individual income tax which should have been paid on dividends distributed to shareholders in the case of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes-only lost company tax and undistributed profits tax will be regained. It provides a very wide degree of leniency to tax evaders in respect of the time that they are given to pay their evaded tax. It fails to act at all against the dry-Slutzkin scheme which involves the avoidance of tax payable on the profits distributed to shareholders , but upon which company tax has been paid. If the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were really serious about being fair, these cases of blatant avoidance would be mopped up. It fails to act on a wide range of other tax evasion and avoidance schemes, picking up only a tiny proportion of Australia's cheated tax bill. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Opposition supports this Bill, it does so to ensure that some other step, however small it may be, is made against the outrage of tax cheating which has been synonomous with the actions of the Government in the last six or seven years. It does so noting also that many in the Government ranks cannot find their way clear to support even this small move. That, in my view, condemns them for all time. The Liberal and National parties are littered with people who oppose this legislation because they benefit from the current scheme. The Liberal and National parties are littered with the new rich of Perth who loll around on their yachts on the Swan River or bask at Rottnest Island. The New South Wales branches of these parties are infested with these tax bludgers. Mr Fraser, desperate for electoral support, has decided to move against some of the more blatant cases of corruption-corruption that is at the very heart of the party that he leads and is found in this Government. This small piece of legislation is all he can come up with. For the sake of the millions of honest Australian taxpayers, the ambit of the legislation needs to be extended. I commend the amendment moved on behalf of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to say a little about retrospectivity. I remind the Senate that , in the early 1950s, allegations were made about a communist. Laws at that time did not cover that case. The Menzies Government had no hesitation in enacting retrospective legislation with the support of the conservatives to deal with that matter because it was not covered by existing legislation. I think it is hypocritical for Government members to get up and say that they are opposed to retrospective legislation when, in fact, they have been party to it on occasions in the past. I find it also inconsistent and unacceptable that Government members can stand up and defend white collar crime which, in the minds of many criminologists, is the biggest form of crime occurring in our country today. Young men-perhaps some young women-who are foolish enough to believe that they can band together and rob a bank and get away with $15,000 or $20,000, when caught will spend six or seven years in a penitentiary for that crime of taking money from an institution. Yet, thousands of people in our community have been involved in monstrous crimes of stealing, not $15,000, $20,000 or $30,000 but millions and millions of dollars. They are the people who should be called to book for the activities in which they have been involved over the last six or seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I am not impressed by the number of letters that I have been getting from the Gold Coast, the north of New South Wales and the North Shore of Sydney suggesting that I ought not to support retrospective legislation, when the writers are living in leisure and taking advantage of loopholes which were given, perhaps, some legal recognition as a result of decisions made by the Barwick High Court. I make no bones about it. I support retrospective legislation when it seeks to establish some equity in our taxing system, when people have set about, through their various means, to evade their responsibilities and have forced ordinary citizens, as a consequence, to pay between $30 and $35 a week more in tax than they would have been taxed if everyone had borne his fair share of the tax burden. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was speaking on this measure yesterday I pointed out to the Senate some of the remarks of the Speaker of the House of Representatives when he made a statement in that House at the time that the Bill was dealt with on 26 October last. In fairness, I should indicate that in making the comments that I made yesterday, I understood and well appreciated the way in which, over the years, the Speaker has advocated a greater independence for Parliament for the protection of the rights of members. But I emphasise that, notwithstanding his going to the trouble of giving evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing-I appreciate that fact-the real genesis of this Bill lies in the thoughtful recommendations of that Select Committee. If necessary, I could mention certain other matters, such as the advance to the President and the advance to the Speaker that are provided for in this Bill on the same basis as there is in the Appropriation Bill an advance to the Minister for Finance. It was a thought of the Senate Committee that an advance should be made available to the President of the Senate for the Senate's needs and that an advance should be made available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives to make certain that Parliament would not have to go cap in hand to the Executive in between sessions of Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On that aspect, I cite, by way of example, one or two small passages from the evidence given to the Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing on 12 February 1981. As reported at page 341 of the official Hansard transcript of evidence, the Chairman of the Committee asked the Speaker of the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to our desire to divorce ourselves from the Executive, do you think it would be better for the Presiding Officers to have some sort of reserve fund, to be administered in consultation with the Treasurer or the Minister for Finance?</PARA>

<PARA>Parliamentary Appropriation Bill</PARA>

<PARA>Parliamentary Appropriation Bill</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker's answer was:</PARA>
<PARA> No. It really is not important to me whether the Parliament has a reserve on which it can draw, in other words a Presiding Officers' fund or a Minister for Finance Fund. The one-line appropriation establishes the situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, as recorded at page 342 of the report, in the course of the same answer, Mr Speaker stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is my preference for the Parliament to budget on the basis of clearly foreseen need as distinct from contingency. I think we could draw upon a general contingency fund. </PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding that, the Select Committee made a recommendation to the Senate and the Senate, in turn, made a recommendation to the Executive. The Executive adopted the recommendation that the President and the Speaker should have an advance in the same way, for general appropriation purposes, as has the Minister for Finance. Also, the Executive agreed to the Select Committee's recommendation to vest in the Presiding Officers, separately or jointly as the case may be, the power of appointment, promotion, creation, abolition and reclassification of the positions of the officers of the Parliament and, as well, the determination of rates of pay and conditions of such officers. That is indeed a most important reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I express my appreciation to-among all who have been involved in securing this legislation-one, two or perhaps three Ministers who sit in this chamber. I do so because I have a shrewd suspicion that they were able to persuade the Executive to adopt the Senate Committee's recommendations. I believe that Senator Sir John Carrick and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who is now at the table, might have had some influence in persuading the Executive to adopt those recommendations because they realised that they were practical, responsible and commonsense recommendations. I have already mentioned the very valuable work that the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney), as a representative of the Executive, does on the Senate Standing Committee on Staffing and Appropriations over which you, Mr President, preside. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is a milestone in establishing firmly the supremacy of parliament over the Executive and the bureaucracy. On behalf of the Labor movement, as one of the Opposition members of the Select Committee and now as a member of the Senate Standing Committee with my colleague, Senator Robertson, the Opposition Whip, I commend the passage of the legislation to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am pleased to speak on this matter because as you indicated in the statement you tabled yesterday it has a very interesting history. Certainly Senator McClelland has contributed to this debate in a very interesting way. He has described the manner in which all this came about and the history of interest of members of the Senate from both sides of the chamber in establishing a Standing Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, which will give us much more control over our affairs. This is but right and proper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also pay tribute to the enthusiasm of Senator McClelland and all members of the Select Committe which deliberated for such a long period in order to bring before the Senate appropriate recommendations, which certainly were examined carefully by the Government and eventually were responded to favourably. It is good to know that sitting on the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing are former members of the Senate Select Committee. I refer to Senator McClelland, Senator Mason, Senator Robertson, and myself. Already we have met on several occasions and have been able to exercise some influence on the matters that are discussed at that Committee level. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important to recall what the Select Committee advised. It said that the Standing Committee should always bear in mind the responsibility it has to exercise appropriate economic restraint. I think one recommendation that we made at the first meeting resulted in some saving. </PARA>
<PARA> We have moved a long way towards accommodating what we believe is a desirable feature-that is, allowing the Parliament to become the master of its destiny and to divorce itself from undue Executive influence. I endorse what Senator McClelland and said about the work that was done by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and Senator Sir John Carrick. They helped in a very real sense to put the case to the Government, which was appropriate at the time, and I acknowledge the work that they did on our behalf. The staff of the Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing are to be complimented. I refer to Peter Murdoch and our research officer. They have a continuing interest in this subject. It was due largely to their efforts that we were able to present what was a very acceptable report. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a bit concerned about the statements made by the Speaker to which Senator McClelland referred. Although we welcomed his interest in coming before us, certainly we did not adopt the recommendations that he suggested in this regard and certainly we did not adopt a single line appropriation. I would like to think that, in order to carry the Select Committee's proposals to the fullest extent, the House of Representatives will follow the example that we have set and establish a committee to deal with matters relating to the House of Representatives. I also hope we will be able to form a joint committee which can deal with Joint House matters and matters of mutual interest to both the chambers. </PARA>
<PARA> I was particularly pleased that this move in the Senate has attracted considerable international interest. We have already had visits from two Canadian parliamentary committees. The Canadian Senate is anxious to upgrade its committee system. I think this is significant because obviously they were attracted to the progressive suggestions that have been adopted by this Senate. It is also of note that when we presented our Select Committee report the House of Commons requested 24 extra copies. </PARA>
<PARA> Another indication of the interest that is being shown overseas in the lead that the Australian Senate has taken is the fact that recently I received an invitation to write an article on the Appropriations and Staffing Committee for publication in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association journal, The Parliamentarian. That indicates how much international interest has been shown in this matter. I assure the Government that the Committee that we have established under the chairmanship of the President will continue to exercise responsibility. We have already removed the bond of staff ceilings. The President is now able to exercise far more influence in providing us with more adequate staff to meet the growing committee needs of this Parliament. I am sure that we will all appreciate that, exercising, of course, the usual restraint and not overdoing it. I am sure it will help immensely the function of the Senate. We look forward-we have the agreement of the Government-to the transfer to the Senate and to the House of Representatives of the administration of the functions that are currently administered by Government departments. That will be another step which will prove to be of benefit to the Senate and to the committees that we operate in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that I hope the House of Representatives, perhaps with the inspired leadership of Mr Speaker, will follow the example we have set so that we can carry the full thrust of our proposals to a satisfactory conclusion. I think that is all I need to say, except to acknowledge again the support that has always been forthcoming from Senator Douglas McClelland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a couple of points with respect to the Bill. The points emanate from the report of the Senate House Committee concerning the Joint House Department. The first point relates to the review by Urwick International Pty Ltd of the Joint House Department, the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. The review advised apparently, that those three departments should be amalgamated. I note that the Senate House Committee, at pages 39 and 40 of its report, made some comments, firstly, about the report of Urwick International and, secondly, about the process of amalgamation. At paragraph 4. 25 of that report the Committee recommended that the report of Urwick International be tabled within a reasonable time. I note that this has not yet been done. I note also that the Presiding Officers have not responded to the report of the Committee and do not have to do so before the start of next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am a little concerned that the amalgamation of these departments may proceed without the report being made public. This concern is aggravated by comments made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives on 3 May 1982, when he claimed the report was confidential to the Presiding Officers and said that its circulation had been restricted to senior officers, and on 26 October this year when the Speaker implied in the House of Representatives that the amalgamation may take place but the report from Urwick International was essentially a private report and would not be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> Having noted that the Presiding Officers' repsonse is not necessarily due before February, I would like to refer to that part of the Senate House Committee's report which assessed the proposal that those three departments be amalgamated. The Committee made the point that it felt that the performance of the Joint House Department in administering its present functions certainly does not inspire in the Committee any confidence that the Department can do so. Essentially, the thrust of the report was that the report of Urwick International should be made public before any amalgamation is proceeded with. My question in respect of this point is: Can we get an assurance that the Urwick report will be made public before an amalgamation is proceeded with?</PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to raise-I will not take up too much of the time of the Senate in relation to this point-concerns the position of the Parliamentary Librarian. For the 15 months or so I have been a member of this Parliament there has been one person in the position of Acting Parliamentary Librarian. That, of course, is Mr MacLean. As yet a permanent appointment has not been made. During the consideration of Estimates Committee A on 13 September this year my colleague Senator Tate raised a question concerning the position of the Parliamentary Librarian, as did Senator Evans. In that discussion the President said:</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the announcement will be made very soon. I expected it to be made very soon. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Will the announcement be made this session. </PARA>
<PARA>The President replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>We are coming towards the end of the session and the purpose of my rising here today is to ask whether that appointment will be formalised before the end of the session. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That leave be given to senators to move motions expressing opinions or making recommendations based on the reports of Estimates Committee A; that such motions be moved when the appropriate vote is under consideration; that where more than one motion is proposed in relation to a particular vote the motions may be debated together, but in all cases a motion or motions shall be disposed of before the question is put on the vote before the Chair; and that any resolutions be reported when the Chairman makes his report to the President at the conclusion of proceedings in Committee of the Whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the questions raised by Senator Bolkus, I did make those statements which are on record, naturally, in the Estimates Committee. I can only say now that the discussions with regard to the Parliamentary Librarian are still underway between Mr Speaker and me. That is all I can say at the present moment. With regard to the Urwick report mentioned in the report of the Senate House Committee, I remind the Committee that the Senate as yet has not debated the Senate House Committee report so at this stage of the game I can pass no further comment. There will be certain responses from me, as the Presiding Officer, and in some areas probably from Mr Speaker to the Senate Committee's report. They will be then taken into consideration when the whole matter of the report is debated. Whether that will be at the end of this session or at the beginning of the session next year, I do not know. That is in the hands of the Senate. I can go no further at this stage with regard to the questions the honourable senator raised with regard to the Urwick report. I think that is a matter that will come under consideration when the Senate debates the report of the Senate House Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I give a response to two other questions that were raised during debate in Committee of the Whole on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) by Senator Martin and by Senator Haines. On 10 November, during debate in Commitee of the Whole on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) Senator Martin referred to the delay in receiving from the Government Printer copies of daily Hansard of Senate Estimates committees. I respond by saying that all copy for printing was despatched from the Hansard office to the Government Printer on the day the Estimates committees sat or on the following day. Mr Roberts, the Principal Parliamenary Reporter, states:</PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised by the Government Printer that the delay in publishing Estimates Committee Hansards was occasioned by the additional workload imposed by the Estimates Committee sittings and by a concurrent heavy workload of printing of legislation. The problem, simply stated, was one of insufficiency of manpower. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Martin attributed the problem, in part at least, to changes in the method of printing. The Government Printer has advised me that the printing method and the equipment he uses do not in any way contribute to delay. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, Mr Roberts states:</PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that on certain days the Senate adjourned to enable three Estimates Committees to sit. On such days the Printer's workload from the Senate would have trebled. </PARA>
<PARA>In connection with the workloads experienced by the Government Printer I am informed that there is available, in the office of the Principal Parliamentary Reporter, a chart which shows the daily workload and the delays referred to by Senator Martin. I invite Senator Martin and, of course, any other honourable senators who may be interested to view that chart. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the question raised by Senator Haines, on 11 November, again in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1), as Senator Haines indicated, when the Senate is sitting the movements of honourable senators in relation to their travel allowance claims are checked through the Senate transport office. In recess periods the travel of honourable senators can be occasioned by parliamentary political party meetings, parlimentary committee meetings, attendance at official government, parliamentary or vice regal functions. The travelling allowance claims are then checked through the committee secretaries and the Senate transport office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I have a very brief question which concerns the installation of a word processing system in the Department of the Senate, I understand mainly for the benefit of the committee secretariat.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the questions raised by Senator Jessop, I must say that the installation has been extremely cost effective. I also say that with the co-operation of the Minister for Finance ( Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) last year we were able to introduce some new equipment which has assisted greatly in doing committee reports. That equipment was a Honeywell DPS 6/48 system-to put it in technical terms-which was ordered in November 1981 and installed in March this year at a cost of some $96,000. Following the change in arrangements regarding the committee secretariat's occupancy of East Block, the system was installed at the Hotel Canberra as an interim arrangement where it operated from early July to the end of October 1982 , when it was relocated at East Block.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The system has been fully utilised since its introduction and has enabled 16 committee reports comprising a total of 2,143 pages to be prepared during the period July-November 1982. This number of reports could not have been handled on the two previous Digital word processing units which had handled 9 reports involving 840 pages during the first 7 months of 1982. I might add that the 16 reports prepared during July-October 1982 on the Honeywell equipment are equal to the total number, and twice the volume, of reports prepared during the whole of 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The new system has resulted in a further reduction in printing costs as the Australian Government Publishing Service is charging approximately $11 per page for Honeywell prepared reports compared with the $15 per page for reports prepared on the Digital equipment previously used in the Department and $43 per page for traditional typeset reports prepared by the Government Printer. On the basis of this new costing, the 16 reports prepared on the Honeywell equipment have involved a printing cost of approximately $24,000. If these reports had been prepared by the Government Printer using the traditional typeset method, a cost of approximately $92,000 would have been incurred. Thus the use of the Honeywell equipment has enabled a saving of approximately $68,000 on printing costs alone during the five months of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional benefits have also accrued by locating three terminals and a printer in the Administration, Records/Table and Procedure areas of the Department which has permitted the introduction of improved records and accounting systems and a general speeding up of much of the printed work of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this system proving so cost effective, consideration is at present being given to the purchase of additional equipment, at a cost of $25, 000, which it is anticipated will further reduce production time for draft committee reports and other documents. I add that there has been a pressing need for this. It is also anticipated that the purchase of the additional machinery will reduce the amount of overtime being worked by word processor operators. Of course, that means in turn another reduction in costs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief in my remarks due to the time factor. I wish to reply to the remarks made and questions asked by Senator Bolkus arising out of the initial report tabled in the Parliament by the Senate House Committee which inquired into the organisation, operation, functions and financial administration of the Joint House Department. Following the publication of that report and the comments that were made and questions asked during the hearings of Estimates Committee A, a further reference was given to the House Committee for the purpose of inquiry into matters raised following the publication of the Committee's report on the organisation, operation, functions and financial administration of the Joint House Department. In the absence of the Chairman I remind the Senate that the Committee has finished its inquiries and that the second report is in the course of being written. I expect that if everything goes according to plan, that report will be tabled in the Parliament prior to its rising for the Christmas recess. That will then enable any honourable senator who wishes to follow up the matter to engage in any debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (1) Is the Minister aware of reports from the United States which suggest that the Reagan Administration is planning to spend $18 billion on safeguarding so- called C-3 stations, allegedly vital command, control and communications facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has the Government, consistent with past practice, been consulted about this safeguarding and what it may mean for the future of the North West Cape installation, which is a C-3 station; if not, will it make representations to the United States Government about these reported plans.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. On 2 October 1981 President Reagan outlined his program to strengthen US strategic deterrent capabilities, including command, control and communications (C-3) systems. The six-year program proposed by President Reagan includes $18 billion for improving existing C-3 systems and acquiring systems that will survive a nuclear attack as part of the continued reliance of the US on a policy of nuclear deterrence.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is a continuing process of consultation about US plans for the North West Cape station and US strategic thinking concerning matters that affect Australia. These discussions encompass US plans for its strategic forces, including C-3 arrangements and other matters of relevance to the station. Details of the matters discussed are, however, confidential between the two governments.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The term C-3 takes in the terms command, control and communications. The US defence C-3 system makes use of a vast array of installations in order to link the many elements that make up the US defence system and to provide redundancy to these links so as to reduce the possibility of its failure. It would be highly speculative to relate the observation the senator has cited with any judgment of the risk to any one link in the US C-3 system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1506) Senator Hearn asked a question without notice relating to the effect of television advertisements and programs on epileptics, to which the Minister for Communications provided a reply in Hansard of 18 August 1982. Supplementary information has now become available through the Minister for Health and is provided for the information of honourable senators as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A computer-based literature survey on the potential for flashing lights triggering off epileptic attacks (of which seizures are only one form) has been done. It appears that flashing lights between 8 and 25 times a second cause the majority of light-induced epileptic attacks. Discotheques, amusement arcade games which display flashing lights to signal the end of the game, faulty fluorescent lighting, lights flickering through trees or venetian blinds, and even a hand waved in front of the face, may all trigger epilepsy. It is not surprising therefore that some special effects on television could trigger such attacks. In fact, for some people, just sitting too close to the television set (even if only the test pattern is being broadcast) may bring on an attack.</PARA>
<PARA> While the problem is recognised, it must be emphasised that epileptics form only a small percentage of the population, with those suffering light induced attacks (photolepsy) representing only a small proportion of this percentage. Of these sufferers of photolepsy, only a few will have attacks triggered by flashing light and, of these, only a very small proportion are likely to be affected by flashing light on television.</PARA>
<PARA> Industry is aware of this problem and I understand that when it was drawn to the attention of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations some two years ago, they withdrew (voluntarily) one commercial and sought the advice of Professor James McLeod of the University of Sydney. On that advice effects known to trigger attacks have been avoided since.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, I understand that the lights at discotheques flash at a frequency below which is regarded as likely to trigger photoepileptic attacks.</PARA>
<PARA> However, some people may still be affected by 'normal' television. In such cases it has been suggested that the likelihood of an attack being induced by television can be reduced by ensuring that the television is viewed from a reasonable distance (greater than 1.5 metres), in a well-lit room, preferably with a table lamp sitting on top of the television set itself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 November 1982 (Hansard, page 2034), Senator Button asked me a question as to the precise contribution of the Commonwealth Government this year to salinity control in the River Murray as compared to two years ago. I provide the following information:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1980-81 a total of $5.998m was provided to New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia under the National Water Resources Program for salinity control , monitoring and investigations, and drainage works in the Murray Valley. This year the States have been offered $6.231m in total, but I have not yet heard from them as to whether they will take up their respective offers in full.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, $81,000 was provided in 1980-81 by the Commonwealth as its share of River Murray Commission expenditures on salinity control works on the Rufus River. This year, provision has been made for $317,000 as the Commonwealth's share of the cost of these works.</PARA>
