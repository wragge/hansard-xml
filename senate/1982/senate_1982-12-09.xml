Initial studies indicated that a single Australian-owned multi-purpose vessel with limited icebreaking capability was likely to be the most cost-effective option. Recent developments have resulted in the studies being widened in scope to include multi-vessel and ship and air options. A ship design consultant was engaged to assist in the development of vessel concepts. That task is now completed. The overall studies are nearing completion and a proposal will be put to the Government later this month.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp, to reflect on the Chair by saying that there was collusion between an honourable senator sitting in this chair and another honourable senator in this place is a very serious matter. I wish to expand on this a little further. I was hoping to have a chance to talk with you this morning, Senator, about the question that was raised last night with regard to the vote and the points raised by Senator Mason. A contingency motion was not moved in this place at the time it should have been moved. Having said that, let me give an assurance to all honourable senators that Senate practice has been that precedence will always be given to a Minister if he or she is on his or her feet, over even a leader of a party. The Minister gets precedence. That was what happened last night. But that does not preclude any other honourable senator also moving a motion at the same time. Senator Mason would have had every opportunity to move his motion last night.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order, Senator! Let us handle this calmly. If Senator Mason or any other honourable senator claimed that he or she was not acknowledged from the Chair, as has happened so many times in this place, he or she could have made his or her position known by calling for the Chair to recognise him or her . Again, if Senator Mason felt that he had not been seen or had been purposely overlooked, which he was not, he could have raised a point of order. There are so many avenues whereby an honourable senator has the opportunity to move a motion in this place. Quite frankly, I think Senator Mason made a mistake by not rising and moving a contingency motion at the time. Once the normal debates under the Orders of the Day have started, it is too late for a contingency motion to be moved. Hence, no contingency motion having been moved in this place, the Senate then had to resort to a normal motion rather than to a contingency motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chipp, I have given an explanation to you. I regard what you have said as a very serious reflection upon an honourable senator in this place who was carrying out his duties in the chair, at the time, as an Acting Deputy President. I say to all honourable senators that I have the greatest respect for the honourable senator upon whom Senator Chipp has cast a serious reflection and for all other Acting Deputy Presidents who operate in the absence of either the Deputy President, Senator McClelland, or me from this chamber. I have never had any occasion to question either their integrity or their fair play in this place. I stand by that statement. I again ask you to withdraw.</PARA>

In response to your question, irrespective of whether a piece of paper was on the desk in front of the Chair, it is the responsibility of honourable senators in this place to stand if they wish to receive the call; it is not for the Chair to give the call on the basis of a piece of paper. I remind all honourable senators in this place that the Standing Orders clearly state that the Chair will give the call to honourable senators who the Chair sees have risen in their places, and not from a speakers list. The speakers list is a guide. However, because of a domestic arrangement between the Whips the practice has been that the Chair does give the call from a speakers list. But I say again that the responsibility for getting the call rested directly with Senator Mason. Senator Chipp, I have given that further explanation because we are handling this matter in a very sensible way at this time. I again ask you to withdraw unconditionally.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, refers to the remarks of the Minister for Health yesterday, in the course of which he accused me and others of scaring or frightening pensioners about the new form on the back of prescriptions. I ask the Minister whether his attention has been drawn to the activities of the Canberra-Monaro Pharmacists Association, which conducted trials in co-operation with pensioners' clubs in this district, such trials showing that the average time to complete the form was 10 minutes, that only one in four was able to complete it accurately and that the average number of errors was three and a half per form. The Association also pointed out that the form will be very hard to read when the prescriptions are filled out on the other side. Does the Minister intend to accuse the Canberra-Monaro Pharmacists Association of scare tactics and of frightening pensioners? Does he consider that the pensioners' clubs which took part in the test are also indulging in frightening the pensioners? Will he not consider the reasonable objections of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, of pharmacists in general, of pensioners' associations and of the Opposition and reconsider whether the use of this form should be continued?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem faced by the Government is that it is providing a concessional prescription rate to certain people and that the system is open to abuse and fraud. A system must be found to obtain some kind of certification to ensure that the expenditure of public money is appropriate. What has been proposed is a system which, I believe, is simple enough. That system is the subject of Senator Grimes's question. I have not had drawn to my attention comments made yesterday by the Minister whom I represent in this place; nor am I aware of the findings of the local group to which the honourable senator referred. I believe that the Minister for Health is receiving whatever input is available about any administrative difficulties involved, but I come back to the point that there is a need to find a way to ensure that the concessional prescription rate is being used by those who are properly entitled to it. I have seen the forms that are required to be filled in and have looked at some of the forms in the books. They seem to me to be simple enough. If there are real difficulties I am sure that Mr Carlton will consider them. I know it is his view that completing the forms is not onerous. I repeat that there is a question of equity as to the rights of the community as a whole, as well as the equity of making sure the concessional benefit goes to those who are entitled to it. Mr Carlton has been able to introduce the concessional benefit to help pensioners, those on low incomes and others. It is a benefit which did not previously exist. The argument now is about the administrative arrangements which will go with this. I will refer Senator Grimes's question to Mr Carlton in case he wishes or needs to take any further action.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question which arises from the answer given by the Minister. He repeated the claim that the new pharmaceutical benefits system is open to fraud; hence the necessity for this form. Is it not a fact that the Commonwealth has supplied pharmaceutical benefits at this concessional rate, or at a zero rate, for pensioners and other beneficiaries since the early 1950s and that the present system, whereby the number is put on the form and the person has to sign that form, has existed for that time? What evidence can the Minister produce that that has led to fraud on a large scale? How many patients over the years have been prosecuted for fraud under that system and why will a simple system like that not operate effectively even under the new pharmaceutical benefits system?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is well aware of the Senate Committee's report and has it under study. It considers that the report contains some very valuable material, particularly relating to the export of commodities such as aluminium, bauxite and alumina. The Government's primary aim is to ensure that the people of Australia get the full market value for the product that they sell . Only if that is so can the real benefit that comes from a natural resource with the application of human labour and skills accrue to the people in terms of better education, housing, social welfare, et cetera. The Government has as a reserve power the ability to impose export controls. The Government is aware that it is possible for certain industries to use that device-particularly industries where both the buyer and the seller may have similar antecedents or origins. This happens very much in the aluminium industry. Suffice it to say that the Government is continuing to study the Senate Committee report. The Government believes that in all these matters it must keep the right to use expert controls if necessary. The Government would be willing to use those controls if necessary. In each case we look to see whether Australia is receiving the world price. That will be the test; it is the test applied to all our minerals.

<PARA> I do not think it can be assumed from the figures given yesterday that it is any easy matter to balance the Government's expenditure and revenue in present economic circumstances. So at this stage I am not in any position to look at any hypothetical profit increases, and the company tax collected on them, and to hypothecate them for a particular capital works program. What the Government is endeavouring to do in its Budget in the present year and in the next year, which is also affected by the wage pause, is to see that there is emphasis on employment-creating projects and projects that will enable as large an employment figure as possible to be achieved. So I think that in those general terms I can say that the Government's objective is towards employment within whatever constraints it has on Budget outcome, and we will be directing our efforts towards that end.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. It refers to a statement in today's Australian in which the Chairman of Qantas Airways Ltd, Mr Jim Leslie, repeats a call that he has made on many occasions for adequate capitalisation of that company. Is the Minister aware that Qantas, because it has inadequate working capital, has to borrow the required funds and that this is currently costing $54m a year in interest payments, which denies Qantas any chance of making a net profit despite its excellent and efficient management? Why does the Government not transfer the sum asked for, which is $ 75m, so that Qantas can compete fairly in what is a very tough market?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am well aware of the financial situation of Qantas. It has been the subject of discussions between the Minister and me and our respective departments on a number of occasions. It is a well known fact that there is not a very large capital in the Qantas balance sheet. But to suggest that simply transferring from borrowed funds on which it pays interest to loans or grants from the Government would enable it to be more profitable in the present very difficult international airline market just evades the point that the profitability itself is difficult. It really matters little whether any profit that is derived is able to be called profit and paid to the Government as a dividend on the finances which are invested, or whether it is paid as interest on the loans. In terms of presentation it may be different, but what one would be looking for is profitability on funds employed, be they grants from the Government, capital invested by the Government or loans. I think the real problem with Qantas is in looking for profitability in a difficult airline market and gaining its share of a reducing world air travel market. Certainly many discussions are being undertaken with Qantas through Ministers. If there are any announcements to be made about restructuring Qantas , they will be made at the appropriate time by the Minister concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Support to the Senate Hansard of 26 October 1982 and to a motion moved by me relating to a reference to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence of the Government aircraft industry at Fishermen's Bend and the Nomad project.

Is it not a fact that 38 employees of the Government Aircraft Factories have now been given notice of dismissal as from 22 December? Were all the employees at the factory told, subsequent to the Senate resolution, that the Government had considered the Senate resolution and that no retrenchments would take place until the inquiry of the Joint Committee had been completed? Did the employees of the Government Aircraft Factories act on that assumption in the context of an industrial relations dispute? If all these matters are so, does this not seriously affect the credibility not only of this Government but also of this Parliament that the resolution of the Senate was relied upon by the employees at that factory and dismissals have since taken place?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do recall the motion that was passed by the Senate on 26 October and to which Senator Button refers. I would like just to outline the background to the discussion at that time. Last May the Government announced that the Nomad aircraft would be progressively phased out of production up to late 1984 by which date it was planned that 170 aircraft would be delivered. At the same time the Government announced that retrenchments would be involved at the Government Aircraft Factories at Fishermen's Bend but that staff levels at the Avalon plant would not be reduced. Consultation at that point proceeded between the factory management, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the staff association and union representatives. The responsible Minister personally participated in that consultation. The first notices of retrenchment were to have been issued in October but the process was suspended when the Senate motion was passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation was reconsidered subsequently in the light of the Senate resolution. Unfortunately since then, and of course as was known at the time, the market weakness and increasing costs, which were advised by the Government as major considerations in the decision last May to stop the Nomad program, still hold, and with even greater force than applied then. There are already people at the Government Aircraft Factories at Fishermen's Bend who cannot be usefully employed because of the falling work load there. Regrettably, therefore , there is no practical alternative to retrenchment. As I think was acknowledged by Senator Button, the last paragraph of the resolution passed at the time included a reference to compulsory retrenchment and, in fact, that particular wording was included, as I understand it, because of requests from the ACTU which had been fully consulted about the matter at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly the Government's decision is an economic one and clearly it is a question of meeting the market situation. There is a developing problem at GAF which has been well acknowledged during the Senate debate. There are prospects of developing alternatives by virtue of offset work which will flow from the F18 program as it gets under way, and that was freely acknowledged in this place during debate on the motion to which Senator Button referred. As to the propriety of the particular action undertaken by management, we have to recognise that we are in a time of very considerable difficulty. It has been found since the passage of that resolution that unfortunately no alternative work was available for those employees.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I mentioned in this place that the dispute in Bass Strait, which is at present a tug dispute, has caused a decline in production of Bass Strait crude of the order of 41 per cent. That in itself, of course, will cause a decline in revenue and will necessitate the purchase of overseas crude. It is a fact that, in general, the workers in the oil industry in Australia have been given very generous terms and conditions. It has been considered by other industries that they are pace setters in the upward surge of wages and conditions. The immediate situation is that Bass Strait production has fallen by some 43 per cent and three crude tankers, one product tanker and an overseas liquefied petroleum gas carrier are waiting to load at Westernport. That delay involves all the costs of demurrage and all the idleness that goes to increase costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give the honourable senator a rundown of what is happening around Australia. The Amoco Australia Ltd refinery in Brisbane is operating at a minimum throughput. The refinery will close down on Saturday if no crude is received. The Amanda Miller is waiting off Brisbane to discharge, and the position on gasoline is tight. Ampol Ltd in Brisbane is operating at a minimum throughput to conserve crude supplies. No shutdown is imminent. The Ampol Sarel is waiting off Brisbane to discharge her cargo. The product supply is adequate. The British Petroleum Co. of Australia refinery at Westernport will close down over the weekend because of a lack of ullage for gas oil. So the story goes. At the Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd refinery at Kurnell one crude distillation unit and platform have closed down and it has only four days crude remaining. The Petroleum Refineries of Australia refinery at Altona is expected to close down over the weekend due to a lack of ullage for fuel oil. At the moment Port Stanvac is unaffected. All these things have immediate and long term effects, particularly upon the image of Australia overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator cannot fail to have noticed that a number of prominent industrialists, both Australian and international, have remarked that Australia' s trade will be threatened very seriously in the short and long term because of our bad track record in industrial disputes. The particular dispute is before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission so I do not comment on it . I am advised that the Commission will hear the matter tomorrow. I comment merely upon the major points that Senator Lewis has raised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The drought, particularly as it affects the Murray- Darling system, is constantly under my attention. In fact, I receive reports virtually daily. The latest information I have received is that with the continuing dry conditions River Murray tributary inflows are continuing to recede and all storages are falling steadily as water is released to meet system requirements. The present situation with storage is that the Dartmouth Dam, which had filled to something like 70 per cent-this is the one remaining salvation for the Murray-is now down to 47 per cent of full storage capacity. Whilst that is still a significant amount, it is falling. The Hume Reservoir is down to 17 per cent. Senator Hill will know that water from the Dartmouth manages to keep this situation tolerable. Lake Victoria's storage, which is significant to South Australia, is down to 54 per cent. The Menindee Lake storage is down to 55 per cent. So the situation is serious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Overall the reserve available to the River Murray Commission is now down to 35 per cent of the total active storage compared with 81 per cent at this time last year. That is very significant. It is likely that if the drought persists storages will be reduced to 10 per cent of total capacity by the end of the current irrigation season. Should the dry conditions continue with further reduction of tributary inflows there may be implications-I am not saying there will be-for the management of the remaining available water resources to meet both the South Australian entitlement, which has first priority and will get that first priority, and planned allocations for New South Wales and Victoria for this season. These matters are constantly under the survey of myself as Minister, my officers and the Snowy Mountains people.</PARA>
<PARA> Owing to a number of factors the salinity level in the River Murray has been conspicuously lower than in previous drought conditions. This is due primarily to the availability of the flush from the Dartmouth and other conditions along the river. I would be very happy to provide the Senate and honourable senators with frequent reports on this matter. It is a serious one. We will endeavour to ensure that the supply of water downstream, in both quantity and quality, is maintained to the capacity that we can do that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bjelke-Petersen draws our attention to a very important matter which the Government has constantly in mind in regard to defence purchases. In respect of major purchases, the acquisition contract commits the contractor to support its equipment with spare parts for its expected life. However, the Commonwealth always reserves the right to order spares from any supplier or manufacturer selected by the Commonwealth. A further safeguard normally built into contracts is a commitment from the contractor to grant to the Commonwealth a royalty free non-exclusive irrevocable licence to manufacture spare parts in Australia for Commonwealth purposes, should the contractor decide to disperse its own facilities for the manufacture of spare parts. Depending on the nature of the purchase, manufacturing data packs are at times secured as part of any acquisition. But local production of spare parts, being an important aspect of self-sufficiency in the maintenance of equipment in service, is always considered when an Australian industry participation plan is made with an overseas supplier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A directory and a data base on local industry capability are maintained and the overseas supplier is encouraged to seek proposals from Australian firms. Small businesses with the relevant and appropriate quality assurance arrangements and capability to work to military specifications are included in this data base. Regional offices exist in all States and monitor the opportunities for small businesses from time to time. Alternatively, work is directed to small business through sub-contract orders from larger Australian defence oriented firms. The supplier is contractually committed to support the equipment for the life of the type. In respect of higher usage items, it is normal practice to develop special arrangements which may include manufacture in Australia to ensure supply and competitive pricing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. I preface my question by drawing the Senate's attention to an article headed 'Industrial truce for Christmas' which was front page news yesterday in the Australian newspaper. While we might pause and wonder about a situation in which no strike action makes headline news, I ask the Minister: Has his attention been drawn to the comments at a summit meeting of world industries that strikes are costing each Australian family $3,000 a year? Is the Minister aware that any company considering investing in Australian minerals must add 20 per cent to its costs to allow for losses incurred due to industrial disputes and that the strikes in the Gippsland oil and gas fields alone have cost State and Federal governments $560m in lost revenue? Does the Minister believe the cessation of strikes would do more to help the recovery of our economy and to create more employment than any other single issue, including a wage freeze?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing there is not an argument about in this chamber is that Australia is going through some very difficult times. There are things that we can do which will influence that in a positive way. There are other things which are beyond our control. The Government has tried to tackle a range of matters which affect Australia, whether by trying to encourage international trade or, most recently, this week in its meeting with the Premiers, by trying to obtain their support for a wage pause. I suppose one of the unhappiest features of unnecessary strike action is that it is so obviously avoidable. The cost to the Australian economy, to the work force and, indeed, to us all is something of which I do not have a measure. I cannot say that the American estimates referred to by the honourable senator are correct. But what is beyond doubt is that they are an unnecessary cost to this community. I would have thought that, given the consensus on the difficulty of the times, there would be some moderation of the trade union movement's attitude towards strikes. Unfortunately, this week we have seen some very poor examples of activity which is clearly costing Australia dearly. I do not wish to say a great deal. Members of the Cabinet will be meeting with the Australian Council of Trade Unions shortly. I hope those talks will be permeated with a common desire to avoid unnecessary industrial disputes which are so costly to us all.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Evans asked me a question concerning directions which I gave in September 1981 to the Aboriginal Development Commission in connection with the acquisition of interests by the newly formed Anungu Pitjantjatjaruku following the passage of the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Act in South Australia. I have been looking back through the documents although I am not sure we have them all. I can advise Senator Evans that I did not give any general direction under section 11 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act and for that reason no tabling was made in the Parliament; it was not required. At the request of the Aboriginal Development Commission I did give a direction under section 8 (g) of the Act in order to provide enabling power for the Aboriginal Development Commission to undertake a function which it wished to undertake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The background is in the context of the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill. While the land was transferred to Anungu Pitjantjatjaruku the reversionary leasehold interests continued with leaseholders although the title to the land had passed to the Pitjantjatjara people. The powers of the Aboriginal Development Commission did not allow it at that time to try to purchase either certain improvements or leases as they became vacant; nor did they allow it to make an arrangement with the leaseholders to pay them for the loss of future enjoyment. The Aboriginal Development Commission took the decision that the acquisition of Granite Downs was a high priority. That decision by the ADC was confirmed in a letter dated 10 July 1980 from Mr Charles Perkins to my predecessor as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Chaney. Therefore, in fact, it was an ADC initiative that the acquisition of Granite Downs was important and it came from the Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent consultation between the ADC and the Attorney-General's Department led that Department to suggest to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs that an extra power should be conferred on the ADC to allow payment to be made in relation to the transfer of Granite Downs. On 2 October 1981 the Aboriginal Development Commission issued a Press release announcing the conclusion of the arrangements. It indicated that the ADC was pleased to be involved and was pleased with the arrangements. I believe that answers the most substantial point in Senator Evans's question. I am sure he will let me know if there are other matters he wants answered.</PARA>

<PARA>That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>We have before us a report on the grants approved for 1983 under the Australian Research Grants Scheme. It illustrates yet again that we have in Australia a very extensive research foundation in all areas of scientific and humanitarian endeavour in our universities. When one reads the variety of the schemes that have been funded for the coming year, one is impressed by the extent of the detailed research that is being undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise a point in relation to funding which I have raised on many occasions and which I will probably be forced to raise in the future. The historical context has always been that the vast bulk of funds for basic research has come from governments. If one notes the titles set out in the report it becomes apparent that most of the research contemplated falls in that category. The funding available to universities from private industry has not been great, but an examination of current trends reveals that it is growing in a number of areas and for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> In keeping with trends in other countries, many private firms are now seeking in respect of a number of important areas to support research, undertaken by universities, that they believe will be beneficial in the short and long terms in relation to the particular products that they produce or areas of activity in which they are engaged. The major area in which such participation began some years ago, was that of agricultural science. Expenditure in that area has been rapidly overtaken by expenditures in what became the glamour industries of the day, for instance, the computer industry. Probably in recent times the growth area, in the United States in particular, in regard to the linkage between tertiary institutions and industry, has been that of biotechnology. This involves ethical questions in relation to research, an area in which we will have to tread very warily. In the United States many researchers in tertiary institutions have themselves established private companies whose sole output is certain biological techniques for use by various industries. It does not take much imagination to appreciate the problems that can very easily arise if a professor who is engaged in a particular line of research has his post-graduate students assist him in an area of activity which coincides with the work that he is doing in his private company. While one should not immediately point to a conflict of interest where one finds that happening--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not just in connection with biotechnology; it is a general problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem is general but has become much more acute in regard to biotechnology because of the ease with which a person with specialised knowledge is able to sell that knowledge rather than a product. Thus, basically, what is involved is the sale of knowledge. Previously that has not offered a sufficiently high financial return to make it worth while for many professors to undertake more than consultation, which has always been a factor in university life. However, the technical problems involved in consulting have been resolved. What I am referring to is totally different. I refer to the involvement of post- graduate students who are the responsibility of a staff member of a university and the question of what they ought to be doing with their time if they are engaged upon research which is of financial benefit to the staff member in his own private company. The United States universities, particularly the main ones, have adopted a variety of rules governing this area, and the proceedings of the various staff association meetings and conferences held within the past year that I have been able to read would suggest that it is not a problem which is easily solved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, Australia has the chance to overcome much of that problem if we move relatively rapidly and seek some intervening method of allowing private enterprise to channel its funds to universities through a public foundation of some kind or another. A private enterprise is perfectly entitled when it seeks to give funds to universities to have those funds tied to particular research outcomes. There is not much point in a particular private company funding across the board. Indeed, I think it would find it very hard to justify that to its shareholders. Therefore, most private companies would seek to look at a particular item or area of research, or a particular line that a researcher is taking and which looks fruitful in terms of that company's product or line of business. I believe that if we had a research foundation through which this money could be channelled we could then fairly easily establish arm's length arrangements with the researcher and the private funder to avoid many of the acute problems that have occurred in the United States and in other countries that have had, as a history of research funding, research funding which comes particularly from private enterprise. That, and because of its historical development, is why it has been felt so acutely in the United States. Australia has never had that historical development and I believe we could now move and the Government could now move towards looking at this issue in a fairly urgent manner so as to avoid the possible occurrence of the major ethical problems that have occurred overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe from discussions with many researchers in Australia that they would welcome a raising of this issue to a much higher profile than it currently has, and not leaving it to individual universities but possibly seeking from the Vice -Chancellors Committee the setting up of a sub-committee with the Government whereby this issue may be aired and some type of procedure set down across the board that would be of benefit to researchers because they then would be clear as to the guidelines which would be available in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The other item that I am concerned about and which I have raised with the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) by way of a question to which the Minister is seeking a response from his Department-since I asked it only last week I believe he has not been able to acquire that information-is the recurring brain drain from this country that we have had from time to time. We had it in relation to the computer industry and now we have it in relation to biotechnology. I believe that this problem needs to be looked at in a most urgent fashion because head hunters particularly from European countries are appearing at our universities looking for our best talent in those areas. We must not allow the people with these talents to go, certainly not for the sake of a small research grant which would keep them here. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In a sense, this is a routine report of the Department. I want to mention two issues which arise from the report. The first is the amount of Government grant for the support of public broadcasting stations in Australia, which is currently $138,000. In addition to that sum, the Government makes money available to public broadcasters which provide ethnic affairs programs, under the appropriate department appropriations. That is an additional amount which is almost a fee for service in respect of those programs which are provided. I want to stress the importance of the developments which have occurred in public broadcasting, with now some 60 radio stations operating in Australia. That is important, and it has been the result of a bipartisan policy. Many of those stations are operating on shoestring budgets, having great difficulties in keeping afloat. It is necessary that our public broadcasting system now be put on a rational financial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's view about this matter is that the public broadcasting system should be set up on the basis of a capital grant by government provided to a foundation, the income from which would be used to provide recurrent expenses for public broadcasting stations. That has two benefits. First, it provides secure income in addition to the other incomes from subscriptions, radiothons and so on which public broadcasters have as sources of income; it also assures the independence and integrity of the public broadcasting system, which is now an important assest which is being wasted because of inadequate recurrent funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make is revealed in the report. It is simply that there is a very serious problem of developing communication services because of lack of planning in relation to licences and the backlogs which have occurred in the planning of new radio and television licences. Earlier this year I asked a question of the then Minister, Mr Sinclair, as to what was the delay in planning for development of new services. The answer I got was that it was 10 years. I understand that since then the estimate has been reduced to seven or eight years . The delay is still ridiculous in terms of new services. The Department just does not appear to have the resources, either intellectual or financial, to cope with this problem at present. It will be a problem which emerges again very strongly when the Senate, as I anticipate, next week, passes legislation providing for supplementary licences in regional areas of Australia, many of which are likely to be given to existing regional radio and television operators . There is no future in the Senate passing that legislation if the backlog of planning is 10 years behind. If we pass that legislation next week, it will be years before any effect flows from its passage if this matter is not dealt with as quickly as possible. Otherwise, I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of Aussat Pty Ltd is important. Aussat is the company which the Government established to manage and develop the Australian domestic satellite. I remind the Senate of the timetable for the development of the satellite. In October 1979 a decision was reached to proceed with the satellite. A number of subsequent decisions have been made and the satellite system is to be operational by mid-1985. To do all this the Government formed a company in which it owns all the shares. But the Government has announced that 49 per cent will be vested in private ownership. Unhappily, the directors of the satellite company come from all major media groups and regional television interests and, happily, from the Isolated Children's Parents Association. Unhappily, I record the fact that neither the Australian Telecommunications Commission nor the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which are both projected to be major users of the satellite, are represented on the board of that body. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recently floated the idea of allowing 51 per cent private ownership of the satellite. It has done this because it is having difficulty attracting capital for the satellite project. It is not a very good investment or a very advisable investment in the first stage of the satellite development. There is a certain reluctance to invest in it, or anything else, at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> But I want to make quite clear the Opposition's view that it is important that the majority shareholding of the satellite and majority control on the board of the satellite be vested in the Government. It is simply a sound principle of common carrier telecommunications systems that they should be controlled by government. It is a sound principle in two ways. Firstly, governments or government bodies have the capacity to develop new technologies in a way which is equal as between citizens and as between business users. That is very important. If one business user has control of a communications system other business users are prejudiced as a result of that control by one competitor. It is important to ensure fairness between citizens and between businesses in the common carrier telecommunications systems. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the first reason why this question of ownership of the satellite is important-the distribution, as it were, of new technology on an equal basis. A number of other reasons, including the protection of individual privacy, are also related to that issue. The other principle which is involved is that of separating the hardware from the software, as it were. It is an important principle that private enterprise or a diverse range of sources should as far as possible be involved in developing programs, software and so on, but that the hardware should be in the hands of a neutral authority in order to ensure the best operation of the system as a whole for the benefit of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of things related to the satellite have not been sorted out by the Government. A number of issues remain important ones for decision. The first is the question of ownership, about which I have just expressed some views. The second point is that currently there is no planning for a proper relationship betwen the satellite system and the terrestrial system of communications in Australia. That is to say, in a sense, each is developing without any regard to the resources involved in the other. Australia has billions of dollars invested in a terrestrial communications system. We are now investing millions of dollars in a satellite communications system. They both provide the same service: The terrestrial system provides it across the ground, as it were; the satellite provides it by transmitting a signal from the ground to the satellite and back to earth. There is a very real need for co-ordination and for proper relationships to be established between the development of the satellite and the terrestrial system of communications which already exists. If a proper relationship is established, the people will obtain the best service from the communications system as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> A third matter for decision in relation to the satellite is the question of alternative proposals now being canvassed for commercial television networks to use the high powered transponders throughout Australia. This involves important issues, not just in terms of a difference between the Government and the Opposition, but also within various constituents of the Government parties. If there is a three network capacity to develop, for example, television programs and to transmit them across Australia, the development of local services which are desirable in the interests of particular local communities can be excluded, at least in part. For example, I was in Western Australia last week and found considerable concern about the possibility of the three major networks having the capacity to use the satellite on the high powered transponders to, as it were, blanket Western Australia with eastern State network programs. The same sort of thing can, in a sense, happen in Tasmania. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Rae" NAMEID="0P7">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The Minister for Communications (Mr N. A. Brown) has recently said that he is reconsidering that matter. Assurances were given at an earlier stage but the matter is now being reconsidered. It has implications for places like Western Australia. The Western Australian view is that that State should have a footprint from the satellite and that that would be controlled by Western Australian television interests. There is something to be said for that view. In part it might be regarded as a parochial view, but there is also an important aspect of localism in it which should be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having previously made a decision but then having been agitated by Kerry Packer , or someone else who is influential with the Liberal Party, to provide this capacity on the satellite for the three television networks, the Minister has been forced into changing that decision. All the power brokers of the communications industry are at work in relation to that matter. I take the view that the transponders should not be available to the three major networks in the way in which they desire because in my view that will exclude not only the capacity, in the long term, of regional television stations to operate and of localism to be present in Austrlian programming, but also it will exclude the capacity to develop new services in the outback of Australia which meet the peculiar requirements of people living in those areas. The technology is available to do that now by using the satellite, but it would not be a relevant technology if the transponders were made available exclusively to the big networks. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth important decision relating to the satellite is how it is to be used in the development of telephony services. Honourable senators will remember that when the satellite was first mooted it was the thing to talk about its importance to outback communities. That has declined somewhat as a priority in more recent years. I think it is very important that proper use be made of the satellite in the provision of telephone services to outback users. There is currently a fight between the Department of Communications and Telecom Australia about how that will happen and that issue has to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is the very important question of access to the satellite for small users; not the big companies but those who, whether they be educational bodies, medical services or Aboriginal communities seeking additional broadcasting services-there are a number of relatively small groups-can gain great benefit from it. I suspect that the interests of those groups have not been looked after as well as they should have. Those are the issues arising from the satellite development at this stage which provide for concern and consideration by this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I would like to make one or two comments on the annual report of Aussat Pty Ltd and endorse what Senator Button has said about the need to provide access to smaller television operators who are performing a very useful service throughout the more remote parts of Australia, away from the metropolitan areas. I believe it is a most important point. I endorse what he said and hope that the Government and the Minister for Communications (Mr N. A. Brown) will take note of it and ensure that these operators are provided with access to the satellite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also believe that the parochial matter to which Senator Button referred-that is, the provision of local news services in country areas-is most important. At the moment in South Australia, for example, at Leigh Creek and Streaky Bay the television service is provided by satellite. The people in those areas are forced to view New South Wales news services rather than their local South Australian country news service. Local news is very important to the people who are interested in their area and this point should be taken note of. I understand that ultimately, when our satellite is in position, Leigh Creek and Streaky Bay will be able to receive a different sort of news service, a combination perhaps of South Australian and Northern Territory news. I ask the Government to have regard to the comments that have been made by Senator Button, which I support. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a routine report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, but it raises two general problems to which I want to refer. Firstly, it discusses the criticisms that have been made of the Broadcasting Tribunal's report on cable television. I want to reiterate the undesirability of Australia developing cable television systems at this stage. I want to say why. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Possibly, as the honourable senator says, even radiated subscription television. There is a separate case for that. I will deal first with the cable issue. There is in certain circles great enthusiasm for cable television. It is a sort of Dr Spock thing. If any new piece of technology exists, the children should have it. One must make value judgments about whether that is desirable. My value judgement is that it is not desirable or in the interests of this country. I want to stress the reasons for that. It is very costly to install cable television in Australia. It will cost billions of dollars. It is sometimes said: 'It is private enterprise which would develop it, so who are governments to say how they should spend their money?' There are a number of other issues in respect of which governments must make value judgments .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe there has been no proper consideration of the economic consequences of the installation of cable television, particularly on existing television stations. There has been no proper consideration of the effects of the introduction of cable television on the Australian television production industry. We have by and large developed a system of television in Australia which is far from perfect and, in my view, highly inadequate. Yet by world standards it is not a bad system. Most major cities are provided with three or four major television outlets. There is some degree of choice. Certain bipartisan rules have been established. Those rules are that television stations should be viable and, being viable, should provide a range of programs, particularly in the area of Australian content. The levels of Australian content have improved. </PARA>
<PARA> If we introduce cable television into Australia under the guidelines provided by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal-in its report it referred to cable television as the era of abundance of choice-the first thing that will happen is that those channels which are additionally available as a result of cable systems will be programmed almost exclusively from the United States and they will be programmed cheaply. The effect of that is that if there are no Australian content rules for cable television the other television networks in Australia could say: 'Why do we have to produce Australian programs when the cable people can buy them so cheaply from the United States?' Cable television is a piece of classical technological mythology which is not appropriate to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine raised by way of interjection the question of radiated subscription television services. This is another issue but in a sense it runs into the same argument, perhaps in a lesser way, that if radiated subscription television services are developed in Australia with no Australian or local content requirement they will affect very much the standard of programming which we already get on the existing television channels. This is a matter about which we ought to beware. We should not look at these questions of cable television and RSTV in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government gave the Broadcasting Tribunal very narrow terms of reference. Important terms of reference which should be given are: What new broadcasting services do we want, not just in terms of the availability of new technology but also in terms of the provisions of services and social criteria which we have established in this country on an almost bipartisan basis; and, how do we deliver these services that we want, whether by way of cable television, UHF, satellite or whatever? There is no resolution of those questions. There has to be before we proceed to spend vast sums of money in this area. This Government listens too much to interest groups and writes terms of reference in response to interest groups. Then when it gets the answers it is suddenly confronted with the real decisions that have to be made in the interests of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I would make is that there is a desperate need to spell out the broad policies governing Australian broadcasting services. No goals have been established in broadcasting in this country by this Government and it is a disaster. It is a disaster to the industry and a disaster to the standards of service which are available because it affects them in a detrimental way. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those guidelines must relate to the issues I have addressed. The economic requirement of preserving in Australia an indigenous communications industry providing a high level of its own programming involves a degree of protectionism which is vastly different from the protectionism which we talk about in relation to the car manufacturing industry. I do not want to go on record about that, but let me say that I am in favour of protectionism in the broadcasting industry for the simple reason that a broadcasting system provides the major means of communication and provision of national identity in a country such as this. If a broadcasting system is cluttered with foreign programs to the exclusion of Australian programs something is lost in the social and cultural life of this community. </PARA>

Many of these matters were not adequately addressed in terms of community needs and social concern. Otherwise, I commend the report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report contains some matters which I believe ought to be noted by the Senate . It does raise some concerns about the administration of the scheme and the funding of the total scheme. It raises some concerns about shortcomings in the arrangements inherent in the scheme whereby the Ministerial Council of the Federal Minister and the six State Ministers is responsible for the provision of funds. It is a matter which was referred to by Senate Estimates Committee A in its report to this chamber a couple of months ago. I do not want to discuss those matters in detail today although I believe that they ought to be considered by the Senate in due course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans would normally speak on this report on behalf of the Opposition. In his absence, I would like to make a few comments. The report maintains the high standards set in previous reports. In particular, it gives a clear, comprehensive account of the first year of operation of the Takeovers and Securities Industry Codes. It notes that during the year the National Companies and Securities Commission was notified of 164 proposals for takeovers and that 400 foreign investment proposals were referred to it by the Foreign Investment Review Board. It is noted-I think it is a very important figure-at page 11 of the report that the Commission estimates that a total of 564,000 companies are registered under the Australian companies legislation, only 986 of which are companies listed on the various stock exchanges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is noted, interestingly I think, that the National Companies and Securities Commission has prepared or is preparing a discussion paper on the subject of financial disclosure requirements which ought to be available next month. On the question of the very large number of companies which are registered, one would have to be extremely naive to believe that there was any commercial justification for more than half a million companies in this country. Many of these companies-not all of them, by any means-as my colleague, Ralph Jacobi has frequently noted in the House of Representatives, are tools used by corporate crooks and spivs rather than legitimate institutional arrangements for the conduct of business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;About one per cent according to the latest estimates of the Commissioner of Taxation. That is a very important point made by Senator Rae. The ease with which companies can be established in Australia with a shareholder 's liability of only $2 is something which facilitates corporate crime in its various forms rather than the conduct of legitimate and productive business. When the comparable report was tabled last year, attention was drawn to the inclusion of policy statements in these annual reports-a practice which has been continued this year and which is welcomed by the Opposition. Chapter 3 of the report deals with the funding of the Commission. When referring to the procedures which have been adopted in the past, the Commission comments that the procedures:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . provide no opportunity, before the amounts of funding are settled and appropriation processes commence,</PARA>
<PARA> for the proposed level of funding to be reported to and reviewed collectively by the Ministerial Council;</PARA>
<PARA> for the Ministerial Council to have consultations with or receive submissions from the Commission; or</PARA>
<PARA> for the Commission's views to be obtained for inclusion in a disagreed bids submission. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission concludes-this was confirmed by Mr Schoer, the Executive Director of the Commission, before Senate Estimates Committee A last September-that in the year ending 30 June 1982:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commission's receipt of funds from all parties was haphazard and unpredictable-thus diminishing the Commission's opportunity of obtaining supplementary income from the rigorous management of cash on a daily basis and causing delays in payments to creditors. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Financial Review of 17 September reported on the discussion of matter at the Estimates committees. I understand that the Ministerial Council meeting in November settled on new funding arrangements. This question of funding and lack of clear accountability to any parliament highlights the problems of what is euphemistically described as co-operative federalism and could in this instance I think be more accurately described as a refusal by or a reluctance of the Federal Government to accept its responsibilities as a national government. It was a function of the decision taken at Maroochydore almost four years ago to settle on what is essentially a lowest common denominator approach to the regulation of companies, stock exchanges and the securities industry, the lowest common denominator approach being the weakest legislation for which unanimous agreement can be obtained from all the State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I certainly make no claims to being an authority on this subject, I was a member of the Senate committee which in 1975 inquired into the then National Companies and Securities Industry Bill which was before the Parliament. For many days we heard contrary opinions from learned Queen's Counsel on whether the Commonwealth had the power effectively to legislate in this area in a pre- emptive way. If lawyers were permitted to argue about that subject ad infinitum I have no doubt that they would. It seemed to me, as a layman, to be perfectly clear that the correct and responsible decision for a Commonwealth government to take was to legislate and then to let the courts finally establish whether the Commonwealth had the constitutional power to do so. The matter will never be resolved by talk fests between lawyers but only by, firstly, legislative action in this Commonwealth Parliament and, secondly, judicial action in the courts if and when that becomes necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The November meeting of the Ministerial Council is reported as having approved 'a fairly substantial increase on the initial 1982-83 funding of $3.1m'. The Commission states that its staffing 'was a source of continuing concern thoughout the year'. The report indicates that a staff ceiling has now been set at 65 for this year, but without an assurance that funds would be granted. However, it was reported, following the Ministerial Council meeting in November, that the Ministerial Council had approved a staff level of 62 for this year, which implicitly, of course, carries the obligation to provide adequate funds for that level. It appears that this relatively new commission is doing a satisfactory job, with the one caveat which I lodged before, given the constraints imposed upon it-that is, the essential lowest common denominator approach to this question-which the Commonwealth has adopted. I seek leave to continue my remarks later, Mr Acting Deputy President. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak briefly on this matter on this occasion. I hope that we will have a fuller debate on this very important report at a later date. The Administrative Review Council and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal have been important innovations in reviewing administrative decisions in this country, not only providing people with a means of appealing against those decisions but also , as a result of their actions, providing now and I hope in the future a more consistent process of administrative decision making so that people can have some sense of certainty in their dealings with the bureaucracy and with the Government in particular. I think a very good example of this is in fact what has happened in social security appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As the Review Council said, when speaking about the nature of appeals in the social security area:</PARA>
<PARA> The most striking feature of the statistics is that the workload, which is principally comprised of invalid pensions cases, come mainly from Victoria and Queensland. The explanation lies in the proportion of cases passing through the Department's appeal procedures, including SSAT--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the social security appeals tribunals-</PARA>
<PARA>review, which are fully or partly conceded by the Department. Until the last quarter of 1981, that proportion was lowest in Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania . In the last quarter of 1981, the proportion of appeals allowed in whole or in part in Victoria increased markedly. </PARA>
<PARA>This, of course, was a result of the very fact that people could go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; but it was also a result of decisions which were made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the case of invalid pensions . It was expected that when the social security appeals provision was established in the tribunals unemployment benefit cases, single parent pension cases, particularly involving disputes over what was or was not a bona fide domestic relationship, would in fact fill most of the cases which appeared before the Tribunal. In fact, invalid pension cases have done so and they have done so in a most uneven way. I make the point that this demonstrates that what the Opposition has been saying in the last couple of years and what all welfare organisations, such as the Australian Council of Social Service have been saying in the last two years, is a fact. We said that all was not well in the administration of invalid pensions in this country, that in fact there was a great unevenness in the way that people were treated-there still is. We said that there was not only an unevenness between individuals but also an unevenness in the administration and interpretation of the legislation and guidelines between States. That unevenness was such that in Victoria and Queensland, where complaints were very frequent and where the administration was very harsh, a large number of appeals appeared. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to have a national security system and if we are to have it administered from this Parliament we should have consistency throughout the country so that everyone can be treated in the same manner. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Review Council in this document have demonstrated that that just has not happened in the past, that some officers and some delegates of the Director-General of Social Services, in the States of Victoria and Queensland in particular, have been extremely harsh in their administration of this Act. At last we can get some consistency of guidelines through the decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I am sure this occurs in other areas but social security happens to be my area of interest. I hope that this indication that all is not well will be taken to heart by the Government and by the senior echelons of the bureaucracy in dealing with these sensitive areas. I hope that when we have had time to peruse this important report we will have a fuller and more sensible debate on the subject. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I welcome the appearance of the report from the Australian Film and Television School. I suppose the first thing to say about it-perhaps Senator Peter Rae will have noticed this, too-is that the report is on time. It is the 1981-82 annual report and its appearance is welcomed. I should say, too, that the Chairman of the School, Mr Ferguson, and the council ought to be congratulated on the preparation of the report. There is no doubt that the Australian Film and Television School is serving a very useful purpose in developing the talents of young Australians for work in all aspects of the film industry and the television industry in this country. Indeed, in recent years, the School has extended its activities to provide radio training. There can be no doubt either that the learning experiences offered at the School are appropriate and relevant to the industries for which they are preparing these people. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the success of graduates of the School is really quite outstanding. I draw the Senate's attention to some well known names in the film industry. If we look at the awards and recognitions granted in the last year to graduates from the interim training scheme of 1973-74 we see such outstanding names as Gillian Armstrong, Christopher Noonan, Phillip Noyce, James Ricketson, Graham Shirley, David Stocker, and later on Martha Ansara, Ned Lander, Gillian Coote, Ken Kelso and so on. So we are very pleased with the way in which students at the Australian Film and Television School have been able to develop their abilities and make outstanding contributions to the Australian film industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The general employment record of graduates of the School has been outstanding up till now but I wish to say more about that at a later stage. The other matters in the report that I want to commend the School on concern the extension of its open program. This means that not only are people living in Sydney in proximity to the Australian Film and Television School involved in the School, but also people throughout Australia interested in developing skills in this area are able to take advantage of the resources of the School through the open program. That is to be commended. I hope that that program will expand even further in forthcoming years. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly pleased also to see that the School has entered into the area of training for radio and, in particular, has been training some Aboriginal people to work in the area of radio. The success of Aboriginal radio is fairly recent but quite outstanding. I refer particularly to the success of CAMA, the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association, which now operates radio programming throughout a very large area of Central Australia in a number of Aboriginal languages and has provided training and employment opportunities in this very crucial communications area for people who previously were totally disadvantaged in the area of communications. CAMA is not the only organisation involved in Aboriginal broadcasting. Since its success there have been other developments in other parts of Australia. I am pleased to see the Australian Film and Television School now co-operating with this development in this crucial area of Aboriginal life and providing further training facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The School, since it started training full time graduates in 1975, has an outstanding record. It has expanded and adjusted its programs to take account of a wide variety of needs in this area throughout Australia. However, what is of great concern to the Opposition and, I think, to everybody working in the Australian film and television industry is the future for future students and graduates from this School. In the last few months I have raised many times in this place the crisis that the Australian film industry is facing. I have pointed out to the Senate and to the Treasurer, Mr Howard-my representations have been supported by unions covering the entertainment industries, by producers' associations, and by delegations from the film industry to Canberra- that two major factors over which the Government has control have undermined the Australian film industry to the point where it is really on the verge of collapse. Those two factors are matters concerning available tax concessions to attract private investment in films. </PARA>
<PARA> The first very damaging operation within Australia affecting our Australian industry is the use being made by certain film production companies of section 51 (1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act which enables the promotors of this scheme to offer a 375 per cent tax concession for investment in foreign films. Specifically, such investment has been in American films. That concession, offering 375 per cent on any money invested, is much more generous than the concession scheme set up by the Government ostensibly to assist the local industry. The Government's scheme operating under Section 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act offers 150 per cent tax concession. This, in itself, is quite a generous concession but obviously it is unable to compete with the 375 per cent concession being offered by the operators of schemes such as United American and Australasian Film Productions. </PARA>
<PARA> The other very objectionable aspect of the section 51 (1) scheme is that there is no requirement for the investment to be in Australian films. The Government's own scheme, the section 10BA scheme, requires that any films that are to get the benefit of this provision must be certified as Australian by the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. That process is a quite lengthy one-a quite cumbersome one in fact. Then, at the end stage of production, that certifcate of eligibility for the scheme must be endorsed by the Australian Taxation Office. Of course, the Australian Labor Party supports the fact that the concession should be limited to Australian films. It is very clear that the Australian film industry does need assistance of this kind and does need a particular attraction to get a proper amount of private investment into the local industry. We object- the whole of the Australian industry objects-to the fact that the UAA type of scheme, the section 51 (1) scheme, does not require that investment be in Australian films. Indeed, to date, it has not. We have had this syphoning off of investment money that ought to have been available to go into the Australian industry. It has gone into American films. The Australian Government has been most negligent in coming to terms with this. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter has been raised on numerous occasions throughout the year. Only yesterday my colleague in the other place, Mr Barry Jones, asked the Treasurer, Mr Howard, what his response would be to the representations concerning the use of section 51 (1) by the industry and other matters raised with him. His reply indicated that he has been paying very little attention at all to this urgent matter. His initial reply was that he had not received a report from the working party looking into the matter of tax concessions in the Australian film industry . He later came back and corrected that information. In fact, the working party had reported some time ago and Mr Howard is waiting on a comment from the Taxation Office. The fact that Mr Howard was unable to give accurate information the first time the question was asked is indicative of the low priority that the Government is giving to this crucial matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The other serious problem for the film industry concerns the operation of the Government's own scheme. In that case the difficulty is that, in order for investors to get the benefits of the taxation concession in the year in which they make the investment-obviously this is what investors want to do-the film has to be conceived, developed, made and be out producing revenue within a 12- month cycle. When the Government introduced this provision I warned that it would have a very deleterious effect on the operation of the industry, that it would cause bunching of production in one part of the year and serious unemployment in the rest of the year. This has happened and this is also one of the reasons why in this year so far only six feature films are scheduled for production compared with the 30 which were made last year. At least two of the six films currently scheduled are under threat unless Mr Howard is able to make a statement clarifying the attitude of the Government towards concessions in the film industry, ruling out section 51 (1) and in particular allowing time for the completion of films under the Government's own scheme to be extended to 24 months. If Mr Howard does not make in the next few days a statement to that effect I am afraid the graduates of the Film and Television School, of which we are all justifiably proud, will be facing a long and bleak period of unemployment because the Australian film industry will have no future. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report put down by the Administrator of Norfolk Island, Mr Trebilco, reveals some difficulties. I believe that concern ought to be expressed in the Senate about what is happening on Norfolk Island. I think there is a clear case of there being something rotten on Norfolk Island. Despite the fact that Norfolk Island is a delightful place, there appears to be a number of considerable difficulties in public administration and in the ability of the island to continue to attract tourism. Consequently, I think it is essential to make some comment in respect of this report. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to get involved in attacking the current Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh), embattled as he is as a result of the infamous decision made by this weak-kneed Government in respect of South West Tasmania. At least Mr McVeigh put forward to the Cabinet the correct decision that this Government ought to have taken in respect of South West Tasmania. However, he was overridden by the obvious troglodytes who dominate the present Fraser Administration. My criticisms would be somewhat muted by such an embattled Minister. The previous Minister, Mr Wilson, is equally embattled in respect of the administration of Aboriginal affairs. However, I believe he has some responsibilities in respect of this report even though he has moved on to a different portfolio. Aboriginal communities in Australia are demanding his resignation and expressing their lack of confidence in his administration of Aboriginal affairs. One can only say that as a result of the constant shifting of ministerial responsibilities by the Fraser Government and by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in particular there is political instability on Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation has been particularly emphasised since the 1982 elections on the island. The chief administrating officer resigned after disagreement with the Legislative Assembly. He was then dismissed by the Assembly, reinstated and then pensioned off by the current Minister, Mr McVeigh. That is a pretty unsatisfactory state of affairs. Obviously these sorts of difficulties and this sort of instability have resulted in a period of uncertainty and confusion on the island. The inhabitants-the islanders; the people who in fact in every sense of the word are the owners of the island-have petitioned for new elections. The new electoral system to be used will be, strangely enough, a modified Hare- Clarke proportional representation system under which the residents will use crosses instead of numbers with a view, I presume, of getting a better result and a better form of self-government. It is interesting that this Government, and particularly those National Party members of it who had so much critical comment to make about my proposals for a new form of proportional representation in the House of Representatives, should in fact be maintaining those very principles in respect of Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, special tax exemptions are given to residents and companies wholly owned and controlled by residents who earn income on the island. I will not go into what I said several months ago about the infamous and nefarious activities of one of the members of the Assembly, Mr Terence Brown, other than to say that he is still on the island and obviously using the weaknesses in our tax legislation to help himself to larger slices of income and evading his tax responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also worth referring to the fact that one of the judges of the Norfolk Island Supreme Court is none other than another person whom some people might regard as infamous. However, I like to steer clear of personalities. That person is Mr Justice Dunphy, who I think has been referred to in the other place as a 76-year-old judge who refuses to retire and continues to receive full pay. I am informed that most of his staff are members of his own family. It would seem to me that the presence of such a person to administer justice in the affairs of Norfolk Island would contribute towards some concern and uncertainty on the island. </PARA>
<PARA> The tourist industry has been regarded as the mainstay of the Norfolk Island economy. That industry has declined considerably. Of course, there will be dire consequences if that trend continues. Clearly there is something wrong when this is happening to an industry on such a beautiful island which has been a very popular place with tourists. The number of Australian visitors to the island in the last year has declined by 16.18 per cent. New Zealanders have stopped going there to the extent of 30 per cent. I remember seeing a large number of American visitors when I was on the island some years ago. The number of overseas tourists has decreased by 53 per cent. There has been an overall drop of 23.67 per cent in tourism. That represents something like 5,500 people. That, of course, must be a reflection of the way in which the island is perceived and the administration operates. The decline in tourism has dire consequences on the island's resources and well-being. This problem needs to be addressed. It seems to me that the Government should assist the local administration to rectify this decline. </PARA>
<PARA> The value of goods sold on the island has also declined considerably in the past year. Of course, Norfolk Island is not now a duty free port. Not only has the Australian economy declined as a result of the inept policies being pursued by the Fraser Government but also this decline is having an effect on a place that has all the delights that anyone could want. Everything about this Government smacks of decline, deficiency and ineffectiveness in respect of its responsibilities in the public and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major setbacks to the tourist industry on Norfolk Island was the requirement, which I find hard to understand, that all Australian visitors must have a passport identity. Norfolk Island is part of our Commonwealth but Australian citizens who want to travel there on holidays must go through the process of getting either a passport or some form of citizen identity. That seems to me to be somewhat ludicrous and without justification, yet that procedure has been introduced in recent times. Instead of having free movement we have now had this impediment introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor, one in which I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, will be interested, involves the conservation of Norfolk Island's flora and fauna species, which are now in a very critical state. Only 18 to 28 of the Norfolk Island green parrots are thought to remain. In recent times there has been a decline in their numbers. Also, of the two very rare types of trees that exist on the island I am told that only four specimens remain of one and 30 of another . Therefore one can only say that the whole way in which the administration of Norfolk Island operates is in a very unsatisfactory state. Responsibility for that must clearly be placed at the door of the Fraser Government. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is quite an important report. As the Senate is aware, the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the environment has a continuing responsibility to exercise oversight of all matters relating to pollution. Accordingly, the Committee has visited the Kakadu National Park area on four occasions. The first was before mining commenced, the second was after it had begun and the third was after processing had commenced. The Committee also visited the area subsequently . It is very important that this sort of surveillance should continue. It is some time since we visited the area, but I believe it will be necessary for the Committee to examine the report in depth and undoubtedly, as a result, it will wish to revisit the area to investigate aspects that have been brought out. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that on page 12 of the report, on the subject of the infringement of environmental requirements, the following statement appears:</PARA>
<PARA> Under Clause 5 of both the Ranger and Nabarlek Environmental Requirements, the companies are required to ensure that all staff and persons for whom they are responsible observe the provisions of the Environmental Requirements. The companies have agreed to report infringements immediately to the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy and forward copies of such reports to the Supervising Scientist and the Northern Land Council. 'Nil returns' are furnished for those months during which no incidents occurred. No serious infringements were reported during the year, though two incidents-the overflow of the plant runoff pond at Nabarlek, and the 'islands' incident at Ranger-gave rise to some media attention when they became known. Infringements of the Environmental Requirements that were reported by the companies, or came to the notice of the Supervising Scientist, are listed in Appendix 10. Significant infringements and deficiencies are discussed in the appropriate contexts in Chapter 4. </PARA>
<PARA>Chapter 4 refers to the two incidents mentioned, the first is the Nabarlek 'Prop ' incident-the release off-site of plant run-off water of March, 1981, which was not reported until July of that year. The second is the Ranger 'islands' incident of November 1981, in which small areas of tailings in the dam were not covered by water. Details of the incidents are also given at a later stage in the report. Mr Acting Deputy President, since you are a member of the Committee, I am sure that you share the view that the Committee should examine the report in detail. Undoubtedly it will arrange to travel to the area again to ensure that the work of the Supervising Scientist is being noted by the companies concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is late, as Senator Peter Rae points out. However, I have not risen at this stage of the presentation of papers to complain about its lateness . Rather, my intention is to note that it is the last report that will appear under the directorship of Mr Noel Flanagan, who has been the Director of the Australian War Memorial for many years. Mr Flanagan has announced his retirement , which is to take place this month. I could not let pass this opportunity to place on record the appreciation of the Australian Labor Party of the magnificent way in which Mr Flanagan has carried out his duties at the War Memorial. In the seven years for which I have been a member of the Senate I have been fortunate to have had frequent opportunities to meet Mr Flanagan at the War Memorial on occasions of significance and have always been most impressed with the developments that he has nurtured there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to mention a few of the developments that have taken place in the War Memorial in recent years, developments that I have found to be very much to the benefit of the museum and, of course, to the Australian public to whom the museum belongs. In very recent years, and most recently in the last Budget, there has been a significant increase in Federal funding for the War Memorial. That increase has been totally justified and the Director, Mr Flanagan, must be acknowledged as having been very effective and successful in gaining it at a time when, generally speaking, public expenditure is being reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the very important things that has happened in recent years at the War Memorial has been the development of proper conservation and curatorial programs . As all Australians will know, the War Memorial represents the most extensive museum in Australia. It has the most extensive holdings of paintings and historical objects that record and document our participation in major wars. However, until fairly recently, many of the holdings, many of the acquisitions of the War Memorial were in danger of rotting away in the absence of a proper conservation program. Funds to employ conservators were not available and no proper training facilities were offering for people who wished to work in the conservation and curatorial areas in Australia. All of these deficiencies have been rectified in the last few years under the directorship of Noel Flanagan. One outstanding achievement of not only Noel Flanagan, but also others who were interested, was the establishment at the Canberra College of Advanced Education of a conservators course, the first of its kind in Australia. The course offers training at the highest level for people who wish to gain qualifications to work in conservation and curatorial areas at our museums. Graduates from the course have been appearing and have been working in the War Memorial and other national and State museums. I understand that their work is of a very high standard. So it is very important that this training course has been established. Of course, the War Memorial will not be the only beneficiary. The Australian National Gallery and State galleries throughout the country will benefit also. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been in the last few years a very significant upgrading of the qualifications of staff generally. Again in the conservation and curatorial area , funding has been obtained so that people of the highest qualifications can be not only employed but also maintained in that employment. There was a period when the Memorial was able to employ but would then lose them because it could not pay them at a proper level. I believe that that situation has now been rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to commend Mr Flanagan and the War Memorial on some of the innovations that have been introduced in recent years and which have brought the community even closer to this important national resource. An example of the kind of innovatory program run within the museum was the performance of an Anzac Day memorial. It was a performing arts production entitled 'The Broken Years', which was held during the week of the Anzac Day commemorations. It involved a number of local performing arts groups, including the new professional Canberra theatre company-Theatre ACT-the Woden Valley Children's Choir, the very well known and well liked Duntroon band and other community organisations. It was an outstanding performance and I believe it was a very innovative and exciting use of the internal space of the War Memorial. It was highly acceptable to the community and I hope to see more such developments in forthcoming years. I must also commend the Memorial on the recent exhibition of paintings by Sir Arthur Streeton, who was not only one of the finest impressionist painters Australia has produced but also an official war painter for the 1914-18 War. The exhibition of his paintings from that period, painted mainly in France, was a most impressive and outstanding one. Again, its scope reflects a new approach to the staging of exhibitions within the Australian War Memorial. For these and many other reasons we can all feel very pleased with developments in the Australian War Memorial in recent years. Of course, the effectiveness of those developments is due very largely to the outgoing Director, Mr Noel Flanagan, to whom, as I have said on behalf of the entire Opposition, I offer my congratulations for a job very well done and my best wishes to him and his family for his retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak briefly to the report of the Australian War Memorial because it is an institution of unique significance to Australian life, as the preamble to the report says. It is certainly the most successful institution of its type, be it art gallery or other public facility of this nature, in the whole of Australia. Its success is demonstrated by the fact that it attracts over 750,000 visitors a year and it is estimated that, of those, 100,000 are from overseas. I have spoken to some of those visitors who have gone to the War Memorial over the years and they are all fulsome in their praise of it. Well they might be, because it is an outstanding collection and there is nothing quite like it in any other country. Of course, it is a great social asset to Australia, with the re-awakening of Australian nationalism in the last decade and a sense of achievement for what we have done. The War Memorial plays a very important part in our social history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The big difficulty that the Memorial has suffered over the years is the perpetual one of money. When it came to handing out money the War Memorial certainly was not one of the most favoured institutions in the Commonwealth. As Senator Ryan has said, the twin problems that face it are those of documentation of a vast collection and the curatorial ones of preservation, which are immense. It is important that these tasks be coped with because the collection is irreplaceable. We cannot simply go to the market and buy replacements for what we have. It is interesting that the collection is valued at at least $100m. I do not know how something like that for which a market does not exist is valued but nevertheless it is a great investment that the Australian community has. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to support the Government in regard to what it has given the Memorial in the last 12 months. It has undertaken to support the Memorial to the tune of $11m in total. The appropriation for this year has gone to $5.5m from an amount of $2.5m last year, which is a move in the right direction. I am happy that the Government has seen its way clear to do this. Putting it in perspective , though, although $5.5m is nearly twice the amount that was given to the Memorial the year before, it is nothing when we look at, for example, the amount allocated the Australian National Gallery which was opened by the Queen a month or two ago. The accounts for the National Gallery show that in the 10 years between 1971 and 1981 the Gallery for acquisitions alone received in excess of $ 32m. The appropriation for the War Memorial was nowhere near that; it would not have been more than 60 per cent of that amount. The whole of the War Memorial has to be run and acquisitions have to be made out of a budget which pales into insignificance by comparison to that of the National Gallery. I am not being critical of the art gallery; I enjoy art and I have been in most of the major galleries of the world many times, with the exception of the Prado in Madrid. I do think that because of the uniqueness of the Australian War Memorial it deserves a higher level of funding than it has enjoyed up till now. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I too would like to pay tribute to the work of Mr Noel Flanagan who has been an outstanding Director. He has also been at a human level a most helpful guide and mentor to me on the visits I have had and I wish him well in his retirement and thank him sincerely for what he has done for the Australian nation in the years he has been Director of the Australian War Memorial. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -This is the first report of the Australian War Memorial submitted under the Australian War Memorial Act which came into force in 1980. It has been pointed out that the report is late but that is probably because of the new procedures necessary. I want to raise the matter of the development not only of our major war memorial situated in Canberra but also other war memorials throughout Australia. Sufficient time has passed since the Vietnam war to raise the question of whether or not Australia ought to be looking, as the United States of America has done, to erect a specific memorial to the Vietnam war. It is doubtless understood by all honourable senators that that war probably caused the greatest rift in the population at large of any war fought by this nation. It was one which I opposed and which I think a lot of other honourable senators would have opposed, although many others supported it. Regardless of that, the people who fought in that war at the behest of the country and of the government of the time carried out their duties in a manner which did great credit to our armed forces, and the country as a whole has an obligation to each succeeding group of combatants in whatever wars the country is called upon to fight to remember the sacrifices that people make from time to time for the continuance of this country and for the continuance of this chamber . I believe it would now be possible to obtain from the community a consensus that we ought to look at something beyond the rather small memorial that exists in Canberra. Probably nobody in the Senate realises that there is a memorial to the Vietnam war. It is not the significant type of memorial that we should have to commemorate that engagement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I speak somewhat diffidently on this because I do know that it is a matter which still causes much concern within the community. Many people believe that memorials may be seen as glorification of war. I have never seen them that way and I hope that the majority of the community does not see them as a glorification of war, but rather as an acknowledgment of the sacrifices that have been undertaken on behalf of everybody in the country. The form that such a memorial might take ought probably best be left to developing discussions. I do not believe that it is always appropriate to raise a large monolith or building of whatever kind as a memorial. Indeed, in relation to this particular war, that may be inappropriate That matter might best be left to a developing discussion in the community, if this idea is one that is able to be entertained at this time. </PARA>

<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>INTERIM REPORT ON THE 28TH CPA CONFERENCE, THE BAHAMAS, OCTOBER 1982</PARA>
<PARA> The Conference was well attended by some 285 delegates, secretaries and observers. It was well organised and administered by the Bahamas Branch of the CPA, supported by the Headquarters Secrtariat. The Conference proper was preceded by a Conference of the Small Nations of the Commonwealth where the main issues discussed were their economic viability, their defence and security and their adaptation of the Westminster parliamentary system in conformity with their traditional customs and diverse cultures. This gave the Commonwealth of Australia Branch delegation the opportunity to canvass certain Branch proposals concerning the organisation and administration of the Association and its future activities with the Australian State delegation, the Australasian and Pacific Regional delegations and with other influential member Branches such as the United Kingdom and the Federations of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth delegation noted a certain sameness in the Conference agenda over the last few years which seemed to restrict the scope of debate on important international issues of common concern upon which an organisation of 125 parliaments, cast mainly in the democratic mould and representing about a quarter of the world's population, could have made a greater impact had the agenda been less inhibiting. The delegation felt that there was a need to broaden the scope of the Conference agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> Branch delegates took part in the debates on all agenda items. There was some lively, informative, useful and controversial discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> In the session on ''World Peace and Development'' delegates argued the merits of unilateral disarmament as opposed to the maintenance of deterrent forces, world government in preference to regional arrangements and free trade against economic equalisation. Some said that disarmament would not only reduce tensions but it would also provide the global economy with the financial resources to close the gap between the rich and the poor. Others insisted that military strength was the only deterrent to aggression. Others took a middle road and called for economic realignment consistent with a defensive military posture and in this case they argued a moderating role for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussion on ''The Security and Future of the Small Countries of the Commonwealth'' there emerged a concept of a Commonwealth defence force noting that while the Law of the Sea Convention provided smaller states with new resources to develop they lack the military capacity to enforce sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussion of ''Approaches to Unemployment'' there was widespread support for policies designed to stimulate job creation but there was such a divergent range of job creation policies ranging from a free market economy to subsidised labour intensive programmes to the removal of protectionist trade barriers which appeared to spread the economic problems of the developed world to the under- developed world, that no real consensus emerged. There was, however, a proposal for the establishment of a Commonwealth Development Bank to give the less developed states an alternative source of development aid to the high interest loans of the current money market. </PARA>
<PARA> In consideration of the ''Freedom of the Individual and Human Rights'' there was widespread support for the CPA to take a more active role in campaigning against the violations of human rights and a call for the CPA to advocate a Commonwealth Human Rights Charter. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussion on ''Alternative Energy Resources'' took a well trodden path but it was generally agreed that there was a need for an information exchange to avoid duplication of effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Opinion was divided on the means of controlling the population explosion. Some argued that political leaders and parliaments and governments should not settle for an advisory role but had to take an active lead by supporting birth control programmes with legislation. There was general support for a suggestion that the CPA should organise a conference of women to discuss population control. There was also the suggestion that men should not confuse procreation with masculinity , but there seemed to be a general view that in the educational process on birth control women would have more success than men. </PARA>
<PARA> On ''Parliament and the Scrutiny of Public Finance'' there was a call for more aggressive scrutiny of public spending and an extension of it into previously unmonitored areas to halt the trend to government taxation without adequate parliamentary review. There were pointers towards the need to assess government borrowing practices and spending by government-owned and subsidised industries. There was a call for Public Accounts and Expenditure committees to split their review into two stages, a political examination of policies and ministerial performance, and a non-political review of managerial performance by departmental heads. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an obvious split between the Westminster style parliaments and the one party parliaments on ''The Role of an Opposition in a Parliamentary System'' . The African exponent of the one party state insisted that the electorate was given the widest choice possible when as many as twenty candidates were endorsed for each seat and that the backbenchers in the parliament were a real and effective Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussion on 'Parliament and the Executive' there was a view that in many cases the Executive had taken control of the legislative arm of government although some members also lamented the fact that a well entrenched bureaucracy had actually wrested government from the elected Executive. There was a general view that an expanded and strengthened parliamentary committee system would be an effective mechanism for improving parliamentary scrutiny of the Executive but it was also conceded that if parliaments did not reassert their authority they would become irrelevant and the Executive would cease to be responsible to the public will. </PARA>
<PARA> That is perhaps an over-concise reporting of the Conference proceedings but that is not the main reason for this Interim Report. The Branch delegation was charged by the Annual General Meeting of the Commonwealth of Australia Branch to raise certain matters of policy, administration (including financial practices and estimates,), organisation, activity, and representation on the governing organs of the Association in the General Assembly and were briefed accordingly. The delegation did not succeed in resolving all these matters to the satisfaction of the Branch but this Interim Report is intended to show how far along the road they got. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth of Australia Branch proposals called for a substantive debate on CPA resolutions as consensus emerged from the Conference, an explanation of the criteria determining representation at Plenary Conferences, the circulation of the draft Executive Committee report together with forward estimates well in advance of the Conference and two meetings of the General Assembly at each Plenary Conference. They also recommended procedures for elections of officers and particularly the office of Chairman of the Executive Committee and they put forward a case for increased representation on the Executive Committee by the United Kingdom and the Federal Branches of the Commonwealth, and finally, observing the escalating costs of Plenary Conferences, they canvassed the idea of hosting these conferences on a regional basis believing that such an arrangement would make for orderly planning and would broaden the scope of parliamentary exchange. The proposals were discussed at ad hoc meetings with the States' delegates and with the Australasian and Pacific Region's delegates, with the United Kingdom Branch and with the other Federal Branches of the Association . New Zealand excepted, the proposals received the unanimous support of the Australasian and Pacific Regional Branches with the proviso that any new arrangement did not impinge upon their autonomy or disadvantage their prospects of representation on the Executive Committee. They were fully supported by Nigeria, Kenya and Tanzania and received qualified support from the United Kingdom, India and Malaysia. On the basis of this degree of support the delegation circulated a paper outlining the proposals to all branches represented at the Conference. It is believed that this paper prompted the Executive Committee to recommend the setting up of a Study Group to consider the CPA and the future. The delegation supported the Executive Committee's recommendation for a Study Group but moved an amendment in specific terms indicating its composition, its terms of reference and its working timetable. This amendment was accepted and a Study Group is to be set up within ninety days , that is by 30 January, it will accept Branch submissions up to 30 April, it will meet in June 1983 and its recommendations are to be circulated to all Branches ninety days before the next meeting of the General Assembly. Its terms of reference encompass all the Commonwealth of Australia Branch proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I believe that Australia was well represented by those delegates who attended this conference. Further, the work carried on by the delegation secretary, Mr Blake, and Mr Ferguson of the CPA was invaluable and they deserve our thanks. </PARA>

<PARA>AUSTRALIA AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS</PARA>
<PARA>The first ever Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the European Parliamentary Institutions has just returned and it is our wish to make a brief statement by way of summary of the Report which will be presented during the Autumn Session of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Delegation consisted of Senator Peter Rae (Leader), Senator A. J. Mulvihill , the Honourable W. L Morrison, MP. and Mr J. R. Porter, MP. </PARA>
<PARA> For the past thirty years Europe has, following the devastation of two world wars, become intent upon creating a new, united group of nations. This was not only the product of that devastation, but also a reaction to the very clearly perceived threat of being the front-line in East-West relations-of having the Iron Curtain for a border. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps understandably, in the light of history, and of the past thirty years of looking at a front line in military and strategic terms, they have tended to be inward-looking, and little concerned about global perspectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The population encompassed by the twenty-one nations of the Council of Europe is 380 million people. The European Community comprises ten nations (perhaps soon to be twelve) with a population of 270 million. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation involves more than 619 million people in the 16 nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Delegation believes that although Australia supported the creation of the new European Community, there was at the same time a realisation and acceptance that the creation of that Community would carry with it the need for Australia to find new economic, trade, and defence relationships. We believe that the phase of Australia finding new economic, trade, and defence relationships was a transient situation. That re-direction has been achieved. The development of the European Community involved Australia in the virtual total loss of our traditional markets for our agricultural products and in the establishment of new relationships in the over-all balance of power. Australia was forced to, and did, find a new relationship in that part of the world in which we as a continent are geographically placed. The consequence has been a total change in Australia's attitude to a wide variety of matters, including its immigration policy and the structure of its population, as well as the other matters referred to above. In all, it is our view that Australia has benefited greatly from that necessity. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, for nearly twenty years Europe has concentrated on its own development as a Community of Nations, and has tended to be inward-looking while Australia has, of necessity, tended to concentrate its efforts elsewhere. However, in this context, Australia has, we believe, completed the phase, and may now look to applying some reasonable degree of effort to the re-building of a mutual understanding with Continental Europe and with the United Kingdom. Of course, we are not suggesting that this should be in any way to the detriment of the further building of our economic, trade and cultural relationships with the Pacific Community and our other newly developed trading partners, such as the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> The Delegation believes that without in any way derogating from the development of our important relationships within our region, the time has come to build a new relationship with Europe. We do not pretend that Europe finds Australia to be a nation of great concern to them. Australia tends to be regarded as ''the lucky country'', with vast resources, a stable political situation, a reliable democracy, and a country about which they do not have to concern themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The mere fact that many of their policies have had extremely destructive effects on Australia has not so much been ignored as unrecognised, particularly in the Parliamentary arena. </PARA>
<PARA> The creation of the elected European Parliament, which is in its third year of full operation has, we believe, changed the potential quite dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> For many years, the European Community was operated by an Executive without the checks and balances of an effective parliamentary institution. We believe that the European Parliament has made major strides in its short period of evolution and development, and that it will play a major part in the future of Europe and its relationship with the larger world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council of Europe, that is the twenty-one pluralist parliamentary democracies of Europe, continues to play a major role in a significant number of areas, including human rights, the development of international accord and co- operation through the development of conventions, the exchange of knowledge and technology through its expert committees. To all of these, Australian participation has now been invited. </PARA>
<PARA> The North Atlantic Parliamentary Assembly, comprising representatives drawn from the sixteen member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, appears now to have accepted that it would be desirable to adopt a global perspective. Again Australia has been invited to participate. Bearing in mind that we are inextricably tied to the ANZUS Treaty involving NATO's most dominant member, the United States, and through Five-Power and other longstanding and traditional relationships with the United Kingdom, we have a very real interest in encouraging a better appreciation of NATO's global perspectives, particularly so far as the Indian and Pacific Oceans are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Delegation had the opportunity for discussion, both in Brussels and in Strasbourg, with the European Commission, the Executive of the European Communities. Those discussions were quite extensive, and we believe, most interesting, revealing and rewarding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Delegation also enjoyed the opportunity for discussions at the OECD headquarters in Paris, as well as participating in the annual OECD Debate, sponsored by the Council of Europe, and to which the non-European members of the OECD are invited. </PARA>
<PARA> The Delegation spent altogether two months in consultation with European Parliamentary, Executive and other institutions. We were able to make an assessment of the state of knowledge, interest, and appreciation of Europe/ Australia relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> We concluded that we should adopt as a start point a statement made during one of the very early briefing sessions-''Australia's real problem is that we don't impinge very much on European consciousness''. We believe that this is not insignificantly Australia's fault. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the fact that we have had the appointment of a Minister for Special Trade Representations for a period of several years, and not inconsiderable diplomatic effort, the tendency has been for government-to- government discussions, position taking, and relatively little by way of mutual understanding on the broader basis-certainly little parliamentary or public understanding of the bigger issues of trade, defence, resources and the like. To change this will require a continuation of persistent effort through all channels. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a significant, if as yet undeveloped, interest in Europe in the development of better understanding and this can be particularly enhanced by the use of the opportunities provided through the Parliamentary Institutions to which we have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> Each has offered to have a special seminar, colloquy, or other form of exchange and development on information and ideas related to Europe/Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The European Parliament has established a Delegation (committee) for Australia- New Zealand relations while both the Council of Europe and the North Atlantic Parliamentary Assembly have offered to set aside a day for the discussion of an agreed agenda relating to our mutual interests. </PARA>
<PARA> We are firmly of the view that Australia's interests would be best served by taking advantage of the awakening interest in Europe in the affairs of the Pacific region. We noted that one delightful European leader said, ''The Mediterranean is the sea of the past-the Atlantic is the sea of the present-the Pacific is the sea of the future''. We, Australia, are in a particularly fortunate position to play a role as the go-between for both Europe and the Pacific. We must not miss that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> We are firmly of the view that we should follow up the ground which has been laid by earlier delegations to the Council of Europe, and take advantage of what has been developed during the course of this Delegation to the European Parliamentary Institutions. We can and should develope a firm line of inter- parliamentary communication with each of these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Delegation was most appreciative of the attitude and encouragement offered by the President and Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, as well as the various Committee Chairmen and others in leading positions in that Parliamentary Institution. The President, senior staff, and many others of the European Parliament, including particularly the Chairman of the Delegation on Australia/ New Zealand relations, were positive in their attitudes to Australian participation. We also found a clear and firm attitude from the newly-elected President of the North Atlantic Parliamentary Assembly, the Senior Vice- President, and the Secretary-General and others who encouraged future Australian participation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the opportunity exists for Australia to overcome the disadvantages referred to earlier in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> From a cost-benefit point of view, we believe that whilst we must recognise the cost in the broader sense, both to individual members and the Parliamentary Budget and in personal terms to the individual members in being away from Australia for a relatively lengthy period, the potential benefits certainly outweigh the costs. </PARA>
<PARA> We have established the details of an agreement for the necessary mechanisms for continuous contact and communication between the Australian Parliament and these extremely important parliamentary institutions. However, we believe that for the mechanisms to be effective on an on-going, throughout-the-year basis, then these mechanisms must be supported by Australian Parliamentary attendance and participation during the October/November period of the European Parliamentary Institutions. We would see the necessity for attendance at the Council of Europe, the European Parliament, and the North Atlantic Parliamentary Assembly Sessions during those months as a tremendous opportunity for Australia as well as the establishment of an Australian Parliamentary presence in Europe. To each of these Parliamentary Sessions we are invited to participate on a very full basis. </PARA>
<PARA> We should accept these invitations. </PARA>
<PARA> A delegation of four, being comprised of equal numbers from each of the Australian Houses, and of Governments and Opposition Members is, we believe, the ideal. This enables individual participation in the various committees which are such a major feature of the operation of these Parliamentary Institutions. A smaller delegation means that a large part of the opportunity is wasted. The bipartisan composition of the delegation ensures that Australians can attend the meetings of the political groups in each of these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> We found this a particularly valuable aspect of the Delegation's work and would wish to express our appreciation of the readiness of those Parliamentary groups to accept our presence and participation. This aspect is of particular importance, as no non-Parliamentary observer could ever hope to be accepted into that form of participation. As in any other Parliament, so much of what really matters happens in the Party (or political group) or meetings in Parliamentary Committee. The plenary tends to be the public reaction to, and explanation of, the product of that process. To both we were given access. </PARA>
<PARA> We wish to stress this point most firmly, and to emphasise our appreciation of the trust and warmth of the involvement which was developed. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Delegation were, as appropriate, invited to, and attended, meetings of the Conservative (European Democrat) and Socialist groups, the Christian Democrats, and other groupings of like-minded parties. </PARA>
<PARA> One further point of importance to stress is that of the proposed Strasbourg Conference. In early October 1983, the Council of Europe propose to sponsor a Conference of the pluralist Parliamentary democracies of Europe and the OECD nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been invited to participate and has informed the Council of Europe that, as a result of an election held earlier this year, the Hon. W. L. Morrison and Mr J. R. Porter will be the parliamentary liaison officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has there been an indication already given by the Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives that Australia will participate, there is a firm belief on the part of the Delegation resulting from the further discussions held in Strasbourg, that the proposed Conference will provide an important opportunity for the development of democracy in the world. We applaud the Speaker's decision. It is both in our particular interest, also our duty to play a part in the extension of the concept and practices involved in providing that system of human freedom. </PARA>
<PARA> As a special conference in which Australia has such a clear interest, we believe that Australia should show its support, and should facilitate its interests by sending a delegation of six to that Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Strasbourg Conference will follow immediately after the OECD Debate sponsored by the Council of Europe, we recommend that the Delegation of six should be comprised of the four members of the Australian Delegation to the European Parliamentary Institutions, together with two extra members who would attend the OECD Debate and the Strasbourg Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> We note again that the Australian Delegation to the European Parliamentary Institutions would include the two liaison officers referred to above, and two other elected delegates. </PARA>
<PARA> We recommend that for ongoing purposes, there should be formed within the Australian Parliament an Australia/Europe Parliamentary Group, similar to the Australia/Japan, Australia/Korea, Australia/Indonesia, Parliamentary Groups, with a function for ongoing liaison with the European Parliamentary Institutions . We recommend that the Delegation should be drawn from Members of that Group with two members of the Group being elected for the duration of an Australian Parliament to fulfil the role of permanent liaison officers. They should be members of each delegation for that period. </PARA>
<PARA> We recommend that for the first period, the two permanent liaison officers should be from one each of the Government and Opposition members from the House of Representatives, and for the next period, a Government and Opposition Senator . </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that an effective Australian delegation must contain a number of members (we suggest two out of four) who know both the procedure and the individual people, involved in the European Parliamentary Institutions. No delegation should fail to comprise two permanent liaison members elected for the duration of an Australian Parliament, as well as two others who may or may not have any prior association with the purpose of the delegation. Obviously, the greater the degree of association and experience, then the greater the potential effectiveness of the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, this Delegation is happy to report that the European Parliamentary Institutions will be reviewing the Common Agricultural Policy, and its effects in the creation of subsidised surpluses together with and the question of unfair trading practices by the sale (or dumping) of those surpluses on world markets. It is through these methods that changes in European attitudes and policies will be achieved. It may well be that there will also need to be some changes in Australia's attitudes and policies. Whichever, a better understanding on a very much broader basis and to our mutual advantage will, we believe, be achievable. Numerous other matters were discussed and agreement reached, including a review of Europe's attitude to the Law of the Sea Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Delegation also wishes to record its appreciation of the strong support and encouragement which it received from the Australian Ambassadors to Brussels, Paris, and the OECD, as well as the High Commissioner in London, and their staff . All wholeheartedly supported the work of the Delegation in developing an inter -Parliamentary liaison and a useful working relationship. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the reports. </PARA>
<PARA>The 200th report is the annual report for 1981-82 of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. I seek leave to have a statement concerning that report incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The 200th report is the annual report for 1981-82 of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. It contains a review of the inquiries conducted by the Committee during the year and issues arising from our investigations and other matters which the Committee regards as significant in its development. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout 1981-82 the Committee has continued to maintain an extensive program of inquiries and research. It tabled eleven reports on significant public sector management issues such as the administration of petroleum royalties and excise, the operation of the government aircraft factories, the effectiveness of the coal export duty and the conservation and curatorial functions of the Australian War Memorial. Additionally, it has tabled discussion papers on the collection and dissemination of statistics and the form and standard of financial statements for Commonwealth undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also hosted its third parliamentary seminar on management and parliamentary accountability of the public sector during the year. This seminar gave senior public servants and executives from the private sector the opportunity to participate in a range of workshops, the results of which were of great value to the Committee in its inquiry into the selection and development of senior managers in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> This year is the thirtieth anniversary of the re-establishment of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and I believe that it is appropriate that its two hundredth report should be tabled at this time. The success of the Committee has been built on the solid foundation laid over the past three decades by successive chairmen, members of the Committee and staff as well as by its official observers and advisers, all of whom have contributed to the building of an institution which is regarded within the Commonwealth as being a significant mechanism for effective parliamentary review. </PARA>
<PARA> With the growing complexities of government, and the intractable problems facing all parliaments in the management of the nation's affairs, it is now becoming a matter of vital concern that parliamentarians should be given the opportunity to be kept informed of the mechanisms by which the efficiency and effectiveness in the development and conduct of government programs can be assured, the public service, which is by nature conservative, needs to be tested by the parliament to ensure that a more efficient and effective system of administration is developed and maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee wishes to record its appreciation to its secretary, its advisors, seconded and permanent staff for their excellent work throughout the year. In addition the Committee wishes to thank officers from the Department of Finance, the Public Service Board and the Auditor-General's Office who have continued to provide high quality professional advice and assistance as observers for all our inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also appreciative of the work done by the Principal Parliamentary Reporter and his staff for their valuable assistance and other officers of the parliamentary departments who have supported the Committee in its activities. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to honourable senators. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 203rd report is a progress report. It has been prepared by the Committee at the request of the Minister for Health (Mr Calton)-the request was made last September-to enable him to examine various options on the basis of the Committee's inquiry into the effectiveness of existing legislation and procedures for dealing with abuse of the medical benefits system. This report contains 45 recommendations, even though it is only a progress report. The recommendations are directed at streamlining and strengthening both administrative procedures and existing legislation. In the course of the inquiry to date, the Committee has received considerable evidence on the abuse by some doctors of the health insurance arrangements. To put it mildly, we have been shocked by the lengths to which some members of this highly respected profession have gone to find ways of profiting from the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be recalled that the inquiry was undertaken as a result of the estimate by the Department of Health that at least $100m per annum is being lost in medical fraud and overservicing. While there remains some doubt about the precise figure, on the basis of the evidence before the Committee we believe that the annual amount is certainly no less than $100m and could well be much higher. I must emphasise at this point that the Committee believes that a substantial majority of doctors are not engaged in either fraud or conscious overservicing; nevertheless, there are members of the medical profession who are defrauding the Australian community or consciously providing excessive services on a large scale as a means of supplementing their incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The medical profession occupies a position of great significance in our society , not only with respect to maintaining the health of the community but also because its members occupy the unique position of having access on the basis of trust to more than $1.5 billion annually, which money comes from taxpayers and health fund contributors. Regrettably, some members have abused that trust, and thus have compromised the high standing of their profession and their professional colleagues. Whatever steps the Government decides to take to strengthen the monitoring and enforcement procedures, it remains the responsibility of the medical profession to help to re-establish the high standards of conduct which the community expects of all its members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has found the overall administrative response to fraud and overservicing most unsatisfactory. Despite the estimate of the Department of Health that more than 2,000 doctors may be engaging in large scale fraud or overservicing, very few have been penalised. In almost seven years between July 1975 and March this year, there were only 48 successful prosecutions for medical fraud, and only 61 doctors suspected of overservicing were brought before medical services committees of inquiry. There are a number of factors contributing to this situation, including shortcomings in existing legislation, and long delays in the handling of cases by the Australian Federal Police and the Crown Solicitor's offices. However, a great deal of the responsibility must rest with the Department of Health. The Committee has found its response to abuse of the medical benefits system grossly inadequate. Despite ample evidence since at least 1975 that fraud and overservicing were occurring on a large scale , too little was done and always too late to stem the loss effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> This report mentions a number of areas in which the Department's performance was unsatisfactory, including its failure to issue adequate guidelines to its State offices, with the result that they have adopted quite differing approaches to a common problem and have at times failed to investigate doctors even when there was strong evidence of fraud. The recommendations in the progress report-I reiterate that it is a progress report-focus on changes to the administrative procedures for the handling of cases of suspected fraud or overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA> We propose as a short term measure, because of the backlog in medical fraud cases requiring investigation and prosecution, the immediate establishment of a special national task force of experienced health, police and legal personnel to reduce the number of outstanding cases. Among the proposed permanent changes that we have recommended are the following: Changes to bulk billing arrangements to reduce the scope for fraud; improvements in the Department of Health computerised detection system and extra staff for that area; the establishment of integrated investigation sections within the Department of Health, to cover both fraud and serious overservicing cases; appointment of medical investigators within those sections to handle apparent cases of serious overservicing; abolition of the present medical services committee of inquiry, and establishment of medical benefits tribunals, which would include medical specialists; Commonwealth-State agreement on uniform medical registration legislation and automatic deregistration of doctors convicted of fraud; and automatic disqualification for medical benefits purposes where doctors are found to have provided excessive services on a large scale. </PARA>
<PARA> I recommend that all members of the Senate read the report in detail to find the further recommendations and the other areas of deficiency which the Committee has discovered. Because the subject is both controversial and complex, this inquiry has been a major undertaking by the Committee. We have so far held 48 hearings and meetings on the inquiry, and taken over 5,000 pages of transcript, in addition to a significant number of written submissions. The effort to produce this progress report in a short time has placed great pressure on the members of the Committee and on our support personnel. I wish to place on record my appreciation to the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), and to my fellow members, Senators Lajovic and Watson, and the honourable members for Barton (Mr Bradfield), Holt (Mr Duffy), Canberra (Mrs Kelly), Tangney (Mr Shack), Northern Territory (Mr Tambling) and Burke (Dr Theophanous). I also wish to express my appreciation to members of the task force which included officers of the Committee's secretariat and a range of expert advisers. I add to this statement by saying that the number of hours of dedicated effort which the officers put into this progress report has enabled it to be tabled today. </PARA>
<PARA> The report raises a number of fundamental issues of public administration and policy which extend well beyond the specific area of medical fraud and overservicing. These include ministerial responsibility and the briefing provided to successive Ministers by the Department of Health, the general relationship between central and State offices of departments and the adequacy of the legal system to deal with white collar crime. We therefore hope that the report will have an audience beyond the Parliament and others concerned with health insurance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I emphasise that we have not finished the inquiry. There remain a number of major aspects of medical fraud and overservicing which are not covered in this progress report. I shall read the list of those because it is important to know the extent to which we intend to investigate the problem. The Committee will be examining further a number of areas for its final report on this inquiry . Major areas include patient fraud; fraud associated with hospitals; fraud and overservicing associated with prescription of pharmaceuticals; fraud and overservicing associated with pathology; unnecessary surgery; possible strengthening of the legislation with respect to medical fraud; possible measures to reduce the growth in the number of doctors; peer review mechanisms and the development of guidelines for the use of specific medical procedures; modification to medical benefit systems to reduce incentives for overservicing; the revision of medical benefit schedules; and, finally, medical education. So the Committee has a substantial way to go before its final report is placed before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Although improvements in administrative procedures are urgently needed and are recommended in the report, the inescapable fact remains that no administrative or legal system in this area can be completely effective without the co- operation of the medical profession, the members of which should act with integrity and should willingly accept a role along with government to ensure that the people of Australia have access to adequate standards of health care at a cost which the community is willing and able to afford. I commend the report to honourable senators. </PARA>

I would like to take two minutes to express my appreciation to the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, Senator Georges. His experience, his judgment and his insight were valuable. He has that rare capacity of being a calming influence in a storm, something which was needed in a number of areas of controversy which surrounded this report. The fact that Senator Georges was able to bring to bear a great depth of experience in the Parliamentary system helped to obtain a very balanced and fair report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday I was speaking on the very narrow point of the real cost of wages and the real cost of employing people in Australia. I made the point that the true cost of employing labour in Australia is not often perceived. The real cost is very high-probably the highest in the world. I related this to the Government's then proposed pay pause which has now become reality. This gives us a bit of breathing space to look at what is happening. It is a very real point. Undeniably there is some fat to be trimmed off some wages and salaries that are paid in this country. We live in competition with other countries and have to compete on the open market. We cannot hide behind protectionism all the way. In supporting my case, I illustrated the conditions which apply for the combined mining unions and I made the point that they are an extreme case. But this is relevant because there is always a flow on from what one union obtains to what ultimately becomes available to all of them. It is just not true to look at average weekly earnings . One has to look behind the scenes to find out what is happening. These hidden benefits in Australia, as I said before, are the highest in the world and they are at least a 50 per cent on-cost to the weekly pay that a worker receives in many industries. Take, for example, paying an increment for a holiday loading. I can remember that when that came in. I thought it was an absolutely illogical move. I could not believe anyone would be paid more to go on holiday than to work and I still have that air of incredulousness about it ten years after it was brought in. I was interested to hear an American observe the other day with astonishment: 'You pay them more to go on holidays than to work'. That is my view entirely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The consequence of this add-on costs is that we are pricing ourselves out of a market. That comes about in two ways. Firstly, we have strikes, which are often related to these additional benefits, in companies that are profitable and can afford to appease the unions in the short term; and secondly, we have to compete with nations, particularly those of the Asian-Pacific rim and our costs of production are too high. I was rather interested to see in the newspaper yesterday an account by one of the Esso financial managers on the effect of industrial disputes in Australia. He made the point that last year strikes cost each Australian family $3,000. He broke that figure up and mentioned that the Bass Strait disputes, which have been largely about the sorts of benefits I have been talking about, account for nearly $1,500 of that, if my memory serves me correctly. He also showed the loss of revenue to the Government in the form of taxation. We spent a rather hectic time in the last two weeks debating a retrospective tax Bill which will bring in at best between $200m and $300m; yet the amount lost through strikes in the Gippsland oil basin is a multiple of that . That is a national loss, because it has to be made up in other forms of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to compete with the nations in the Asian-Pacific region. There is no way we can protect Australian industry. There is no way we can protect our national wealth by higher and higher protection-tariffs and quotas. We simply have to compete. We are a healthy and an educated work force but we cannot compete if we are not prepared to work or if we want to pay ourselves too much. When I visited Taiwan once I heard the Finance Minister address a gatheing of overseas people. One of the visitors asked: 'What sort of welfare program do you have here, Mr Minister?'. The Minister looked at him and said: 'We believe the best welfare program we can give our citizens is to give them jobs.' That is not a bad philosophy. The path we are following will denude Australian industry of jobs simply because the industries cannot be profitable. The best way to trim these excess payments back is, of course, by competition in the market-place to allow a market for labour to be developed so that those who want to work can work on terms agreed between them and their employers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use the occasion of the first reading of the Bank Account Debits Tax Administration Bill 1982 and associated Bills to raise an issue which was initially raised by Senator Lewis, my colleague from Victoria, in Question Time on Tuesday, 7 December, when he asked a question about the journalist Claudia Wright.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many female journalists in 1982 use their own names. If the honourable senator is not up with that, he ought to be. He referred to her second husband, Melbourne-born Harvard PhD Dr John Helmer. He then asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is this Claudia Wright the person who launched, as recently as 13 November on Australian Broadcasting Commission radio from Washington, a violent attack on President Reagan and his Administration, accusing them of lying, cheating, lusting and of liquidating their personal opponents?</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Is this the same Claudia Wright who is the supporter and apologist for the murderous Colonel Gaddafi and his Libyan hit squads who were mentioned in the newspapers today?</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Is this Claudia Wright the person who has deliberately put at risk the lives of Western intelligence officers by naming them in the United States and is now prohibited from naming them there? Is she coming to Australia in order to name them whilst she is here? Can the Minister confirm or deny the rumour that this person is about to return to Australia and is to be given the opportunity by some Mebourne radio station to spew her lies and racist hatred on the Melbourne people. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that a point of order was taken at that time about the use of Question Time to make cowardly attacks on individuals. The President properly ruled that it was undesirable that the Senate be used as a forum for that sort of activity, but of course he made the very important distinction that honourable senators can call Claudia Wright or anybody else in the community-we all know this and rely on it a bit, I suppose-a liar or a spewer of venomous statements and so on; yet we cannot say that about each other. We belong to a protected species in that respect. That is one of the great hypocrisies of parliamentary Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> I hold no brief for any of the views of Claudia Wright. Although I am sure I would share many views with her, there are other views of hers which I would not agree with at all. That is not, of course, what I regard as being an issue in the manner in which the Senate Question Time was used by my fellow Victorian senator. Let me make some brief acknowledgment, however, of the particular smears and innuendoes which were contained in the question. First of all, it is suggested that Claudia Wright is an apologist for the murderous hit squads of Colonel Gaddafi. Claudia Wright has in fact publicly condemned the activities of those hit squads, so-called. Secondly, it is alleged that Claudia Wright published the names of Western intelligence officers in the United States. The question goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . is now prohibited from naming them there. </PARA>
<PARA>Claudia Wright has never published the names of any Western intelligence agents in the United States. On one occasion she referred to a book which was written, I think, by a man called Agnew, a former agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency, in which he named certain CIA agents. She referred to that book some time after it was published. She referred to the naming by that man of people involved in the CIA. The implication of the questions--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Let me make it quite clear. She has referred to a book which named CIA agents in Morocco, if the honourable senator wants to be precise. The expression 'publish' means, on my understanding, published for the first time. As I understand it, she would not dispute the fact that she has referred to publications which have named for the first time Western intelligence agents. It is not true to say that she is now prohibited from naming them in the United States even if she wanted to, but that is another point. Legislation was introduced in the United States this year-the Intelligence Agents Protection Bill-which covers a wide range of activity. It was not introduced with Claudia Wright in mind, as I understand it, but as a result of a number of publications made by ex-CIA agents. That is a matter which in a sense I have already adverted to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Claudia Wright, whatever one thinks of her views, is, in respect of a variety of publications throughout the world, a distinguished journalist. I will seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a statement of the professional activities of this Australian journalist. Before doing so, I refer to the fact, as did Senator Lewis, that she is the Washington correspondent of the London New Statesman, and the Paris weekly Temoignage Chretien. She is a regular contributor to the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Atlanta Constitution, the Miami Herald, the Pacific News Service and News Day. In addition, she broadcasts on the British Broadcasting corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Irish Radio and Television corporation and the Pacifica Radio Network. I want to make it quite clear that in addition she is, of course, a commentator on Middle East affairs in respect of which some of her views would not be acceptable to me, but in my view she is quite entitled to state them. It is very interesting to note that she has published, in conjunction with the Carnegie Institute, statements on foreign policy. Her work is published in International Security, a journal published by the Kennedy School of Government and Harvard University; International Affairs, which is a publication of Chatham House, London, and the Royal Institute of International Affairs; and in the Politique Internationale of Paris. </PARA>
<PARA> In April 1982 Claudia Wright was invited by the United States House of Representatives committee on Africa to give testimony on American foreign policy in the Middle East, including Libya. In October she participated in an international conference funded by the Rockefeller Foundation in Italy on the political future of Africa. She has also been appointed a Fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for scholars of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington. She was a participant with senior American officials in the Johnson foundation's conference series on American foreign policy. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard that document which I have described in some detail. </PARA>

All of these allegations are somewhat hysterical and would not be made outside the Parliament against a journalist and, of course, should not be made inside or outside the Parliament against a journalist in support of suppression of freedom of opinion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It invites her to participate in seminars on United States foreign policy and things of that kind. All of the newspapers to which I referred, including the New York Times and Los Angeles Post are distinguished newspapers in the United States which have made their judgment about her and publish her work. As I said, I do not want to say that I agree with everything she says. What I do say is that I affirm her right to say it. The United States, for all the criticisms we may have of it, as a major democracy in the Western world, accords to a journalist such as Claudia Wright that freedom of speech. I have had a few arguments with her and I can tell honourable senators that she is quite capable of looking after herself. But the United States accords those freedoms to her. Her work is published in that country. She is involved in public controversy about many issues in the United States. It is very sad that when she comes back to Australia the standards of democratic freedom and participation in debates which are recognised by all of the United States newspapers and the British and French newspapers to which I referred, and the BBC and other organisations, are sought to be denied her here by this sort of scurrilous atack from Senator Lewis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There should not be in this chamber, in relation to freedom of expression and opinion of views which the honourable senator happens to disagree with, a different standard from that which pertains in the United States and is recognised by all the newspapers and journals to which I referred. As I say, Claudia Wright is quite capable of looking after herself. If Senator Lewis solicits an invitation to appear on her program he will find that out for himself. I am sure that facility would be made available to him to say some of these things in public. This journalist has an extraordinary curriculum vitae in terms of her contributions to various communications outlets. The standards of this Senate should not be debased by these sorts of hysterical and cowardly attacks against such a person which would not be tolerated in the terms in which they were made in the United States or by the proprietors of the various journals to which I have referred.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, to defend her and to defend her right to speak. I would defend people's rights to free speech. Notwithstanding what Senator Button has had to say, I do not endeavour to have Claudia Wright refused permission to speak in some way or other in public forums in Australia or on the radio or to publish articles in newspapers. But I believe that it is necessary for the people who take an interest in these matters to be alerted to the people who are speaking to them. It seemed to me necessary to bring to the attention of those who were prepared to listen to or read what I had to say what I believe are some of her characteristics which ought to be known to the people of Australia and which probably would not be known because she publishes in places around the world other than Australia. Senator Button listed her qualifications. She has certainly come a long way since she was the social editor of the Melbourne Herald. It is interesting to wonder how she has come a long way and how it is that she is such an expert on Libyan affairs. It is that connection which causes me great concern. The people of Australia have recently had the opportunity of hearing-those who were there-and of reading-those who read the Australian-what Sir Larry Lamb said in the Arthur Normal Smith Memorial Lecture in journalism. I quote from some of the sections of his speech which are relevant to this matter. Sir Larry Lamb said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are, of course, those who believe that the biggest threat to Press freedom comes not from outside, but from within. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the most dangerous voice in politics today is the voice of the lunatic fringe of the Left-the ones who are dedicated to the destruction of society. </PARA>
<PARA> And since the first rule in the anarchists' handbooks is to infiltrate the media, there is no doubt that the Press has rather more than its share of them. </PARA>
<PARA> They exert and, I fear, will continue to exert, an influence out of all proportion to their numerical strength. </PARA>
<PARA> For that, we who occupy positions of power in the industry-</PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about proprietors of the industry-</PARA>
<PARA>have only ourselves to blame, for they are dedicated, tireless and without scruple in their determination to destroy, and we are part of the apathetic society. We are not only tolerant, which may be be commendable, but complacent, indolent, and all too often voiceless in defence of our ideas and ideals. </PARA>
<PARA> The wreckers, here in Australia, may be few . . . But they are there, and they are active. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Larry Lamb went on to point out that he was not talking about people who stood for elected positions. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I speak rather of those who wish to tear down our society and destroy our institutions without the remotest idea of what is to replace them. </PARA>
<PARA> There are such people. We ignore them at our peril. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to the fact that a Melbourne radio station has a very large advertisement in today's Melbourne Age talking about 'the mouth that roars- Claudia Wright', and advertising her attendance on a particular radio station, I think, some time next week. In any event, I say to the proprietors of that radio station that they ought to read very carefully what Sir Larry Lamb had to say in that speech. I compare that speech with an article which appeared in Quadrant of April 1982. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Button says, it is a reliable journal and it ought to be read more often by people who have the protection of Australia and Australian freedoms at heart. It was that article which alerted me to Claudia Wright-not the article which Senator Button talked about which appeared in that scrurrilous Melbourne newspaper. I quote from a section of Quadrant of April 1982 about Claudia Wright which referred to an article that that she had written on 20 March. Quadrant states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this same article (March 20) she repeatedly uses such terms as ''quislings'' , ''terror'', ''collaborator'' and ''purge'' to describe, and demean, almost every aspect of Reagan's administration, terms noticeably absent from the coverage of her favourite Arab countries (i.e. Libya and Iraq). Everyone, it seems, in the Reagan administration is a crook. If they are rich they are successful crooks, if not, unsuccessful ones. </PARA>
<PARA>Our great Australian Broadcasting Commission radio gave this person the opportunity to speak on two occasions. It was not satisfied with one occasion. On 13 November 1982 on a program called Saturday Guest she attacked the Reagan Administration and President Reagan using such terms as 'the job of President attracts a special kind of sadist'. That is just one quote from a speech which was broadcast in Australia by ABC radio. The following week, on 20 November 1982 , again on Saturday Guest, she attacked Margaret Thatcher. That week the program was supposed to be about women in politics but, for some reason or other, Margaret Thatcher does not appeal to her and she attacked her. She alleged that Margaret Thatcher was no longer female; that she was only female in sex. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been revealed to us that the KGB objective throughout the Western world is misinformation. We heard a lot about misinformation during the war when we had Lord Haw Haw representing the Germans, and Tokyo Rose representing the Japanese. But during the Korean war there developed a particular type of ' journalist-political agent'. I refer to one person by the name of Wilfred Burchett. I quote from an article in the Los Angeles Times written by one Tom Lambert and published on 26 February 1967. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The political or diplomatic journalist has long been a fixture in the newspaper world, the man whose subject is diplomacy, the relations, interplay and exchanges between nations. </PARA>
<PARA>That is right and proper. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> But with the inception of communism, and its deliberate subjection of journalism to ideology, a new type of reporter came into being in modern history -the journalist political agent. As such, Burchett is one of the most valuable in the Communist world. His contacts and abilities also make him one of the most suspect, perhaps one of the most dangerous. Burchett's eminence in his field is manifest in various ways, in both the Communist and free worlds . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to Claudia Wright's detailed knowledge of Libyan affairs. It is interesting to consider how she is using this detailed knowledge in her publications. I refer to some publications which I have gathered from the Parliamentary Library. I have an article on Greece dated 27 February 1981 in which she referred to Greece as being 'another United States bomb site'. I have an extract from the New Statesman of 13 March 1981 entitled 'The new White House warmongers' in which again she attacked President Reagan as she is doing continually. She referred to him and his security staff as a 'bloodthirsty crew' . The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Recently, Reagan has tried the ploy with which Adolf Hitler achieved some success in Germany. </PARA>
<PARA>These sorts of allegations continually come through in her pubications. It may very well be that newspapers are just as greedy as anyone else in industry, commerce, private or, indeed, public enterprise. Maybe they cannot resist publishing these things because they believe newspaper circulations will be increased. </PARA>

The point is that the people of Australia ought to know the sorts of publications that this woman has been making up until now. Decisions about what the New Statesman ought to publish are matters for the proprietors and the editor of the New Statesman. I refer to an article of 4 January 1980 entitled ' ''Crooked business as usual'' is the route to success in Washington'. Again, that was another violent attack on President Reagan and his colleagues. Another article states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Another article under the heading 'Germany' has a further heading of 'The Middle East adventure'. It is dated 18 July 1980. This article is clearly an attempt to drive a wedge between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation allies. She talks about the Germans being the lackeys of the Americans. She states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity during this first reading debate on the bank Bills to make some comments about a report on child migrant education that was tabled last week but which was not included for debate. More specifically, I want to talk about a particular language problem. The report on child migrant education states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Commonwealth funding of research studies in child migrant education has mainly been provided under programs of the Education Research and Development Committee (ERDC), which has been administered by a secretariate provided by the Commonwealth Department of Education. As a consequence of the Government's decision to abolish the ERDC-</PARA>
<PARA>That was one of the decisions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions-</PARA>
<PARA>a major source of funds and initiative for research studies in child migrant education no longer exists. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt about the widespread interest and concern in Australia today about all aspects of language and its usage. This has been borne out by the excellent response to the current reference of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts into the question of a national language policy in Australia. The needs of those whose mother tongue is other than English-migrants and Aborigines-are gradually being acknowledged. Language difference in this country is seen as a language deficit according to Ms Eva Fesl, who is Director of the Aboriginal Research Centre at Monash University. Too many children in this category go through the school system understanding only a fraction of what was sought to be taught. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent work in Melbourne showed that of one group of migrant children-most went through the system in primary school understanding only a quarter of the curriculum. Their difficulties within an insensitive system have frequently led to frustration, behavioural problems and an early rejection of schooling, as victims of a deficient system. Those children whose mother tongue is English are frequently missing out on the enrichment of their experience which the learning of a second language can contribute. Australian society is poorer generally because we lack appreciation of other cultures and retreat into the insularity and intolerance which our monolingual education has engendered. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some valuable initiatives currently seeking to overcome such historical disadvantages. At the North Ainslie Primary School here in the Australian Capital Territory, since 1978 the curriculum has included a Greek language program for children, parents and teachers, which has cost no more annually than the salary of one specialist teacher. This program is currently under threat of having its funding withdrawn or reduced by the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XG4">Senator GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Baume will let me continue, I will point out that this innovative program, now in its fifth year, is one which involves the whole school, embracing as it does each child from the time of entry into kindergarten and before. The reasons for starting this program were social and educational. A significant number of Greek children were already at the school and were having language difficulties as well as experiencing problems of acceptance. Some children with a gift for languages were being denied an opportunity of becoming proficient in two languages. It was suspected that the self-image and self- esteem of children from different backgrounds could be raised considerably and this has been the case. The appreciation of Greek culture, rich in its traditions of literature, song, dance and cuisine, has provided a springboard for the study of other cultures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This longitudinal program, including as it does each new intake into the school at kindergarten level, is creating a wealth of data for study by linguists, educators and government planning bodies and all for the price of one primary school teacher. I must admit, that teacher is required to be a very special person: In addition to being a linguist that person must be a diplomat and an expert teacher. It has also been suggested that above all it is necessary to have a native speaker-that is, one who has received virtually all initial schooling in the foreign language. Australian children of migrants or migrants who came to Australia before completion of secondary school generally do not have a firm enough grasp of their native language to provide high quality instruction in it. Also, their pronunciation is liable to be corrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> At the North Ainslie Primary School we have living, breathing evidence of the positive outcome of foreign language study in a primary school. The understanding of the principal of the school and the staff of the school is that in 1983 current funding will be cut to 50 per cent and in 1984 funding will cease altogether. A Schools Authority evaluation in 1980 found: That this program appears to be achieving very positive results with very limited resources; that there was a general improvement in reading ability, especially for the non-English speaking students, few of whom then required remedial teaching in reading; that there was evidence to suggest that the reading skills of all children had improved since the introduction of the Greek program. </PARA>
<PARA> The local community itself has been invited to comment on the contribution which is being made by the program. Their comments are very similar to those that have been collected from the parents at the North Ainslie Primary School who are overwhelmingly in favour of the program being continued. Important benefits mentioned by the parents were the increased self-confidence and pride that they now see in their children. One parent commented: 'Most children take pleasure in knowing something that their parents don't know, and my own kindergarten son feels obliged to teach me Greek'. </PARA>
<PARA> Continued provision of an out-of-formula teacher, which is advocated by the school, is essential. There is no possibility, apparently, of the sort of flexibility within the school curriculum that would provide for this extra teacher because the school is not in a growth area. Its current enrolment is 330 ; the numbers are not dropping but they are not increasing either. The appointment of a within-formula replacement teacher solely on aptitude in Greek could be self-defeating and would be at the expense of the rounded education program at present available within the school. Another suggestion, that one floating relief teacher with responsibility for the program would be adequate to continue the program, would be risky as a decline in the school numbers could cause a decline in the availability of hours. The principal believes that the slow death of a deteriorating program will occur unless the school can be assured of funding of an out-of-formula teacher. The Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority specifically noted this necessity in its evaluation of four Australian Capital Territory primary schools with out-of-formula bilingual teachers. This evaluation was conducted in 1980, and this is what was said:</PARA>
<PARA> It was recommended that a special component be built into the staffing formula of those four pilot schools to allow one extra second language teacher from the start of 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts was invited to see this program in action. We had great pleasure in accepting the invitation and watching three classes during one morning a couple of weeks ago. We were able to see how, from the very beginning of school, children are given this opportunity to acquire another language, to acquire understanding of another culture and in fact to have their education enriched in very many ways. On the day we attended the next year's intake of kindergarten pupils was visiting the school and was mingling with the kindergarten pupils, who sang their songs and demonstrated their grip of the vocabulary and their great joy in the program in which they were involved. The multicultural strand of the program involves every child in the school. Intense study of Greek has been undertaken by the kindergarten children of 1978 and subsequent years and has now moved through to year 4. In the very early years there are three sessions a week in Greek. As they get older they have five sessions a week. Children from Greek speaking homes and monolingual children from kindergarten through to grade six, who have demonstrated a special language aptitude, are involved in intensive study of Greek. Some of these children have since graduated to high school. I believe that the Watson High School is one of those secondary schools in the Australian Capital Territory at which they are able, or were able, to continue their Greek studies. Implementation of the program has involved the development of teaching strategies, skills, materials, approaches, and a new curriculum. As I said before, all of this is done at the cost of one salary. </PARA>
<PARA> Future plans include the teaching of Greek as a written language. This has commenced in years 3 and 4 and these children are now capable of writing small stories, taking dictation and conversing in Greek. The study of grammar is being undertaken. Familiarity with the Greek alphabet, I might add, starts from the very early years. New developments which are being planned include the extension of the program into the senior school and developing literacy in the Greek language. The participation of the Arts and Liaison Committee of the North Ainslie School Board, comprised of board, parents and citizens and teacher members, has actively promoted the multicultural strand of the Greek program. Over the years classes have been held in handcrafts and cooking, and social evenings have been conducted. In 1982 interested parents attended Greek classes during school hours. They are being offered one hour's tuition per week and it had been planned to encourage and further extend this new language learning development in forthcoming years. </PARA>
<PARA> With the strong likelihood of the program being cut back to a half of a teacher next year and the funding being cut out altogether in 1984, the school community is anticipating that it will immediately have to discriminate. Up until this time all children have been able to learn Greek. In 1983 only some children will be able to do so, and those who will lose will be those who have become accustomed to losing. Losing seems to be their lot in life. If the Government is sincere about multicultural education, if it is prepared to follow the dicta put down by the previous Minister for Education, Senator Sir John Carrick, three years ago, that additional language teachers would be provided to allow these schools which are dedicated to the notion of giving children a second language, the opportunity may then be extended. Whatever the future may hold, whether the program continues or dies, in the words of the principal of the school:</PARA>
<PARA> Hundreds of children at this school have benefited enormously from their involvement in the learning of another language and the loss of our fine Greek program fills me with deep sorrow. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of reasons exist why this program should at least be allowed to continue at its present level until it has time to complete its function as a pilot study. That would allow the children currently involved in the program to continue through to the end of their primary school years. The program has been carefully developed. The cost to the nation and to the education system generally is minimal, this at a time when research generally into these particular language questions is falling, by default, onto the shoulders of people such as those at the North Ainslie School who have given an enormous amount of their own time and effort to make the program a success. Quite apart from everything else, there has been enrichment of the whole community life of the area. The children at school have this immense opportunity to acquire a second language, to acquire a greatly expanded approach to their environment and to the cultures of other people. The stimulus to their education has been marked . All of the teachers are very enthusiastic about the program and comment about the improvement in a wide range of skills, not just language skills, as a result of the extra stimulus that this program has provided. Above all, I believe that the expansion in community tolerance and understanding is invaluable. It simply cannot be quantified. I would urge the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) to give serious consideration to making it possible for the program to continue at its present level, at least until it is able to be continued as a complete study, over the span of primary school years for the 1978 pioneers of the program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity of the first reading of the Bank Account Debits Tax Administration Bill 1982, Bank Accounts Debits Tax Bill 1982 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Amendment Bill 1982 to raise a matter which is of concern to the Australian Democrats, one which has been the topic of some discussion in this place on a number of occasions. Continuous assertions have been made about the voting record of the Australian Democrats in an attempt to try to diminish our independence in this place. For example, the Liberal Party used false statistics in the 1980 election campaign to attack our Senate candidates. One of the latest incorrect assertions was made by Senator Sir John Carrick on 26 October 1982 when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . if one wants to know how the Democrats will vote, they will vote as the limpet fish of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> What I am saying is that on almost all matters of any significance in the Senate the Democrats can be relied upon to vote with the Labor Party . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These statements are totally incorrect. Senator Sir John Carrick has based his comments on a Liberal Party document which, quoting figures relating to divisions only, comes to the conclusion that the Democrats had voted with the Australian Labor Party three-quarters of the time. This is totally incorrect. There is, as anybody in this place knows, a very large distinction between votes and divisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I have written to the President (Senator the Hon. Harold Young) seeking his guidance on this matter and he has replied to me. In his reply he has said that he has no objection to my quoting from his letter. In it he said:</PARA>
<PARA> As you are aware, not all decisions of the Senate are taken by a vote, and comparatively few votes are determined by division. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, to take divisions alone, as the Liberals do, and then to say that they represent all voting behaviour in the Senate, is grossly misleading. The ratio between votes and divisions is a very large one. From 15 August 1978 to 18 September 1980 there were 8,152 decisions taken by the Senate and there were only 247 divisions; that is, 8,152 to 247. The President, in his letter to me, said:</PARA>
<PARA> In January 1981, in response to an inquiry from Senator Mason, the then Clerk of the Senate provided some figures which indicate that only a small minority of decisions taken by the Senate were decided by division. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious, however, that the number of decisions will always be very much greater than the number of recorded divisions. </PARA>
<PARA>No figures on the number of decisions in the current sittings of the Senate have been compiled. Since there is an enormous amount of work involved in the compilation of those figures I did not feel justified in seeking again from the Clerk of the Senate that such an activity ought to be undertaken. In relation to the proportion between decisions of the Senate and divisions called in this place and recorded in Hansard, the President noted:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is likely that, if figures were compiled for the present session, they would indicate a similar ratio between decisions and divisions. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, divisions represent about 3 per cent of the number of decisions taken by this Senate. Yet anyone seeking to find how a senator votes can refer only to the divisions. They are the only records. According to the President, it is not possible to ascertain which way any senator voted on a decision that does not go to a division unless, only one senator expresses an opposing point of view and seeks to have that recorded in the Journals of this place. It should be noted that divisions under the Standing Orders can be called only by a minority, that is, they can be called only by the group against whom the decision is given by the person in the chair. Thus, when the Australian Democrats vote with the Government and constitute a majority, the Australian Democrats are unable, under the Standing Orders, to request a division and have their votes recorded in the Journals of this place. We believe it is grossly unfair and, indeed, improper for honourable senators who outside this place then totally misrepresent the actions of the senators in going about their business. Indeed, I believe it runs very close to a breach of the privilege of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Australian Democrats entered the Senate in 1977 and held the balance in 1981 it is nonsense, completely misleading and untrue to say that the Democrats have voted with the Australian Labor Party more than with the Liberal Party and National Party. That is unascertainable by any honourable senator. To so assert is indeed to seek deliberately to impede the activity of senators in carrying out their duties. I have raised this matter because I am extremely concerned. Indeed, if this were to occur again and if letters were to be written such as have been written, I would seek to bring that before the Senate as a matter of privilege so that misleading statements being made in other places can be brought before this chamber and the Senate can review them and see whether or not there has been an attempt by honourable senators to bring pressure to bear on other honourable senators as to how they should vote. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>BANK ACCOUNT DEBITS TAX ADMINISTRATION BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the decision by the government to impose a new tax on debits to cheque accounts kept with banks in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> This new tax should be recognised as being consistent with the government's policy of seeking to place greater reliance on indirect taxes in order that some relief can be given in the income tax field. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, this and the other budget measures by which a modest broadening of the indirect tax base has been achieved contributed significantly to our ability to responsibly make a substantial reduction in the personal income tax burden as proposed in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the practical details of the new tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to specified exemptions, the tax will apply to all debits made to a bank account on which cheques may be drawn. </PARA>
<PARA> Debits resulting from cheques drawn on an account, as well as other debits made to an account, such as for periodical transfer payments and for the charging of interest and bank fees, will be subject to the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Debits to current accounts held with trading banks will be the primary subject of the tax, although it will also apply to debits to accounts with cheque drawing facilities with other banks such as savings banks, special purpose banks , and certain accounts with the Reserve Bank of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The liability to pay tax imposed on a debit made to a cheque account will, except in special cases identified in the Bill, fall on the bank in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA> Banks with which cheque accounts are kept will be required to furnish to the Commissioner of Taxation monthly returns of taxable debits and to pay the tax imposed on those debits. </PARA>
<PARA> Payment of the tax will be required of the bank within 14 days after the end of the month to which the return and tax relate. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the banks will be primarily responsible for payment of the tax, the scheme of the tax is that the incidence of it will effectively fall on bank customers rather than on the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The bill therefore proposes that the banks be given a statutory right to recover from their customers the tax payable on debits made to customers' accounts. This may be direct charge at the time of the debit entry or by some other periodical charge arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemption from the tax will be provided for a range of institutions and some persons. </PARA>
<PARA> These include public benevolent and religious bodies, hospitals, schools, government departments and instrumentalities, other than for government business undertakings, foreign diplomatic and consular personnel and international organizations for which Australia traditionally grants tax exemptions of this kind in recognition of our treaty obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> A person or body entitled to exemption from the tax will be able to apply to the Commissioner of Taxation for a certificate of exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> Banks will be freed from liability to pay tax in respect of debits to any account for which a certificate of exemption is in force. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain other classes of debits will also be exempt from the tax irrespective of whether a certificate or exemption is in force in respect of the account concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> These are debits made to an account to recover from the bank's customer the tax payable by the bank, debits made to reverse a prior credit entry and any debits which are subsequently reversed. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a bank has paid tax in relation to an entry but is unable to recover from its customer, the bank will be entitled to claim from the Commissioner of Taxation a refund of that tax. </PARA>
<PARA> A large portion of the bill is concerned with the machinery provisions of the kind commonly found in taxation acts which are necessary for the efficient administration and collection of a tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will note that the new tax will not apply to instruments known as bank cheques, since the scheme of the tax is that it will apply only to debits to customers accounts. Bank cheques are a convenient formal payment instrument for people in the community who do not maintain cheque accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that exemption from the tax is to be provided for debits made to an account held by other banks with the Reserve Bank of Australia or with any other bank. </PARA>
<PARA> This exemption is intended to ensure that, as far as possible, the tax will fall on customers of banks and not on the banks themselves. This will ensure that the tax can only effectively fall once on particular transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> In drawing attention to these 2 features of the bill I sound a warning to any who might attempt to exploit them as a means of avoiding the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say, Mr President, that the government will not stand for any abuse of these exemptions and any move in that direction could well result in their withdrawal. </PARA>
<PARA> The bill as a whole, along with its associated bills, is explained in an explantory memorandum being made available to honourable senators and I think that I need say no more at this introductory stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>BANK ACCOUNT DEBITS TAX BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill formally imposes tax on debits to cheque accounts with banks and sets out the amount of tax payable by reference to the amount of a particular debit. </PARA>
<PARA> Originally the Government indicated in the Budget that the tax would apply from 1 January 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then it has been put to the Government that there would be serious difficulties for some of the banks, on which primary responsibility for payment of the tax is to fall, in having in place by that date the necessary systems to cope with their administrative functions in relation to the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The writing and testing of the necessary computer programs is, of course, a major task. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, some banks have been under particular strain in relation to recent bank mergers and also because of the proposed imposition of state taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts that there may be a valid case for allowing more time for banks to prepare for the commencement of the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It has therefore decided that the tax should now commence to apply from a date to be fixed by proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA> The government will, of course, in its discussions with the banks seek the earliest possible date for the commencement of the tax, consistent with practical convenience. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the practical aspects of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax to be imposed by this Bill will be in the range from 10 cents for debits of less than $100 up to $1.00 for debits of $5,000 or more. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax will generally be payable by the bank with which the account is held, subject to a right of recovery by the bank from its customer. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also imposes tax that, in special circumstances, will be payable by the customer of a bank. </PARA>
<PARA> This would be the case, for example, where a person who is a resident of Australia shifts his banking business to an overseas bank for the purpose of avoiding the tax in respect of an Australian account. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax would in that case be imposed on and payable by that person in respect of debits made to the overseas account. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS (JUDICIAL REVIEW) AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA>This third Bill in the package associated with the new tax on bank account debits proposes an amendment, consequential upon the 2 Bills I have already introduced, to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisions under certain Acts are precluded from review through the system of review provided for by that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisions connected with the new bank account debits tax are also to be excluded from the purview of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, consistent with the position that prevails in relation to decisions under various other Commonwealth taxation laws. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a bank or other person liable to pay an amount of bank account debits tax and who is dissatisfied with a prescribed decision or assessment by the Commissioner in relation to the tax will have available full rights of objection and appeal to a Taxation Board of Review or a Supreme Court and ultimately, if the matter warrants it, to the Federal and High Courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Other taxation laws administered by the Commissioner of Taxation that provide similar rights to contest liability, as I say, are also excluded from review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I also commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Bill 1982 has the support of the Australian Labor Party. In other words, we do not intend to oppose the Bill. However, we intend to move an amendment and I believe that the Australian Democrats also propose to move an amendment which is acceptable to the Opposition. There will be an unusually large number of speakers in this debate. I understand that the Government was interested in expediting the program but there is to be more than the average number of speakers. For the consideration of the Senate we will make some comments and criticisms regarding the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our criticisms and comments revolve around some key points. These are the inadequate funding which the Government has given for road development programs since it came to office in 1975; the unreasonable and political pressures that the Government is placing on the State governments and to that extent, on local government; and more importantly perhaps, the addition of yet another tax burden on the ordinary Australian because the funding of this Bill will considerably increase the costs of most goods produced and distributed in Australia. This flies in the face of the Government's so-called anti-inflationary policy. Another Bill which seeks to increase the costs of petroleum products and petrol in particular is to be regretted. We have a great deal of misgivings about this Bill in terms of what it is claimed is the strategy of the Fraser Government. We also question the political use to which funds will be put by the Government, particularly by the National Party senators who have attempted to introduce the principle of pork-barrelling and so on in respect of the way in which these funds are to be used. Of course, we also have some misgivings about the blatant misuse of the Bicentennial Authority which has been used for the purpose of justifying this added tax upon every Australian who uses a mode of transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us seeks to establish the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund to receive funds raised by a special surcharge on motor spirit and diesel excise for the purpose of upgrading Australia's road system by 1988, which is the bicentennial year. I think it has to be said that the Government has failed miserably to arouse any enthusiasm among average Australians about the bicentennial year, which is now less than six years off. Yet, that event, which marks 200 years of white rule in this country, is being used as the pretext for upgrading our road system via the new tax. Of course as I said, this proposal flies in the face of the Government's anti-inflation policies because it is in fact highly inflationary. One, therefore, has the right and the obligation to criticise that aspect of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The new tax is expected to yield a net $2.5 billion from the motorist over the next six years. The surcharge on motor spirit and diesel fuel will be 1c a litre as from last Budget night until 30 June, and then from 1 July next year it will be 2c a litre until 31 December 1988. But that, of course, does not take away the opportunity for another Liberal government-God forbid we should have another one like the Fraser Administration-to raise that surcharge subsequent to the passage of this legislation. The funds so collected are to be allocated to national highways including developmental roads, urban and arterial roads and local roads. But part of the urban arterial funding may be spent on urban public transport capital projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Senate's attention ought to be drawn to the fact that some 40 years ago a conservative government introduced legislation to establish a fuel tax, the sole purpose of which was to build roads. The greatest percentage of the huge sum of money that has been collected over subsequent years has been going not to road construction but in fact to Commonwealth revenue. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Robertson correctly points out, it has gone to general revenue. However, we are given the justification for an additional fuel tax which, according to this Bill, will be especially set aside for the purpose of road building. This legislation gives to the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt), who is probably the chief pork-barreler in the Government, the sole power to allocate national highway funds. That is not a very satisfactory situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Urban arterial, rural arterial and local road funds are to be allocated on the basis of relativities contained in the Road Grants Act 1981-the Senate dealt with that legislation last year-and set out in the schedules attached to this Bill. The conditions that are applicable to the States and the Northern Territory before receiving these funds are that the Commonwealth Government will have to give approval for each of the projects covered under the program and that the States and the Northern Territory must maintain their real level of funding from their own resources. Here we have a situation where the Commonwealth is saying to the States: 'Well, we will allocate you these funds but you must also allocate an equal proportion of your last year's funding for road purposes if you want to qualify'. That seems to be the very antithesis of what the Government says about Commonwealth-State relations. How many times over the last few years have we heard Senator Sir John Carrick speak about 'co- operative federalism'? This is dictation from Canberra by a government which claims to stand for the principles of States rights and which was so critical of the Whitlam Government when we sought to establish some form of priority in respect of the sorts of roads and other public facilities and services that should be provided on the basis of equality and reaching a common standard. Yet this very government which rode to power on the alleged differences between the States and the Commonwealth, pledging its support for and faith in the principle of States rights, in fact is now imposing directions upon the State governments.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition takes the view that the injection of funds into road construction that will result from the Bill is certainly most welcome. That is why we are not opposing the legislation. As has been indicated, of course, we have much criticism to make of the Bill because the Bill is one of the best admissions one could have by this Government-by the Fraser Government, by the Frasers and the Howards-of its disastrous road policies since it came to office seven years ago in 1975. No doubt this Government is under siege and threat. It is now attempting to use the bicentennial concept for the purpose of trying to build up our important public road transport system. But instead of money for this purpose coming out of funds collected by way of a fuel tax that was established many years ago, we are confronted with an inflationary tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will have two road programs when this legislation is passed-the program set up under the Road Grants Act and the proposed Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. Rather than improve the former, the Government has come up with a new scheme. It is another one of the gimmicks for which the Fraser Administration is so notorious. It is hoping to avoid reference to the disaster of its management of road grants legislation in past years. It does not matter which State or local government association or organisation throughout the Commonwealth of Australia one wishes to point to-every State and every local government body is dissatisfied with the Commonwealth's contribution to road funding. One has only to read what has been said by State road construction Ministers or representatives of local government associations in the various States speaking on behalf of local government bodies to appreciate that the Government is on the nose as far as its road construction responsibilities are concerned. Instead of meeting its obligations under the old fuel tax, it comes forth with this new project. Of course, we are entitled to say that the Government seeks to use an occasion and an additional tax to meet what should be its obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refresh the memory of honourable senators in respect of this Government's record. The Government has had a very poor and inadequate record in respect of road grants since it came to office. In every single Budget year there has been a reduction in road funding to the States and local government. In the first Budget the funding was reduced by 8.2 per cent. In the following years it was reduced by 2.2 per cent, one per cent and 7.1 per cent. Last year it was reduced by 3.7 per cent. That means that in real terms $517m less has been available for road construction in Australia during the period of this Government. In my State of New South Wales the loss involved was $92m. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much talk of job creation and unemployment. Surely, if the Government were really interested in creating jobs it could do so in this area, rather than come up with such gimmicks as a wage pause or wage freeze. Surely not only employment but also cost efficiency is involved. If you have an inefficient transport system, as is acknowledged by this legislation, additional costs must be built into retail and distributing charges which, in Australia, are enormous and growing as a result of the deficiencies of this Government. The Government is bent upon pursuing its own philosophical approach that if a dollar is spent in this field rather than in the private sector somehow or other the society will disintegrate. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking not only about an actual reduction in funding allocations for road construction but also about a most incredible increase in road construction costs. In the last two years such costs have risen 31.2 per cent, yet this Government talks about a wage freeze, a wage pause. The workers are to carry the burden of the economic crisis arising from the problems of capital in the world and the inept and inefficient government of Mr Fraser and Mr Howard in Australia in particular. There is no price control on road construction costs. There has not been in the last two years an increase of 31 per cent or anywhere near that figure in main roads departments' works staff, but there certainly has been an increase of that level in road construction costs. That simply highlights the present situation, one in which we might as well have a guestimate-that is all one can hope to do in view of the nature of the Government's Estimates-that some $1,000m less has been spent on roads during this Government's term of office. </PARA>
<PARA> We have hardly passed the Estimates for 1982-83 in the Senate yet the deficit has gone up from $1.5 billion to $4 billion, more than it ever was under the Whitlam Government. Yet Government supporters have the audacity to defend it and to criticise Labor for the situation then, which merely reflected the economic position worldwide in the latter part of 1973 and 1974. Labor was then forced to defend everything as a result of the obstructionist position taken by the tories in the Australian Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> These cuts in road funding have occurred during a period of soaring road building costs. One need not guess at the figures. The recently released Bureau of Transport Economics report on road construction price indexes indicated that in one year, 1979-80, such costs went up by 15.9 per cent and, in 1980-81, by 15 .3 per cent. Surely we are on common ground in stating that the effect of this, combined with the Government's policy of reducing road funding, has been staggering and obvious for any driver to see. Therefore, the funds provided by this Bill will only just make up for the seven years of the Fraser Government's complete and utter neglect and unconcern for the state of road construction in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the Government seeks to solve the problem in one blow by adding another financial impost to the burden carried by the public. It will mean slugging the Australian public generally, the business sector and the transport industry, to the extent of $2.5 billion. If the Government had been really concerned about maintaining road grants it would have amended the actual States Grants (Roads) Act so that a fair share of motorists' taxes would be returned to the States for road works. It would not then have been necessary in this legislation to impose a new tax on motorists, who yet again are being asked to carry the Government. The Government not only has increased the price of petrol by imposing excise taxes which have risen alarmingly and have brought in millions of dollars for every Budget, but also now seeks to impose an additional tax. If one were to work out the Government's share of the increased cost of petrol in Australia it would be seen as taking into its own coffers about one-third of the price paid by the motorists. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill attaches a number of conditions to the receipt of Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program funds. One is that the States maintain their own real level of road funding. That has no regard for the particular circumstances in which States find themselves as a result of the squeeze on health funding and the reduction of general revenue and special purpose grants. Similarly, housing funding has been reduced and additional tasks allocated to the States. This has happened at a time when the States are trying to take up the slack which has resulted from the almost total collapse of the private sector. I repeat, we live in a period in which the private sector is almost collapsing. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, I spoke to a former member of my staff who is taking his doctorate in economics at Cambridge University and who is currently visiting Australia. He described England as an industrial wasteland. We are fast approaching that position in our own country, as a result particularly of the policies being pursued by Mr Fraser and Mr Howard, yet the States are expected to make funds available for public works programs. Road construction is an important decentralised form of employment activity which plays a vital role in local and rural centres as we try to update our arterial road system. Despite this, in the last seven years the Government has seen fit to reduce road funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we are faced with a hypocritical proposition by a Government which itself has reduced the level of funding by $517m since 1975-76. Even worse, if some of the States cannot in the years ahead raise the additional money to maintain a real level of funding they will suffer a 100 per cent penalty. The amount by which they default will be withdrawn from them under this program. Thus, if in a particular State there is a problem associated with power, hospitalisation or education, necessitating a rearrangement of the State's Budget, the Government will impose a 100 per cent penalty so far as withdrawals from the fund are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, while we are not opposing the Bill, because it is at least doing something to overcome the road construction problem and provide employment opportunities, we are thoroughly justified in criticising the Government's approach. The States are now spending a record share of total funds on roads in order to compensate for the reduction in the Commonwealth's real road funding since 1975-76. At that time the Commonwealth funded 37.6 per cent of total real road funding. By 1979-80 that figure had fallen to 30 per cent. In order to compensate, the States' share rose from 30.5 per cent in 1975-76 to 39 per cent in 1979-80, an increase of almost one-third. So the States' share has increased while the Commonwealth's share has fallen by 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the Commonwealth wants to dictate to the States that they should maintain a real level of funding based on their peak expenditure levels of last year. That is an imposition upon, a dictation to, the States. In addition, ratepayers across Australia have been slugged with higher rates to help local government make up for deficiencies in funding by the Commonwealth Government. This legislation is thus designed to force up State licence fees and taxes upon motorists and road users. Unless the States take that unpopular step they will forfeit these funds; so it is heavy-handed, hypocritical and removes, right up to the year 1988, the discretion of the States with regard to a large part of their Budgets. In New South Wales in 1981 motor vehicle registration charges rose by 30 per cent. This year they rose by a further 13.6 per cent. This is a result of the Federal Government's policies. It is an effect of the so-called new federalism about which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) used to talk. We never hear that term used now by either the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick-I do not think he has used it in this place for the last year or so. All we used to hear was that record being played over and over again. The Federal Government is palming off its responsibilities to the States and refuses to provide further financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> In a further intrusion into the powers and rights of the States and local government, this Bill will also give the Minister for Transport and Construction the sole power to determine which national road projects are carried out under the Fund. This will leave the Fund open to discrimination and pork barrelling. Unfortunately, the Australian Bicentennial Authority has been dragged into this messy procedure. The Authority, which is supposed to be a non-political, non- partisan and unifying body, has been brought in to endorse the Fund. The Authority has been asked to excuse and soften the introduction of a new tax on the people of Australia and the Government should be condemned for dragging down in this way an authority which should be above party politics. The Opposition is therefore concerned about the Bill. It should not be used to cover up the neglect by the Fraser Government of Australia's road programs over the last seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> We are particularly concerned about the inadequate provision of funds for local roads. As our proposed amendment seeks to show, local government has been treated as a poor relation, by the Government in this legislation. The scheme will do precious little for local government because almost all the funds available will be taken away by the rise in petrol and diesel costs and by the removal of the exemption from excise duty on diesel fuel used off public roads. Naturally the Australian Council of Local Government Associations has objected to that. So, in overall terms, local government will be barely any better off as a result of this legislation, due to increased costs and the way in which the funding will be organised. I understand from preliminary estimates that in net terms local government will receive less than a two per cent real increase in road funds in 1982-83 and about a four per cent real increase in 1983-84, but it will suffer about an eight per cent decrease in real terms in the following year -this at a time when inflation is in double figures. Therefore, I move the Opposition amendment, which seeks to overcome that problem:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add, but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) recognises the special roads needs of the various regions of Australia and deplores the failure of the Government to make provision in the Bill for an equitable allocation of national roads funds between the States and the Northern Territory; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) condemns the government for its discriminatory decision to allocate an inadequate level of funds to local government bodies for local roads. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that in the preparation of this legislation the Government failed completely to take into consideration its responsibilities in respect of environmental impact legislation. I have been provided with a list of the proposed construction of roads in Queensland. Judging by that list, there is no doubt that this Government has failed to understand its responsibilities in respect of its own legislation-legislation which was introduced by the Australian Government in 1973-74 and which requires an environmental impact statement for all public construction works. I am led to believe that, in some of the regions of Queensland where it is proposed to construct roads as part of the arterial system, the Government has failed to have any regard at all for the environment. These proposed roads in Queensland will go through rain forests and important coastal areas and will have a very important effect upon the local environment. My colleagues in the Australian Democrats propose to move an amendment to take this into consideration. It is clear that when this Bill was drawn up the Federal Government failed to comply with the provisions of its own legislation and the States, themselves, have not given due consideration to the need to carry out such construction works at a minimum cost to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had big struggles in this country about protecting our rain forests and other environmental treasures. In fact, we argue about them consistently in this place. We tend to forget that all actions by public authorities can, if they are not properly controlled and developed, have a detrimental effect on the local environment. To that extent, I believe that there is a very important need for the Australian Government to insist, when allocating funds to the States under this legislation, that there shall be due regard to protecting the local environment. It may well be that in some instances it will be impossible to avoid an impact on the local environment, but as far as is practicable there ought to be a public inquiry or at least an inquiry carried out by the appropriate national or State authority to ensure that there is minimum damage to the local environment. That is the purpose of Dr Cass's environmental legislation, which received the approval of the Parliament and which the Commonwealth is now obliged to see applied. To the extent that the Democrats' proposed amendment will seek to establish some principles in respect of that, the Australian Labor Party is prepared to accept it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity once again to enter a debate on road development funds and the allocation of those funds between the respective States. I say at the outset that the Government's move in establishing the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund should be commended by all Australians. It is further proof of this Government's recognition of the importance of road transport to the national and regional economies in a way that is both imaginitive and appropriate. It will form the basis of a significant contribution to Australia's bicentenary celebrations in 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the auspices of this Trust Fund an additional $2,500m in road development funds is expected to become available by 1988. Together with the road grants already set aside following the Government's announcement in June of 1980, totalling $3,650m in the five financial years ending 30 June 1985, the funds generated by this Trust Fund will contribute towards meeting the objectives which the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) outlined in the House of Representatives in his second reading speech on the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Bill. Foremost amongst these objectives is the completion of the national highway system, which is to be sealed and made virtually flood free by 1988. In my view, that in itself is a commendable task. </PARA>
<PARA> At 30 June this year some 11 per cent or 1,700 kilometres of Australia's national highway network of 16,100 kilometres remained unsealed. The unsealed sections, located primarily in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland , are frequently parts of major commercial and passenger links, such as between Port Hedland and Mount Newman in Western Australia and between Townsville and Rockhampton in Queensland. The upgrading of those roads to a dust free condition is therefore a major importance to the tourist industry as well as to the regional industries of the areas concerned. Many of Australia's sealed national highways also require upgrading and this requirement will be met as well by the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. It is a fact that Australia, perhaps more than any other developed nation, relies upon road transport. A total of 80 per cent of domestic freight is carried and nearly 90 per cent of passenger kilometres are travelled on the Australian road network, which in all stretches over 860,000 kilometres. In very many senses, they are the arteries of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, it is important to note that the Fund which this legislation establishes and the programs which will proceed from it cover not only national highways; specific urban and rural arterial road projects will be funded and, where the States choose, assistance will also be provided for urban public transport projects. Local authorities may also nominate for the inclusion of local roadworks in the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. It is, as I said earlier, an imaginative program which holds out the prospect of long- lasting benefits for Australia beyond the bicentennial year in which the surcharge by which the Fund raises money will be terminated. </PARA>
<PARA> The program very appropriately channels money raised by a levy on motor spirit, at the rate of 1c a litre from Budget night to 30 June next year, and then at the rate of 2c a litre thereafter until the scheme terminates, from the motorist to road development work throughout Australia. It will, as I understand it, provide employment for 8,000 persons directly in the road construction industry and will generate about 20,000 jobs, directly or indirectly, throughout the duration of the program. In that sense, this initiative is a significant contribution to the economy while it is under way and, of course, it will provide lasting benefits when the work is completed and the objects of the program have, by that time, been met. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, it is important to understand at this point that the funds that will become available through the program are no mere cosmetic gesture. In this financial year, the first year in which the Fund will operate and during which time it is really establishing itself, it will make about $180m available for roads. That, together with the $734m already committed under the Roads Grants Act, means that this year a total of $914m will be made available for roads in Australia. That represents an increase of about 33 per cent over the funds available in 1980-81. It is expected that in 1983-84 a total of $1,208m will be available from these two sources, or a further 32 per cent increase over the amount to be spent in this financial year. In the first two years of the program the amount spent on roads will have almost doubled. Even when allowance is made for inflation, it is clear that significant real increases have been made in this area. I would think that there would be little argument that this is warranted when the importance of the road system in Australia is taken into account, as it quite properly should be. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, as a senator from Western Australia, I must say that the same doubts about the outcome of this legislation arise as when the Road Grants Bill was debated in this place last May. Looking at the national road allocations this year, we find that Western Australia will receive 10.6 per cent of the road funds, yet that State contains 29 per cent of the national highway system. In terms of the increase in road funding for States over the previous financial year, we find that New South Wales will receive a 32 per cent increase-the same as Western Australia-while Queensland will receive a 34 per cent increase. In my view, that does not reflect the relative needs of those three States. With roughly one- third of Australia's land mass, Western Australia contains about 3 kilometres in 10 of its national highways, and yet it receives $1 in $10 of Commonwealth expenditure on national highways. </PARA>
<PARA> A joint Commonwealth task force indicates that it would take 44 years-in other words, to the year 2026-to bring national highways to what is defined as intermediate highway standards in Western Australia. For New South Wales to achieve the same result it is estimated that it would take 24 years, and for Queensland it would take 33 years. I made that point during the debate on the Road Grants Bill and I reiterate it today. In terms of funding for national highways under the road grants formula, Western Australia receives 10.49 per cent of the total allocation. I maintain that that is inadequate as a share of road funds, and I maintain that the 10.57 per cent of overall funds for national highway roads allocated to Western Australia remains inadequate to develop and maintain national highways in Western Australia at an acceptable standard. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore express the hope that those allocations, which are described as ' indicative statistics only' by the Department of Transport and Construction, and 'to be discussed with the relevant State governments', will be subject to substantial revision in due course. However, I must say that if the trend in the allocation of road funds over the last decade or more is continued, I do not hold out much hope that Western Australia will receive the consideration that it quite properly deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the total allocations which the States will receive, not only for national highways, which will account for 40 per cent of Australia's Bicentennial Road Development Program funds, but for arterial roads and for local roads as well, in 1982-83 we find that Western Australia's share is anticipated to be $112.3m. I might point out that I say 'anticipated' because, like the funds for national roads, the totals are subject to some discussion with the State governments. However, given that these figures are anticipated, honourable senators should note that a similar discrepancy arises in the case of Western Australia's allocation of its share of all roads in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Nearly 20 per cent of Australia's total public road network is in Western Australia, yet its total allocation from all sources-that is, from the Roads Grants Act allocations and from the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund-amounts to 12.3 per cent of all funds allocated. In 1983-84, when this legislation provides for a change in the proportions between national highways and other roads in the program, with national highways then taking 42 per cent of the total funds allocated from the program instead of the 40 per cent set down for this year, Western Australia's share does not change. For the next financial year it still gets 12.3 per cent of the available funds. Perhaps Western Australians ought to be grateful for that, because since 1968-69 every time there has been a change in the proportion of Commonwealth funds being allocated to that State, that change has invariably been for the worse. I have a table which illustrates this point and I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I think that the point is clear for those who care to read the penetrating observation which has been tabled. In 1968-69 Western Australia received 17.9 per cent of the Commonwealth road funds. By 1972-73 the proportion was 15.74 per cent. In this financial year it is expected to be 12.27 per cent, and for the next year it will be precisely the same. Yet once again New South Wales and Queensland, the two States which have already seen the largest share of funds for national highways, had the largest share of overall funds allocated also. What is more, I would expect this to be a matter of concern for senators from South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory to take up during this debate. These States will actually lose part of their share in the 1983-84 deliberations in order that the proportion of the overall funds allocated to New South Wales and Queensland can be increased. I can say only that when the final figures for these allocations are calculated in consultation with the State governments, I hope that it is not decided to reduce further the proportion which is earmarked for Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Western Australians are already aware that the proportion of Commonwealth funds made available to them is not sufficient, and that the proportion is far exceeded by that State's actual share of the overall road network, and they will accept not further reductions. When I last canvassed this subject during the Road Grants Bill debate I indicated that there were very good reasons why that was to be the case. Previous road developments, such as the beef roads program in the 1960s, were particularly important in opening up the north-west. A modest outlay of $40m opened up an industry in the region which was responsible for export sales in excess of $200m during that same period. Similarly, the more recent road programs provided access to the site of major mineral developments which have brought with them important new population centres, often in very isolated parts of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The costs associated with living in the north are naturally greater than in the more populous, more temperate southern regions of Australia. Earlier this year I indicated to the Senate that the cost, for instance, of building a three-bedroom house in Port Hedland suitable for Pilbara conditions was 78 per cent higher than in Perth. Many of the building materials and the internal fittings necessary must be transported from Perth or other major centres in the south and most of it is in fact carried by road. Food is also transported mainly by road. So it is essential that roads in the north of Western Australia be in the best possible condition to ensure not only regular reliable supplies in all weather but also prices that are as close as possible to capital city prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Figures recently provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that on average retail food prices are 21 per cent higher in the north of Western Australia than they are in Perth. They are 36 per cent higher in Kununurra, 31 per cent higher in Halls Creek and Wittenoom and 33 per cent higher in Marble Bar. One way to ensure that prices are kept down is by keeping the roads in the best possible condition. That in turn impinges on freight costs by reducing maintenance costs for transport operators, which improves the quality of life in these regions and may as a consequence improve such other areas as industrial relations and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, Western Australians have a just call for a greater share of Commonwealth road funds which meet the objectives of keeping roads at a standard sufficient to ensure that one of Australia's fastest developing regions can continue to expand. From the way in which the funds have been allocated over the past decade and from the indicative figures for allocation of funds from this program, there is reason to believe that Western Australia's allocation will continue to be insufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect there is another very important reason to ensure that roads in the north-west of Western Australia are kept in good condition-that is, the matter of defence. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Seventh Northern Australia Development Seminar held in Port Hedland this year the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Ray O'Connor, emphasised the need to ensure the defence of the north and of its vast mineral resources. The entire northern and western coastlines are possible threatened areas and road planning should take into account the supply requirements of Australian forces deployed to meet any perceived threat. For that reason a road network close to the coast must be maintained at the highest possible standard. However, for the same reason as such roads are necessary in an attack situation, they are also very vulnerable because of their proximity to the coast. For example, in a hypothetical attack on Darwin there would be two distinct supply routes-one to Adelaide and the other to the Sydney-Melborne industrial triangle via Mount Isa. On the other hand, the Pilbara does not have this advantage. It has only one road leading to Perth which at times is perilously close to the coast. Of course , in those circumstances road contact could be very easily broken. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of Australia's northern defence requirements consideration, in my view, should be given to an alternative road network to ensure flexibility in the deployment of forces, equipment and supplies in the event of an attack on this country. Consideration should be given also to hardening suitable strips of national highway so that in such an event they could be used as airstrips. In that way they would be subject to constant maintenace in the normal course of roadworks and would be immediately available in the event of any emergency. In that instance they could well have civil defence functions. In such events as flooding, which isolates parts of the north from normal road communications, such an innovation is useful also in peacetime. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally in this vein, it is clearly an important defence function of Australia' s road network that it be designed to specifications sufficient to cope with the bulk and weight of military road transportation and equipment. Such developments will contribute to a level of defence preparedness which is increasingly important in today's uncertain world situation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the principal question in considering the allocation of road funds is whether they are sufficient to meet the needs of each State. In the case of Western Australia, I submit that they are not. It is now time for the basis for the allocation of road funds to be reassessed. A system must be devised which more closely follows the extent of the road network in each State so that no one region is favoured or discriminated against in road fund allocations. If a particular State has 20 per cent of the country's roads, as does Western Australia, allocation should be made after consideration of the general condition of those roads, given of course the other impinging factors. The fact is that Western Australia has one of the largest strips of unsealed national highway in Australia. It has been estimated that it would take longer in Western Australia to bring highways to intermediate highway standard as defined than in any other State. Yet Western Australia's share of road funds over the past decade has been declining. These are anomalies which require urgent redress. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the Western Australian Government recognises that fact and has considerably increased its contribution towards road funds. In 1968-69 its contribution to roads was $13.19m or, to put it another way, about 43 per cent of the Commonwealth's contribution to Western Australia's road funding. In 1981- 82 the Western Australian Government set aside $78.7m for roads against $83.9m in Commonwealth grants. The Western Australian Government has therefore lifted its contribution to nearly 94 per cent of that of the Commonwealth Government. Over the period 1968 to 1982, while the Commonwealth has increased its funding for roads in dollar terms by 175 per cent, the State Government has increased its road spending from State revenue sources by nearly 500 per cent. In 1981-82 Western Australians paid $62.46 per head in State charges for roads-a commitment by the people of that State which not only improved their lifestyle but which, in my view, also contributed towards a generation of further export income for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australians clearly understand the importance of developing a road network in their State and they have acted accordingly. The State Government's commitment to the road network has been constantly increasing in real terms throughout the past decade. With respect, it is therefore incumbent on the Federal Government to recognise the importance to the national economy and to the regional economies of Western Australia of the road network and to adjust its financial commitment accordingly. The relative allocation between the States must be reassessed and redressed. If the condition of roads in Western Australia is not to suffer relative to other States, a new formula will have to be devised . </PARA>
<PARA> The matter which concerns me and which concerns all Western Australians is the level of funding received by Western Australia for its roads as compared with the total allocation to all the States. The Bill before us today does not allocate funding on a State by State basis. It simply provides a mechanism by which these funds are to be raised and distributed. As I said earlier, to that extent I believe it is a bold move, a wise move and one worthy of support in this chamber. Any initiative which increases the level of road funding is welcome and a program which will spend an estimated $2.5 billion by the end of 1988 is especially so. Without hesitation, therefore, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there is any matter that is ever brought before this place that indicates more the need for a States' House, as the Senate is, than does a Bill dealing with roads. One has only to look at the repeated speakers lists that come up whenever a roads grants Bill is debated, or whenever a report on roads is debated, to find the majority of speakers come from Western Australia, South Australia or Queensland. We are not facing a different circumstance today. Six of the seven speakers are from those three States-the three largest states in the Commonwealth and the three States which, as the previous speaker has already indicated, are the hardest done by when it comes to road funding. I do not very often find myself in agreement with Senator Crichton-Browne, but I am forced to endorse wholeheartedly his call for a different formula to apply to the disbursement of road funding and road grants in Australia. I have not bothered to check with the Minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), but I do not think it is possible to incorporate a map in Hansard, I really would not like to push the issue, but it is a pity that we cannot without causing Hansard a great deal of additional--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It is like trying to incorporate a three dimensional matrix or something. Anybody who sees the Australian Bicentennial Road Program national highways map would be aware of why senators such as Senator Crichton-Browne, Senator Bjelke-Petersen, Senator MacGibbon, Senator Jessop, Senator Colston and I are on our feet or are intending to be on our feet today to speak on the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Bill. A quick look at the work which remains to be done on Australia's national highway system indicates that the majority of that work is in South Australia and Western Australia with a lesser amount to be done in Queensland; nevertheless there is still substantially more work required there than in Victoria and New South Wales, the two states which tend to be most favoured when it comes to the allocation of funds vis-a-vis the extent of their road systems. So I say to Senator Crichton- Browne that South Australia is just as hard done by as Western Australia is when it comes to road funding allocations. This Bill goes some little way towards correcting this inequity, but as Senator Crichton-Browne indicated, it does not go far enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill in effect is to establish the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund from which an estimated $2.5 billion will be provided over the next six years to upgrade Australia's roads by 1988. This will be spent mainly on upgrading and sealing national highways, but a certain amount of it will also be allocated to local and arterial roads. I say that that is not before time. I have said before in this place that Australia's roads are a national disgrace, if not exactly a national liability. One thing is certain, and that is that they are not a national asset. One hopes that after the expenditure of this money, with the additional $3.65 billion which has been provided for the States under the Roads Grants Act 1981, our roads system will become more in tune with the needs and rights of the Australian people in all States, not just in Victoria and New South Wales. The two programs will together provide some $914m in 1982-83, rising to something in the vicinity of $1,208m in 1983-84 for all categories of roads. This money is sorely needed, partly because of the inequities in the disbursement of the funds over the years but also partly because it has been a habit of this Government to reject the recommendations of the Bureau of Transport Economics for funding; a fact that I have pointed out on previous occasions and which I do not intend to go into again today. I suppose we ought to be grateful that after withholding what I would consider to be basic funding entitlements to large parts of this country, the Government has at least grasped the 1988 nettle to make some sort of bicentennial roads razmataz. As I said, for that we ought to be duly grateful. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that, as Senator Gietzelt pointed out earlier, in order to do this the Government has imposed a levy on the one item in this country which affects the price of almost every other commodity and that is the price of petrol. Nevertheless, if that is the price we have to pay to get our road needs fulfilled, I suppose we have to grin and bear it. I cannot see much else being done at the moment. However, I sincerely hope that the Bicentennial Road Development Program does not simpy become an excuse for ribbon-cutting or some sort of self-congratulatory exercise in 1988, that in fact it does contribute substantially to the transport, movement, defence and safety needs of the people of Australia. I hope too that in particular it does something for those people in isolated rural areas and not just for those who are on tourist tracks, which is something which rates continual mention in the Bill. There is constant reference to tourist development. I ask the Government to pay just as much consideration to the needs of people in isolated rural areas whose contribution to the economy of this country is at least as great as that of tourists, either international or national. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, over recent years the Government has continually ignored the recommendations of the Bureau of Transport Economics and as a result a critical situation has developed; a fact which the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) admitted in his second reading speech when he noted that the level of this Government's funding of roads has not kept pace with increases in road construction costs. He particularly mentioned in his speech the road between Rockhampton and Townsville as being 'to put it mildly-totally inadequate '. That is something I would have to endorse, having recently travelled by car that part of the road from Townsville to Mackay and discovered the rather nervewracking experience of shattered edges, very narrow roads and these astonishing one-way bridges that one runs across, if not actually into, on this route. </PARA>

I am sure Senator Bjelke-Petersen will correct me if I get my directions wrong, but between Townsville and Mackay southbound traffic has right of way, but between Townsville and Cairns northbound traffic has right of way. When I was travelling that road I passed a number of Western Australian cars, campervans, trailers, caravans and so on and I just wondered who had initiated them into the local rules of whom they were or were not supposed to give way to. I trust the Government will pay some attention at least to getting the give-way signs all going the same way in Queensland; or is this a plot by the people north of Townsville to get a separate State?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that what it is? I certainly hope for the sake of the interstate visitors, as well as the locals, that indeed they are. There is no question, however, that the demands on the road system in Australia are increasing all the time. As I said in an earlier speech, despite increased fuel prices the amount of travel on metropolitan road networks in particular is expected to increase by a further 40 per cent by the year 2000; and that, I remind the Senate, is only 18 years ahead of us. As has already been mentioned today, Australia is highly dependent on an efficient road transport system for the movement of its people and its primary and manufactured products and for its defence as well as, of course, the safety of the people who are travelling on those roads. For a variety of reasons we have a scattered population in a very large country. Vast distances exist between large population centres and even vaster distances exist between small population centres and urban areas. We are extremely vulnerable when it comes to any sort of attack from outside, although I sometimes suspect that the attackers might get to our shores, take one look at our road system and go home again.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not think they would get very far. Certainly any very heavy armoured equipment would have to stay on the periphery of our country. The Australian Democrats believe that Australia is sorely in need of a national transport commission to co-ordinate all types of interstate transport in Australia and to promote a national transport system which makes efficient use of the resources that we have. We believe that we need substantially increased road transport planning and research allocations. We believe that it is essential to take a long term comprehensive view of these matters rather than the present piecemeal or ad hoc approach. The Democrats favour the allocation of increased funds from Federal sources to existing road construction authorities through a rolling five-year program which allows proper forward planning of works. We believe that more attention should be paid to the administration of national road safety programs. Finally, we believe that specific attention should be paid to the protection of wildlife and the environment generally with regard to road programs. It is this latter point, to which I will refer in a moment, that relates to the amendment that we intend to move to the Australian Labor Party's amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister said in his second reading speech that the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program will save lives. I sincerely hope that he is right. If it is one of the aims of the Program, I suggest that it would be wise to have as one criterion for funding programs that are suggested by local and State governments, an evaluation of the cost effectiveness of various measures for increasing safety rather than just blandly assuming that general upgrading, sealing and patching of roads will be an adequate safety measure in itself. I do not believe that that is the case. Certainly, the Director of the Road Accident Research Unit at the Adelaide University does not believe that that is the case. He believes that road safety involves not only sealing and maintaining roads but also improving roadside design and road design, which include measures such as making sure that in country areas there is distinct separation of lanes; that there are sufficient traffic signs not only in the countryside but also in the cities; that there is an increase of embankments, barriers and so on. All of these things need to be considered when projects are put forward for funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats support any increased funding for roads and commend the Government for the action that it is taking, although we believe that it is overdue. We are pleased to see that local government authorities will be encouraged to be involved, given that for the last few years at least they have been particularly hard pressed, with increased responsibilities for upgrading and maintaining their local roads, while their responsibilities to rate payers in other areas are having to take second place. We are pleased also to see that this is a labour intensive program in a period when unemployment is reaching record heights. I understand that it is estimated that 8,000 jobs will be directly involved in this program, with a toal of 20,000 jobs brought in on an indirect basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that we support the concept of the Bill and the basics behind this program, I refer to some specific concerns that have been raised, particularly with regard to the environmental and conservation aspects of road development in this country. I have received a letter from a Mr D. G. Hill, the Deputy Director of the Conservation Council of Western Australia. He raised a matter of concern to him and to other environmental groups with regard to the potential destruction of the environment by some road projects. He specifically mentioned two. The first is the proposed road through the Hamersley Range National Park which is to be funded by the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund . He is concerned that he has received information-I have no knowledge whether this is correct-that the 18 kilometre road through the park will be fenced on both sides. He acknowledged that this is necessary to stop off-road vehicles moving into the more vulnerable sections of the national park. But he questions the fact that there has apparently been no public environmental assessment on the road proposal. The first that anybody knew about it was apparently when legislation was introduced into State Parliament to excise the road reservation from the national park. </PARA>
<PARA> The second project that he mentioned is a new urban controlled access highway which, as he rightly pointed out, is only a freeway by another name, which has been approved by the Western Australian Government, despite the fact that it has been strongly and consistently opposed by residents and local government authorities in the area. This route passes through prime coastal lands, including the Bold Park and Wembley Golf Links. Although no Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust funds have yet been allocated, Mr Hill understands that the State Government is seeking such funding. The concerns that he raised about these two projects have been echoed by a number of other environmental and conservation groups which ask only that when projects are being assessed by the Commonwealth Government for funding, environmental and conservation aspects be taken into consideration. That is behind the amendment that the Democrats will move to the Australian Labor Party's amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> After paragraph (b) of the words proposed to be added,-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, to be added by the Australian Labor Party's amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>add:</PARA>
<PARA> '(c) is of the opinion that no grant should be made under the Bicentennial Road Development Program unless the proposed project</PARA>
<PARA> (i) is subject to the procedures under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 as if it were a Commonwealth project, and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) makes provision for appropriate rest areas and for the enhancement of the adjacent landscape by the planting of trees and other vegetation'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government is involved not only in a road funding and development program but also in a national tree program for the bicentenary. We are asking through this amendment to the second reading motion that the Government takes the opportunity of tying the two things together. It should tie its concern for environmental maintenance and development with its concern for the development of the road system in this country. It is an ideal opportunity to do both. If it ensures that some of the criteria used for determining whether a project will be given the go ahead under the roads program are a satisfactory environmental study and satisfactory awareness of potential damage to the environment, I believe it has a first class opportunity for achieving both its aims and achieving something very worth while for Australia as whole and for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy that the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Bill 1982 is finally being debated in the Senate. I congratulate the Government and the Minister for Transport and Construction, the Honourable Ralph Hunt, on the introduction of this Bill. I take the opportunity this afternoon to make some comments on it. I was in Mundubbera last Saturday and I met the Commissioner for Main Roads. He asked me when this Bill would be passed so that they could start to organise their schemes. I met the Under Treasurer of the Queensland Treasury Department at the Premiers Conference the other day and he asked me the same question; so once the Bill is passed the governments of the various States will have the opportunity to get their bicentennial roads schemes under way. Comparisons of Australia's road system with those of many other countries leave us wondering whether the other countries were wrong and over-invested in road networks, or whether they were right and Australia, with its relatively poor road networks, was wrong. I feel that not enough money has been allocated to roads in Australia over many years. One can certainly experience the consequences of that as one travels in western Queensland. Senator Haines seems to have had a few experiences while she was travelling up north in our beautiful State.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good answer. I think that could well be taken into account. I am glad to know, from my reading of the figures, that Queensland will have a share in the goodies when this bicentennial roads scheme goes through. It is not before time. Queensland is the most decentralised State in Australia. Its roads cover vast distances. For a long time Queensland has had roads which need improvement. On an overall look at Australia's roads needs, three factors should be kept in mind: Firstly, the Government must make decisions based on current knowledge and rational future predictions; secondly, it must see all transport modes as interacting parts of our overall communications system; and, thirdly, funds must be allocated in accordance with real needs. That, I feel, is what the Government is trying to do through this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe the Government has taken a considerable step forward in the right direction with the introduction of the Roads Grants Amendment Bill, in the first place, and the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Bill 1982, in the second place. Both of these will contribute towards making significant changes to the Australian road systems, in terms of not only additional revenue but also forward thinking policies. The aim of this Trust Fund is to receive moneys raised by a special surcharge on motor spirit and diesel fuel excise for the purpose of funding major road construction and urban public transport projects to significantly upgrade Australian roads by 1988-the bicentennial year . The only thing I regret, along with previous speakers in this debate, is that money has to be raised by imposing a tax on fuel. Fuel is used in large quantities by people who live in the outback and this charge will be very costly for them. But if the roads are improved through this program it will be of distinct advantage to them. </PARA>
<PARA> An estimated $2.5 billion will be provided over six years to upgrade Australia' s roads by 1988. Of course, this funding is in addition to and separate from the $3.65 billion provided to the States under the Roads Grants Act 1981. Together both programs will provide $914m in 1982-83, rising to $1,208m in 1983-84, for all categories of roads. This is the biggest single drive to boost road construction and improvement of roads ever mounted in this country. Its object is to fund national, arterial and local road projects of significance that will develop the Australian road network to a high standard. I feel confident that these two Government initiatives will help to alleviate some of the problems faced by Australian motorists and particularly the country dwellers who have had to cope with very bad roads for such a long period. It is hoped that this injection of funds will indirectly help to reduce our phenomenal road carnage- the single biggest killer of Australians each year. No doubt honourable senators are aware that most fatalities on the roads occur in country areas. I cannot help but blame the poor-in some cases, very bad-condition of roads in those areas for a large percentage of those fatalities. We can only hope-I certainly do-that better roads will reduce this senseless destruction of human life. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that most positive benefit, a number of other significant benefits will accrue from these schemes. Lives will be saved as a result of the improved safety of our roads. Communications between States and regional centres will be enhanced. Savings in vehicle and transport operating costs will result. Obviously, there will be savings in travelling time. Some honourable senators have referred to the fact that 8,000 jobs will be provided in the road construction industry alone. At least 20,000 jobs are expected to be provided in both direct and indirect employment throughout the Program's duration. The Government has acknowledged that the level of its funding for roads in recent years has not kept pace with increases in road construction costs. The Minister has indicated to me on several occasions that Queensland, of all the Australian States, is the most disadvantaged and underfunded State when it comes to road funds. </PARA>
<PARA> An assessment of the Australian road system by the Bureau of Transport Economics in its analysis of results stated that expenditure in Queensland represented two-thirds of the efficient allocation, with underallocations in all categories other than rural local roads. Expenditure on national highways in Queensland was one-third of the efficient allocation for this category. Expenditure on rural arterials in Queensland was half the efficient allocation. That represents the largest misallocation of expenditure of all the Australian States. Expenditure on rural local roads in all States was above the efficient allocation, except in Queensland where it was the lowest. It is very good to know that more funds will be spent on Queensland's roads. </PARA>
<PARA> However, total Commonwealth road funding in 1982-83 will amount to some $914m, which is an increase of $2,299m or 33 per cent when compared with road funds allocated in 1981-82. The special ABRD surcharge on motor spirit and diesel fuel excise is being phased in to allow State and Northern Territory road authorities time to gear up for the substantial increase in construction activity that will result. Queensland, for its part, will recieve a 35 per cent increase this year and an 81 per cent increase in 1983-84 compared with 1982-83 figures. This is a substantial increase and will provide the much needed funds for Queensland to develop its massive road network. I know, from personal discussions with the Queensland Minister for Main roads, the Honourable Russell Hinze, that he and the Queensland Government also are very pleased with the allocations and there now seems to be hope that much can be done to improve the 42,000 kilometres of roads which Queensland possesses. In Queensland the grant will be distributed according to a formula developed by the Main Roads Department in consultation with the local Governemnt Associations of Queensland and the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Construction. A total of 52.7 per cent or $17,786, 000 of the local roads grant will be distributed to councils for expenditure on roads under their control. The balance of the grant will be allocated to the Main Roads Department for roads under its control and for special works on local government controlled roads. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is any criticism of the initiatives in road funding which the Government has introduced-both last year and this year-I think it is the requirement that tenders be called for all construction work on national roads. According to my research, there is no evidence to suggest that this approach will result in more efficient and cost-effective construction. In fact, it appears that the disadvantages which may accrue from the proposal outweigh the advantages. I feel there are some disadvantages in this proposal. It is likely that there will be retrenchments of departmental and local authority employees. Parts of existing departmental and local authority employees. Parts of existing departmental plant fleet, could become redundant.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Australia we have enormous problems with road construction and road maintenance. Given the physical size of our nation and the decentralised nature of our population it is little wonder that we have these problems. Some States, of course, have greater difficulties than others. We have had speakers this afternoon from Western Australia and from South Australia who have outlined the problems in their States. Queensland, the State that I represent and the state that the previous speaker, Senator Bjelke- Petersen, represents, has a large area and is extremely decentralised. Our difficulties are immense. Some roads which should be regarded as major highways are nothing short of a disgrace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not make those comments lightly, nor do I make them with any political bias. The Minister in charge of main roads in Queensland, the Honourable Russ Hinze, would readily agree with my comment about some of Queensland's roads. He would probably use the opportunity while agreeing to say that the cause of Queensland's road problems lies at the feet of the Commonwealth Government. Whilst the fault is not necessarily all that of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth does have a significant role to play, if not in actual road building and maintenance, then at least in road funding in Australia. There is no reason why the Commonwealth should not play a role in road funding. If for no other reason than it has a responsibility for the nation's security-there are, of course, other reasons-then it should ensure that there is an effective road network throughout the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is nothing new for a national government to have a role to play in the construction of roads. During the time of the Roman Empire, for example, constant care and an enormous amount of effort were applied to construction and maintenance of roads. Whilst the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Bill 1982 which is under discussion allows for funds to be made for urban arterial roads, this would not have occurred in the Roman administration. Owners of buildings in Rome were responsible for the maintenence of roads which ran past their properties. This obligation was policed by a group of aediles- probably what we would call public works supervisors. In some respects, our urban dwellers find that not much has changed. When they purchase a building block on a new estate the cost for associated road construction is included in the price. The comparison with ancient road building practices probably does not end there, even though there are marked contrasts in the actual methods of construction. In rural areas the Romans recruited local labour and also employed soldiers on road building and the repair of existing roads. We do not, except in special circumstances, ask the Army to assist in road construction and maintenance. Our leaders however, still follow an ancient practice. Even though labourers and soldiers shouldered the arduous task of building roads, the Roman Emperors took all the credit. The result is that there are still many inscriptions in existence today extrolling the achievements of various Emperors. Similarly our highways are littered with signs which proudly advertise the source of funding for road construction projects. I doubt that these signs will have similar durability to the incriptions of the Roman era. </PARA>
<PARA> It is notable that the Bill being debated by the Senate actually specifies the erection of signs and the nature of those signs on bicentennial road construction projects as a condition to the granting of funds to the states, I doubt that this provision is included to give the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) some form of immortality. I suspect it is designed to guard against misrepresentation by State authorities and I envisage that it will be a provision that will be useful in Queensland when the Australian Labor Party wins the next Federal Election. I shall illustrate what I mean. Not far from where I live in Brisbane some roadwork is being carried out by a contractor to the Queensland Main Roads Department. Part of the project requires the construction of a bridge. The Queensland Government has erected a sign which reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>A Queensland Grant ProjectMain Roads Department</PARA>
<PARA>Western Arterial</PARA>
<PARA>Fig Tree Pocket Road InterchangeBridge</PARA>
<PARA>Construction Authority: Main Roads Department</PARA>
<PARA>Construction Cost: $1,150,000</PARA>
<PARA>Construction: Thiess Constructions P/L</PARA>
<PARA>What the sign does not reveal is that the Commonwealth this financial year will provide $51,397,000 to the Queensland Government for the construction of arterial roads. Whilst it is impossible to say with absolute certainty that the funds for this particular bridge are being paid out of this $51m, I strongly suspect that they are. Yet no mention of this is being made on the State Government's sign. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to argue that the Commonwealth Government should not be making a major assault on the substandard roads all too prevalent in Australia. Indeed, it is a simple matter to argue that this assault should have begun many years ago. In some respects it can be convincingly argued that road users should pay for road construction and maintenance, but that type of argument is far too simplistic. Even before the imposts of the August Budget were introduced Australian motorists were paying substantial taxes to State and Federal governments. State governments charge a wide variety of fees, many of which have risen considerably this year. Probably the most significant State government motor vehicle charge is registration-a charge that is borne by many people throughout the community. But after motorists have struggled with that charge of registration they are faced with taxes on the fuel that they use. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980-81 the crude oil levy and excise on petroleum products yielded $3,940m to the Federal Government. In 1981-82 this increased to $4,070m and the estimate for this financial year is $4,500m. Over this three-year period about $12,500m was received by the Federal Government from the oil levy and excise on petroleum products. How much of this has come back to the motorist by way of road funding? Over the three-year period I have just mentioned about 15 per cent came back- that is, $1,978m. I would not argue that all fuel taxes and levies should be applied in the transport area but I would argue that a return of 15 per cent is far too low. Surely additional taxes to finance the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program are not necessary. But there will be increased taxes. Before the Budget, 5.155c per litre excise was levied on petroleum products and on road diesel fuel. To allow the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program to proceed this excise was raised by 1c per litre to 6.155c. I am just getting to the very interesting part of my speech. Rather than go on, I will pause at this stage to allow other business to be dealt with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Banking Amendment Bill 1981, which was introduced into this chamber by Senator Haines, was referred by the chamber to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. On 19 May and 16 September of this year, on my motion, at the agreed request of the Committee of which I am chairman, the Senate resolved that the date for the presentation of the Committee's report be extended. It was necessary for the Committee to seek these extensions of time because submissions requested from a number of interested groups had not been received. In fact, the Committee is disappointed that the Housing Industry Association of Australia has still not forwarded a submission on the Bill, having been invited to make its submission on 17 February of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee received submissions from the Treasury, a number of interested banking organisations, the Association of Permanent Building Societies and the Australian Consumers Association. The opinion expressed in the submissions received was that the terms of the Bill had two basic flaws. The first was that the Bill, if enacted, could only control those interest rates charged by banks subject to the terms of the Banking Act 1959. The second was that the mechanism for control of interest rates on first home loans proposed by the Bill was inflexible and time-consuming and would have the probable effect of reducing funds available to the banks from depositors and, as a result, reduce funds available for home loans. The Committee has drawn attention to the effect of the operative parts of the Bill and the likely economic effects of its introduction. It has also noted the Government's housing policies introduced since the Bill was brought into the chamber. These policies were introduced in March and August of this year and were designed to assist first home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make it clear that the Committee had discussions with Senator Haines and was attracted to the aims of the legislation but it did not receive evidence which would enable it to report in any other way than it has reported. In summary, the Committee is attracted to the aims of the Bill and recognises the severe economic effect that rising interest rates have on people who are paying off their first home. However, the Committee believes that the Bill would not achieve those aims and should not be proceeded with for the reasons which are outlined in detail in its report, and it so recommends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want at this stage to make only a few comments on the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations on the Banking Amendment Bill 1981. I have not had the opportunity since the report was presented earlier today to study it in any depth, largely because of other business that I had to attend to in the chamber. Suffice it to say at this stage that I am not particularly surprised at the final recommendation of the Committee, notwithstanding the fact that it did mention, as Senator Peter Rae noted, that it was attracted to the aims of the Bill and that it recognises that rising interest rates have had a severe economic effect on people who are either paying off a loan or are seeking a loan to finance a first home. The question which was raised at the end of that comment was whether the Bill in effect provided acceptable or better machinery to control interest rates than the existing system. It argued that it did not. I would say, however, in defence of the legislation that surely just about any system would be able to provide better machinery to control interest rates than the existing system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It does not suprise me that Government members, whether they are members of the Committee or not, would be opposed to this legislation. The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) made the Government position very clear when she spoke on the Bill. After all, it does fly in the face of the recommendations of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and is quite against the principle of deregulation. It is deliberately intended to fly in the face of those two things, since we felt that an area as crucial as housing finance and the major factor which impinges on it-that is, interest rates-were something which required benevolent interference on the part of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I am more surprised and somewhat disappointed at the apparent acquiescence of the Opposition in this rebuff to the legislation since it stemmed initially from a public meeting that I attended in Adelaide at which I put this suggestion and had it heartily and publicly endorsed by the now Deputy Leader of the Labor Government in South Australia. Indeed, it was also endorsed at that meeting by the representative from the South Australian Consumers Association, apparently in contradiction to comments made by the Australian Consumers Association, which felt that the legislation would affect only part of the financial community in Australia. Indeed, this criticism was raised by the Committee itself on pages 8 and 9 of its report, and by a number of comments in submissions that I have had the opportunity to look at. In chapter 3, paragraph 4, of the report the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA> Evidence from the submissions received indicates that the effect on banks as lenders and borrowers could be marked. </PARA>
<PARA>It makes the point, which I think from memory I made during the second reading stage of the Bill, that the Banking Act 1959 regulates only those banks listed in the Act and its controls do not extend to State savings banks, finance companies, building societies and other non-banking financial intermediaries; in other words, that the legislation, if effected, would affect only part of the financial sector and hence the provisons of the Bill would not apply to more than 50 per cent of existing housing finance. Even leaving aside the fact that this is so, I would have thought that something which affected 50 per cent of existing housing finance was something to be approved of in the present financial conditions. Nevertheless the comment is, at least in part, irrelevant since it is easily remedied. If those sections of the Financial Corporations Act 1974 which have yet to be proclaimed were in fact proclaimed, this would then give the Commonwealth Government jurisdiction not only over the banks, with the exception of the State banks, but also over building societies and a variety of other financial organisations involved in lending money for purchase of homes. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not, either, have a great deal of sympathy for the banks' arguments that they will have their operations severely curtailed and that they will have curtailed also the flexibility and ability to fund their lending operations. It is a faily well-known fact that the banks are amongst the few businesses in this country which have had massive rises in profits over the last few years-I believe in excess of 30 per cent last year-so that for them to be crying poor at the moment is nothing more than a display of crocodile tears. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in marked contrast to the genuine crying poor which exists among people who would like to borrow money or who have already borrowed money and who are finding grave difficulty in meeting their mortgage repayments in view of the continued increase in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention of my Banking Amendment Bill was, as the Committee so correctly pointed out at the beginning of its report, to assist primarily those on lower incomes, although it would have had some effect on those on middle incomes. I was aware that it was breaking new ground in that it gave Parliament rather than the Reserve Bank of Australia the right to alter interest rates or to approve increases in interest rates. I was aware also of a number of other effects that the Committee has pointed out. However, I do not want to spend any longer discussing this since I have not had an opportunity to look in great detail at the comments made by those organisations which responded to the Committee's repeated calls, as I understand it, for submissions on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaving aside the fact that there may be a number of groups in this community as I understand there are a number of honourable senators in this chamber who believe that I have absolutely unmitigated effrontery to even have considered putting forward this legislation, I would have thought that there would be enough interest in its intentions, if not its ultimate effect, for more groups to submit their comments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch I mentioned that the 203rd report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, a progress report on medical fraud and overservicing, reached people in high places. The existence of fraud and overservicing by some doctors has been known since at least the first involvement of the Commonwealth in medical benefits in the 1950s. Computerised statistics were first collected in 1975. These led to a growing awareness of the size of the problem. The Committee has considered in detail the role and performance of the Department of Health and the adequacy of the Department's briefing of successive Ministers for Health. The report cannot cover all of the Committee's findings because the inquiries are still proceeding . The progress report, however, does emphasise a lack of performance on behalf of the Department of Health. In the progress report the Committee suggests extensive improvements in the present procedures. We believe the great flood of responses and information to the Committee reflects a widespread public concern. This publicity has helped the Committee to get a more accurate perspective of the whole problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The hearings have produced more than 4,000 pages of transcript so far. Even estimating the size of the problem proved to be difficult because of a lack of information and because of the Health Department's low level of activity in so many areas. The Australian Federal Police and the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office appeared to give, at times, low priority to some of the problems in this health area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Health estimates the level of fraud and overservicing by doctors to be at least $100m per annum. That is just under 10 per cent of the medical benefit expenditure. The Australian Medical Association accepts the figure of $100m. The figure does appear to be, on the face of it, somewhat conservative. Despite the size of the figure, very few doctors have been convicted. In fact, only 39 doctors out of about 17,000 who are in full time private practice were penalised for fraud in almost seven years. Only 12 were penalised for overservicing in the same period. These figures are an incredibly dramatic demonstration of the present shortfall in the investigative processes at a number of levels in a number of departments. In fact, one major problem is that no one body has complete authority. In fact, there is too much buck-passing and there are too many delays. Therefore it is very easy for those involved to pass on the blame or to leave the problem for another day. </PARA>
<PARA> Those involved include the Department of Health, the Australian Federal Police, the Deputy Crown Solicitor, State health authorities and the courts. But of all those the Department of Health must shoulder most of the responsibility. In fact , we have yet to take further evidence from most of the bodies mentioned. We believe that the Department of Health bears a great responsibility. In fact, at times its excuses were fairly flimsy. The Department of Health had a responsibility for overall implementation of health policy. It should have been well informed especially as the Director-General was also Chairman of the Health Insurance Commission from mid-1976 to November 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> The failings of the Department were numerous and will be outlined in detail in the report. I will mention just a few: The Department failed to monitor the activities or to give sufficient direction and guidelines to State officers; it lacked guidelines regarding fraud; investigators lacked training; the Department gave low priority for investigations which meant low funding and low staffing. These restrictions severely limited the success of the fraud and overservicing detection service. Long delays occurred between the different responsible bodies and there were unacceptable court delays. The Committee admits that defining ' overservicing' is a difficult problem. On the other hand, 'fraud' was quite easy to define. Overservicing involves certain value judgments and analyses of typical patterns. Not all doctors are deemed average as problems in the differences in the age of patients, location and specialisations all created problems in determining the extent of overservicing. But it is not an insurmountable problem. It is possible, with careful thought, to devise checks and more adequate programs as the Public Accounts Committee has been doing. </PARA>
<PARA> We admit that in some cases some doctors have proved their intelligence, their inventiveness and their ingenuity; some proved very devious. I cannot resist sharing a few of the anecdotes, apart from those concerning the usual, unsophisticated fraud such as claiming fees for social visits, lengthening the time of visits, and splitting operations and tests into multiple claims, for example, chest x-rays and x-rays of several different parts of the body. One or two of the memorable cases come to mind. A doctor doubled his fee by charging for 114 grafts when performing 57 hair transplants on the dubious grounds that the grafts were taken from one place on the body and replaced elsewhere. A doctor gave all members of his son's football team a medical checkup before they played and so received payment for 15 consultations for a number of games. A doctor paid a pensioner $20 to have his lawns cut and then asked the pensioner to sign an assignment form to enable him to receive a $22 consultation fee which was more than sufficient profit for pay also for the petrol to run the mower. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the many ways which in which the Public Accounts Committee recommends improvements include the integration of procedures. If the investigative section of the Department of Health and the Australian Federal Police worked as one, there would be a better performance. New roles must be created and additional resources provided. For example, we believe that a medical investigator should be appointed to investigate patterns of excessive services and to allow the tracing of overservicing. Because of past situations and the lack of action by the Department of Health, special short term remedies are now needed as a catch up. For example, we recommend that a special national task force be established to investigate the backlog. There is a need for a check on management processes and for streamlining to ensure that lines of responsibility are clarified much more clearly. I think there is a responsibility to make doctors' accounts more comprehensible so that lay people can understand and check them. There may be a case for accounts to be signed in a doctor's presence after a service has been provided. Medical benefits tribunals should be set up and severe penalties for offending doctors are recommended. The progress report contains much more detailed ways in which abuse can be reduced. In some ways medifraud is perhaps the best known variety of white collar crime. Perhaps we have been working on prototype procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to point out that the Committee will refer to other matters. As I have said, this is only a progress report. Other areas for investigation include patent fraud, fraud associated with hospitals, overservicing associated with the pescription of pharmaceuticals, fraud and overservicing associated with pathology-there is a great need for investigation in this area-unnecessary surgery, possible strengthening of legislation with respect to medical fraud-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief in my remarks. As a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I would like to point out to the honourable senators that this is an interim report which touches only the surface of the problem. The Committee dealt with 5,000 pages of submissions and evidence. We found that there is an incredible difference of opinion about what is overservicing and what is fraud. In some instances it is quite easy to say what is fraud. However, it is difficult to determine what is overservicing. The submissions and evidence given to the Committee show that it is impossible to say whether a doctor is guilty of overservicing. This is a grey area. I believe that the Committee has to give close attention to defining what is overservicing . We have to be able to determine whether overservicing has taken place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee came across a problem concerning new doctors. We were told that the 1,700 new doctors admitted each year in Australia are not told during their studies about the legal problems of overservicing and fraud or anything about ethics. One of the recommendations of the Committee is that medical schools and colleges should include in the last year of a course the subject of ethics and the problems associated with possible overservicing. It is a fact that counsellors are not able to contact all new graduates and as a result an increasing number of young doctors have no idea what overservicing is. Therefore , I feel it is absolutely necessary for universities and colleges to ensure that new graduates know exactly the pitfalls before they enter a medical practice. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also point out that the Department of Health estimates show that approximately 2,000 doctors are overservicing or commit fraud. I admit that 2, 000 seems quite a lot. However, there are 17,000 general practitioners practising in Australia and on that basis 2,000 represents merely 11 per cent. I do not intend to cover up for or try to shield doctors who commit fraud. However , I would like to point out that the number of cases of fraud which has been detected and punished is very small. Therefore, it would be absolutely improper for anyone to consider that all doctors are cheats. This is not the fact. As in any profession, there are people who are not ethical in the way in which they practice. Therefore, I feel that honourable senators should study the interim report. They should take the report as such-it is an interim report which has touched only the surface. The Public Accounts Committee has made recommendations to the Government on how to deal with and improve the detection of fraud. I intend to say only these few words because I feel it is important that the public and honourable senators realise the value of the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take a minute or two of the Senate's time to speak to the report on pesticides and the health of Vietnam veterans. I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and Environment that prepared the report. I think this was one of the most difficult reports to compile of any report compiled by a Senate Committee. I have nothing but praise for the Committee members who served with me, for the Committee advisers, for the secretarial staff and particularly for the witnesses, some of whom gave evidence on more than one occasion. The Committee considered a mountain of evidence. There are very genuine difficulties collecting and in interpreting the evidence that was presented to us, as illustrated by the paper presented this afternoon in the other place by the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) which referred to a whole new swag of records that have turned up in the Australian War Museum. The Committee will look at them as an extra task. However, nothing in the Minister's statement this afternoon conflicts with any of the recommendations in the Committee's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To return to the difficulties of interpretation, the collection of data was extraordinarily difficult in our effort to find out actually what happened. The second part of the inquiry, which dealt with medical effects, involved a most complex subject. We are not dealing here with an acute condition such as toxicity, in which there is a direct cause and effect relationship, but rather with a delayed or chronic medical condition. We are not looking for a specific pathology. We must look at the whole range of human biological and neurological response. Again, the time relationship, as between cause and effect, is variable . Presumably, it could vary from soldier to soldier or from serviceman to serviceman in an unpredictable way. As I have said, we did not know the initial dose rates and there is no way now, many years after the event, that that can be established. </PARA>
<PARA> An aspect that does create a problem was that the chemicals used in Vietnam were and are also used in Australia, in agricultural applications in particular. We have the problem of isolating any war-related cause for a present health condition from any background or environmental exposure that may well have occurred when the soldier was a youth. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these things are very hard to quantify. This is of course an epidemiological study and such studies are a science in themselves. Epidemiology has developed considerably over the last 30 or 40 years. One is usually looking not for a dramatic cause and effect relationship but rather for low grade effects which produce results over large populations and over a lengthy period. But it is a science and I regret that the public at large does not understand the degree of sophistication involved in epidemiological studies. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other problems with which we had to cope in preparing the report was the negative philosophy adopted by some. Many people have very genuine concerns. I do not set them aside lightly or irresponsibly, but one of the attitudes of mind with which we had to cope was the attitude: 'You cannot prove that such and such was safe, therefore it must be unsafe'. It is very hard to cope with such a point of view. The chemicals with which we are dealing here, agent orange a mixture of 2, 4, 5-T and 2, 4-D-have been used in Australia for almost 40 years. In some agricultural applications very high dose or application rates have been used. Given the nature of the farming community which uses them, they have been used frequently in less than ideal conditions and certainly not in accordance with directions or with more than minimal safety precautions. In addition to use by farming communities they may be used as was DDT, in urban areas, in backyards , on lawns and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the question of the difficulty of making a large-scale epidemiological study and the ignorance of the community at large, which does not appreciate the complexity of running such a study and relating cause and effect. Unless one is involved in the health professions one does not realise the number of people who become sick at any one time. The other thing that one does not realise is that with any pathological condition-a good example is provided by leukemia-one has clustering. One may find three of four people in a particular street who develop monocytic leukemia or something of the sort at the same time. Then everyone races round and says that it is an infectious condition , but if one looks at it over a 10 or 15 year span, and over a large population of several hundred thousand, one realises that some degree of clustering occurs frequently as a natural aberration. </PARA>
<PARA> I have every sympathy for Vietnam veterans when they talk about the rates of carcinoma or suicide amongst their friends. However, that must be measured against the statistical averages for the community. Most of the veterans are now in the 30-39 year age group and, as the report states, of 100,000 males in that group 41 will die of malignant disease and 44 will commit suicide. Certainly, no evidence was advanced to the Committee that the incidence of either malignancies or suicides were higher in Vietnam veterans than in the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> The most worrying aspect with which we had to deal was that of birth defects. The Committee comes out quite strongly with the opinion that in this direction there is nothing to fear. Birth defects are an enormously emotional subject. They affect all of us as males and affect every female. It really is a frightening subject, but there is no possible way of showing that exposure to herbicides could have affected the incidence of birth defects in Vietnam veterans. That is explained quite clearly in the report and I will not take the time of the Senate to repeat it. Basically it is because the defects would have had to come throught the male line and the time delay is of such length that, from a biological point of view, such a result would not have been possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The worry about birth defects leads us to what is probably the most important concern that we have about the veterans. I refer to their morbidity, to the way in which they worry about conditions which might or might not be related to their war service. All of us have an enormous sympathy for those who served because to them such worries are very real. The community, through the Parliament and the repatriation service, should do everything that it can to assuage those worries. </PARA>
<PARA> The report offers at page 14 a list of recommendations, basically on the need for the constant surveillance of the veterans, on the need for immediate care where required and, specifically, in relation to possible delayed neurological damage and matters of that nature. The Committee requested the Government to respond by the end of March 1983, and I am sure that it will take up that request because, in dealing with this problem, speed is of the essence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Committee that was involved in this very difficult, lengthy and quite complex investigation, I wish in a few words to put my point of view and that of the Australian Democrats. We see the report very much as an interim report which expects a great deal from the Government over the next few months. Having heard the evidence submitted over a period it seems to me that the greatest inadequacy of all, in what I believe is the undoubted cause of the Vietnam veterans is a lack of information. Time and again we found that when expert witnesses came before us, especially from the medical research field, one set would say one thing and another would say almost the opposite. When we pressed the matter we found that, often as not, the differences were attributed to a lack of information, a lack of research and a lack of statistics and figures in that particular area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is for that reason that I feel, as I am sure the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment did unanimously, that there is good reason to lay on the Government at this stage an obligation, in a rather unusual way, to produce within a period of three months some of this further information that will help unravel this very tangled and difficult story concerning the question of morbidity, the causes of disease among Vietnam veterans, the question of mortality and causes thereof, an accurate comparison between birth abnormalities among veterans' children and those of the community at large. These very important aspects have yet to be established and I believe that in the cause of the Vietnam veterans, in the cause of common justice and in the cause of veterans' peace of mind they must be established permanently and finally. Until they are and the real truth behind the matter is revealed and action taken along the lines suggested by the facts, the matter will never be laid at rest. It will continue to be one which concerns and worries the conscience of Australian people almost universally, and certainly my own. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need, then, for more information. Perhaps we will need to take another look at the total effect of the veritable cocktail of poisonous chemicals to which these young people in Vietnam were exposed. One of the most interesting things about the inquiry was that it ranged away from the original look at agent orange, a plant destroying material, to pesticides and insecticides. Evidence was given that regularly soldiers in the Nui Dat camp in Vietnam, wearing nothing more than a pair of shorts in that hot climate, were exposed to the direct blast of a chemical fogging machine as often as once a week. That blast would contain a cocktail of such delectable items as dieldrin, lindane, malathion, chlordane and a number of other dangerous substances. I cannot believe that those men were not affected one way or another by that. The real problem now is to determine the extent to which they were affected and in what ways they were affected, and to try to take some course of action based on that. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the feelings of people and the apparent sense of urgency to have another inquiry held, I feel strongly that another inquiry should not be held right now. If a royal commission were held now it would tend to come up with the same results as our Committee has done, for sheer want of information. When further information is available there may well prove to be good reason for a further inquiry based on that information. That is quite likely. I spoke to a meeting of 200 Vietnam veterans at Randwick in Sydney last Sunday. They are still unhappy. They feel that the Committee's report is a whitewash. I might say that many of them had not read it thoroughly and some of the points I was able to put to them corrected some of their views. I hope they justify the point of view I am putting now. However, I make it quite clear, as a member of the Committee, that it should be understood that this is an interim report. The very important obligation of getting something done quickly and finding out about these things has been laid on the Government. I shall be looking for a response in March. If it does not come up, or if it is unsatisfactory, I will be among the first to support the Vietnam veterans' call for a further inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take only a minute of the Senate's time in relation to the report of the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. I was not on the Committee but I read the report with great interest. It seems to me that in terms of evidence to be obtained the report does take us a fair way down the track. The report shows that the Committee members spent an enormous amount of time sifting the evidence and attempting to come to some reasonable conclusions from the evidence presented to them. Again the Senate committee system has been shown to be a very useful device in furthering the cause of providing information to Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That said, I am unhappy with a number of the conclusions. I believe that, for example, the conclusion that it is unlikely that the majority of Australian troops were directly exposed to herbicides does not seem to be a reasonable conclusion given the evidence contained in the Hansard record and in the report itself. I believe that a conclusion which said simply that the Committee could not determine the degree of soldiers' direct exposure may have been a more correct conclusion to draw from the public evidence available. However, the point that Senator Mason just made is important. It is certainly one that most people who have been involved with this matter are also concerned about. The recommendation in the Committee's report that more detailed evidence is required in the areas delineated by the Committee as needing immediate investigation, with an endeavour to come forward with the types of statistics that obviously are necessary, ought to be taken up and pursued vigorously. Once one has read the report one is struck, as Senator Mason has already said, by the enormity of what we do not know about this matter. That, in a sense, is also an extremely useful result of this Committee's report. Having reviewed all that it was able to find out, it could point time and again to loopholes in our understanding of this extremely important area. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in that sense the Committee's report ought to be applauded by Vietnam veterans as being a further step in taking their cause down the road to ultimate solution. Of course it is not a solution for the difficulties that veterans and their families have but the community itself should accept that they and their families have suffered grievously in the service of their country and that the country has an abiding obligation to support them in the difficulties that they have had since returning from Vietnam. Once again I commend the Committee's report. Although I cannot say that I agree with everything in the report, it does make an extremely useful contribution to the debate and to our understanding of this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -When the debate on this matter was interrupted I had just been granted permission to table a chart which proved that at the moment Tasmania has the cheapest power in Australia. I go on to the cost of the power schemes. The Select Committee on South West Tasmania has suggested that there be a three-year moratorium before we start building the dam . The dam will take 10 years to build and by the year 1990 the estimates of the Tasmanian Government for the cost of the project are certainly different from those put forward in the Committee's report. It has been indicated that the cost of the dam, in 1982 prices, will be $453m. There have been various quotations, all without foundation. That is the correct figure in 1982 prices. In the past, Tasmania has built and paid for much larger schemes so the great fear about what it will cost the community and how long Tasmanians will be paying off this dam must be seen in its true perspective. We must also take into account that almost the total amount spent on building the dam will stay in Tasmania. That includes the amount spent on labour and construction materials. It will stay in Tasmania and will create additional employment in that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The quotations as to costs by various groups vary considerably. The Committee decided that it could not come to an accurate assessment of the various alternative energy sources. Some academics with conservation persuasions say that the Hydro-Electric Commission costings were not accurate. However, every assessment made by independent professional consulting engineers confirmed the general correctness of the HEC's costings. Perhaps I may list those, because they have been done time and again: Sir Alexander Gibbs and Partners, in association with Merz and McClelland, a report dated September 1979; Cameron, Preece International, consulting engineers, a report dated March 1982; the Ziedler Committee of Inquiry into Electricity Generating and the Sharing of Power Resources in South-east Australia, report, 1981. The McLachlan Group report on Supply to the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania also reported in 1982 that its estimate for the year 2000 was well within the HEC's estimates. So we have no disagreement in this area. I am sure that Senator Coates would agree that that is so. </PARA>

But the Committee did not mention that Dr Kellow had omitted the cost of 33 million tonnes of coal, quite a considerable omission , from his costings on the thermal program. I should like to ask anyone following me in this debate why that question was not asked, and why 33 million tonnes of coal were not costed. Surely that is a considerable cost. Dr Kellow happened to omit that vital statistic. There were quite a number of other areas in which Dr Kellow was wrong, but I shall not go into them now.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the importance of the work of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania was that it did not approach the matter from the usual tack of assessing the importance of the national heritage and then looking at what effect the proposed Gordon-below-Franklin dam would have in relation to that heritage but, rather, that it looked at the importance of the dam and the hydro project on the Gordon from the point of view of its impact upon economy of Tasmania. We did that by looking at the existing supply system, the anticipated demand to the year 2000, and then looking at the economic viability of alternatives to meet any shortfall. In looking at the existing system, we found it to be almost entirely hydro based. Historically, it appears to have served Tasmania well. But the scene is changing. One sizable hydro scheme remains-either the integrated or separate development of the Gordon , Franklin and King region. After that, only a limited number of small options exist. Even the Hydro Electric Commission, in the longer term, accepts that it will have to look to alternative sources of power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This seems to be often forgotten. We are looking at the last of the major hydro schemes. Whether Tasmania likes it or not, in the long term it will have to move to some other form of power production. In looking at future demand, the Committee accepted the advice of its consultants. The key to the advice which was received was flexibility. But there is considerable uncertainty as to the future requirements of power, and the system must be sufficiently flexible to meet the highest demand whilst at the same time recognising that under utilisation of a highly capital-intensive scheme is economically undesirable. Someone must pay that cost. </PARA>
<PARA> The demand band settled upon is wide, and the further ahead it projects, the wider it becomes. But a most important point is that it would be very difficult to argue that it is restrictive of future industrial development. It is a forecast that takes account of the most optimistic but yet realistic level of industrial growth. In comparing that forecast with the current supply, taking into account completion of the Pieman scheme, it was obvious from the point of view of power availability that there is no need to commence a major option for at least the next three years. The major options are the Franklin-Gordon-King hydro interconnection with Victoria, or a coal-fired thermal plant. But furthermore, it is economically unsound to do so if one accepts that the demand projections call for flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> However to be within the highest and most optimistic projection of the demand band, it would be prudent to commence the development of small schemes, small hydros in non-contentious areas-the HEC has already done considerable work on this option-or small wood-powered thermal plants. Delay in commmencing a major option would allow a more detailed evaluation of the two non-hydro options- interconnection, and coal-powered thermal. The importance of this is the advice of our consultants that on economic grounds alone-I stress that it is on economic grounds alone-at least interconnection may be competitive with the Gordon-below-Franklin hydro-scheme. It depends on the methodology used for economic comparison-anticipated utilisation, the cost of Victorian power, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> We would not promote our consultants' view as being beyond dispute. Rather, it is a view of independent experts. But I believe that it changes the whole parameters of the debate. In certain demand scenarious, hydro may not be cheaper . Therefore, there are good economic reasons to delay construction of the dam irrespective of the environmental debate. The Tasmanian Government is clearly determined to move Tasmania back into an industrial growth pattern. For that it is to be commended. The unemployment position, though largely inherited, is intolerable. But unfortunately the dam is being promoted as the answer to Tasmania's economic woes, and that simply is not so. Very rarely are there simple answers to complicated problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The days of hydro industrialisation are past. No longer will new industries be established utilising ore from as far away as the Northern Territory and Queensland simply because of the availability of cheap power. They have been overtaken by the relativities of transport and other costs. The emphasis for the future must be in the development of resources indigenous to Tasmania but with further downstream and value-added processing, expansion of the tertiary sector, and so on.That is not just my opinion; it is the view of the Department of Industrial Development in Tasmania. The demand will be for power at a price competitive with that of the mainland. Certainly that will be available provided Tasmania moves to an averaging system of pricing. It will be available from either interconnection or from coal-fired power stations. In mentioning the latter, I must say that there is potential for a new industry. Knowledge of Tasmanian coal resources has developed greatly over the past three years. Another three years could indicate whether such an industry could be economically established. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. Senator Missen corrects me. Of course, the Bill came into the Senate first and was then referred to the Committee. The Committee considered it before the debate commenced and reported to the Senate, in accordance with its principles, before the debate commenced. I should like to read to the Senate from the report of the Committee. The quotes are very short, but I think it is important that they be placed before the Senate so that we know where we stand as we go into debate. First of all, in paragraph 5, the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact I will divert there for a moment to say that when the Senate last debated this Bill, Senator Chipp did not say that that was not the purpose of the Bill but he made some statement along the lines that everyone knows what the purpose of the Bill is. According to him, the purpose is to stop somebody in Tasmania from doing something which apparently that somebody is currently doing. So in fact Senator Chipp, who is the leader of Senator Mason's party, apparently says that the purpose of the Bill is different from the purpose described in the Bill. It is important to note that. Of course, if Senator Chipp and Senator Mason had wanted to introduce a Bill which prevented somebody in Tasmania from taking a particular action, I see no reason why they could not have introduced a Bill which was specifically directed to that purpose. Then not only would we have all been clear but also the rights of other people-small people in Tasmania -might not have been overriden by this general shotgun Bill which endeavours very roughly and rudely to prevent all action being taken in this area of Tasmania. The report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills further states:</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 6-Protection of Properties This clause makes it unlawful for a person to ''do any act or take any action that is likely adversely to affect'' the general conservation of a property listed or nominated for listing, under Article 11 of the World Heritage Convention. The clause provides very little indentification of the scope of unlawful actions with which the Bill would deal. </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to me to be a very serious criticism of the Bill by the Committee. The report of the Committee further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is concerned that in the absence of any list of specific offences , persons may not be able to arrange with any certainty those of their affairs that relate to the use of nominated or listed properties. </PARA>
<PARA>The report is very brief in that last sentence but very significant in pointing out the imposition that this Bill places on the people of Tasmania-not just on the one body to which apparently Senator Mason and Senator Chipp wished to direct their attention, but generally on persons being unable to arrange with any certainty their affairs in relation to the use of nominated or listed properties. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 7 provides that any person may seek a court declaration that a certain action is in breach of the Act and a court may order to remedy or restrain the breach. Court action might be taken against a person who had no intention of damaging a property, whose actions however might be regarded as likely adversely to affect the protection, conservation, presentation or rehabilitation of a property. </PARA>
<PARA>How significant is that criticism by the Committee. Of course, people going into this area, moving on to these properties, may very well take actions. In fact the mere walking across properties clearly damages the environment of the property and some person may inadvertently stand on some area which is significant and do damage to it. Some person may accidentally light a fire in the area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Martyr is very keen on talking about chip fires. I can assure Senator Martyr that I have not seen a chip fire heater anyway in 30 years and I do not see one in this chamber, that is for sure. But it is clearly one of the unfortunate consequences of our Australian bush that people light fires, perhaps deliberately, but then accidentally allow them to get out of control. Frequently, the result of that is very serious damage to the environment. It is one of the problems that our nation and our environment have to put up with no matter what governments endeavour to do. The report further states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the doing of an act can include the failure to do an act, the declining by an owner to take, for example, steps to preserve or restore a property, area or building may fall within the prescribed conduct. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that there the Committee is reporting on the significance of some owner failing to do something as a result of which the area falls into the problems created by this Bill. Then the owner might find himself unfortunately at risk. The report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of any clear guidelines in the Bill as to the precise scope of the prscribed actions referred to in clause 6, the Committee draws this clause to the attention of the Senate under principle 1 (a) (i) in that it might be regarded as trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that it is very much the people in this place who always claim that they stand for civil liberties, who want to stand up and be heard when the matter of civil liberties is being raised, who are supporting this measure and who are totally ignoring the report of the Committee that this clause might be regarded as trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties. They want to ride roughshod across the rights and liberties of the people of Tasmania; they want to ride roughshod across the constitutional responsibilities of the Government of Tasmania; they want to have their will and they will leave no stone unturned until such time as they have had their will. Indeed, that is the very reason I am on my feet today. As I mentioned in an earlier debate today; I am on my feet because when this matter was last before the Senate these so- called protectors of civil rights and liberties were in fact shouting down a fellow senator, Senator Walters, because she was putting a view to the Senate which was different from theirs. They were howling her down and using every device within the Standing Orders to prevent her being heard on the subject. That is what attracted me to this debate and that is the reason I am on my feet today. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills having brought this matter to the attention of the Senate and after the second reading debate on the Bill, it was up to the independent senator for Tasmania, Senator Harradine, to bring this matter properly before the Senate by a motion which he put, and which I will now read so that the debate is understandable by all those who are endeavouring to follow what is happening here today. The motion put by Senator Harradine is:</PARA>
<PARA> Pursuant to Standing Order 196A I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill 1982 be referred to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report . . . </PARA>

<PARA> (1) inadequacies and ambiguities identified in the Seventeenth Report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills;</PARA>
<PARA>I think I have covered that adequately so that people know what we are talking about. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the desirability or otherwise of a limitation being placed on the standing and class of persons who may bring proceedings;</PARA>
<PARA>That is a matter which Senator Harradine drew to the attention of the Senate when the debate was taking place as being a matter of grave concern. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the nature of the offence and likely penalty arising from a breach of the order of the Court; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) whether it would be appropriate for the Commonwealth to invoke the foreign affairs power of section 51 (xxix) of the Constitution to legislate in the manner proposed by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>It is that last matter to which I wish to direct the attention of the Senate because I believe that the most significant matter raised by this whole debate and the bringing into the Senate of this Bill is this section 51 (xxix) of the Constitution and the decision in the so-called Koowarta case. That decision raises matters that the Senate should apply its mind to in great detail. I propose to spend some considerable time looking at that matter. That so-called Koowarta case in fact is the case of Koowarta v. Bjelke-Petersen and others and the State of Queensland v. the Commonwealth of Australia. It is reported at page 625, Volume 56, 1982 Australian Law Journal. To summarise the case, it was about the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and its validity, and as to that particular aspect of it I do not think I need to say any more. The particularity of the case was not necessarily relevant but the constitutional aspects of it are of grave importance to the Senate. I will read firstly from the headnote which people would know is a summary of the actual decision but is not in the words of the judges and therefore is not binding as such. It is purely and simply a summary for people to read quickly although, of course, frequently such summaries run to many pages. It was a majority decision held by Mr Justices Stephen, Mason, Murphy and Brennan with the Chief Justice, Sir Harry Gibbs and Mr Justices Aickin and Wilson dissenting that sections 9 and 12 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 were laws with respect to external affairs within the meaning of section 51 (xxix) of the Commonwealth Constitution and they were accordingly intra vires and valid. There was a demurrer in the case and they held that the demurrer by the defendants in this action should be overruled and the action of the State of Queensland dismissed. The headnote endeavours to give a very brief summary of the reasons and it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Per Stephen J.-''External affairs'' in s. 51 (xxix) refers to such of the public business of the national government as relates to other nations or other things or circumstances outside Australia. A subject-matter of international concern necessarily possesses the capacity to affect a country's relation with other nations. It is not enough that a challenged law gives effect to treaty obligations, and it is not necessarily excluded from international affairs because it is not the subject of a treaty to which Australia is a party. </PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph contains the summary of the reasons of Mr Justice Mason and Mr Justice Brennan. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> A treaty is an external affair or a matter of external affairs, subject only to its not having been entered into solely for the purpose of attracting Commonwealth legislative power. But a treaty is not an essential prerequisite. Thus a matter of external concern to Australia having become a topic of international debate and negotiation, or a subject which affects or is likely to affect Australia's relations with other international persons constitutes an external affair. </PARA>
<PARA>The next summary is that of His Honour Mr Justice Murphy. Notwithstanding that he was once the Leader of the Australian Labor Party in the Senate, I am prepared to read into the Hansard his apparent reasons. The summary states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is an external affair wherever Australia is involved with any entity, circumstance or event outside Australia (whether or not this involves any affair in Australia). Any purported treaty or agreement between an Australian State and a foreign country is a nullity. </PARA>
<PARA>Those were the reasons given by the four judges of the High Court who upheld the Commonwealth power in this matter. Honourable senators will see from those summaries, and certainly from a reading of their judgments, that it is clear that their desire is to expand the powers of the Commonwealth whenever that possibility arises. They talk about the Commonwealth Constitution having to be read broadly. It would seem to me from their judgments that they would read into the Commonwealth Constitution an ability to exercise the power whenever they possibly could, unless for some reason or other they saw it to be specifically excluded. In many ways, especially with regard to what Mr Justice Murphy said, it seems to me that the Commonwealth could enter into any sort of external agreement and then exercise its powers and pass legislation, no matter how restrictive, on a State of Australia. I turn to what is, to my mind, the most significant judgment; that is, the minority report; the judgment of the dissenting judges, of which there were three. What they had to say is summarised clearly in just a few lines. The Chief Justice, Sir Harry Gibbs, Mr Justice Aickin and Mr Justice Wilson, in their dissenting judgments, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A law which gives effect within Australia to an international agreement will only be valid under s. 51 (xxix) if it is with respect to a matter which itself can be described as an external affair. Any subject may constitute an external affair if the manner in which it is treated in some way involves a relationship with other countries or with persons or things outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I put to the Senate that that is a very generous interpretation of section 51 ( xxix) which any Commonwealth government would be able to implement but, at the same time, it is fair and reasonable for the State governments in this nation. The judgment of the Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs states:</PARA>
<PARA> What however remains unclear is the extent to which the federal nature of the Constitution requires that limits be imposed upon the broad power to implement international obligations seemingly conferred by par. (29), thus ensuring that exercise of that power will not destory the federal character of the polity. </PARA>
<PARA> Suggestions that there are some such limits to the power recur in the cases, although their precise nature is not very clearly defined. In Burgess Starke J. suggests at p. 658 that the external affair may have to be ''of sufficient international significance to make it a legitimate subject for international co- operation and agreement'', citing United States writings for that proposition. Dixon J.,-</PARA>
<PARA>The famous Mr Justice Dixon, later Chief Justice Dixon-</PARA>
<PARA>at p. 669, would apparently confine the power to the implementing of treaties which relate to ''some matter indisputably international in character''. </PARA>
<PARA>Who in this chamber could disagree with those words in relation to the powers of the Commonwealth Constitution given to this Commonwealth Government by our founding fathers? Who could disagree with that sort of interpretation in relation to those powers as they should exist, not only for the remainder of this century but also into the next century? They are certainly broad enough for any Commonwealth government to exercise those powers which it might properly exercise. At the same time, we do not have a unitary system of government; we have a federation. A federation involves the recognition of the validity of the existence of State governments and their rights to operate in their own sphere without interference from the Federal government. I see that my time has just about expired. I want to discuss a number of other things in the Senate in relation to this legal matter. I believe I will have an opportunity later during the Committee stage of this Bill. I will then resume at the point at which I now finish. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Harradine's motion to refer the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs because it seems to me the only way we can get out of the mess that we are in with this totally inadequately drafted Bill. Furthermore, it accords with the practice of the Australian Democrats. I nearly said the policies of the Democrats, but it occurred to me instantly that the Democrats never have any policies; so I use the word ' practice' for what they intend to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill contains so many inadequacies that the longer we look at it and the longer it is debated the more that surfaces. It is just falling to bits before our eyes. If Senator Mason feels that something can be salvaged from it, I invite him to withdraw the Bill and redraft it. If he does so, I am sure I could prevail upon Senator Harradine to withdraw his motion to refer it to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee. If it were referred to that Committee at least we could obtain a balanced view on the most important issue, which regrettably Senator Lewis, in an excellent speech, did not have time to touch upon-that is, the matter of States' rights and the fact that we are a federation of Australian States. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not prepared to accept the proposition that is put to us that the States have no rights, that they are an anachronism, and the other statements that have been flying around this chamber in relation to this Bill. They are the views of people who come from Victoria and New South Wales. We can expect that sort of big brother view from them. They think that everything turns in the great conurbations of Sydney and Melbourne. But I have news for them. Australia is different from that. It is growing and the formerly great areas of Sydney in New South Wales and Melbourne in Victoria are not the places where Australia's history will be written during the coming decades. In particular, now that we have Labor governments-socialist governments-in both New South Wales and Victoria, we will see Brisbane develop as the financial capital of Australia to exploit the great resources, both human and physical, in Queensland. If Australia is to benefit from what Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania have to offer, we cannot be tied with practical examples of this centralist, socialist dogma that is being canvassed in the form of this Bill. Those States in Australia do have rights. I believe that their rights are severely abridged and trampled on by this legislation. I welcome the opportunity to refer it to the Committee to look at this matter. </PARA>

So I did not proceed with asking him, as Chairman of the Committee, whether it ought to be referred to him. Mr Acting Deputy President, in your address you indicated quite validly that there is no responsibility on a member of this chamber to ask the chairman of a Senate committee whether he can move in this chamber for a Bill or some other matter to be referred to a Senate Standing committee. The rights of individual senators in this chamber are being undermined as it is, and too much, I believe, by the committee system.

Senator Missen left me under the clear impression-there was not the shadow of doubt about it-that he would not have a bar of any discussion on this issue. Neither Senator Missen nor any of the other senators have addressed themselves to the issues that I raised in the debate. Senator Missen himself said that the Bill is defective.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even Senator Mason is now admitting that this legislation is not perfect. That is why I want to see it referred to the Committee. Senator Missen went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the major defects have been covered by the Australian Labor Party in its amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>So at least he admits that there are major defects in the legislation as it stands, but he thinks the major defects have been covered by the Australian Labor Party in its amendments. He knows it is defective. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> I see some defect in that if a State has a plan of management for parks and so forth there is no way at the moment that that could be protected from action. </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on with, I presume, other matters and makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a relatively minor point; it could easily be picked up in the House of Representatives if it is thought desirable and if the Commonwealth decides that this is the course of action to take. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have an admission by Senator Missen. Incidentally, Senator Button also admitted that there are faults in the Bill but that they could be fixed up in the House of Representatives. So what do we have? We have a general recognition all round that the Bill is defective but that-according to those who oppose my reference-it can be fixed up in the House of Representatives. What are we? According to the opponents of this reference we are not a States House and now, according to the opponents of this reference, we are not a House of review. I thought that the two major purposes of this House were to act a States House and as a House of review. I do not know why the people who have advanced these specious reasons against the reference of the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill to a Committee take their money home. They ought to pack up, go home and save the taxpayers a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the issues which were not met by any of the opponents of this reference. Senator Lewis, in his very perceptive address to the Senate this afternoon, detailed again the Koowarta decision and its effects. He pointed to the fact that the Koowarta decision indicated, inter alia, that certain actions can be taken by the Commonwealth pursuant to its external affairs powers under section 51 (xxix) of the Constitution, notwithstanding that the legislation concerned may impinge otherwise upon the constitutional powers of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mason, in his second reading speech, which incidentally was almost identical in parts to evidence given by a witness from the Australian Conservation Foundation to the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania, said that the Koowarta decision applies equally to this Bill. On 25 November 1982, as recorded at page 2862 of Hansard, Senator Tate said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the possibility of this legislation-</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>being based on the external affairs is based on a very biased reading of the Koowarta decision. </PARA>
<PARA>Why did any honourable senator who opposed this reference-for example, Senator Chipp or Senator Mason-not address himself to that question, which after all is fundamental to the Bill? Here we have a fundamental difference of opinion as to the applicability of the external affairs powers in respect of this legislation. Why did they not address themselves to that clear difference of opinion?</PARA>

They will also see who is trying to undermine the role of this Senate as a States' House and a proper House of review. Let us not hear anything further on that subject from Senator Missen. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other people have preferred using invective to addressing themselves to this particular reference. Indeed, it occurred last night when Senator Grimes used a smear tactic which was found to be totally baseless and false. Many things have been said by the opponents of this measure that have been inaccurate and indeed downright false. I referred to one of those inaccuracies last night. It is not my intention to do so today. Let me refer in particular to the questions of the reference. We are seeking to have this Bill referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs and have that Committee report on the inadequacies and ambiguities identified in the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. We seek to have the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs raise the desirability or otherwise of a limitation being placed on the standing and class of persons who may bring proceedings. In the debate, Senator Missen said: 'Oh, that is no problem. You are worried about eskimos. There is no problem about that'.

The nature of the offence and the likely penalty arising from a breach of the order of the court is a very serious matter. Let us see who is likely to be affected by the provisions of this Bill. The workers in the Hydro-Electric Commission are likely to be affected by this Bill because they, under this Bill, will have to bear the brunt of this Bill that is moved by the Australia Democrats and which is now supported by the Australian Labor Party .

<PARA> I turn now to the question of whether it would be appropriate for the Commonwealth to invoke the external affairs power in section 51 (xxix) of the Constitution to legislate in the manner proposed by the Bill. That is fundamental. Again I refer to what Senator Tate said. He indicated that the provisions of this Bill and the possibility of this legislation being based on the external affairs power is based on a very biased reading of the Koowarta decision. Surely those are weighty matters for a Senate committee to consider. I ask all honourable senators in this place to give full regard to what they are doing about this matter, to recognise that the issues that have been raised have not been met in any shape or form by any of the speakers against the proposition that I moved last week and that is before us today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I have moved that the clause be postponed . This is a formal motion. I quote from page 318 of Odgers's Australian Senate Practice, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A common practice is to move that clause 1 (normally the short title)-</PARA>
<PARA>In this case it is the short title of the Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>be postponed-as an instruction to the Government to do certain things relevant to the Bill. A debate then proceeds on the subject-matter of the proposed instruction5. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am having distributed in the chamber at the moment the proposed instruction, which is to Senator Mason and not to the Government, of course, because this is Senator Mason's Bill. For the purpose of the record the instruction is:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) To take advice on the validity and Constitutional propriety of this legislation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to re-draft the Bill so that it:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) no longer contains the inadequacies and ambiguities identified in the seventeenth report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) places suitable limitations on the standing and class of persons who may bring proceedings;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) identifies the nature of the offence and likely maximum penalty arising from a breach of the order of the Court; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) after re-drafting, represents a balanced and complete document suitable to pass through the Parliament,</PARA>
<PARA>The situation that I was trying to explain to the Senate when my time to speak ran out during an earlier debate relates in particular to instruction (a). I say seriously to Senator Mason that we have a federation. It is time that the Senate realised that a federation means that the States have rights, duties and obligations. It is not the right of this Commonwealth Parliament to ride rough- shod over those rights and duties. This is an attempt to do so. It may very well be that in due course--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I rise to order. I refer to page 318 of Odgers's Australian Senate Practice, which states;</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Chairman quoted Standing Order 202, which states that 'no new clause or amendment shall be at any time proposed which is substantially the same as one already negatived by the Committee. . .'</PARA>
<PARA>My point of order is that the amendment proposed by Senator Lewis is substantially, though not formally, the same as the one moved by Senator Harradine. Its intent is the same as the intent of the one moved by Senator Harradine. The sub-sections of the amendment and its thrust are very much the same as that moved by Senator Harradine. According to that Standing Order, I ask that you rule this amendment out of order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, this is a motion to postpone a clause; it is not an amendment. I remind Senator Bolkus that this is the first motion that has been moved in the Committee stage of this Bill. There is, therefore, no point of order.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. What I was trying to do was to draw the attenton of Senator Mason, the Australian Democrats and those who support this legislation to the problems of a federation. We have in a federation a fabric which must be retained. We cannot ride rough-shod over the rights of the Commonwealth Government or the State governments. There must be some give and take. I draw the attention of the Committee to the report of the Koowata case and the statement in the head note of the dissenting opinion of Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs and Justices Aickin and Wilson that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A law which gives effect within Australia to an international agreement will only be valid under s. 51 (xxix)-</PARA>
<PARA>Of the Constitution-</PARA>
<PARA>if it is with respect to a matter which itself can be described as an external affair. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words: 'if it is with respect to a matter which can only be described as an external affair'. I suggest to the Committee that where we have a federation and this sort of delicate fabric of give and take between the States, among the States and between the States and the Commonwealth it is necessary for the Commonwealth to tread very carefully in the exercise of its powers. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Coates" NAMEID="LF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator Coates</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a minority.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it was a minority view, but one of these days it may become a majority view. In any event, it has not necessarily always been the situation that minority views are not always correct. There is a particular minority view in this Senate which is far more correct than the majority view of a particular committee back in 1975 and this view is held on both sides. What I am trying to say to those honourable senators who wish to apply their minds instead of their mouths to this subject is that when we are endeavouring to get a balance in a federation, when we do not want to destroy what has been achieved in 82 years, we must look to exercising our powers properly. I put it to the Committee that this description of how those powers should be exercised is valid and proper. The best way to go about exercising our external affairs powers is to make sure that the subject matter can be described as an external affair. In no way can the subject matter of this Bill be described as an external affair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other constitutional difficulties have been raised by Senator Evans, Senator Tate and Senator Harradine. These major difficulties relate to the treaty arrangements and whether the treaty powers can be used at this stage when, in fact, only a submission to the World Heritage Council has been made. I do not want to go into those matters at great length. They have been spoken of before and are recorded in Hansard for the benefit of honourable senators who wish to apply their minds to the matter. It may very well be that in due course Senator Evans will explain them to us again, but I am not raising those particular aspects. I am talking about the general concept of the Commonwealth of Australia exercising its external affairs powers. The Bill in no way relates to any matter which can be described as an external affair. Clearly, what it relates to is an internal affair, specifically one concerning a part of a State of the Commonwealth. On 2 December, Senator Chipp, as reported at page 3129 of Hansard, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The . . . Bill . . . is designed for one purpose; that is, to stop the vandalism that is taking place in one of the most beautiful places of the world.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, it has nothing to do with any external affair or matter. Under the description given by Senator Chipp, the claim is made that vandalism is taking place in the State of Tasmania and the Bill is designed to stop that vandalism. How can that be said to be in any way an exercise of the external affairs power of the Commonwealth? I hear not a dissenting voice. </PARA>

I am totally opposed to the construction of this dam. I have indicated that view to Government Ministers. I have taken that viewpoint repeatedly whenever I have had an opportunity to do so in my party room. But I am also desperately concerned about the rights of States. I am not necessarily saying that the exercise of States' rights is always correct, but there are various matters that one must look at carefully if one is to exercise one's judgment in this chamber. It is not just a question of whether a dam is to be built in Tasmania. That is not the only question raised here. Involved is the question of the use of the external affairs power of the Commonwealth, the question whether it can validly be used to impose something upon a State in order to change what has been decided by its Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me quote again the judgment of the High Court on the enforcement of treaties by Oliver, as reported at page 644 of ALJR of 1982:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A constitution would cease to be federal if the central government, without consultation with the states, could enter into any treaty and by so doing increase the legislative powers of the central government at the expense of state legislatures. If the treaty power can cut across all reserved powers and interdict the powers of the member states, then there are no real powers reserved to the internal sovereignties. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is the fundamental principle involved in what is being proposed in the Bill. Senator Evans, who claims to be a constitutional lawyer, ought to have some knowledge about these things. Instead of making personal attacks on me and my ability as a lawyer, he ought to be applying his mind to matters which are of concern to us here. Are we to destory the federation? Are we to exercise these powers, or say: 'We may have this power but this is not the sort of use that we ought to make of it'. I have put to honourable senators that, according to the dissenting judgment, the proper use of the power is with respect to a matter which itself can be described as an external affair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis, as did Senator Harradine, has quite properly drawn attention once again to the basic inadequacies of Senator Mason's Bill. Senator Lewis has offered Senator Mason a perfectly logical and proper way out of his difficulty. I cannot understand why Senator Mason does not accept his magnanimous gesture. It would give Senator Mason a way out of all his problems with this dreadful Bill. Senator Lewis has properly outlined the basic reason this Bill will not be able to function. I repeat, it is quite incredible that such a Bill should be presented to the Senate. It is quite incredible that the Opposition, containing, as it does, a number of lawyers, some perhaps of doubtful quality but others probably of some quality, does not seem able to help Senator Mason with his Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Its deficiencies are obviously directly attributable to the over-enthusiasm of such people as Dr Moseley, the Director of the Australian Conservation Foundation, who ought to stick to conservation and stay out of the area of the law. His over-enthusiasm is obviously sustained on government handouts. We feed the conservationists and they seek to destroy us. Why Senator Mason listens to such people instead of going to the lawyers and fixing up his Bill so that it might be acceptable to this chamber, I do not know. Instead, Senator Mason goes beyond the law and asks these enthusiastic conservationists for advice. Yesterday I called them greenies, and that is what I think they are. They ought to stick to their flora and fauna and leave the law to the lawyers and to honourable senators who know a little about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I support Senator Lewis's instruction to Senator Mason. He has given perfectly logical reasons why the honourable senator, if he had sense, should withdraw the Bill and redraft it after proper advice. If he then brought it back and it was suitable, we might even, on this side of the House, be enthusiastic about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to paragraph (a), concerning constitutional propriety, which seems to me to be the threshold point of the proposal put before us by Senator Lewis. We do have a federation, one that is becoming more and more fragile, one that more and more seems to be deteriorating and collapsing as a result of the purposeful endeavours of some people. We have to make up our minds on whether we want it to work or to fail, whether we want in Canberra a centralised system and the total abolition of the States. If that is the case perhaps we should say so. If it is we will find that slowly but surely this great country of ours will tear itself apart. I believe we have to continue to recognise that there should be checks and balances as was intended in the first place by the founding fathers. If this power, this insidious proposal were put to the people in a referendum, even with the support of the Government and the Opposition, it would be ignominiously defeated. I have no doubt about that and I am sure the Opposition knows the same thing. I am sure that the great majority of people do not want further powers vested in the hands of the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal is a sensible one. In regard to constitutional propriety, there have been endeavours and moves-reasonable, altruistic and with good purpose-to review the Constitution from time to time. Senator Evans has been one of those who has led the push towards reform, at least as he sees it. On each of those occasions he, like everybody else who has participated, has recognised that if there is not goodwill or co-operation from the States then endeavours to amend the Constitution in any way and find a more suitable framework are bound to fail . If it is the view of some in the Senate that the States should be completely abolished, they ought to say so. It seems to me that they have a convenient excuse for the time being but the moment the States take a contrary view on something then they say the States ought to be overruled completely. That seems to be the second best thing to abolishing them. Senator Lewis has put before us an ideal, practical and sensible proposal. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be a pleasure to come back to it. Mr Justice Wilson referred to the only four cases which had been before the High Court in relation to the interpretation of section 51 (xxix) of the Constitution. The Koowarta case was only the fifth case on our history when the High Court was able to give consideration to this provision. The first case was Burgess's case in 1936, which was followed by Sharkey's case in 1949, the Airlines of N.S.W. case in 1965 and finally, in 1975, the case of N.S.W. against the Commonwealth. Having referred to each of those decisions and having gone through them, Mr Justice Wilson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have reviewed these cases in order to show the very limited authority that they provide. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very significant. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> In every case, the law in question was one which in the words of Chief Justice Latham in Burgess's case had an external aspect. The operation of the law within Australia was necessarily invested with an international character. Whether it was the extradition of fugitive offenders from abroad, the seizure of the property of enemy aliens, the safety and efficiency of aerial navigation within Australian air space used by foreign aircraft, the vesting of sovereignty in areas beyond Australia or the protection of foreign governments from seditious activity within Australia, the law bore on its face the marks of an external affair. </PARA>
<PARA>We should appreciate how significant that is. He went through each one of those cases and in a sentence summarised the nature of the case which came before. See how they are related to an external matter. Compare the seizure of the property of enemy aliens with the interference in Tasmainia in relation to the Tasmanian Government wanting to construct a dam. Compare the use in Australia of air space by foreign aircraft with the interference in Tasmania of the Tasmanian Government's desire to build a dam. Seditious activity within Australia by a foreign government and all of these matters have an external affairs section to them. A part of all of them is related to external affairs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Evans and those of his ilk wish to extend the powers of the Commonwealth of Australia but the people of Australia do not want to extend the powers of the Commonwealth. They have rejected repeatedly any extension of the powers of the Commonwealth Government. They have said that this isolated area, Canberra, ought not to have any more powers. Yet people such as Senator Evans wish continually to impose upon the people of Australia any device that they possibly can to extend those powers. Mr Justice Wilson said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the external affairs power is sometimes likened to the defence power, there is in my opinion a significant distinction to be drawn. Whereas the needs of defence will vary with the existence and character of hostilities in which Australia may be engaged and consequently the scope of the power will expand or contract accordingly, there is no such ebb and flow in the conduct of Australia' s international relations. There is now no limit to the range of matters which may assume an international character. </PARA>
<PARA>When talking about communications and satellites he pointed out that there is now no limit to the range of matters which may assume an international character and this situation is unlikely to change. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> These considerations underline the importance of identifying clearly the criteria which will attract to a law of the Parliament the character of a law with respect to external affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Justice Wilson was pointing out how the external affairs power will continue to grow and that it is most unlikely ever to stop growing. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The broader question then is whether the Parliament is competent, by reason of Section 51 (xxix), to give effect within Australia to every obligation which Australia assumes within the community of nations. In answering that question, it must be borne in mind that a distinction is to be drawn on the one hand between Australia as a fully autonomous sovereign nation within the international community with all the rights and responsibilities that attach to that status, and on the other hand the identity of the Commonwealth as a constituent unit of a federation possessed of the legislative powers conferred upon it by the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Justice Wilson drew clear a distinction between Australia as a sovereign nation exercising its external affairs power in relation to other countries, and Australia as a constituent unit-not as the dominating controlling unit-of a federation possessed of the legislative powers conferred upon it by the Constitution. Mr Justice Wilson then came to this conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion, the power in Section 51 (xxix) does not extend to enable the Parliament to implement every obligation which Australia assumes in its international relations. The discrimen to be applied is that which is established by the earlier decisions of this Court. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what he is saying is that one has to look at the external power in relation to external affairs and whether the manner of the implementation necessarily exhibits an international character-which is a summary of how Mr Justice Wilson put it. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me back to the summary that was so very well put in the headnote and which seems to me to make so much sense-that when we exercise this power as a Commonwealth we ought to recognise that the laws that we implement under this head of power should be laws which give effect within Australia to an international agreement to be valid only if it is with respect to a matter which itself can be described as an external affair. I go on to quote further:</PARA>
<PARA> Any subject may constitute an external affair. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not a very limiting power. Any subject may constitute an external affair. Surely that is of enormous value to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. The judgment goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Any subject may constitute an external affair if the manner in which it is treated in some way involves a relationship with other countries or with persons or things outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that makes good sense. But this Bill in no way relates to those matters. In no way does it relate to or involve a relationship with other countries or with persons or things outside Australia. All that the Bill does is to ride roughshod over the State of Tasmania, over the desires of the Government of Tasmania and over the wishes of the people. A recently elected government of Tasmania has made a particular decision on this matter, and this Bill proposes that that should be wiped away. The way in which it is proposed that it be wiped away is by using the external affairs power. That must surely be a nonsense, and in no way could it be said to be a proper exercise of the constitutional powers of this Parliament. That is why I propose that Senator Mason ought to withdraw the Bill, take it away and take advice on its validity-I doubt its validity, anyway-and then he ought to take advice on its constitutional propriety and consider whether it is right and proper, with all the soft fabric of a federation, to destroy that fabric with a Bill such as this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that Senator Missen's understanding of the Constitution is a little better than his understanding of the Standing Orders. This is a matter of great importance. After hearing the previous speakers, I am moved to support this proposition. I want to make it perfectly clear that the first time that I saw this proposition was when it was handed to me as it was distributed in the chamber. I had thought that we were going into the Committee of the Whole, and I had distributed among senators some amendments -not that I will necessarily move them, but they are amendments which senators should be able to consider moving themselves if they so desire. However, having heard Senator Lewis, Senator Martyr, and Senator Crichton-Browne, I am convinced that what Senator Lewis has done by proposing this measure is to get Senator Mason off the hook and to preserve the dignity and role of this Senate as a States House, a House of review, and a House which is committed to the protection of personal rights and liberties of individual citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from what Senator Missen said during his speech on the second reading of the Bill, I do not know what advice was obtained by Senator Mason in the preparation of the Bill. Normally, of course, when governments bring measures before this Parliament, we are quite certain that they have received advice. The advice that they may have received may not have been accepted by them, and quite frequently we take issue with the measures. Quite frequently also, as in the industrial legislation package, we in this chamber refer the measure to a Senate select committee. However, that opportunity has now been denied to the Senate by virtue of the vote that has just taken place. So now Senator Lewis provides to Senator Mason an opportunity to advise us as to just what legal advice he has taken on the validity and constitutional propriety of this legislation. If he has done so, let him stand in this chamber and state from whom the advice was received and what it was, and then we will be able to examine for ourselves whether we regard that advice as valid. But there is a deafening silence from Senator Mason on this subject. He is in charge of the Bill. He has chosen to remain silent on the very important constitutional issues that have been raised in the chamber today, last week and, indeed, the week before by Senator Tate and Senator Evans. There is no excuse for this silence. It is a reflection on the chamber. It is a reflection on the intelligence of individual senators. </PARA>

But if any honourable senator places before the Parliament a Bill and seeks to have the Parliament enact that legislation, it is that honourable senator's responsibility at least to address his mind to the matters that have been raised by other honourable senators. Senator Mason has not done that. But if he wants Senator Lewis's motion not to be supported, let him say from whom he has taken the advice. If he does not want to say that, I do not mind. Senator Missen has suggested that it was the Australian Conservation Foundation President but let him at least table the advice so that we have the information before us. Otherwise, if he has not taken advice let him, as proposed by the motion, take the advice on the validity and constitutional propriety of the legislation. Let him also redraft the Bill in the manner proposed by Senator Lewis. We are talking about this chamber as a responsible chamber, a States House. I point to what was said in Odgers's Australian Senate Practice. He made it perfectly clear in his first chapter that this is a States House. We are talking about fundamental issues of federalism. We are talking about co-operation between the Commonwealth and a State. The very areas which are referred to in the amendments of the Australian Labor Party are managed in co-operation with the relevant State or Territory. But this Bill seeks to have a coercive effect on one State. That is a very dangerous path to follow. Later in the Committee stage I will ask Senator Mason further questions on that particular issue if he is not prepared to do that which is proposed in this measure now before us. Let him also identify the nature of the offences and the likely maximum penalty arising from a breach of the order of the court. This is not a hypothetical issue. It is a very practical issue. If this legislation is passed by this chamber and by the House of Representatives we as a Federal Parliament will place an enormous burden on the already overburdened workers of the State of Tasmania.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Lewis's amendment. I support particularly those sections of the instructions which pertain to the essential rights of the States and, through the States, of the individuals who are concerned. I feel it relevant to begin with the quotation from Mr Justice Wilson that was so appropriately used by Senator Lewis. In relation to some Commonwealth powers, he referred to 'the very limited authority that applies'. It is quite obvious that what Senator Mason's Bill seeks to do above all other things, as has been alluded to already by Senator Lewis and Senator Harradine, is to deny the States certain fundamental rights. Senator Lewis's amendment seeks to guide Senator Mason in the right direction so that those essential powers will not be taken away from the States, so that the States will be able to preserve a definite identity within this Commonwealth of Australia. I think it is appropriate, when speaking to this clause, to remind the Senate of Pat Kennelly, of saintly memory, who said on one occasion that it did not matter who had the logic because he had the numbers. That would be perfectly satisfactory to him. That, I suggest, is the sort of exercise that is being conducted in this chamber today. Some senators feel that because they have the numbers-a majority of only one or two-they will dispossess the rest of us of our fundamental right to speak in this debate and to speak as accurately and as directly as we can about these very vital matters of States rights which have been alluded to by Senator Lewis and which we are trying to cover within his amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Mason does not seem willing to accept the good guidance from my eminent friend who sits in front of me. I insist that I am trying to serve democracy here. I have heard comments from various people that we are not serving democracy, that we are outraging this chamber. Just because I want to support Senator Lewis's amendment I am told that I am not serving democracy. It is absolutely outrageous that people can come in here and attempt to ram through legislation which is totally inadequate, so totally inadequate in law that it is absolutely disgraceful. There are people on the other side of this chamber who are prepared to associate themselves with a piece of stuff and nonsense which would do better in vaudeville. A pantomine could be made about Senator Mason's Bill. Numbers of senators want this rammed through this chamber. They are the people who will bring this chamber into disrepute. They are the people who are denying democracy and outraging my right to speak, when all I am doing is speaking to Senator Lewis's amendment, and doing so with some conviction and sincerity. His amendment is absolutely necessary to make sense of Senator Mason's Bill. I began my speech by quoting the words of Mr Justice Wilson, which Senator Lewis used. It may well have been a minority opinion, but the fact is that when Mr Justice Wilson talked about the very limited authority that applies he was talking about excessive Commonwealth powers, and possible excessive Commonwealth powers are definitely prevalent in Senator Mason's Bill. We are doing the best we can here to produce something which this chamber can be proud of. Senator Mason so far refuses to accept the good advice that we give him. I say to Senator Mason that it is he and hounourable senators on the Opposition side who will bring the Senate into disrepute unless they are prepared to accept this guidance and produce a decent Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was he who filibustered on my time and prevented me from speaking to this proposition for my allotted time of a mere quarter of an hour. I now wish to return to where I left off. I was indicating that unless Senator Mason can show to the Senate a clear indication that there is constitutional validity at the base of the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill when that has already been challenged by one person from the Opposition, he ought to do what he is required to do under the proposition that is now before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have dealt with the question of ambiguities that were identified. I was coming to the point that we are not in fairyland. This is not a theoretical debate by any means. It is not theoretical from the constitutional point of view . It is not theoretical from the point of view of the democratic rights of Australian citizens. I will give a practical example. Paragraph (b) (3) of the motion that is before the Chair seeks Senator Mason to redraft the Bill so that it identifies the nature of the offence and the likely maximum penalty arising from a breach of the order of the court. That is a very important matter. It impinges upon the democratic rights of Australian citizens. Who are those Australian citizens? Under clause 3 (2) of the Bill those Australian citizens will be the workers of a State authority who will be acting in accordance with the laws of a State. Clause 3 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> A reference in this Act to the doing of an act or taking action by a person includes a reference to the doing of an act or the taking of action by a person in association with or for or on behalf of another person or other persons. </PARA>
<PARA>The question that is in my mind for next Saturday is this: Do the Australian Democrats put at threat the workers of the various unions employed in the Hydro- Electric Commission-the members of the Australian Workers Union, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, the Building Workers Industrial Union, the Plumbers Union, the Federated Clerks Union and the Transport Workers Union? Will they be put at risk by the Democrats' Bill? The Democrats are not even listening. They could not care less. They could not care less about the civil liberties of those workers who will, I remind the Senate, be acting in accordance with the laws of the State of Tasmania. This is one of the reasons why I am concerned about this measure. I am legitimately concerned about it not only as a representative of these workers in this place, but also as a senator in the very House of Parliament which, according to the blurb that is given to school kids in 'The Australian Senate-An Introduction', in paragraph (6) entitled 'Functions of the Senate', states:</PARA>

<PARA>BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill introduces legislation to give effect to the Government's decisions on supplementary licences which were announced on 11 August 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will recall that the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Act 1981 provided the legislative framework for the extension of commercial FM broadcasting through the supplementary licence scheme. The present Bill makes a number of significant changes to that scheme and includes provision for supplementary television services. </PARA>
<PARA> A constant source of complaint over many years by people in country and regional areas has been the imbalance in broadcasting and television services available in those areas when compared with the five mainland State capital cities. Apart from national services, these people often have access to only one commercial broadcasting service and one commercial television service. </PARA>
<PARA> A major difficulty in attempting to redress the balance has been the inability of many of these areas to support fully competitive stations without endangering the viability of existing services. A further consideration has been the need to maintain, as far as practicable, the local flavour and character of country and regional services. The supplementary licence scheme has been developed as a means of resolving these major problems. It also provides a mechanism for the indentification of those areas which are able to sustain additional commercial licences. </PARA>
<PARA> The pattern of commercial broadcasting and television services in country and regional areas has essentially remained unaltered since the early 1960s, in the case of television, and even longer, in the case of broadcasting. The supplementary licence scheme heralds a major expansion in those services. It will enable the progressive development of an additional commercial FM service and commercial television service in most country and regional centres thereby offering people in those areas greater program choice. A maximum of 99 commercial FM services and 36 commercial television services could be established uner the supplementary licence scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Careful attention will need to be given to the planning of these new services. The Minister for Communications intends to make a full statement on planning guidelines for the implementation of the supplementary licence scheme as soon as possible after the legislation has been passed by the Parliament. This statement will cover all the practical steps required to implement the scheme and will cover matters relating to the commencement of the scheme, the definition of service areas, the procedures by which applications will be processed and the determination of technical specifications. Consultations will also be held with industry bodies and individual licensees on these matters. The Department of Communications is establishing a special task force to handle the implementation of the scheme and to institute more effective procedures for handling the large number of planning proposals which will result. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I would now like to turn to the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill introduces a major innovation in the licensing of broadcasting and television services. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators will be aware that the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 as it stands is a particularly complex Act, due in part to the fact that it provides for the licensing of stations and technical facilities, rather than broadcasting or television services as such. As new types of services have become available, or new uses have been found for existing technology, it has been necessary to accommodate these changes through the creation of new classes of licence with the result that the Act has become exceedingly complex. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the system adopted in the Bill, a supplementary licence will authorise the provision of a broadcasting or television service to a specified area. There will no longer be any need for the licensee to apply separately for licences for translator stations to re-transmit the supplementary service. In determining the service area of a supplementary licence, the Minister will endeavour to ensure that, as far as practicable, the supplementary licence will serve the same area as that of the related commercial licence and associated translators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes there would be great merit in adopting a service-based approach throughout the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942, and it is gratifying that a start is being made with the supplementary licence scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I now propose to give a brief outline of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill allows the licensee of a commercial AM broadcasting service or a commercial television service to lodge with the Minister an application for a supplementary licence to operate one additional commercial service within his service area. In the case of broadcasting this additional service must be an FM service. The Bill also allows a consortium of licensees serving the same area to apply for a single supplementary licence. </PARA>
<PARA> Once an application has been received the Minister may either accept the application and forward it to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, together with a specification of the area to be served by the licence and other technical specifications, or reject the application on planning or technical grounds, giving his reasons to the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA> As the supplementary licence scheme will not apply to the five mainland State capitals, applications will not be accepted from licensees serving those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the Tribunal receives an application from the Minister it may conduct a public inquiry into the grant of the supplementary licence, and must determine whether an independent commercial licence would be viable in that area, and if so, whether it would be in the public interest, on certain specified grounds, to invite applications for such a licence. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of its consideration, the Tribunal will either recommend to the Minister that applications for an independent licence be invited, or grant the supplementary licence for up to five years. </PARA>
<PARA> After eight years of operation, or earlier if the licensee so elects, special renewal provisions provided for in section 86A will come into operation. At such a renewal the Tribunal must re-examine the question of whether an independent licence would be viable, and if so, whether it would be in the public interest to invite applications for such a licence. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Tribunal determines that the area still cannot support an additional independent licence or it is not in the public interest for such a licence to be granted, the supplementary licence will be renewed for up to three years. The viability of an independent service and the public interest consideration must be re-examined at each subsequent three yearly renewal. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the Tribunal determines that an area can support an additional independent licence and that applications should be invited, it renews the supplementary licence for up to three years, notifies the supplementary licensee of its determination and recommends to the Minister that applications be invited for an independent service to commence three years later. The Minister has three months to decide if he accepts the Tribunal's recommendation. If he does not accept the recommendation, the supplementary licence continues in force, until the matter is re-examined by the Tribunal at the next three yearly renewal. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister accepts the Tribunal's recommendation, the licensee is notified , and has at least three months to decide which licence he wishes to retain. He may choose either to retain his original commercial licence or his supplementary licence. The licensee must also decide whether he wishes to allow the unwanted licence to expire, or to seek to transfer it to another party. </PARA>
<PARA> If the licensee chooses to retain the supplementary licence or transfer it to another party, it subsequently becomes a full commercial licence. </PARA>
<PARA> If he decides to transfer one of the licences, he has eight months in which to arrange the transfer and gain the approval of the Tribunal. This time limit may be extended at the discretion of the Tribunal to ensure continuity of service in the area concerned. If a successful transfer is effected, no further action is required by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> If the licensee elects to allow one of the licences to expire, or is unable to arrange a successful transfer, the Minister may invite applications for an independent commercial licence. If he does not do so or if an independent licence is not granted for any reason, the supplementary licence continues in force. </PARA>
<PARA> Supplementary licences will be subject to the normal requirements imposed by the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 and related legislation, however there are several special requirements. A supplementary broadcasting or television licensee will be required to gain the approval of the Tribunal before undertaking regular broadcasts or telecasts of programs from the related commercial station, and in the case of television only, the programs of any other station operated by another licensee, the Australian Broadcasting Commission or the Special Broadcasting Service. Special provisions relating to local content will also apply to supplementary television services. A supplementary television licensee will be required to encourage, as far as practicable, local advertising and the provision of local programming on his supplementary television service. </PARA>
<PARA> The above outline broadly sets out the main features of the supplementary licence scheme as embodied in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Communications announced on 11 October 1982, the increasing workload being experienced by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal due to the rapid increase in size and complexity of the broadcasting industry and the even greater workload anticipated with the introduction of supplementary licences, has made it necessary to increase the maximum membership of the Tribunal from five to eight members, including the Chairman and Vice-Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> The supplementary licence scheme, as provided for in this Bill, is an effective means of bringing a wider choice of services to those areas which, because of their limited population, cannot support additional independent commercial licences. The scheme will also contribute to the steady growth of the commercial sector in non-metropolitan areas. The Bill before the House provides the means to do this, and allows for the necessary increase in Tribunal membership to handle the volume of inquiries which the supplementary licence scheme will generate. </PARA>

<PARA>BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill makes a consequential amendment to the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Act to make the terms used to refer to supplementary broadcasting licences and stations consistent with the terms used in the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill 1982. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>TELEVISION STATIONS LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Television Stations Licence Fees Act 1964 to extend that Act to supplementary licences for television stations, consequential to the introduction of the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill 1982. References in the Act to commercial television stations, licences and licensees are applied to supplementary television stations, licences and licensees. Provisions have also been inserted to deal with licence fees payable by a consortium of commercial television licensees holding a supplementary licence. The Bill provides that the supplementary television station will be regarded as a separate operation for the purposes of licence fees assessments. The effect of these amendments is to place supplementary licensees on the same basis as commercial licensees in respect of the imposition and calculation of licence fees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present a report on the use of herbicides, insecticides and other chemicals by the Royal Australian Air Force in Vietnam; secondly, a signal message from the Australian Embassy, Washington, notifying United States comments on the Army report on the use of herbicides, insecticides and other chemicals in South Vietnam; and, thirdly, a report on the use of herbicides, insecticides and other chemicals by the Australian Army in Vietnam. I seek leave to make a statement concerning the reports and to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 6 May this year, in response to a question without notice from the honourable Member for Banks, my predecessor gave an undertaking to provide any further information that might become available on the use of chemicals in South Vietnam by the Australian Army. That undertaking was given in reply to a question about the large number of Army records created in Vietnam which dealt with Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War that had been recently transferred for archival purposes to the Australian War Memorial. </PARA>
<PARA> A painstaking search of Army records, comprising over 20,000 files including Army files created in Vietnam and in Canberra, war diaries of units which served in Vietnam, and appropriate records of functional commands and military districts, was undertaken by teams of up to 30 Officers and Warrant Officers at a time from Army Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of that task, conducted in a sustained effort over three months, is a detailed report on the use of herbicides, insecticides and other chemicals by the Australian Army in South Vietnam. The Report also fully covers all known and possible cases of exposure of Australians to chemicals used by United States forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I now table that Army report. I am also tabling an Air Force report on the RAAF role in the transport and spraying of these chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> Previous research by my Department on the subject of the use of chemicals in Vietnam was based almost wholly on files created in Canberra, which were thought most likely to contain all the information being sought. These concerned principally policy issues rather than operational details. Records created in Vietnam, giving operational details, were not examined exhaustively until early this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Already extensive documentation has been made public in such forms as the report ''Pesticides Used in Vietnam Hostilities and their use in Australian Agriculture: A Comparative Study'' (the Pesticides Report), answers to Parliamenary Questions, Ministerial statements, press releases and, most recently, evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment and its report on Pesticides and the Health of Australian Vietnam Veterans. The Army report does much to confirm what was previously known and made public about this subject, but it also provides new information, some of which contradicts earlier statements. These earlier statements were, of course, made in good faith on the basis of the then known facts. But, new information having come to light, some of these statements are seen to have been wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall refer briefly to the salient points, but I stress-and the media might note-that the Army report, which is a comprehensive and accurate summary of a vast mass of material, needs to be read in its entirety to ensure a correct perspective on the events depicted in the many files examined. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australians in Vietnam were involved with herbicides in three ways: there was the aerial herbicide spray programme carried out by the United States; there were crop destruction missions principally carried out by the United States; and herbicides were used to control vegetation around perimeters and bases. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to emphasise to honourable members that the use of herbicides in Vietnam has to be seen in the context of the war and the terrain in which it was fought. Chemical products were used in and around the Australian Army's bases in an attempt to keep down vegetation which posed risks to Australian lives because it offered cover to hostile forces. There was, and is, no mystery about this matter . The Australian Army took reasonable and responsible steps to protect Australian lives. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the particular attention of honourable members to Book 2 of the Army report where it is recalled that ''the defoliation programme was seen as an important measure in helping to deprive the enemy of the advantages that he enjoyed through the use of natural vegetation for cover in Vietnam's tropical environment. In addition, through crop destruction, mainly utilizing herbicides, it was intended that the vital in-country food support that the enemy relied upon could be substantially reduced. The use of herbicides to control base area vegetation was also seen as an important protective aid to local defence.''</PARA>
<PARA> From 1962 to 1971 the United States carried out, in support of the Government of South Vietnam, an aerial herbicide spray programme over a wide area. This became known as the RANCH HAND programme. The aim of this was to expose enemy installations and communication routes to observation from the air and to provide improved observation and easier going for allied troops on the ground. May herbicides were used in the RANCH HAND programme, but mainly Agents Orange and White. The Army report makes it clear that the RANCH HAND missions over parts of Phuoc Tuy Province were mostly at the request of our forces from about mid 1966 to mid 1968. The cessation of the United States defoliation operations in Phuoc Tuy Province appears to have resulted from comments by the Commander, 1st Australian Task Force, among others, that they were not achieving the aims set for the RANCH HAND programme. </PARA>
<PARA> Control of vegetation by Australians around the Australian Task Force base area was a major task in South Vietnam. A variety of products used for that purpose was, and still is, commercially available in Australia and widely used in this country. It has been previously stated that no records had been found which showed that Australian forces had used Agent Orange. The Army report refers, however, to indications that on one occasion Australian forces may have used six drums of Agent Orange to control vegetation in 1966 but it is not possible to say with certainty that they were used. </PARA>
<PARA> With the exception of the mention of an Australian crop-destruction operation in the Pesticides report, it had been previously understood that Australians did not conduct crop-destruction in South Vietnam. The Army report shows Australian forces destroyed crops by using herbicides, by burning-off, by contamination with oil and by breaking padi bunds. In addition to these Australian crop- destruction operations, the US undertook similar operations at our request. Known herbicidal crop-destruction operations took place on five occasions between July 1967 and July 1968. Two others may have occurred, one in September 1968 and one in August 1969. </PARA>
<PARA> The Air Force report shows that 3 of the 5 crop-destruction operations I mentioned involved the use of RAAF helicopters and crew. The reports indicate that up to 13 drums of herbicide, possibly Agent Orange, may have been used in 1967. However, of these 13 drums, the documentation suggests that the US Force sprayed 10 drums and it is probable that the remaining 3 were sprayed from a RAAF helicopter. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of allegations that the Army continued to use helicopters after the US stopped, there is in the Army report a record of only one request from the Australian Task Force in Vietnam, made after the US suspension, to employ the herbicide Dalapon to destroy crops. This request was not agreed to by the Department of Defence. The report also notes one instance of a post-suspension order to kill weeds on a helicopter pad at Nui Dat. Whether herbicides were to be used, or even whether the order was carried out, is not clear. </PARA>
<PARA> The Army report reveals little new information regarding our use of insecticides in South Vietnam. A variety of measures was used to combat insect- borne diseases, including extensive aerial insecticide spraying as well as ground spraying. </PARA>
<PARA> The spraying of insecticide was designed to prevent such diseases as malaria, encephalitis, and filariasis and was completely in accordance with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO) for other areas such as Africa, Central America and the South-West Pacific, and indeed with practices of long-standing and continuing present use and acceptance in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Army report also summarises the use of other chemicals such as riot-control agents, camouflage creams and medicines taken for the prevention of malaria. </PARA>
<PARA> The Army report makes clear that prior to, and during, the war in South Vietnam , Australian Military Board Instructions were in force on the safety precautions for ground-spraying weed-killers and insecticides. </PARA>
<PARA> There were two recorded departures from these instructions. The first occurred in December 1967 when an Australian ground-spraying test of herbicides for the control of perimeter vegetation, using chemicals supplied from Australia, resulted in the exposure of eight individuals. This was attributed to the failure of the individuals to use all their safety equipment. The second involved two people, who had drunk alcohol, using aerosol insecticide sprays in a confined space during what was described as ''horseplay''. One was hospitalised. </PARA>
<PARA> On the topic of the extent of the exposure of Australian troops to chemicals, the Army report records two instances of aerial herbicide exposure. On 15 September 1967 V (vee) Company, a New Zealand Company of the combined Second Royal Australian Regiment/New Zealand (ANZAC) Battalion, was exposed to aerial ' 'crop dusting''. This is the only herbicidal crop-destruction operation using a helicopter in which it seems likely some personnel may have been exposed. The other exposure-and this one has already been made public-involved C Company, Fifth Royal Australian Regiment on 22nd August 1969. Some of these troops were exposed to herbicides sprayed by the US forces as part of RANCH HAND. </PARA>
<PARA> There were only two cases of Australian soldiers being temporarily overcome by riot control agents to the extent that formal notification was made. On a number of occasions unidentified troops suffered minor ill-effects from these agents which did not need treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as recorded instances of exposure, the Army report points out possible exposures in the operational area of the Australian Task Force. There were eleven occasions when friendly troops may have been exposed to herbicides sprayed by the US forces as part of RANCH HAND. Details of ten of these occasions were covered in evidence on Army units given to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. There were, of course, instances where exposure to Australian ground spraying herbicide operations was possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Army report indicates that on occasions during the RANCH HAND programme, herbicides were sprayed in Phuoc Tuy by the US forces at considerably higher than the recommended application rate. Only two of these cases occurred in close proximity (less than 4 km) to Australian troop locations. In view of the apparent variations in application rates I have asked that this matter be investigated in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> In completing my brief summary of the Army report's contents on exposure I note that any ill-effects recorded were in those few cases where safety rules for ground-spraying were not followed. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been particular interest in what Ministers of the day knew about Australian herbicide spraying programmes. I shall outline briefly the instances described, in the Army report, of Ministers receiving information on this matter . </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, Ministers for the Army were told of problems encountered in the control of vegetation around base perimeters during 1967, and of the subsequent action taken to implement an adequate herbicide programme to protect Australian lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser, then the Minister for the Army, during a visit to the Australian Task Force in Vietnam in 1967, asked whether one of the substances tested to control vegetation contained toxic organophosphates which could be absorbed through the skin; it was subsequently confirmed that it did not. </PARA>
<PARA> From June 1967, quarterly reports from the Field Operational Research Section, HQ Australian Force Vietnam, appear to have been passed regularly to the Minister for the Army, Mr Fraser, at his request. The reports covered a wide range of subjects, and occasionally contained brief references to herbicide use for perimeter vegetation control. </PARA>
<PARA> Another document shows that in August 1967 the Deputy Chief of the General Staff wrote to the Minister for Army, Mr Fraser, ''As you are aware, 1 ATF requires defoliants and herbicides to remove growth from their defensive wire and minefields, and to keep fields of fire clear, both at Nui Dat and the Horseshoe feature''. DCGS indicated that he would seek the Minister's approval to send an expert from the Defence Standards Laboratories to Vietnam to see the problem at first hand. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1967 the Minister for Army, Mr Fraser, approved the visit of Major E. S. Holt of the Scientific Advisor's Office, Army Headquarters, Canberra, to Vietnam to overcome perimeter vegetation control problems. He undertook this task with a Defence Scientist, Mr G. A. Lugg of the Defence Standards Laboratories, Department of Supply. </PARA>
<PARA> In a brief to the Minister for the Army, Mr Lynch, in 1969, the Secretary, Department of Army stated that Australia had not participated in warfare contrary to the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and defoliants had been used only for weed -killing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Returned Servicemen's League in December 1969 sought assurance from the Minister for Defence, Mr Fraser, that Servicemen's records would be endorsed when they served in places where chemicals were employed. The Minister directed the Services to review their recording arrangements. In responding to the Minister for Defence in January 1970, Army stated that current policy called for a blood test to be made on all casualties and on persons suspected of having been subjected to chemical attack; that protective measures were taken to eliminate the risk of exposure where chemical agents were used for defensive purposes; and that accidental exposure was recorded on individual medical documents. In reply to the Secretary of Defence regarding the Minister's directive that Army review its recording arrangements (April 1970), Army said in August of that year that its arrangements were adequate but would be kept under review. </PARA>
<PARA> In Navy's case, there were no existing arrangements for recording exposure to chemicals, but arrangements were made in 1970 and appropriate naval authorities were asked to report any case of exposure to the Head of Naval Personnel Branch, Navy Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Air Force considered that Air Board Order A7/28 was adequate to ensure the medical recording of chemical exposure. However, a specific question was included in the post-South East Asia medical examination procedures relating to ''any history of exposure to Weedicides/Pesticides or CS (tear) gas''. The RAAF also issued instructions for appropriate blood examination if there was any suspicion of exposure. </PARA>
<PARA> These requirements were subsequently embodied in RAAF Director General of Medical Services ''Medical Services Circular Serial No. GEN 1-31'' issued on 30th April 1970. This circular directed that a medical examination be carried out within 3 months of a member's return from Vietnam and provided that ''a specific history of exposure to toxic chemicals of the weedicide/herbicide type, or to CS (tear) gas is to be recorded and appropriate action taken.''</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, although as I have said Ministers were aware of the use of herbicides to control vegetation around Australian bases, there is no record of Ministers having been informed of Australian participation in crop-destruction operations or of Australian requests for US forces to carry out aerial herbicide spray missions. </PARA>
<PARA> The report recalls in various places that the enemy mounted a propaganda campaign about the deleterious effects of herbicides. This campaign aroused fears and concern similar to those experienced today. The US provided information which stressed that herbicides when sprayed and used as directed would not harm humans. It is possible that many present-day worries over the use of herbicides are born out of that propaganda campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> Now I would like to mention several other related matters. There may be some concern that in tabling its report on ''Pesticides and the Health of Australian Vietnam Veterans'' the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment was not aware of the general findings of the Army report. I can say that the salient facts I have outlined here today were presented to the Committee. That Committee will, no doubt, assess the Army report. </PARA>
<PARA> Previously, in the Pesticides Report, the extent of RAAF involvement in the aerial spraying of herbicides and insecticides had been specified. Also, as mentioned earlier, the Air Force report provides new details of the participation of RAAF helicopters and crew in crop-destruction missions. The Air Force report also covers other RAAF chemical activity. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Pesticides Report a fairly high degree of probability was accorded to the delivery and use of twenty 50 gallon drums of Agent Blue by Australians in September 1967. The Army report finds no evidence to support such a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Army Office personnel who undertook the task of researching the records and preparing this report are to be congratulated on their extensive and meticulous investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot guarantee that further information will not come to light in future. However, given the enormous volume of records already examined, I strongly doubt whether any files that might hereafter be found will yield new information that would materially alter the picture that has emerged. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the high public interest in this topic, I have directed that special arrangements be made to make publicly available the files and documents on which the reports are based. In addition to other material, these include about 400 files created in Vietnam and now in the custody of the Australian War Memorial. Some of the documents on these particular files are of foreign-mainly US-origin and the agreement of the originators is being sought to their public disclosure. Australian documents on those 400 files are also being examined prior to release to protect individual privacy and, if relevant and necessary, national security. Those cleared should soon be available for public inspection. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that all the documents, whether security classified or not, were examined and reported on by the Army team. Thus security considerations in no way affect the contents of the Army report. </PARA>
<PARA> In our efforts to ensure that our reconstruction of the events of those days is accurate, my Department sought from the US Department of Defense an assurance that the Army report does not contain information contrary to any they hold. They know of no information contained in US documents or reports which will contradict the findings of the Australian report. The US review of their Vietnam records is continuing, but at present, they have no information which would qualify this report. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department has co-operated in this by providing information to the Commonwealth Institute of Health, which is studying the possible effects of Vietnam service on Australian troops, to the Departments of Health and Veterans' Affairs, and to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment in its inquiry into pesticides. </PARA>
<PARA> The reports constitute a major work of reference for those bodies and I know that they will find them useful. They supplement information already given to the Senate Committee in evidence by officers of my Department and in written answers to questions from the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The source documents to these reports, other than the few restricted by privacy and security considerations, will be available to all these interested government agencies as well as to private bodies and individuals for further research. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the normal tabling distribution of the report, I am making copies available to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment , to Departments, to the Commonwealth Institute of Health and to interested persons outside the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Army report being a summary of the Vietnam files tells us nothing about any possible long-term effects of exposure to herbicides and the other chemicals. That subject was covered by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment in its report on 'Pesticides and the Health of Australian Vietnam Veterans', tabled last month. What this Army report covers is the extent of exposure to herbicides, and it will be noted that Australian troops in Vietnam, in fact, experienced relatively little exposure. The Government is determined to unravel the events of the past and to assess any possible implications for the welfare of Vietnam veterans and their dependants. This report represents a further major contribution to our knowledge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make one or two final remarks. Today in the debate on this statement in the House of Representatives the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Clyde Holding, saw fit to attack two members of the staff of my Department. I wish to reject out of hand in the strongest possible terms the insinuations which he made against those two officers. The Army report which I have just tabled publicly thanks Mr Manning in particular for the valuable assistance and advice which he provided in the course of the preparation of the report. It was he who first alerted the Department of Defence to the information in the records now presented. Probably he has the most familiarity with the records as a consequence of his researches in connection with Vietnam veterans. He was asked to help clarify many points of detail. Such co-operation between departments is normal. Mr Manning was of assistance, but the reports are on defence matters.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept your ruling of course, Mr Chairman. This is not relevant to my motion. The Australian Law Journal volume 56, No. 8, published in August 1982 turned its mind to the question of the external power of the Commonwealth. So that article becomes relevant to part (a) of my motion. As you, Mr Chairman, have pointed out regularly to the Senate, but some honourable senators do not seem to be able to grasp it, my motion is that clause 1 be postponed. The motion does not go any further than that. But in accordance with the general principles , my motion then goes further. To give an indication of why clause 1 should be postponed, I have set out the position in clauses (a) and (b) (1), (2), (3), and (4). I might just remind the Senate of what clause (a) of my motion says. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To take advice on the validity and Constitutional propriety of this legislation . </PARA>
<PARA>It may very well be that that advice is to the effect that in fact the legislation would be valid. It may be that the advice would be that legislation is constitutionally proper. Those are matters for those people who advise Senator Mason. But I have been putting to the Senate that that would not be so, that it would not be valid. But it may be, in the light of the article published in the Australian Law Journal, that I could be wrong. Of course, we know that Senator Evans is sure I am wrong. I do not necessarily think so. It may be that this view would be correct and for that reason I think it is fair and proper that I should expose to the Senate the views expressed in this article in the Australian Law Journal. He says that in the past majority cases have been decided and have since become the definitive law and asks why should that not happen here. That may be so, but I put it to the Senate that ultimately the view of the minority would be the view which would be the view that would be upheld. I also put it that if one were to apply the principles here exposed by the majority as well as the minority to the particular Bill we are discussing, the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill, the High Court of Australia would still find that the legislation was invalid, even under the principles put by the majority. However, let us look at what the article said in relation to this legislation. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The doctrine as to the range of the 'external affairs' power, subscribed to by the majority in the Koowarta case, may be epitomised as follows: Where matters have, by virtue of general multilateral Conventions or treaties, to which Australa is a party,-</PARA>
<PARA>(Quorum formed). I was explaining to the Senate that there is an alternative view to that which I have been putting to the Senate. That is, that it may be the article starts off with the words:</PARA>
<PARA> The decision of the High Court in the two cases of Koowarta v. Bjelke-Petersen and Ous; State of Queensland v. Commonwealth of Australia ((1982) 56 A.L.J.R. 625) now represents the final,-</PARA>
<PARA>That is interesting. They think it is the final. I would have thought that it is nowhere near the final-</PARA>
<PARA>or almost the final landmark authority on the reach of the Commonwealth Parliament's power as to 'external affairs' conferred by s. 51, P1. (xxix) of the Constitution, and also on the limits to the scope of that power. True it is that the result was achieved by the narrow majority of four to three-</PARA>
<PARA>It then indicates that the dissenting judges were the Chief Justice, Sir Harry Gibbs and Mr Justices Aickin and Wilson and that the majority in favour were Mr Justices Stephen, Mason, Murphy and Brennan. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>but similar close majorities have in the past definitively settled the law in important areas. </PARA>
<PARA>This, of course, is why Senator Evans so volubly puts this forward. That the external affairs power is wider in ambit than I would prefer to see. I was referring to this article in the Australian Law Journal in volume 56, No. 8 of August 1982 in which this matter is raised as a current topic. The article is epitomising the decision of the majority in the Koowarta case as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Where matters have, by virtue of general multilateral Conventions or treaties, to which Australia is a party, or by reason of customary international law, become a proper and genuine subject for co-operative international action, in which such international action the Commonwealth of Australia has a clearly discernible interest, legislation by the Commonwealth Parliament legitimately dealing with such matters or giving precise effect to the Commonwealth's obligations under the relevant multilateral Conventions or treaties, or under the relevant rules of customary international law, will be held valid as being supported by the external affairs power, notwithstanding that the legislation concerned may impinge otherwise upon the constitutional powers of the Australian States, and accordingly State Governments and the citizens of the States will be bound to comply with the provisions of such Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the Senate to that epitome, as it is called, for the reasons of the decision. But even there I think it is said that there may be an impinging upon the rights of State governments. They do not say that where there is literally no relationship to the exercise of an external affairs power, the legislation would be valid. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the article refers to legislation by the Commonwealth Parliament legitimately dealing with such matters or giving precise effects to the Commonwealth's obligations. Of course, at this stage the Commonwealth has no obligations because at this stage the nomination of the South West of Tasmania is still only a submission to the World Heritage Committee. It has not yet reached the stage where it has been accepted. So it becomes necessary to consider whether the exercise of this power would be held as being valid and supported by the external affairs power when in fact there is no legitimate dealing with a matter which gives precise effect to the Commonwealth's obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The article goes on to deal in particular with the problems of Mr Koowata and ultimately the court upheld the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. Senator Evans has regularly asked me for my views in relation to that Act. Of course, I accept the High Court's decision in relation to that Act. But that is irrelevant. If Senator Evans would apply his mind to being a lawyer on this subject instead of being a mouthpiece for I am not quite sure what, he would realise that the mere fact that the Racial Discrimination Act is valid does not necessarily mean that this World Heritage Properties Protection Bill is valid. Of course, I accept that it is valid and I accept the majority decision of the High Court of Australia, even though I prefer the views of the minority decision . The article then gives the details of Mr Koowarta's case. It goes on to state- these are important matters for honourable senators to consider:</PARA>
<PARA> In the result, in the application of the doctrine epitomised previously, the High Court by the majority referred to held that the challenge to the validity of the provision failed because the provision represented valid enactments in pursuance of the Commonwealth Parliament's legitimate exercise of the external affairs power conferred by section 51 (xxix). </PARA>
<PARA>The article then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> No prior decision of the High Court had gone so far as to enlarge to this extent the scope of the external affairs power. The prior high water mark of the reach of that power had been contained in dicta by Mr Justice Evatt and Mr Justice McTiernan in 1936. </PARA>
<PARA>That was some 46 years ago. In other words, this article is saying that in 1936 we reached the high water mark in the extent of that power when Mr Justice Evatt and Mr Justice McTiernan made some dicta, some observations irrelevant to the decision about the extent of that power back in 1936. The article goes on to explain what those dicta were. It states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am once again speaking in support of Senator Lewis's motion and instruction to Senator Mason to take advice on the validity and constitutional propriety of this legislation. I understand that, whilst it is possible to address oneself to all of the paragraphs of the instruction, we are still basically discussing paragraph (a). It seems to me plain that Senator Mason's Bill is deficient. Senator Lewis, in seeking to amend it sensibly, has made suggestion after suggestion. However, there has been no response from Senator Mason who, it seems, is determined that this Bill should go through with all of its deficiencies. To a very large extent those deficiencies are well known. They certainly are well known to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I submit that the passage of such a Bill is not something that will add to the repute of this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is plain that Senator Mason in his Bill has forgotten completely the normal procedures that would need to be followed in order to seek Commonwealth co- operation. I think in part there is a suggestion in Senator Lewis's instruction to Senator Mason that seeking that co-operation would have been a far more sensible procedure than for Senator Mason's Bill to be put forward in its present form. It is obvious that Senator Mason's Bill has been drawn up in complete disregard of what has normally happened in the past. For instance, the Commonwealth surely would be forced to hold a referendum on a matter like this if sufficient people in Australia were vitally interested in imposing the Commonwealth's will on the State of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators Lewis's suggestion to Senator Mason is designed to avoid such difficulties as would arise. In terms of co-operation with the States, quite a useful precedent has been set, one which Senator Mason could have taken into account. Senator Lewis certainly has done so. The Commonwealth and the States have come together before and agreed on common efforts in regard to environmental areas. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator Harradine</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ7">Senator MARTYR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely, and I am coming to that. The Bill overrides all of the precedents that have been set for State and Commonwealth co-operation in the achievement of reasonable ends. The Bill jumps all of those constitutional precedents, jumps completely the logical progression of understandings between the Commonwealth and States in matters such as this and overrides, like a battering ram, the small State of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lewis has tried as best as he can. He has suggested that the Bill be re -drafted. He has detailed how it may be made appropriate for acceptance by the Senate. It seems that Senator Mason is not really interested in listening to the suggestions that we make, all of which involve co-operation. We are only interested in seeking to produce in the Senate something of which we can all be proud. We do not want to see a situation in which these proposals are put to the Senate and, by a bare few, the Senate can be brought into disrepute because a Bill is deficient in essential law. Other speakers have made that point time after time. It is a tribute to our patience that we keep making these suggestions to Senator Mason. We do so because we are concerned about the reputation of the Senate in regard to producing good legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am surprised that people who are as well read and well versed in constitutional law as is Senator Evans and my colleague Senator Missen should seem to be co-operating in allowing a Bill such as this, Senator Mason's Bill, to be the product of this Senate. There is no way in which the constitutional situation in this country can be changed by the use of the battering ram. Senator Lewis has alluded to certain cases before the High Court which have broken down, very gradually, some of the sovereignty of the States, some of the powers of the States, in certain matters. I submit that it is much better if that legal progression, which allows the Commonwealth to assert its authority in certain limited areas, is encouraged. It is better if the Senate, in particular, as the senior legislative body of the Parliament, does not indulge in steamroller tactics, in tactics of coercion, as Senator Harradine has said, which will bring this chamber into disrepute. Obviously, honourable senators opposite disapprove totally of the actions of people such as Senator Lewis and I and various others who have spoken on these amendments. They disapprove strongly of what we are trying to do, but we are merely trying to prevent the Senate from doing something that, in our view, would represent an ultimate foolishness. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments and wise advice of Senator Lewis are continually rejected. I again appeal to Senator Mason, and to those who are enthusiastic about his Bill, to accept some of the proposals made by Senator Lewis in his suggested amendments. Then we can have a Bill that will not upset the Senate and will probably be the subject of some co-operation. </PARA>

The late Sir Robert Menzies, in his book Central Power in the Australian Commonwealth, questioned the extended view of the external affairs power adopted by Evatt and McTiernan in the Burgess case as the Evatt doctrine, and subjected it to a critical examination, making various rhetorical queries as to the consequences of its full application.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nuclear fuels would be a subject that would be dear to the heart of Senator Gietzelt. The statement continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>-the generation and use of nuclear energy and ionising radiations in order thereby to be able unchallengably to implement international decisions and arrangements in the nuclear area. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in 1959 a Commonwealth joint parliamentary committee was so concerned about the weakness of the external affairs power that it recommended that the Constitution be changed to enable the Commonwealth to pass this sort of legislation because it was of the view-that is, the Committee was of the view- that the power was not wide enough. The article then goes on to say how joyfully Senator Evans welcomed the judgment when it was published on 11 May this year. It then summarises the principal general points about the external affairs power which received authoritative endorsement by the High Court. As I said, I am trying to be unbiased in this matter and to give to the Committee the views of the majority decision of the High Court, which is the broadest interpretation of this power. I am reading from this summary of them for the benefit of other senators. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) section 51 clause (xxix) confers a plenary, distinct and independent grant of power; that is to say, a power not merely ancillary to or restricted by the other powers possessed by the Parliament under section 51. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting point. I do not think it is any great constitutional point; it is one that most constitutional lawyers would have accepted a long time ago. But still it is made in this decision. The summary continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) any subject matter may constitute an external affair, provided that the manner in which it is treated involves in some way a relationship with other countries or with persons or things outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the summary in this article of the views of the High Court, which the author of the article believes are fairly put by the decision. For those who do not appreciate it, when the High Court gives a judgment it is not a single judgment as each judge is entitled to and frequently does give his own decision and so sometimes one ends up with six or seven exposes of what the law is all about. That makes it very difficult to summarise what the law actually is because there might be six or seven different interpretations. The author of this summary said that:</PARA>
<PARA> A fair summary of this is that any subject matter may constitute an external affair . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Who could argue with that? That would certainly enable this legislation to be valid. He then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . provided that the manner in which it is treated involves in some way a relationship with other countries or with persons or things outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>How could it possibly be said that the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill , which deals specifically with a part of Tasmania, in some way or other deals with persons or things outside Australia. That is why I have repeatedly put to Senator Mason-I put it to him again as strongly as I can-that he ought to take this Bill away and get some advice on its validity before he subjects the people of Australia to the putting through of this legislation. Imagine all the rigmarole we would have to go through. Senator Mason talks about the expense of me speaking in this chamber. The expense of a High Court judgment in which the validity of this Bill was considered would be 20 times the figures that he has been yelling at me across the chamber tonight. The author of this article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The external affairs power is to be construed liberally, not narrowly and pedantically, provided, however, that its exercise is not related to matters of purely domestic concern. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the Committee to that statement again. The power is to be interpreted liberally-we accept that-but its exercise must not be related to matters of purely domestic concern. Surely this proposal of Senator Mason's, this Bill, relates to matters of purely domestic concern. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The power is, however, to be exercised within established limits-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) like all other powers given by section 51 of the Constitution, it is subject to this Constitution so that the grant of such power must be read as subject to the restraints upon legislative power imposed by other sections of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) an exercise of the power would not be valid if it contravened some basic features of the Constitution and of the Federation; for example, if it operated to prevent a State or States from continuing to exist and function as such. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is clearly indicated that the exercise of the power must not prevent the States from operating in accordance with the federation. The summary continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) It could not be exercised so as to amend the Constitution and thus to conflict with the power of amendment conferred by section 128 of that instrument . </PARA>
<PARA> (d) A statute enacted in order to give effect to a treaty concluded by the Government merely as a means of conferring legislative power that is colourable and not bona fide could not be supported by clause (xxix) of section 51 of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of the majority which Senator Evans has been pushing to me across the chamber as the view that I ought to be talking about. He suggests that I should not talk about the view of the dissenting judges. I suggest to the chamber and I suggest again to Senator Mason, if only he would listen to me, that even within that interpretation his proposed Act, the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill, would not be valid. If it is carried, ultimately it will have to be subjected to review by the High Court at enormous expense to the people of Australia because the people of Australia will be paying all sides-the judges, the plaintiffs, the defendants and everyone involved-in order to discover what I have just told the Committee, that this Bill is invalid. I say again to Senator Mason that he should take to his heart the words of Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs in relation to the exercise of this power, as summarised in the headnote which says:</PARA>
<PARA> A law which gives effect within Australia to an international agreement will only be valid under section 51 (xxix) if it is with respect to a matter which itself can be described as an external affair. Any subject may constitute an external affair if the manner in which it is treated in some way involves a relationship with other countries or with persons or things outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I again quote from the Chief Justice, who in fact was quoting Oliver:</PARA>
<PARA> A constitution would cease to be federal if the central government, without consultation with the states, could enter into any treaty and by so doing increase the legislative powers of the central government at the expense of the state legislatures. If the treaty power can cut across all reserved powers and interdict the powers of the member states, then there are no real powers reserved to internal sovereignties. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly that is what is proposed in this Bill. That is why I once again beg Senator Mason to adopt the proposal I have suggested to him-that clause 1 be postponed, that he take the Bill away and seek legal advice on its validity. He should consider the constitutional propriety of this legislation, which rides rough-shod over the views of a constituent part of the federation and should then come back here and explain to it whether he is going to go on with the Bill or whether he is going to withdraw it. He may even be able to produce some other form of Bill. </PARA>

I quote from the last sentence of its report on this Bill:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the absence of any clear guidelines in the Bill as to the precise scope of the proscribed actions referred to in clause 6, the Committee draws this clause to the attention of the Senate under principle 1 (a) (i) in that it might be regarded as trespasssing unduly on personal rights and liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder how much members of this chamber really are concerned about civil liberties. Yesterday Senator Chipp threatened 23 members of parliament whose seats would be lost with an electoral swing of less than 3 per cent. The civil liberties of those members of parliament are threatened by Senator Chipp. If we read the Hansard we see that Senator Chipp very clearly threatens those members that if, as he would say, they do not kowtow to his demands, he will take action . Action will be taken against them, and there will be considerable lobbying to put those members-- (Quorum formed). As I was saying, Senator Chipp has threatened those 23 Government members of parliament. He has said that they will be the target--</PARA>

The postponement of the clause is a matter on which the Senate could be influenced by a whole series of different considerations. One of the considerations which have been put before the Committee by Senator Walters is that one view has been adopted by the Australian Democrats with respect to pushing for action on one issue, and a quite different course of action, a quite different approach, is being adopted with respect to the dams issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am again supporting Senator Lewis's motion to postpone consideration of clause 1 of Senator Mason's Bill. Senator Walters was quite obviously supporting what Senator Lewis has proposed. Above a lot of noise, most of which was irritating and was designed to disturb her to throw her off the point, she was supporting Senator Lewis's motion. Mr Temporary Chairman, I have to make this point with you. It seems to me here that if one agrees with Senator Chipp and Senator Mason about this Bill, everything is fine; there is no problem. One is not subjected to a continual flow of disturbance and interjection. The same thing applies to other honourable senators opposite, who have just determined that those of us who appear to be a minority are just not going to be heard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I insist that what I am saying is germane to the Bill, because embodied in what Senator Lewis has tried to say in this motion are those individual rights and individual liberties which we all enjoy as citizens of States and of this Commonwealth. Senator Lewis has sought to ensure that these important things are retained and that this Bill of Senator Mason, this attempt to batter into submission those of us who believe that the States have some rights, should not prevail. Obviously Senator Mason has not taken much cognisance-his Bill shows it -of some of the constitutional and legal history that Senator Lewis has been drawing to out attention. I draw Senator Mason's attention to section 61, the executive power, in the Constitution. The exercise of this executive power was important for the establishment of departments such as the Department of Education and the successive Commonwealth departments which have dealt with the environment-currently it is the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Commonwealth has no direct legislative control in these areas it can set up an administrative structure to co-ordinate activities with the States, to keep statistics, to research and advise and to monitor grants made to the States pursuant to section 96 of the Constitution. I think this is important. These are some of the essential features that Senator Lewis has sought to draw to Senator Mason's attention-quite unsuccessfully so far. Section 61 is also an important basis of power when considered in conjunction with the concept of the national implied power. I think Senator Lewis has referred to the AAP case in which Mr Justice Mason considered that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation was a legitimate exercise of the executive power. He said in that case:</PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion, there is to be deduced from the existence and character of the Commonwealth as a national government and from the presence of sections 51 and 61 a capacity to engage in enterprises and activities peculiarly adapted to the government of a nation and which cannot otherwise be carried on for the benefit of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>I submit that in no way does Senator Mason's Bill fit in with that interpretation of Mr Justice Mason. Indeed, had he looked at some of these precedents, his Bill would have been more constructive. I assure Senator Mason that he would not have had the trouble had his Bill been better presented and better researched. </PARA>
<PARA> As I keep insisting, we are trying only to save the Senate from embarrassment. We do not want to be infected with the professional incompetence displayed by Senator Mason. The Senate is going to be blamed for this, and people not present here at the moment have suggested that we are trying to make a laughing-stock of the Senate. Indeed, we are not. We are not trying to make a laughing-stock of the Senate; we are trying to save the Senate and the reputation of the Senate. The only way in which we can do that is to amend this ridiculous Bill and to try to give it some reasonable, logical and legal presentation so that it may be acceptable to the people of Australia. Senator Lewis has made his best efforts and this stubborn man over here will not bend. He is absolutely intractable. Surely the power to convince rests in the Senate chamber. It is our objective to convince each other, particularly those on the other side, of the justice of our cause. Senator Lewis in his motion has tried to do this. For some reason obscure to us, we are not able to make our point. I regret that deeply. I say to you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that the Senate will be a laughing stock if this Bill is passed by the Senate. It is a disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be helpful if I could at least comment briefly. It might enable us to make some progress. The fundamental concern which has been expressed about the Bill is its possible impact upon the federal nature of our Constitution. The view has been expressed by the High Court of Australia and others that the federal nature of our Constitution requires that limits be imposed on the broad power to implement international obligations seemingly conferred by the Constitution. That is a very valid concern to be expressed by the Committee. Some honourable senators feel that it could have been expressed more briefly but the fact is that it is fundamental to the Australian constitutional arrangements and, therefore, it is quite reasonable that there should be a high level of Senate interest in the matter. It does appear, however , that views about this aspect are relatively fixed. Some honourable senators feel that the request is unreasonable. Other honourable senators feel that, in view of the importance of this matter and in view of the technical problems about which Senator Peter Baume talked in his second reading speech, it really is incumbent on the Australia Democrats to pause, to take further and better advice and to redraft the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that the eloquence of any honourable senator will change anyone' s view at this late stage. I suspect that we have reached the point where the argument has solidified and cemented us into our respective positions. Therefore , I suggest respectfully to the Committee that we should test the temper of the Committee by taking a vote on this motion. The fact is that other amendments are to be proposed. I understand that the Australian Labor Party is moving at least two amendments. The position of the Government in relation to those amendments-I do not wish to take a lot of the time of the Committee if we deal with them-is that whilst we retain our fundamental concern about the Bill, which has been expressed by other speakers and by Senator Peter Baume, we do believe that the amendments proposed by the Opposition improve the Bill, although they do not make it totally acceptable. I indicate on behalf of the Government that we propose to support those amendments in Committee. It is a reserved sort of support but it would mean that the Bill would be in a--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I have inadvertently misled my senatorial colleagues slightly in what I have said. There has been a slight amount of cross-purpose between the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) and me. He is discussing the matter at the moment. When I was on my feet before in light of the fact that the Opposition was moving certain amendments which we support as being amendments which would improve the Bill, I urged all members of the Committee to proceed to a vote on this as soon as possible. The implications of that from a procedural point of view, I think, were clearly understood around the chamber. At that time I made the comments on the basis that Senator Harradine clearly indicated that he would refuse leave for the third reading tonight. He has made that quite clear and I understand that he does not propose to change his mind. The point on which I had no information when I spoke before was that apparently there are two occasions on which leave is required. One is on the reporting of progress and the other is on the third reading. It will not assist us for the rest of this evening if senators on either side proceed under a misapprehension of each other's intentions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I raise a point of order. You quite properly said earlier that the Standing Order which disciplines a senator who indulges in repetition has never been used, to your knowledge, in this place. I suggest that it is no reason why it should not be used now because by Senator Lewis's own admission his opening remarks-I do not know whether you heard them because you were negotiating with your deputy-were: 'I will now restate the views for the benefit of those Opposition members who did not understand the views I stated earlier'. That is a simple statement of intent of repetition. I put it to you in clear terms that this Standing Order needs to be invoked not just because of what he said, that he would restate his argument in identical terms, but because of the context of this whole argument. Senator Harradine, Senator Lewis, Senator Martyr, Senator MacGibbon, Senator Crichton-Browne and Senator Walters are determined that this Bill should not go to the House of Representatives while it is still sitting. They will do anything under any circumstances to prevent that course of action. That is the clear tactic, Mr Chairman, which should now be manifest. When an honourable senator gets up and openly states that he is going to flout a Standing Order-that was his opening remark-I do submit with great respect that you ought to act.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, on the point of order: Senator Chipp made two points in his point of order. First, he criticised Senator Lewis for suggesting that he was going to restate a particular proposition. Senator Chipp suggested that under the Standing Orders that was repetition, though he did not say tedious repetition. The second point that he made, which was totally irrelevant, was that certain honourable senators had engaged in certain tactics in this place. I submit that on both counts there is no point of order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the latter point, all I was doing was trying to get some answers. There has been no answer at all from Senator Mason to the matters I have raised. I submit that a restatement of a proposition need not be a repetition of that proposition . One can restate a proposition in different terms. Quite often lawyers are heard to say: 'I will restate that proposition in different terms'. Under those circumstances, I believe there is no point of order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. When I was interrupted-the interruption has taken some seven and a half minutes of my time to speak-I was saying that there are two sections to the instructions to Senator Mason proposed in my motion. I have proposed that clause 1 be postponed as an instruction to Senator Mason, firstly, so that he might take advice on the validity and constitutional propriety of this legislation. The reasons are very simple. We ask Senator Mason to consider this matter to ensure that the exercise of this power does not destroy the federal character of the Constitution of Australia. It is a simple proposition. Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A constitution would cease to be federal if the central government, without consultation with the states, could enter into any treaty and by so doing increase the legislative powers of the central government at the expense of the state legislatures. If the treaty power can cut across all reserved powers and interdict the powers of the member states, then there are no real powers reserved for the internal sovereignties. </PARA>
<PARA>What he is saying, in effect, is that we are thereby destroying the Federation. Now it may be that some senators and members of the House of Rep resentatives would want to destroy the Federa tion, but I certainly do not and that is why I have joined in this debate. I have tried to make it per fectly clear that I am quite opposed to the con struction of the dams in Tasmania, but I am sin cerely concerned about the rights of the States. I see Senator Button over there is looking at me. I am sincerely concerned about the deficiencies in this Bill and the rights of the States as imposed by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the second part of my instruc tions to Senator Mason as proposed in my motion-that is, to redraft the Bill so that it no longer contains the inadequacies and ambiguities identified in the seventeenth report of the Stand ing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I have indicated to the Committee that subsequently I would consider this clause. I now consider sub-clause (b) (1). Subsequently I will come to sub-clauses (b) (2), (b) (3) and (b) (4). The seven teenth report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills clearly indicates the nature of the deficiencies of the proposed legislation. The re port says:</PARA>
<PARA> The clause-</PARA>
<PARA>I am referring to clause 6, the protection of properties. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Chipp told us last week that the whole purpose of this Bill was to attack some alleged vandalism in Tasmania. I have repeatedly pointed out to the Committee that the Bill goes much further than that. It is the extent of the Bill which creates the problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, as foreshadowed, I will be directing questions to the senator in charge of the Bill, Senator Mason. I note that under clause 3 'Convention' is defined as 'the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage referred to in the preamble to this Act'. Senators will note the words 'referred to in the preamble to this Act'. I am just wondering why it does not state 'refered to in the Schedule'. Does that mean that the text of the Convention can be changed at some stage and, despite what is contained in the schedule to the Bill, that will change certain aspects of the Act ipso facto?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just had a very brief debate on clause 3. In fact, one could not dignify what happened with the term 'debate'. Now that we have reached clause 4, I wish to make a couple of comments about what has just occurred.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not mention that to start a row. I mention it because I want to suggest that it would be desirable at least to allow adequate debate on each clause so that senators wishing to raise matters of concern could have a chance to put them on record. A number of senators have indicated concern about the drafting of this legislation. It is undoubtedly one of the Senate's functions to be concerned about those matters, as it is also a concern of this Senate to be concerned about constitutional issues. The point I wanted to underline was that in this case we had a gag before anybody had spoken in response to the matter which was raised. I merely wish to suggest that if it is the wish of a majority that there be further gags moved in the Committee stages, they might have the decency to permit an airing of the points of concern on the clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put that suggestion very seriously because I believe that all honourable senators, after a very long day of sitting, would like to see this Bill dealt with expeditiously. It is certainly my wish to intervene in the debate as little as possible to ensure that that occurs, and I do not propose to intervene any more than I absolutely have to. But I respectfully suggest to the majority of senators who have just supported a gag motion that they should permit queries and matters of concern to be raised on these clauses if we are to do justice to the role of the Senate in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask Senator Mason a couple of questions about this clause as he is in charge of the Bill. Unfortunately, senators do not have a memorandum before them explaining each clause, which is normal then Bills are presented to the Parliament. We do not have that; so I am forced, as are other honourable senators, to ask the person in charge of the Bill what certain aspects, words and clauses mean. With regard to clause 4, I ask Senator Mason: What do the words 'doing of an act' mean in clause 4 (2)? Do those words relate to clause 3 (2) which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the doing of an act or taking action by a person includes a reference to the doing of an act or the taking of action by a person in association with or for or on behalf of another person or other persons. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important question. We are talking about a person's civil rights and liberties. Does this mean in practical terms that if this legislation is passed, a Hydro-Electric Commission worker-a member of a trade union, who is performing a task in accordance with works authorised under a State Act of Parliament-is the person who, under those circumstances, would be liable? That is a very important question. I want to know what is meant by the 'doing of an act' in that context. Does it refer to the doing of an act prejudicial to a property? This leads to my second question. When are the mechanisms of the Bill triggered? Are they triggered when the property is submitted under Article 11 of the Convention or are they triggered when, as Senator Tate said, in his view, the property is accepted by the World Heritage Commission?</PARA>

I remind the Senate of what those honourable senators said in respect of that question. Senator Tate raised a very important question about the time that any power arises; that is, whether it is at the time of listing-in accordance with his words; it is really at the time of sub- mission, according to the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I would like to raise a couple of other matters. The legislation deals with property submitted by the Commonwealth under Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection of the World's Cultural and Natural Heritage. What would happen if the actual Convention were changed? Would that automatically change the essential nature of this Bill? For example, take the cultural heritage aspect. According to the Convention, cultural heritage includes groups of buildings. Does Senator Mason believe that this Bill would apply to the Rocks area, the Opera House or the Harbour Bridge in Sydney if the Commonwealth nominated them for listing. I ask honourable senator's to bear in mind that their nomination had previously been rejected. If they were submitted again, would their very submission-which has already been rejected-under the Bill be sufficient to trigger off its mechanism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine is bringing up a grab bag of whatever he can get his hands on. I think he is really raising these points, not through any genuine desire for information but because he wishes to prolong and delay the situation. How- ever, I would like initially, of course, to cover his previous point. With the indulgence of the Committee, I would like to answer his point on clause 3. It does not really matter whether we are referring to the World Heritage Committee in the preamble or the schedule of the Bill. The honourable senator spoke about groups of buildings. This is a quibble. If a group of buildings was submitted it would be submitted responsibly and with due thought. If, indeed, it was submitted and accepted and it became part of the world heritage, the Bill would apply.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was in inverted commas, Mr Chairman. It was a quotation from an earlier work. The point I wish to make is that again we face the prospect of the gag before there can be any proper raising of the issues concerning this clause. I just want to point out that clause 5 purports to bind the Crown in right of the Commonwealth and hence it is a clear imposition on or an attempt to put obligations upon the Commonwealth with respect to the matter that the legislation deals with, namely, the position in South West Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a very odd discrepancy in behaviour here. There is not only the discrepancy within the Australian Democrats who have told us they will never gag -never, apparently, until today; we are going to have no more of that-but also there is some discrepancy between what is happening here tonight and what the Australian Labor Party did when it had the opportunity to do something. The Labor Party was in government in Tasmania. We know that the Labor Party here has its organic links to the Labor Party in Tasmania; we know that the Labor Party in Tasmania pursued this dam; we know that the Labor Party has the power in intervene federally in all sorts of cir- cumstances; and we know that the Labor Party did absolutely nothing to try to take the course that it is now seeking through this legislation when it had the power so to do. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we have the nice situation where it is fine to come in here and vote when one has no power and no authority but when the Labor Party had both the power and the authority, it not only did nothing but also it pursued the objective of this dam. That is the fact of the matter and it is something about which there ought to be a clear message to the electors. Why is it that when Tasmania had a Labor Government no effort was made by the Labor Party here to turn back what the Government was seeking to achieve? Why is it that it is only when the Labor Party is in a position of powerlessness, when it cannot in fact affect events, that it suddenly takes this highly principled stand? I think there is something very odd in all of this and for that reason the Government opposes this clause. I am sure that all Government members will do likewise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition wishes to move an amendment to clause 6 of the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill 1982. I will explain briefly the purposes of the amendment. Clause 6 of the Bill makes it unlawful for a person to take action that would adversely affect the protection, conservation, presentation or rehabilitation of a property which is included, or which has been nominated for inclusion on the World Heritage List. By operation of the Bill and the Act Interpretation Act 'person' would include corporations and government bodies. Proposing to take the above action is also caught by clause 6, as is action taken in association with other 'persons' referred to in sub-clause 3 (2). The purpose of the amendment moved by the Opposition is to exclude from the action prescribed in clause 6 any action taken as a part of implementing a plan of management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously in a wilderness area there ought to be a plan of management and people engaged in implementing that plan of management should not, in our view, be considered to be contravening this provision. I believe that Senator Mason's purpose in this provision is to provide protection for the South West Tasmanian region. We agree that that protection should be provided in this way, but that legitimate activity arising from the implementation of a plan of management under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act ought not be excluded. Indeed, it is highly desirable that such a plan of management be implemented in the park area. I remind honourable senators that such a plan of management is now implemented in the Kakadu National Park in order to preserve, conserve and generally manage the park area under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. Similarly, a plan is being prepared for the Uluru National Park which again will be a Federal plan under the Federal Act-the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975-although Northern Territory Government agencies will be involved in the day to day implementation of that plan. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted that in the second reading debate there was some criticism of our amendment and an expression that our amendment would preclude the operation of a plan of management of the national park which was implemented by a State government. I point out to honourable senators who raised that objection that although there is an overriding Federal responsibility here, that Federal responsibility does not preclude co-operation with the Tasmanian State Government. If the Tasmanian State Government wished to be involved in the management of this area, then it could submit a plan of management to the Federal Government. If that were satisfactory-and being satisfactory would mean that it would include such things as the opportunity for public submissions, the opportunity for a statutory period during which objections could be laid before the authorities and so forth-then there could be agreement by the Federal Government that the State plan of management of the South West Tasmanian region could be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> In moving this amendment the Opposition is enabling the operation of a plan of management which would be either a Federal plan implemented under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, or, with a co-operative State government, a State plan which met the requirements and indeed the responsibilities of the Federal Government. I point out that because the area provided for in this legislation is an area which has been nominated for inclusion on the World Heritage List, there is not only a Federal Government right but also a Federal Government responsibility to ensure that any plan of management is in keeping with Federal objectives. I hope that that explanation has clarified the matter for honourable senators, particularly those who made some reference to this matter in the course of the debate. On behalf of the Opposition I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 4, clause 6, at end of clause, add the following new sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Nothing in this section shall render it unlawful for a person to do any act or take any action which is expressly or impliedly authorized by a zoning plan that has come into operation under the provisions of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 or a plan of management in force under the provisions of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, or any such zoning plan or management plan as may be provided under a law of the Commonwealth, including a law in respect of South West Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment and believe it clarifies some criticisms which were made by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in respect of this clause, as it does particularly identify plans of management that may be agreed. During my second reading speech I still expressed some criticism that it may not include State plans which had been approved by the Commonwealth, but I think on reflection that the words in the amendment, including 'management plans as may be provided for under a law of the Commonwealth' are probably wide enough to do that. In addition to that fact, Mr Murray Wilcox, Q.C., wrote a letter to me on 22 November relating to the criticisms which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee made, and, not by way of a concluded determination but by way of floating, raised some possible difficulties. He answered these in a letter in which he sets out that the Australian Labor Party amendment does largely alter the situation, and moreover, that there is no real problem. I have shown the letter to the Minister, to Senator Harradine and to the Opposition spokesman. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard this letter which relates to his answers to these criticisms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Selbourne Chambers, 174 Phillip Street, Sydney 22 November, 1982 Senator Alan Missen,</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Missen,</PARA>
<PARA> Penny Figgis has mentioned to me her recent discussion with you relating to the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill. I am grateful to you for your invitation to comment upon the notes on the Bill of your Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It is correct that cl. 6 of the Bill is couched in general language providing ' 'little identification of the scope of unlawful action with which the Bill would deal''. The foreshadowed ALP amendment, designed to add a new subclause (2) goes some distance towards overcoming this objection. The effect of that subclause, of course, would be that management plans could be prepared in respect of particular properties and any act which was in accordance with a management plan would be lawful. I think that the result of the additional subclause would be to encourage the preparation, and adoption under Commonwealth law, of suitable management plans and this would be an obvious advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in the meantime, I doubt that there is a real problem. The Bill does not, of course, create any criminal liability. If it were alleged, in a particular case, that a particular activity was likely adversely to affect an area then it would be a matter for the Federal Court to determine whether this claim was made out. This would involve the court considering the nature of the threat and whether that threat was likely to have adverse consequences. If it were found that there was such a threat then the court would make an order restraining the defendant from taking the action. Provided that he obeyed the order he would be at no risk. The situation is similar to that found in numerous statutes where general formulae have to be used, allowing the courts to work out the situation in particular cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I doubt whether it would ever be possible to formulate an appropriate and comprehensive list of likely threats. Even in relation to the existing properties on the World Heritage List or nominated for the World Heritage List there is a wide variation in the nature of possible threats. As the number and variety of properties on the List increases so will the nature of the threats they might suffer. For this reason, as it seems to me, the power of the court must be put in fairly general terms but with a provision encouraging the creation of zoning plans in respect of particular properties as soon as possible . </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's comment on cl. 7 points out that court action may be taken against a person who had no intention of damaging a property but whose actions might be regarded as having an adverse effect. This is, of course, correct but, as you would know, it is the invariable practice to call upon a person said to be in breach of a statute to desist before actually commencing court proceedings . He then has an opportunity to assess his position before becoming involved in any court proceedings. The defendant would not be at risk as to costs unless, after consideration of his position and taking any desired advice, he decided to persist with his claim and if he then unsuccessfully argued that the action would not be likely to have an adverse effect. Under no conditions, of course, would he be at a greater risk than in respect of legal costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee raises the question of failure to preserve or restore a property. This is done on the assumption that ''the doing of an act can include the failure to do an act''. With respect, I doubt the validity of that assumption. The Bill was deliberately framed so as to confine the unlawful behaviour in cl. 6 to circumstances where a person does an act or takes an action likely adversely to affect a property. One does not, of course, do an act by failing to do some other act and I see no basis upon which the court could hold that an owner was liable for failing to preserve or restore a property. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the above comments may be of some assistance to members of your Committee. Please use them as you see fit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason for my rising before Senator Harradine, who I know wishes to move amendments to the amendment, is that I am a great believer in Pavlovian psychology. Five gags in a row were moved immediately after Senator Harradine spoke so one can expect the same sort of treatment. I figured I might not get a chance to contribute to the Committee unless I spoke before him. I do not say that by way of hoping that he will have the gag moved but merely out of weary expectation after the antics of the last hour. I just want to indicate, as I did in the opening stage of the Committee debate, that the Government proposes to support the Opposition amendment as one which improves the Bill. It is not an amendment which we believe makes the Bill acceptable; there are many other elements of the Bill which would require attention and that has been made clear in the debate and I do not wish to labour the point. But I would want it to be part of the Committee record that we would be supporting the Opposition amendment because we see it as a significant improvement on what is contained in the original Bill. I will, of course, have to await Senator Harradine's explanation of his foreshadowed amendment in the Committee stage, but as I understand the amendment, without having heard it, I also anticipate that the Government would support his amendment to the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Government is in accord on this matter and supports the Australian Labor Party amendment which was discussed by me with the Labor Party some little time ago. It is a positive improvement to the Bill and we are pleased to have it brought to us and moved by the Labor Party. We are pleased to see it have an input to this legislation. The Australian Democrats by no means regard themselves as the fount of all wisdom. We think that it is a proper pursuit of the business of the Senate for honourable senators to think diligently about legislation which they disagree with and to bring forward amendments. Those amendments ought to be tested by discussion in this place and passed or otherwise. If they find approval with the Senate the legislation will be passed; if not, it will not be passed. We see that as a very proper course of events in connection with this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I intend to be extremely brief in my comments because I am appalled at the enormous sums of public money which have been wasted in the terrifying filibustering on this Bill. I think that well over 10 hours has been taken over the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill and I am not prepared to compromise extensively with anybody who wants to quibble where I am convinced that there is a quibble. We approve of the Labor Party's amendment to the clause . Senator Missen raised the point of State plans. My advice is that we can include State plans approved by the Commonwealth and this of course would be the reasonable and proper procedure. I do not want to say more than that now. Senator Harradine must, of course, move his amendments. I do not see much virtue in them at the moment but I am sure he will be trying very hard to convince all of us of their virtue when he speaks. </PARA>

During the time we have debated this measure there has been no attempt by Senator Mason, nor by any other honourable senators supporting this measure, to answer the questions that have been raised. Now we see the shadow senator in charge of this Bill, Mr Murray Wilcox, having a letter introduced into this Parliament and incorporated in Hansard. At least the shadow senator who, presumably, was responsible for the drafting of this Bill has a document incorporated in Hansard. I have a copy of it. I should like a little time to go over it to assess-with assistance, of course-the merits or otherwise of what has been stated by the President of the Australian Conservation Foundation. But it really is extraordinary that Senator Mason, the senator in charge of this Bill, is unable to answer a question and a shadow senator from outside this place has a letter incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now raise a couple of questions about clause 6 of the Bill. Of course this clause first of all refers to a peson doing-or proposing to do-an act as being in breach of this Act. I ask Senator Mason: What precisely does he mean by a person proposing to take an act? That really smacks of thought control. I should like to have a response from Senator Mason as to why those words are included in this Bill. </PARA>

I would have thought that this was a matter for the discretion of the courts within the context of this legislation. The only intention is that a person can be told not to do something and if they do it they are in breach of this proposed Act. If a person merely proposes, the degree of damage which they could create does not exist, but their intention is there to be taken some note of. It would be improper not to have that provision in the Bill. To do so would be to infer a situation where damage would actually be done to valuable properties of the Commonwealth when that might have been prevented. I think this is a reasonable situation. I am not particularly concerned with Senator Harradine's amendments. I think there is no reason why we should not accept them. I do not mind accepting them.

<PARA> (3) Amendment No. (1), proposed new sub-clause 6 (2), leave out 'the Commonwealth, including a law in respect of South West Tasmania', insert 'a State after consultation between that State and the Commonwealth'. </PARA>
<PARA>The third amendment is a much more important amendment. It takes up a point that was made by Senator Peter Rae when speaking to the reference motion. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that what occurs as a result of this legislation is done with the co-operation of not only the Tasmanian Government but the Tasmanian Parliament. Under this provision, the machinery of this Bill applies in a coercive fashion to the State of Tasmania. There is nothing in the Bill which encourages, let alone requires, co-operation with the Tasmanian Government or with the Tasmanian Parliament. In that situation, the amendment proposed by the Opposition is quite different from the practice insofar as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act are concerned. This fact is indicated by a release on 17 November from the Australian Heritage Commission. The Commission indicated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission notes that the propriety of the Commowealth involvement in an area of world heritage significance is being disputed in certain quarters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission would only wish to point out that the Commonwealth is involved already in two areas on the World Heritage List, that is Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory and the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, and operates with co-operation from the Territory-and State governments. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that there is co-operation between the Commonwealth and the State governments. There is no other purpose than that. What the amendment seeks to do is to exclude from the Australian Labor Party's amendment the words 'the Commonwealth, including a law in respect of South West Tasmania' and include therein the words 'a State after consultation between that State and the Commonwealth'. Senator Ryan's amendment would then read:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Nothing in this section shall render it unlawful for a person to do any act or take any action which is expressly or impliedly authorised by--</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate 'any such zoning plan or management plan as may be provided under a law of'--</PARA>
<PARA>a State after consultation between that State and the Commonwealth'. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that it is appropriate for this Senate to amend the amendment in that fashion because that entails a truly co-operative approach between Tasmania and the Commonwealth. Might I refer to what Senator Rae said. Senator Rae maintained his position in respect of this Bill. Indeed although admittedly he had reservations, he voted for the second reading of the Bill. His reason for doing so was that he had been involved and was committed to a Liberal Party policy commitment issued in 1975. On page 3122 of Hansard he is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> That policy statement referred to the fact that there had been discussions between Federal Liberals and State Liberals in relation to the question of South West National Park and that there was agreement. It stated: He quoted the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>These are his words:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is important that early action be taken to preserve this area. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The area referred to was a significantly enlarged South West National Park which was to be developed and maintained. The statement went on to point out that there was a need for co-ordination in relation to the park. It stated-</PARA>
<PARA>This is the important point that Senator Peter Rae made in respect of this matter-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commonwealth Government provide a special grant to assist the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service to develop a management plan for the existing South West National Park as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, I might mention that Senator Missen also made the point at page 3110. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think the major defects have been covered by the Australian Labor Party in its amendments. I see some defect in that if a State has a plan of management for parks and so forth there is no way at the moment that that could be protected from action. </PARA>

They are not the responsibility of State governments; they are the responsibility of the Commonwealth. Therefore, any plans must be approved by the Commonwealth Parliament. I hope I made that clear when I spoke to the previous amendment. Such plans could be proposed by a State government. There could be consultation. Senator Harradine says he is keen to establish consultative procedures and, indeed, we hope that there would be consultation and co-operation. But even if the plans are proposed by a State government they must be approved by the Federal Parliament. Senator Harradine's amendment rules out the Commonwealth legislative power and replaces it merely with an opportunity for consultation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to move an amendment to this clause, which provides the procedure to have the proposed Act enforced. It enables a person to bring proceedings in the Federal court for an order declaring that any actions or proposed actions breach the Act and can order a restraining of such a breach. Any person, including a government, may seek such a declaration from the court. It is not necessary that such a person have personal rights which would be affected by the breach of the Act. Although we agree with the effect of this clause, we believe that there should not only be an enabling provision but there should also be a responsibility for the Minister, when he has cause to believe that there has been a breach of an Act, to take action to bring the proceedings to court. The purpose of this amendment is to give teeth to this provision to make the Minister obliged to act to bring proceedings when there has been a breach.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The purpose of the first amendment is to withdraw from this Bill one of the most rigorous applications of the law available within Australia.

The two proposed amendments stand together. Honourable senators will recall that during the debate on the second reading, and also during the debate on my motion to refer the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, I referred to the fact that the Bill contains a rather draconian measure, the contempt of court provision. I said then that it appears that none other than Mr Murray Wilcox, the Chairman of the Australian Conservation Foundation, may have been responsible for the suggestion that the contempt powers should be available in relation to actions taken under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that this is a very serious situation indeed. I mentioned either earlier today or yesterday that the contempt powers were used against the managing editor of a newspaper in Adelaide and he was in fact gaoled. It is usual in contempt proceedings for judges to impose gaol sentences. I think that is a bit rough, when consideration is given to the fact that some of the people involved could well be embroiled in an argument between the States and the Commonwealth. They could find themselves before the Federal Court and put in gaol until they changed their minds. They could be proceeding in accordance with their obligations to a statutory authority which, in turn, is, proceeding with a project endorsed and authorised by the State Parliament. It would, to my mind be a travesty of justice if an employee of that authority were hauled before the Federal Court and, after refusing to obey an order, be liable to punishment for contempt under section 31 of that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned very frequently-I am advised that this is what happens in the majority of cases-contempt of court is one of the worst offences in the book . The courts throw the book at an offender and, normally speaking, he ends up in gaol. It may be said that the penalty I am proposing is not an adequate penalty for an offence. The penalty of $100 is the same as the penalty that applies under the State legislation in respect of the forthcoming blockade. Other senators may have opinions about what the penalty ought to be, but that is the reason that I have applied the $100 penalty in this amendment. I commend the amendment to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the two amendments. I think the carriage of these amendments would be quite disastrous to the effectiveness of the Bill. The Bill provides that the power of contempt should reside in the court. It is a power which resides normally in the Federal Court. Of course, it is subject to control by a superior court. It is an essential power to a court which is to restrain an action which may cause incalculable damage to a world heritage item, perhaps causing damage necessitating millions of dollars to be spent on reconstruction work or causing complete destruction of an item. I have no doubt that the contempt power would be exercised with sense and reason by the court and would be dependent upon the type of circumstances that arose. To take away that power would be to nobble the court in exercising a control over this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The alternative penalty of $100 is, of course, quite a contemptuous amount. It is something less than the penalty for shoplifting and it is an amount which would be no deterrent whatsoever to a person who might destroy something of vital importance and incalculable value to future generations. It is important to keep this power in the court, knowing that courts will act with reason and justice in this matter. I urge the Senate to reject these amendments. </PARA>

But, on behalf of the Government, I express reservation on the quite unlimited powers of punishment which are effectively contained in clause 7 as it stands. For that reason, the Government would prefer to see a writing down of the penalties in a more specific inclusion. In conclusion, I think if this were a Government Bill we would probably be seeking a penalty rather higher than that which is put forward by Senator Harradine. But since it is not a Government Bill and since we have the reservation about using the full extent of Federal Court power to punish for contempt, the Government will support the amendment moved by Senator Harradine.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would like to take this opportunity to indicate that this sort of open-ended extraordinary use of the contempt provisions is consistent with the single-minded approach of those who have advanced it. I remind the committee that the suggestion came from the President of the Australian Conservation Foundation in evidence given by him to the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania. If honourable senators would only refer to my speech at the second reading stage they would see what the President of the Australian Conservation Foundation said was as I quoted him in my speech. Again we see that honourable senators are not interested in civil liberties, the civil rights of the ordinary person. They are single-minded in their approach to these questions. They are not even prepared to balance the viewpoints of the State concerned. Let me remind honourable senators that it is their view-their single minded view-that it is South West Tasmania today, the world tomorrow and probably Western Australia the day after.</PARA></TALK.START>

It seems to me that if in fact there were such an extraordinary situation in which one person certified something and another person certified something else , other evidence would have to be produced. The clause states that such evidence is evidence of what is in the certificate. It does not say that it is conclusive evidence, or that it brings the matter to an end. It just means that if a case against someone is to be proven-and this is a very common clause found in a lot of other Bills-that evidence can be used as prima facie evidence of stated facts . If that curious situation of two lots of evidence saying the opposite were to arise, it would obviously have to be argued out and a court would have to decide finally what the truth of the matter was.

I notice that Senator Chipp, who has been in the same position, is agreeing by smile if by nothing else and I suspect you, Mr Chairman, might have had experiences where by you would admit to that possibility. For that reason I express less optimism than did Senator Missen. I express concern about the very broad nature of this clause. I would have thought it is not in a common form.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No; well, he probably did not read his second reading speech. I point out to you, Mr President, that we have had eight to 10 gags tonight. I think it is important for the Senate to settle down and to ensure that there is time for us to reconsider what we have done tonight. Obviously, Mr President, that is why the Standing Orders are written in the manner that they are. There are two hurdles to be overcome; and yes, we will be debating it on Tuesday, and yes, we will be debating it on Wednesday. Standing Order 448 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 'In cases of urgent necessity, any Standing or Sessional Order or Orders of the Senate may be suspended on Motion . . . without Notice'. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chipp has not made out a case for urgency in respect of this question.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like senators to bear in mind a scenario of next week. What if we did agree with Senator Chipp's motion and the third reading stage was completed tonight, the Bill went down to the House of Representatives passed the Bill on Tuesday? Is that not the day before the day on which the World Heritage Committee will meet to consider the listing of the area?</PARA>
<PARA> What if the World Heritage Committee refused to list the area? Then we would have a ludicrous situation where the area would be a World Heritage area according to this Bill, subject as is a property, according to this Bill, because it is submitted to the World Heritage Committee. If the Committee refused to accept it, what a ludicrous situation we would be in. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing is certain: The Australian Democrats have not shwon responsibility in respect of this Bill or any adequate knowledge of Standing Orders, much less the Constitution. As the Minister has often stated in this chamber, it is all very well for the Democrats to roll up this sort of political stunt legislation when they do not have the responsibility of carrying it forward, when they have refused to co-operate with the Government of Tasmania. It all boils down to a question of responsibility. When one takes responsibility on one's shoulders, there is very little room for chips. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise for keeping the Senate for about five minutes. My apologies are to the Hansard staff and to the staff of the Senate for having had to work now for over 13 hours. I was one of those who voted not to change the hours of the Senate's sittings. All the Hansard staff in particular have had to work from 10 o'clock this morning without a meal break. ( Quorum formed). I thank the honourable senators for returning to the chamber, because what I have to say is very important. I repeat, I was one who did not vote to change the sitting hours and I know that all of the people affected have suffered a lot of trauma today. I want to put the record straight on a matter to which I referred some days ago. During the consideration on 17 November of the proposed expenditure for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, as set out in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1982-83, I complained about the long delay in the Aboriginal Development Commission providing answers to questions that I had asked in the Estimates Committee hearing dealing with that body. In the course of my remarks I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I get back to what I started on. Why cannot the answers be provided? Why have not the legal advisers to the ADC been able to come up with the answers? Why are they hiding behind a cover? I suggest that they are doing so because Ralkon's lawyers have been told that they need to be paid before any further cases proceed on behalf of the ADC. They will not go on forever and a day without being paid for the legal expenses that they incur in taking cases to court on behalf of the ADC. </PARA>
<PARA>On reflection, my words were ill chosen. I have recently received correspondence from the solicitors engaged by the ADC and now take this opportunity to correct the record. As I did not name the solicitors on 17 November, I will not do so now. The solicitors in question wrote to the firm of solicitors representing Ralkon on 25 November of this year making reference to a telephone conversation of the previous day and enclosing an extract of the Senate Hansard recording my remarks. A copy of the letter, which was forwarded to me, contains the following passage:</PARA>
<PARA> We were pleased to note that you have no knowledge of any such suggestion. The allegation is entirely unfounded. We confirm that you state that you know nothing about this whatsoever and you have not been told anything to this effect . </PARA>
<PARA> We will be informing the Commission that the allegation is entirely unfounded. We would like to be able to say that we have spoken to you. The terms in which we propose to advise the Commission to comment on the allegation are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The allegation made by Senator McLaren that ''Ralkon's lawyers have been told that they need to be paid before any further cases proceed on behalf of the ADC' ' is quite unfounded. The Commission's solicitors have informed the Commission that they have not made any such comment to Ralkon's solicitors. Furthermore, the Commission's solicitors have asked Ralkon's solicitors whether they have been told anything to this effect. Ralkon's solicitors have informed the Commission's solicitors that they know nothing about it whatsoever and have not been told anything to that effect. They also have told the Commission's solicitors that they may reply in these terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Would you please telephone Mr-</PARA>
<PARA>I have deleted the name-</PARA>
<PARA>and let him know whether you agree with the terms of the above paragraph. We would be grateful if you would then confirm your attitude in writing. </PARA>
<PARA>Ralkon's solicitors then replied to the ADC's solicitors in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th November, 1982. We confirm that we have never received any information as suggested in Senator McLaren's allegations. </PARA>
<PARA> We confirm that we consent to your proposed reply. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote in part from a letter to me from the ADC solicitors, dated 29 November. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> We write to assure you that those allegations are completely unfounded. We have not made any such request to the Aboriginal Development Commission. Nor indeed, have we informed Ralkon's solicitors to that effect. Indeed, Ralkon's solicitors have informed us that they have not said anything to the effect as alleged by you. We enclose a copy of a letter we have sent to the solicitors for Ralkon and a copy of their reply which confirms this to be so. The actual position is that we undertake such work as is handed to us by the Aboriginal Development Commission. For that work we charge what we believe to be fair and reasonable fees. Those fees are rendered from time to time in the course of the matter in respect of work which has already been done. We have not asked the Commission to pay fees on account before any work was undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> We note that in the course of your remarks on this question in the Senate you said that you had a deep concern about the issues and went on to say that if you were wrong about any of the matters stated you would be prepared to apologise if you have offended or humiliated any person in any way: see page 2442. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not asking you to make a public apology or any public withdrawal of your allegations in relation to the conduct of this firm, unless you would prefer to do so. We only wish to convey to you our concern that the allegation was made, inform you that it is entirely unfounded, and to inform you of the true position . </PARA>
<PARA>That letter is signed by the ADC solicitors. I accept completely the explanation given by both firms of solicitors in the letters from which I have quoted. In keeping with my promise referred to on page 2442 of the Senate Hansard of 17 November, I now express my apology and sincere regrets to both firms of solicitors for my remarks about the payment of legal expenses incurred on behalf of the ADC. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one further matter I wish to correct. On 2935 of the Senate Hansard of 30 November 1982, I am recorded as saying that the administrator, Mr Probyn, had locked the community hall, et cetera. On checking my files I now find that it was Mr Ron Wilson, the then chairman of the Point McLeay Aboriginal Council, who had locked the hall, and that Mr Probyn did not arrive at Point McLeay until the second week in March 1981 to take up his duties as administrator at Point McLeay . I intend to forward a copy of my remarks tonight to the ADC lawyers and also to the lawyers who act on behalf of Ralkon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I had intended to speak this morning when the Australian War Memorial report came up, because one cannot help noting, when looking through that document, the impact of the Director, Mr Noel Flanagan, upon the activities of the War Memorial. The time for discussing the report this morning passed before I had the opportunity to refer to him. I wish to do so because of his impending retirement on 25 December this year. Mr Flanagan was born in Victoria on 25 December 1917, that happy occasion being, I understand, the reason for having the names Noel Joseph. He went to school and university in Victoria and commenced his working life in 1937 in the Postmaster-General's Department. A lot of notable Australians have done exactly that. He served in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II and has had a number of distinguished positions in the Public Service during his working life. He worked, I believe, on one occasion at least, in the same department as our own now Acting Deputy Clerk, Mr Nicholls. The pair had some distinction as a doubles teams of tennis players at about that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1975 Mr Flanagan has been the Director of the War Memorial and the following years have been important and significant ones in the development of the War Memorial. Not only has Mr Flanagan managed it but also he has kept abreast of museum development, liaised with other institutions and given a lot of advice and assistance to museum institutions. He has been responsible for assessing the future needs of the War Memorial and is chief adviser to the 13- member council. </PARA>
<PARA> The War Memorial is a very important tourist part of the Australian Capital Territory and its tourist development has been significant in the last couple of years. When built some 40 years ago it was anticipated that there would be about 300,000 visitors a year, but at present it has about one million visitors a year . Significantly this growth has taken place during the time of Mr Flanagan's directorship. His enthusiasm, his energy and his ability to approach anybody with the matters that he wanted to deal have been significant. It has a budget now of $5.5m and extensions recently approved of $11.5m, which shows the planning that he has put into it. One could speak for some time listing his actual achievements. But I think they are well known and certainly well documented. One could say of Mr Flanagan, quite simply, that he has been an achiever, a very pleasant one at that, who has got on well with those with whom he has worked, particularly, with Sir Thomas Daly, who was Chairman of the Australian War Memorial Council for about seven years until April of this year- he is also, of course, a man who served the Memorial with great distinction-and now with Sir Anthony Synnot, the present Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us who know Mr Flanagan are sorry that he is leaving the War Memorial. Certainly, the people of Canberra will miss him in that position and it will be very hard to replace him. There is a great deal more that could be said, but in view of the late hour to simply say that he was an achiever in the position sums up his career. It will be for those of us who are interested to see that the War Memorial continues to obtain the funds to maintain the development that has occurred and see that the preservation of its treasures are maintained. I thank Noel Flanagan, for what he has done. I wish him well in his retirement and also his wife, Dell. </PARA>

When I was Special Minister of State in the Whitlam Government I was responsible to the Parliament for the Australian War Memorial and, naturally, in that respect I was closely associated with Mr Flanagan. Not only I but also former Senator Willessee and Mr Bowen-another Special Minister of State , now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-held him in the very highest regard. I , and all members of the Australian Labor Party, wish Mr Flanagan well in his retirement. He was a first class public servant.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, I am aware of reports from the United States of unauthorised personnel gaining access to computer systems.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department uses 'in-house' WANG micro-computers for first stage data collections and processing in State and regional offices. This equipment is not used to store comprehensive files and data collected is only held in memory temporarily until written to magnetic diskette storage. The Department does not have its own central data processing computers, but does make extensive use of CSIRO facilities in Canberra. Use is also made of a number of other time-sharing bureaus for the processing of particular systems for example library catalogues. Access to these bureau facilities is controlled by the need for special log-on account codes and passwords which are known only to authorised departmental officers and a limited number of bureau staff. Physical wire-tapping would be necessary by a person with a high level of technical knowledge and appropriate terminal equipment before such information could be obtained.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Apart from the need for termimal equipment and a knowledge of the log-on account codes and passwords, access to particular files of data is limited to one account code and password combination. These are different for each group of files. No one officer would know all these codes, and in most cases knowledge of the actual account code and password is restricted to one or two officers. Account codes and passwords are changed periodically. In some situations equipment log-on account codes and passwords are generated automatically by terminal devices to prevent this information becoming known. In such cases the information available through the terminal is restricted and strict physical security controls exist which prevent unauthorised officers using the equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The possibility of access to an individual's data record occurring either accidently or deliberately by an unauthorised person is considered so remote, that no security risk is considered to exist.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am advised that the practical difficulties associated with 'plugging in' to computer systems used by the Department are very considerable. While not completely impossible to a determined individual with criminal intent and unlimited time to experiment, it is considered that computer based files offer greater security than paper-based systems, and the risk associated with their use is not unacceptable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The crude oil and liquid petroleum gas levy receipts are shown in Table 7, page 341, of the Budget Statements 1982-83. In summary, these are:</PARA>
<PARA>Percentage</PARA>
<PARA>$m increase</PARA>
<PARA>1975-76  264 n.a. 1976-77  344 30.3 1977-78  476 38.4 1978-79  1,227 157.8 1979- 80  2,270 85.0 1980-81  3,108 36.9 1981-82  3,163 1.8</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The proportion of the current retail price of petrol in Australia attributable to the crude oil levy cannot be estimated precisely for a number of reasons, the most important of which are:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) there is no single retail price of petrol in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) petroleum products are jointly produced from crude oil and it is not possible to precisely allocate costs to individual products; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) no crude oil levy is imposed on imported petrol or petrol refined from imported crude oil.</PARA>
<PARA> If, however, crude oil levy receipts are allocated to petrol sales in proportion to such sales in total sales of petroleum products, then the crude oil levy could be said to be roughly equivalent to about 24 per cent of the weighted average of the six State capital city retail prices for premium grade petrol in the September quarter of 1982.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of no reports that the Queensland Main Roads Department has terminated the employment of any of its employees in the Winton and Aramac areas of the State.</PARA>
<PARA> Some 90 per cent of all roads expenditure in Queensland involves roadworks not related to national roads construction, I therefore cannot accept the proposition that retrenchment of Main Roads Department employees in the State would be attributable to the tender requirements of the Roads Grants Act. Furthermore, it was established prior to the introduction of the tender and contract system that a significant proportion of national road construction works in Queensland were already being undertaken by private contractors.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will be aware of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development (ABRD) Program which I recently announced. The objective of ABRD, which will provide an additional $2,500m to the States and the Northern Territory for roadworks over the next 6 years, is to upgrade sections of Australia's road network to a high standard by 1988-our Bicentenary.</PARA>
<PARA> When combined with the funds already being provided under the existing five year roads grants program the total Commonwealth contribution for roads in 1982- 83 will be about $914m, an increase of about $229m (or 33.4 per cent) over the 1981-82 allocation. In 1983-84 an estimated additional $430m will be made available under ABRD for roads bringing the total to $1,208m. This is $523m or 76.4 per cent more than the 1981-82 level. Queensland's indicative share of ABRD funds in 1982-83 and 1983-84 will be $39.2m and $93.7m respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the direct road-related benefits arising from ABRD, which will be directed toward all categories of roads, I estimate that, directly and indirectly, 20,000 new jobs will be created across Australia as a result of the program, including rural areas such as Winton and Aramac.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) There are at present 103 permanent teachers employed in the New South Wales Adult Migrant Education Service. Funds are being provided in 1982-83 for an additional 30 permanencies and a further seven positions are being converted from casual to permanent by some rationalisation of the present arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I understand that the New South Wales authorities estimate that at present some 150 casual teachers are employed for 20 hours per week and that these staff are referred to as full time casual staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Teachers Federation has expressed the view that the proportion of permanent staff should be somewhat higher than at present. I have undertaken to consider this further and have sought information from all States so that the issue can be considered on a national basis. I have also sought further information from the New South Wales Minister for Education about organisational arrangements to make the best use of permanent staff and the improvement in the service which would result from the increased use of permanent teachers. Provided these matters can be resolved quickly and the information requested from all States is forthcoming, it should be possible to indicate the additional permanent positions in New South Wales by mid-December.</PARA>

<PARA> The Acting Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian and British officials have held discussions on this matter, and remain in touch.</PARA>
<PARA> It is, I think relevant to note that, following Prime's conviction and sentence to a term of 35 years' imprisonment for offences under Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, Mrs Thatcher made the following remarks in the House of Commons on 11 November concerning possible damage to Britain's allies:</PARA>
<PARA> 'It is not only British interests which have been damaged, the damage extends to the interests of the United States Government. And of course the damage to our own and United States interests is damage to the interests of the Atlantic Alliance as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> There is, however, no evidence that Prime had access to any classified information about our own or allied military dispositions or intentions, or about nuclear weapons, or to any information which could have endangered the lives of agents'.</PARA>

<PARA> I undertook to check on investment figures during this period and I now provide the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill's question and my answer related to a reference by the South Australian Chamber of Commerce to the biannual Survey of Major Manufacturing and Mining Projects conducted by the Commonwealth Department of Industry and Commerce.</PARA>
<PARA> The most recent survey (June 1982) indicated that the aggregate estimated remaining cost of projects listed by developers as at the 'committed' or 'final feasibility' stages in South Australia increased from $3.48 billion in December 1981 to $4.03 billion in June 1982. According to the survey, proposed investment in the South Australian manufacturing sector comprised 19.5 per cent of the Australian total of manufacturing projects at the 'committed' or 'final feasibility' stages. While the survey is not intended to provide a forecast of investment expenditure in total or over time, it does provide an indication of investment intentions.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that a statement by the then Premier that investment in manufacturing in South Australia during the relevant period totalled some $1, 500m was based on a survey conducted by the South Australian Office of State Development.
