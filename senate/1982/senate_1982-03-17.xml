<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 43 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament Assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That Oksana Meshko, 77-year-old acting chairman of the Kiev based Ukranian Helsinki Group, has been sentenced to six months prison and five years exile by a Soviet court in Kiev, Ukraine, for daring to expose Soviet hypocrisy in the matter of human freedom.</PARA>
<PARA> According to the US Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Mrs Meshko suffers from a heart condition, making this harsh sentence of a 77-year- old woman tantamount to a death sentence.</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Meshko and her son Mr Serhiyenko have been attempting to emigrate to Australia to join family members who live here.</PARA>
<PARA> On the occasion of World Freedom Day your Petitioners most humbly pray that in the interests of humanity the Honourable Senators in Parliament assembled initiate appropriate action to ensure that the Soviet Union lives up to its commitments under the Helsinki Agreement and allows Mrs Meshko to live out the last years of her life in peace with her Australian relatives, rather than endure the grave hardships of Siberian exile.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the almost bipartisan approach in this Parliament which was adopted in relation to the persecution of Solidarity trade union leaders by the Government of Poland which assumed control of events in Poland on 13 December last. I ask the Minister: Has the present Government, having made protests to the Government of Poland, made any protests in relation to 52 trade unionists who are at present on trial for their lives in Turkey? Is the Minister aware that Turkey, a member of the Western Alliance, is also under martial law? Has the Australian Government taken any steps to protest against this treatment of trade unionists in that country? If so, on what dates and by what means have these protests been registered?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I have some information on this matter but I am not sure whether it is precisely in the form sought by Senator Button's question . My information relates to the report of Amnesty International and to the prohibition of certain trade unions and to detention, trial and, in some instances, torture. I am not able to confirm reports that 60 political prisoners have died while under detention, or the numbers of those injured. I understand the Turkish Government has stated that between 20,000 and 30,000 persons remain under detention. The Foreign Minister is aware of decisions by both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament criticising the situation in Turkey. The resolution of the European Parliament requested the suspension of the European Communities' financial aid to Turkey and requested the Foreign Ministers of the EC member countries to take action in regard to 52 DISK trade union leaders now on trial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, in considering its response to events in Turkey since the military takeover of 12 September 1980, has been particularly aware of the extreme difficulties which confronted Turkey prior to the intervention of the military authorities. Terrorist violence was claiming approximately 20 lives a day and the economy was in a state of near-total collapse. The Australian Government has been very concerned about this and the only really satisfactory solution to the problem of the derogation of personal freedom, of detention without charge and of the allegations of the use of torture is the abolition of martial law and the restoration of civilian rule. In this regard, I note that a constituent assembly has been convened to draft a new Turkish constitution and that the Government expects that elections will be held in 1983. I am not aware of what representations have been made directly by Australia. I will seek that information and see whether there is any information that I am able to add before the end of Question Time to the comments I have made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for National Development and Energy to the impending electricity blackouts and four day working week in New South Wales. Is it a fact that routine maintenance work on electricity generating equipment in New South Wales has been neglected this year during the summer months, when such maintenance is normally done? If a four day working week is necessary now what will the situation be like in the winter? Will it not be an intolerable winter, as it was described by the New South Wales Minister for Energy? In view of the enormous damage done not only to New South Wales but also to the whole Australian economy by these restrictions is there any assistance that can be given to solve these New South Wales problems? In particular, can more power be given from the Snowy River scheme without damaging other users or its output? Is Victoria, with its relatively much more efficient power generation system, doing all it can do to help New South Wales?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="854" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My recollection is that some months ago the New South Wales Government made a public statement that it was proposing to forgo a certain amount of the normal routine summer maintenance of its power plants because it did not want to use excess water from the Snowy Mountains scheme. In fact what happened, assuming that that practice was put into effect, is that at a time when the New South Wales Government would normally be doing its maintenance to take the full weight of the winter, that maintenance was not done . If that is so that must inevitably threaten quite serious danger for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Premier has spoken, as has the Minister for Energy in New South Wales, in the most extreme terms of the perils that face New South Wales, perils which mean that at the moment the New South Wales electricity plants are working at far below their installed capacity-perhaps half or less of their installed capacity-and are perilously dependent not only on electricity conservation by the people but also on drawing upon the Snowy Mountains scheme. It is, I think, a tragic indictment of any government that it, having gone to the electors on a basis that if it were voted for it could provide full employment and growing and massive new industries, cannot within weeks of being elected support its existing industries. It is true that Victoria was providing New South Wales with some 5 per cent of its total consumption during January and February. Victoria has done a great deal. It is presently recommissioning some of its own power plant and, therefore, should not be called upon to do too much.</PARA>
<PARA> My understanding is that the Snowy Mountains scheme generated around 20 gigawatt hours on Monday and 30 gigawatt hours on Tuesday and is expected to generate about 35 gigawatt hours today. Almost all of this was drawn for New South Wales. This represents a very large proportion of the total New South Wales demand- of the order of 100 gigawatt hours daily. I am told that at this rate of draw, the Snowy Mountains scheme cannot continue past tomorrow because short term storages will have been drawn down. Today Snowy Mountains Hydro- Electric Authority engineers are meeting and reviewing the situation. They will be looking to see what the scope is for generating electricity in the near future and will be able to draw conclusions as to whether further significant assistance can be given to New South Wales. But I am not hopeful; the situation is most grave.</PARA>
<PARA> I must add that the Commonwealth is asking the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority to do all within its power within its terms of operation to assist New South Wales in this situation. The situation is most grave. It will badly affect not only the New South Wales economy, in particular the wages of New South Wales workers and the productivity of industry, but also the national economy. Therefore, the situation threatens the whole of the well-being of the Australian people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, relates to Press reports which allege that Mr Javad Yarjani, the then Iranian Charge d'Affaires, was summoned by the Department of Foreign Affairs of 14 January to clarify reports that eight members of the National Baha'i Council had been executed in Iran without trial. In view of the persistent reports reaching Australia of persecution and ill- treatment of Baha'is in Iran, I ask: Firstly, what did the Minister's discussions with Mr Yarjani reveal about the reported executions? Secondly, is it correct, as alleged in the Minister's Press release of 13 January that ' justifications published in the Press in Iran had clearly shown that persecution was in fact occurring and that its motivation was religious intolerance rather than fear of subversive activities'? Thirdly, what report has the Minister since received from the Iranian Charge d'Affaires about the reported executions?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; As reported in the Press, the then Charge d' Affaires of Iran was called into the Department of Foreign Affairs to clarify to officials reports of the tragic executions of Baha'is in Iran in December and January. The question from Senator Missen raised a number of specific issues. In response to those I advise that the discussions provided no information about the executions. The Charge d'Affaires simply stated that Baha'is had been executed for criminal activities, not for their religious beliefs. It is correct to say that justifications published in the Press in Iran had clearly shown that persecution was in fact occurring and that its motivation was religious intolerance rather than fear of subversive activities. I understand that no report has since been received from the Iranian Charge about the reported executions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 31 January Australia joined members of the European Community and four other countries in collective representations to the Iranian authorities. At the recently concluded 38th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights the Australian delegation played an active role as a co-sponsor in having a resolution adopted on 11 March concerning human rights in Iran and referring specifically to the persecution of the Iranian Baha'is and to summary and arbitrary executions. Australia has also supported a resolution on the wider subject of summary and arbitrary executions. The Government will continue to work for an end to the cruel disregard for human rights in Iran, both through direct representations to the Iranian Government and through active support for effective measures in international forums.</PARA>

I refer to the headline in this morning's Age which states that this week the Fraser Government intends to allow an increase of one per cent in home loan interest rates. I ask the Minister: Will this add $300 per year to the annual repayment burden of individual home buyers and a total of $238m to the interest bill of all Australian home buyers? Is she also aware that the value of Mr Fraser's much leaked home interest relief package has been valued at $225m, as opposed to $238m which will be the additional cost to home buyers? If so, is there any value at all in the Government's package? Does the Minister agree that to give with one hand what one takes with the other is little more than a cheap confidence trick?

In view of that answer I ask the Minister: Why is it that stories similar to that in the Age, coming directly from Cabinet or Cabinet Ministers, are leaked daily to the Press and information is not given to the Parliament when a specific question is asked by a senator of the Minister for Finance, who is a member of the Cabinet?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Senator Chipp would well know, as a former Minister, that it is not usual for policy statements to be made in advance of an announcement from the appropriate Minister if Cabinet has a matter under consideration. The honourable senator's contention that the stories that have been appearing in the Press come directly from Cabinet is something that I am not able to assert.

<PARA> With regard to a matter of major policy, as we regard it, by means of which we are attempting to give assistance in the purchase of homes, for me to come out, piecemeal, with a package, in answer to questions, as a Minister representing another Minister, would not be to the enlightenment of all. I expect that when the statement is made tomorrow, or at such time as the Government is able to make its complete statement, questions will be able to be dealt with and whatever figures need to be examined will be able to be examined in that context . I hope that when the package is brought forward from the Government we will have the support of Senator Chipp and his colleagues in whatever we are able to do to assist people in the purchase of their homes because it is a very firm commitment of this Government that assistance be given.</PARA>

The fact is that funding for the Australian Research Grants Scheme for the last four years has been set to maintain a constant level of activity. In 1982 a sum of $17.98m has been allocated.

In addition, the Government has just announced an award for centres of excellence of research grants totalling $16m. The size of the average grant under the ARGS increased by 7.9 per cent in 1982 in response to the Minister's request that the scheme give greater emphasis to excellence. Funds for research have not been cut with the exception of project and commencement grants which operate under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act. Discussions on these reductions are currently being undertaken in an effort to have funding restored. Those are the facts relating to the Australian Research Grants Scheme in recent years and particularly in the current year.

The Minister will be aware of the huge problems at present in the world tin market, which has become destabilised because of the clandestine operation of a group of tin producers who have bought up much of the market supply of available tin. Apparently the activities of this unnamed group have forced those short of supply to pay up to the record price of #Stg9,000, which subsequently, between 16 February and 10 March this year, when the situation was uncovered, crashed to #Stg7,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a brief relating to tin. Since July of last year there have been numerous Press reports of support for tin prices by what is described as an influential buyer. There is no doubt that huge tonnages of tin believed to be in excess of some 30,000 tonnes were purchased on metal markets between July 1981 and late February 1982. Although there has been conjecture in the Press as to who might be involved, there is no conclusive evidence, nor has there been an authoritative statement at any time as to who has been behind the support buying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the period in which the influential buyer was operating the London Metal Exchange price increased by about 30 per cent to the level mentioned by Senator Archer, which was some 6 per cent higher than the 1980 peak. That increase took place despite record stocks on the London Metal Exchange, the biggest statistical surplus for over 20 years and a sharp increase in United States stockpile releases since 14 December last year. However, since late February the unidentified buyer has withdrawn from the market and the LME price has declined sharply to the July 1981 price level, which was about #Stg7,000 a tonne.</PARA>
<PARA> Of most interest to Australian miners is what has happened to the peak Penang price, which is the pricing basis for the sale of Australia's mine output. The Penang price has also fallen significantly in recent weeks to a point close to the floor price of the buffer stock price range of the International Tin Council . At this level the Buffer Stock Manager is required by Tin Council rules to support the market by the purchase of tin. In this regard, at a special Tin Council session held on 9 March it was decided that all outstanding buffer stock contributions, equivalent to about $185m, would be called up immediately. Australia will be making its proportionate contribution to the call for funds to finance the necessary operations of the Buffer Stock Manager. I understand the significance of the matter to Senator Archer and Tasmania. If there is further information I will be happy to supply it to him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will disappoint the Senate to know that I do not have detailed information on the effect of the disease on cavendish bananas in those countries . I have been somewhat concerned about my exposure on this subject when, of course, the banana industry is very important not only in the State of Queensland but also in my State of Western Australia where we produce a particularly fine brand of bananas at Carnarvon. I suppose that Senator Bjelke- Petersen will suggest that the bananas she represents are better bent and in other ways better than the bananas in my State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I need disappoint the Senate no longer as I am able to confirm that panama disease is prevalent in both Taiwan and South Africa and it is a major concern in both of those countries. As I said before, I do not have any detail and would have to seek that for the honourable senator. As to their success in controlling the disease, again I have no detailed information, but I have been informed that there has been an outbreak of panama disease in the Wamuran Basin area in southern Queensland which is affecting cavendish bananas. The honourable senator correctly pointed out that that species of banana has not been affected by that disease before. In the first instance, of course, dealing with problems such as this rests with the State department concerned. I do not think the honourable senator is suggesting that the State department is not able to deal with this problem which is within its responsibility. Should there be an interstate problem, however, mechanisms have been established to enable Commonwealth and interstate co-operation. I am sure that if the Queensland Department of Primary Industries feels that there is a problem which should involve either the Commonwealth or other States those mechanisms will be called in to play. I will seek some more technical and more precise information on the matters raised by the honourable senator. I am sure that she will be able to get an early assurance that the State department involved is indeed tackling this problem in an enthusiastic way.</PARA>

Doctors have told me that a lower intake of salt is helpful in dealing with diseases such as high blood pressure and many others. Senator Townley is correct in stating that the facts need to be made well known since a certain amount of salt intake can be controlled easily by people. It is one simple measure to take to keep themselves healthy and well. The honourable senator asked whether the labelling of food was an appropriate way of dealing with the problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I preface my question by stating a fact with which the Minister should be well acquainted. For people living in remote towns, such as Mount Newman in Western Australia, it is far easier to establish quickly eligibility for unemployment benefit and then receive that benefit than it is to establish eligibility for special benefit. How many wives of workers who were stood down in remote areas because of strikes claimed and were paid unemployment benefit in Western Australia in the last 12 months? How many dependent children did these women have between them? As there are very long distances between many industrial towns in Western Australia and the nearest social security office, will the Minister tell the Senate how the wives of workers stood down because of industrial disputes will establish their rights to special benefit when they and their children face genuine hardship? Can the Minister assure the Senate that these women and children will not go hungry while their eligibility is being established?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that for some people living in the remoter parts of Australia there can be longer delays in establishing entitlement for unemployment benefit than applies to people who are closer to regional offices of my Department. That is a problem which has been drawn to my attention in a very clear way and which I am presently examining to see whether we can reduce the delays which such people suffer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from that general point, the honourable senator raised the matter in the context of legislation, which is to be debated later today, restricting the right of the wives of strikers to seek the assistance of the social security system. I am not able to give him the numbers which he seeks. Obviously I do not have that sort of detailed statistical information before me at the moment. Whilst I am prepared to seek that information, I remind him of the figures which were cited in the Senate last time there was a debate on that legislation . Those figures drew attention to the fact that a significant number of cases of payment were recorded in centres which were rather remote, such as Queensland coal centres which are very similar to the Western Australian example which he gave. Notwithstanding any difficulties which may apply generally in this field, clearly people in such centres have been able to gain unemployment benefit in the strike situation. Exactly the same procedures will be available to them to seek special benefit. They will be able to apply in the same way as they are able to apply for unemployment benefit. Again, it would be footling to suggest that there are not greater difficulties where people are remote from regional offices, but those difficulties are not insuperable and special benefit is granted in such circumstances. The statistics which I placed before the Senate last time this matter was debated showed quite clearly that some people had sought and obtained unemployment benefit while others had sought and obtained special benefit. There will be no change to those people who are entitled to seek and obtain special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated, I do not wish in question time to anticipate debate which will take place later. One of the features of the proposal which has been somewhat ignored in some of the debate which has occurred is that there is the safety net provision that dependent wives and children who are left without cash resources will be eligible for assistance through special benefit, it not being the intention of the Government to see such people deprived of sustenance. The point is that where such people have resources of their own there is no reason why they should be put onto the taxpayers' payroll in substitute for the income which they would normally have received had their spouse been at work.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Senate generally will be aware of the very considerable financial difficulties which have been discussed in this place and revealed recently by Trans Australia Airlines in its report. Senator Peter Rae draws our attention in particular to the problem of superannuation liability with respect to TAA employees. He would also be aware, as would the Senate, that considerable action has been taken by the management and the board of TAA to cut its losses by reducing expenditure in various ways. There has been emphasis on the reduction of staff numbers and the reduction of salaries applicable in that area. Due regard has also been had to the lack of growth in the industry generally in recent times, and cost-cutting measures have been implemented in relation to certain routes which TAA is flying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The superannuation liability is a matter to which the Minister is currently giving attention. I am unable to give the honourable member any further information at this moment except to say that the Minister is taking a very close interest in the matter. I expect that this will be discussed between unions and the Department and/or the management of TAA at various meetings in the not too distant future.</PARA>
<PARA> A further matter which Senator Rae raised was the formation of a public company or otherwise to operate TAA. As he would know, there are many complex issues connected with this matter. That involves one point which he perhaps already acknowledges, that is, the question of the superannuation liability of TAA, the capital structure of the company, the staff employment conditions and the renegotiation of TAA's existing loans.</PARA>
<PARA> Before proceeding to a consideration of those matters, the Government is currently consulting with both TAA and the Crown Solicitor regarding the necessary draft memorandum and articles of association that are necessary for the company's establishment. As has been stated quite clearly on previous occasions, the company, if formed, will be 100 per cent Commonwealth owned. As the Minister has indicated previously, the Government has not made any decision at this stage about the sale of shares to the private sector. For a fuller explanation of the current situation with regard to superannuation, I will refer that part of Senator Rae's question to the Minister and obtain an early reply for him.</PARA>

A significant proportion of this aid is provided for development projects, food aid and training assistance to more than 70 developing countries, including half those countries which are classified as the least developed countries. It is believed that this level of aid reflects the Government's concern to give as much assistance as it is able. We hope that it assists in bridging the gap between the poor and rich countries in helping to overcome the problems associated with feeding the world's population. There are other things that we are able to do, such as provide research aid and projects of that sort. I believe that we are active in world assistance for developing countries. We share our expertise wherever this is possible. As I said, our aid of $662m that was provided in this year's Budget is directed towards the problems that were inherent in Senator Watson's question.</PARA></TALK.START>

Has the Minister read an article by Christopher Jay in the Australian Financial Review of 2 March headed: 'Why Victoria Faces Winter Power Failures'? If so, is he familiar with the memorandum from the Assistant General Manager of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria which argues that the Loy Yang project should be deferred in order to ease the financial strains in Victoria brought about by three factors-rising interest rates, wage pressures and Federal Government funding cut backs? If the Minister is familiar with the memorandum, does he recall that it points to the fact that economic growth rates in Victoria will be lower than the national average of Australia? Are these factors, which have been brought to his attention in relation to the power supply situation in Victoria, likely to lead to winter failures?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not recall the article. I certainly do not believe that I have had the privilege of seeing any such memorandum. It would interest me to see it. My understanding is quite clear, that over the summer months the Victorian Government has been able to generate not only sufficient electrical power for Victoria, whilst doing its own maintenance work, but also substantially more to provide for New South Wales. I am not aware of the memorandum. I cannot say what it says so I cannot comment on it. I will have a look at it. In relation to the growth rate of Victoria, the fact is that the people of Victoria are being reminded at this moment that the general peformance of Victoria in a wide range of activities is a pace-setter for Australia. Victoria, through the development of its brown coal in particular and its power supply, will be able to offer substantial opportunities to industries to invest and to provide employment. Furthermore, an indication of that is the willingness of the Japanese to invest very largely in a pilot plant in the Latrobe Valley for coal liquefaction. I will have a look at the matter and see whether there is anything further to add. I ask that further questions be placed on notice.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in Question Time Senator McIntosh asked a question about the difficulties which might be faced by the wives of strikers in obtaining special benefit. I do not have the figures relating to Western Australia which might have illuminated the answer. I will get those for him. Because I suspect he wants some figures for the debate later today I thought I would give him the figures which are available to me. These are figures which, to my recollection, have been quoted before in the Senate. If one looks at the strike at Blackwater in Queensland between June and September 1980, one finds that 411 wives were granted the unemployment benefit at a cost per week of $30, 825 and 112 wives were granted special benefit. So the wives at Blackwater were able to master the administrative problem and obtain special benefit. In Gladstone in Queensland there was a strike between January 1981 and March 1981. On that occasion 47 wives were in receipt of unemployment benefit and six were in receipt of special benefit. Gladstone is one centre which has no social security office directly. At the Utah Development Co. mine in central Queensland between July 1981 and September 1981, 471 wives were receiving unemployment benefit at a cost per week of $40,000 and 11 wives claimed special benefit. At Gove in the Northern Territory there was a strike between August and October 1981. Six wives claimed unemployment benefit at a cost per week of $510 and 99 claimed special benefit at a cost of $8,415 per week. The relevance of that to Senator McIntosh's question is that I understand the question to be concerned with administrative difficulties which might be in the way of wives seeking assistance, in strike circumstances, through special benefit in areas remote frm social security offices. I quote those as available examples which might be of interest to the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>

He asked about several detailed matters which will require further examination in order to obtain a full reply for him. In general terms I answer along the lines that all indications are that the basic system for accounting and recording the throughput of crude oil and fuel product in this circumstance is sound. But obviously, as revealed by the Auditor-General's report, there is some room for improvement. The report has put forward suggestions for improvements and those are being examined. Some initiatives have already been taken by the Department. A stronger oversight role by the central office has been established. In fact, 10 additional positions have already been created in order to do that. A greater emphasis has been placed on the implementation of management systems within the Department to ensure that proper control is implemented. Some of the suggested improvements will require careful analysis and discussion with industry to assess practicability and cost effectiveness in the longer run. For example, this might involve the establishment of measuring devices, meters at various stages of the production processes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had the audacity to extol the virtue of government policies marked by, to use his words, balance, vision and realism. He had the effrontery to denounce what he called unrealistic demands and expectations. Nobody has done more to fuel unrealistic demands and false expectations than the Fraser Government and in particular the Prime Minister. I will give some examples by citing extracts from the speeches. The list is by no means exhaustive. The Prime Minister in his 1975 policy speech promised jobs for all. He promised to end the great tax rip-off. He promised full indexation of personal income tax and 5 per cent to 7 per cent real growth in gross domestic product per annum. He also promised to maintain Medibank. In 1977 he promised that interest rates would fall by 2 per cent over the coming year, saying that it was a target that could and would be met. He promised again to end the great tax rip-off. He promised specifically tax cuts in the form of fistfuls of $5 notes. This blazed out of the pages of newspapers in full page advertisements with headings such as ' Liberals offer tax cuts' and showing fistfuls of $5 notes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1978 in the Budget Speech the Government stated that inflation would be down to 5 per cent by the middle of 1979. In the 1980 policy speech the Prime Minister promised the great resources boom-the $29 billion resources boom. What actually happened? Jobs for all were promised but unemployment last month hit the highest level ever recorded since the Australian Bureau of Statistics has been collecting statistics. Incidentally, unemployment has been at higher levels continuously since the Fraser Government took office than it was prior to its taking office. I cite the great tax rip-off. Not only has it not ended but it has been extended, widened and deepened. We have the highest income tax ever. The tax indexation promised was buried completely in May 1981. It was never fully applied. It was promised there would be 5 per cent to 7 per cent real growth in gross domestic product but no single year since the Government came to office nor in any 12-month period, whether a calendar year or financial year, has real growth of gross domestic product equalled the lower end of the range that the Prime Minister promised in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> For three of the calendar years since the Fraser Government came to office real growth in gross domestic product has actually been negative. The 1977 promise was that interest rates would fall by 2 per cent over the coming year. The Prime Minister stated that that target could and would be met. Interest rates are now 3 per cent or 4 per cent higher than they were then. They are at record levels and still rising. Taxation remains at record levels and is still rising. The tax cuts of 1977, the fistfuls of $5 notes that stared at us from full page advertisements in all the newspapers in the country, disappeared in June of the next year when the infamous surcharge was applied-as a temporary expedient for one year only. It remained in force for one and a half years and then was replaced by fiscal drag, by the secret tax of inflation, as the Prime Minister used to call it, which continues to maintain and extend the highest taxation rates we have ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA> The 5 per cent inflation predicted in the 1978 Budget for mid-1979 turned out to be 9.8 per cent-an error of almost 100 per cent. The great resources boom, the jewel in the Liberal Party crown for the 1980 election, is in the process of becoming the great resources bust. The Prime Minister, again in his 1980 election policy speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA> A new confidence is alive in Australia's men and women. </PARA>
<PARA> Our financial position is the envy of many industrialised countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Business expectations are high. </PARA>
<PARA> The optimism of overseas investors has been restored. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Prime Minister was saying in 1980. This is the man who had the effrontery last week to denounce those who raise unrealistic expectations. In 1980 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturing exports are growing strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year rural exports were the highest for the decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, our balance of trade was the best result for the decade. And, under the Fraser-Anthony Government, Australia has won a respected place in world affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what he promised only 18 months ago. What is the reality? What do we actually have today? We have a consumer price index and the inflation rate well above double figures; by far the highest levels of income tax and other taxation ever imposed in peacetime; record interest rates; record unemployment; a balance of payments crisis; and an economic growth rate that is either falling rapidly or may even, on the latest indicators, be stagnant or negative. What about business confidence? What about the one area where the Fraser Government would claim above all else to have respect and to inspire confidence? What about business confidence? Yesterday, the all ordinaries index on the stock exchange hit 463 points, which is down 200 points on what was said to have been an unrealistically low level prior to the 1980 election, which situation was caused , according to Mr Fraser, by the fear of an impending Labor victory. If the fear of a Labor victory was responsible for the fall in the week before the 1980 election, obviously the reality of a Fraser government is far more frightening than the prospect of a Labor government. All of those crucial, economic indices- growth rate, inflation, unemployment rates, interest rates, stock exchange index levels-are moving in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Two events above all others-the release of the December 1981 consumer price index figure, which was the highest for five years, and the February unemployment figures, which are the highest ever-were such a devastating indication of the failure of this Government that the truth could no longer be successfully denied. The economy is sick. Even the Government has finally admitted it. Its excuse for the sickness was that it is externally caused; it is part of a world scene. The Prime Minister claimed last week:</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot but be affected by factors such as the present slackness in world demand, and the high cost of funds, nor can we avoid being affected by the protectionism which strikes at many of our exports, especially our farm products . </PARA>
<PARA>Like his Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) he is an innocent victim of circumstances, or so the Prime Minister would have us believe. I might add that this is a very different view of the world to that which he boastfully asserted at the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science conference in 1975 when he was making his run for the Liberal Party leadership and the prime ministership. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped, it is part of a world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership when if they were men of real stature, they would be saying 'We can overcome'.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister certainly is not saying now: 'We can overcome'. He has the effrontery to denounce others for allegedly raising false expectations and feeding false hopes. This innocent victim of circumstances excuse is accompanied by a repetition of the boasts, false assertions, misrepresentations and wishful thoughts which have characterised statements by this Government on the economy for the last six years. Central to that diversionary tactic is the assertion that Australia has done very well since the mid-1970s relative to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as a whole and the major industrial powers. I quote again from the Prime Minister's speech last week. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is an undoubted fact that as a result of our policies Australia has prospered in recent years while the rest of the world has been stagnating. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement simply is not true. It is presented as an alibi. In fact it is a piece of fiction. I have in front of me a series of tables taken from the OECD Economic Outlook No. 30 published in December 1981 which gives on a calendar year basis-all OECD figures are presented in this form-unemployment rates, gross domestic product growth rates and consumer price index changes for Australia, for the OECD as a whole and for a number of individual OECD countries. That publication shows that in every one of the years from 1976 to 1981 inclusive the unemployment rate in Australia was higher than it was in Austria, Germany, Japan , Norway and Sweden and is higher also than the OECD average as a whole for those same years, with one minor reservation, namely, the OECD composite figure for 1981 is not yet available. If we look at real GDP growth-the 1981 figures again are not available-for the four years from 1977 to 1980 we see that Australia's average growth rate was 2.3 per cent. The average growth rate for the OECD as a whole was 3.1 per cent. In every one of those years Norway had a higher growth rate than Australia. In all but one of those years both Japan and West Germany had higher growth rates than Australia. The consumer price index for some of those years was marginally lower in Australia than it was in the OECD as a whole, a situation which, on the most recent available statistics, has been reversed. In other words, throughout this period where the Government boasts that Australia has performed very well relative to the rest of the OECD the plain fact is that our unemployment record and our economic growth record are below the OECD average. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just a minute, sweetie. Throughout that period Australia's average growth rate has been significantly lower than that of the OECD as a whole. Throughout that period, for every one of those years, the unemployment rate was higher than the OECD average. In every one of those years it was higher than the rate in Austria, Germany, Japan, Norway and Sweden. I suggest to the honourable senator, if he is numerate enough to understand it which, judging from some of his previous statements in the Senate, is probably open to doubt, that he consult the OECD Economic Outlook No. 30 published on 30 December and verify those figures. Certainly in the financial year 1980-81 growth rates in Australia were above the OECD average. That situation has very quickly been reversed. In one year only have we managed to perform better in terms of growth rate than the OECD as a whole. The Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an undoubted fact that as a result of our policies Australia has prospered in recent years-</PARA>
<PARA>He said 'years' in the plural-</PARA>
<PARA>while the rest of the world has been stagnating. </PARA>
<PARA>The truth is the reverse. The Government's response, at a somewhat more sophisticated level or from a different direction to these realities, is to boast about the large increase in household income-a $2.7 billion real increase in household income in the financial year 1980-81 over that of the previous year . That is a dishonest figure, firstly, because it makes no allowance for the increase in the number of households, which accounts for about half of that aggregate increase. Nor does it present the most recent statistics, which are for the September quarter of 1981 over the September quarter of 1980. When looked at on that basis, real disposable household income expressed in September 1981 dollars has fallen from $5,023 to $4,994. On the most recent available statistics real average disposable household income has actually fallen compared with what it was a year earlier, something which reflects to a very substantial degree the massive Fraser Government tax rip-off and the effects of what Mr Fraser used to call 'the secret tax of inflation'. More recently we have had Professor Pollard's figures cited to us. Professor Pollard-I eventually tracked this down-an Emeritus Professor of Statistics at, I think, the Macquarie University, in a publication called Australian Economic Trends, dated February 1982, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> My text is taken from the February 1982 publication 'The Hayden Health Plan'. The text is the first sentence of that publication which reads as follows: 'The living standards of Australian families have fallen dramatically over the last six years.' what do the figures show?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a rhetorical question. Pollard's figures certainly do not show changes in living standards over the last six years; Pollard's figures show changes between December 1974 and December 1980. We need to bear in mind that he wrote this article after the Hayden health plan was released, after the figures for December 1981 were available. Pollard claims to have disproved Labor's claim by selecting figures for a different time period. There was, of course, a good reason for that. The figures for the real period, December 1975 to December 1981 -the last six years at the time Pollard produced his figures-showed not only the reverse of what Pollard claimed they show but the reverse to a very dramatic degree. Pollard has long been a toady of the conservative establishment. He has now shown himself willing to misuse his academic prestige and title to give a facade of credibility to a fraudulent misrepresentation of the facts. He is an academic prostitute. The final diversionary tactic is to say: 'Well, tax might be high but it would be $7 billion higher if the Hayden scale were still in operation'. Why pick on the Hayden scale; why not the McMahon scale? If that were still in operation taxes would be $15 billion higher. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's debate on a matter of public importance is the latest in a series of debates on the economy that has been brought forward by Senator Walsh and his colleagues. A number of themes constantly appear in these debates. They seem to seek to denigrate Australia and the efforts that are made by Australians and they are apparent in the approach that was taken again today. There is always, in a speech from Senator Walsh, the absolutely irresistible impulse to denigrate individuals, to attack them rather than to discuss policies. I think we saw that in the closing stages of Senator Walsh's speech. To have spoken of an academic, Professor Pollard, in the terms that he did shows that he has very little understanding of the information and expertise that can come from people of long years of experience-far longer than Senator Walsh has or perhaps many of us in this place have been able to show-in a field of endeavour about which we have informed ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Time and again we are faced with the selective use of statistics-quotes being given to back up a particular assertion, the careful use of a particular year. Selectivity is addressed in an obvious way so that some particular point can be made. Above all, there is always the utter failure to offer any credible alternative. The obvious denigration of the achievement of Australia in economic terms, in terms of contribution to the world community, is brought forward by Senator Walsh and his colleagues without any credible alternative. If the problems facing the Australian economy are of the order and magnitude that are suggested by Senator Walsh it could rightly be assumed that anyone posturing to be a member of an alternative government would have at least developed some policies to deal with these matters. The fact is that the Australian Labor Party has no credible alternative; it has no alternative policies. Indeed, the very programs put forward by ALP spokesmen could only exacerbate economic difficulties leading to higher interest rates, higher taxation, less investment and more unemployment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> An article in the Bulletin released today pointed out that Mr Hayden had declared on a television program that he found economics 'boring and irrelevant' . I think we can safely assume that Mr Whitlam had the same attitude to economics because the Budgets during his term of office led Australia into many economic difficulties. If Mr Hayden, as the present Leader of the Opposition, finds economics boring and irrelevant I would expect that some of his colleagues would attempt to put into effect policies that any alternative government ought to develop and present. The sort of speech that we heard from Senator Walsh today-linked with our knowledge that the Leader of the Opposition sees economics as boring and irrelevant-makes us feel rather fearful of what would happen if they were ever entrusted to put policies into effect.

<PARA> The way in which he (Mr Hayden) has allowed emotive factors to set the tone of economic debate suggests either an unwillingness or inability to bring intellectual honesty to bear. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps that is what we ought to be on about if we are looking at the economic difficulties of this country and of many countries in the developing world. I think that a debate of frankness, honesty and perhaps an endeavour to lead to better things would be far more useful than one which simply denigrates every aspect of Australia's achievement. Many of the issues that we face today are complex. More than ever they demand rational debate and they need a very careful analysis. If we were to take the other side of the argument and look at the strong points in our economic position and then at some of the problems we might have a more informed debate on the whole matter of the Australian economy and the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that our economy has recorded significant achievements over the last two years in terms of economic growth, investment growth, creation of jobs, rising real incomes and the sharp reduction in the size of the Budget deficit. They are all strengths in the economy; they are all positive achievements. Yet there was no mention of any of them. These achievements were made at a time when the world economy was running down and in very serious difficulties. Therefore the advances that have been made are even more creditable. We can swim against the tide if we have used the right economic policies. As a result of our policies Australia as a whole has prospered. This should not be ignored at any time that we are talking about the economic difficulties, the economic debate or the consequences of certain policies. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to the picture painted by Senator Walsh, I will cite a number of statistics which illustrate our Government's record. In some cases the figures were used by Senator Walsh so I do not think there will be any doubt about them. The honourable senator chose to look at unemployment. I do not deny that there is a difficulty in finding sufficient employment opportunities for all people who seek employment in Australia. But we should look at the fact that almost 400 ,000 new jobs have been created in the last three years, about 90 per cent of those being in the private sector. We can hardly suggest that there is not a business confidence that underlines whatever difficulties we may face. The new jobs are real jobs in which people will be able to use their skills and contribute to the development and growth of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh spoke about family incomes and questioned the growth in them. There was an increase in real household disposable income of about $2.9 billion after tax in 1980-81. We can cite an increase in real household disposable income of almost $3,000m. An after-tax increase of almost $3,000m in family disposable income is very significant. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Inflation is important, but we cannot ignore the growth in real household disposable income, the rewards enjoyed by people who have been in employment during that time and the additional 400,000 people who have found new jobs in the last three years. Another matter that was raised was investment. This is crucial to the health of the economy. The 1980-81 rate of increase was the highest for 30 years. That figure should not be denigrated; it is a very considerable achievement in light of many of the difficulties that face modern economies. The 1981-82 rate is also likely to be over 10 per cent in real terms. It should be remembered that business investment is the way in which we create employment. It is the way in which the vital creation of new jobs is able to be undertaken and it is the basis on which real improvements in the standard of living will come about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rather than talking down our achievements, let us look at the confidence that has been shown by those who wish to invest their capital, seek a return on it and provide the much needed employment opportunities. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) recently pointed out that we are one of the few countries which has been able to reduce total Budget outlays as a percentage of the gross domestic product and to bring about a significant improvement in balance between revenue and expenditure . That has been one of the important aspects of this Government's policy in creating its Budgets. We look at the Budget outlays and we find it a primary responsibility of government, on behalf of the Australian people and the use of their funds, to see that the total Budget outlay as a percentage of the gross domestic product is as low as possible in order to maintain the services that people expect from government. We have carried out this policy constantly, probably with very great effort, and we will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short term, Australia is facing the future from a position of comparative strength, provided that it does not squander its advantages and it is able to overcome its current difficulties and face the future with confidence . It is that confidence that we ought to be trying to develop and not the spirit offered in the terms of the matter of public importance before us. We are facing a downturn in world trade and our export markets must inevitably be affected. As competition becomes tougher on export markets we are facing renewed inflationary pressures at home which can only reduce our competitive advantages. Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) sought to address the nation on these matters and even that statement was the subject of denigration. The fact that a prime ministerial statement addressed itself to the position of Australia and to its prospects in world terms is something that ought to be welcomed because it can open up public debate and discussion. Apparently, there was something wrong even in putting facts forward as we see them. In that speech the Prime Minister made it clear that excessive wage rises and damaging strikes were placing economic progress at risk. It does not need very great economic expertise to understand that excessive wage rises for those who have jobs make it very difficult for those who do not have jobs, when one looks at the profitable employment of capital needed to provide employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the difficulties facing New South Wales today-these were mentioned during Question Time in the Senate-I would think that any Australian Labor Party spokesman who is prepared honestly to face up to reality would undoubtedly agree with the Prime Minister that excessive wage rises and damaging strikes are placing economic progress at risk in that great State. This is the spirit that ought to be adopted in this chamber. The threat to family incomes and job security in New South Wales has not been laid at the unions' door by none other than the President of the Australian Labor Party, the honourable Neville Wran, who is the Premier of New South Wales. That great State is in difficulties with regard to providing continued and full employment to the millions of people who live in it because of the lack of responsibility shown by union members. Their actions are causing untold disadvantage to the people in that State. The risks that are facing that State are so grave that all of us can only hope that reason will prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of the debate today, the point to note is this: How can the ALP ever hope to portray itself as a credible alternative government if its key economic spokesmen, such as Senator Walsh, fail to analyse and boldly confront the real issues? Senator Walsh raised the issue of taxation. The present taxation levels are of concern to many people and to the Government. The Government certainly understands the community's hope for reduced taxation and it will make further taxation reductions when it is economically responsible to do so. That, of course, has to be linked with the expenditure of government and the way in which we are able to raise the revenue to meet that expenditure. In contrast to our policy, which is clear and absolutely unequivocal, the Labor Party believes that it can increase the levels of taxation. The shadow Treasurer and others have certainly made that point clear in statements over the years. Not only personal taxes would need to be raised but also wealth tax, capital gains tax, probate tax and all the other things that ALP spokesmen talk about. If we are looking at after tax income we need to look at the policies of an alternative government and wonder what level of taxation would be needed to fund them. A very good reason why the Labor Party must talk about increasing taxation levels is the string of promises which have been made which would inevitably lead to some source of funds from the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; If that is what the honourable senator is suggesting, if that is the way in which he makes promises, then so be it. That is his statement, not mine. The honourable senator says he can make promises and not pay for them. Senator Walsh also mentioned inflation in the discussion today . The Government believes that inflation remains at the forefront as the principal threat to this economy and to our competitive position on world markets. That is why we recognise the dangers posed by constant demands for higher wages and shorter working hours and the strikes which threaten the livelihood of many Australians. None of these issues were addressed by Senator Walsh. Given the nature of his party, he would not be in a position to raise such matters as the demand for higher wages, shorter working hours and strikes. He would probably find himself off the front bench and not able to confront an issue which is basic to economic security and health. Senator Walsh would not deny that we have reduced inflation from the record levels under the Whitlam Government and that by international standards our record in this area has been among the more successful in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another matter mentioned by Senator Walsh was economic growth. He was prepared to admit that last year Australia's growth rate was significantly higher than that in most industralised countries. In OECD countries there was a growth rate of only just over one per cent while Australia recorded a solid 3 per cent rate of growth. Of course, he did not acknowledge the high investment figures which I mentioned earlier in this debate. On the figures that come from comparable countries in the OECD area we must recognise that our solid 3 per cent growth last year in comparison with just over one per cent of other countries is something again which shows the inherent strength and development of the Australian economy. Senator Walsh discussed interest rates. Interest rates are high; no one denies that. Given the international environment, particularly the American interest rates, there is no magic wand, as Senator Walsh might like to have us think, to bring the level of interest rates down. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the sorts of policies that are put forward by the Australian Labor Party can only exacerbate the current economic difficulties. The policies that were followed by the Labor Party when in government, which caused such economic devastation to this country, continue to be expressed as the policies of the present ALP Opposition. The ALP policies of high deficits and lax monetary policies could only compound the difficulties that we now face. In view of the fact that Senator Walsh mentioned world economic trends on the domestic economy during the term of the Whitlam Government, it is worth bringing a few points to his attention. Our criticism in 1974 was directed not so much at the disruptive state of the world economy but rather at the extent to which the policies of the Labor Government aggravated and encouraged, through expansion of the money supply and expenditure, encouragement of the wage explosion and deficits, the influence on the Australian economy of world economic trends. We criticised that aspect and not the fact that the world economy was in a particular state. The way in which the Whitlam Government attempted to address the questions and the policies that were at that time operative with regard to the money supply and the expanson of expenditure-its approach to economic responsiblity was completely reckless-was the matter that we had under debate. We are happy to debate that at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to bring some balance into this debate today to get away from the purely negative and denigratory statements that have been made by Senator Walsh. I acknowledge that there are economic difficulties, but prospects and opportunities are also before the Australian people. If we indulge always in abuse and exaggeration, I think we only cloud the real issues. The Opposition has failed to come up with any credible alternative policies. I think that highlights the continuing irresponsibility of the party to which Senator Walsh belongs and the party which would aspire some time to be the government of this country. I argue that when debating the state of the Australian economy we should look to its strengths, its achievements and the undoubted investment confidence that has been shown and hope that by working together in a different way from that put forward by Senator Walsh we will ultimately provide the opportunities for employment for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh was criticised by the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) for allegedly attacking and denigrating Australia's efforts. Senator Walsh was seeking rather to protect Australia and the Australian people from the inadequate and unsatisfactory economic performance of the Fraser Government. He was, in fact, setting about to denigrate the policies that that Government has been performing in its seventh year of office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) only a week ago came to the Parliament with a most pessimistic portrayal of the state of the Australian economy. He sought to tell the Australian people that they should reduce their expectations, tighten their belts and put up with the state of affairs facing the Australian economy. This is a marked contrast to his public statements on the eve of the 1980 elections when he promised a $25 billion resource-type development of Australia in which all Australians would profit. Clearly, after seven years in office, this Government has failed to deliver the goods and now, after constant pricking by the Australian Labor Party about the state of the economy, the Prime Minister is forced to come to the Parliament and say that his policies are not working. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make a few points in order to prove the Opposition's point of view. When the British journal, the Economist, recently surveyed the prospects of Australia 's economy in 1980 it did so under the heading 'It will need more than luck.' Indeed, the survey pointed out, very clearly, the fact that our economic development depends very much on the strategy that we, Australia, map out now in this crucial period of an uncertain international climate. In the wake of the voters' condemnation of the Government's policies in the Lowe by-election, Mr Fraser and the Minister for Finance have made it clear that they do not intend to reconsider their economic strategy; that is, the economic strategy that has directed Australia's development for the past six years. The Prime Minister, in his most recent radio talk, said plainly that the thrusts of his monetary economic policy would be maintained. In other words, he will follow the policies of President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher and will continue in the belief that those policies are of benefit to Australia. Yet these are the economic policies which have brought many Australians misery and hardship, put thousands more out of work and brought production and growth to a virtual standstill. These policies have brought every major economic and social indicator to their lowest ebb in years. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like today to draw the Senate's attention to some of these indicators and to point out to the Minister that her figures are to be challenged and refuted. For example, the most recent figures on unemployment released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show unemployment officially at 482,600, some 7 per cent of the work force. We know that many other thousands can be added to that because of hidden figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at taxation. This Government came to office with a welter of anti- tax statements claiming that it would reduce the tax burden on the Australian people. This has been proven to be the biggest lie of the Fraser Government. Taxes have not been reduced. They have increased, and the burden has fallen heavily upon the average wage earner. In the years 1980, 1981 and 1982 the total Commonwealth tax receipts as a portion of gross domestic product increased by over 2 per cent. Net pay-as-you-earn receipts-that is, tax collected from Mr and Mrs Average Australian-have risen from 41.7 per cent of total tax revenue to 45. 7 in the current year. At the same time taxes collected from non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers-that is, those with incomes from business, property or dividends-have fallen from 13.1 per cent of total tax revenue to 9.5 per cent. So there has been a redistribution from the poor to the wealthy. In the years 1975-76 to 1980 -81, the last year for which statistics are available, tax payments by PAYE taxpayers increased by 101 per cent, while total wages, salaries, supplements, et cetera have grown by only 72 per cent. Over the same period, payments by non- pay-as-you-earn taxpayers grew by 56 per cent, while their incomes grew in the same period by some 94 per cent. These figures underline the fact that the tax system under this Government is working against the average PAYE taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the cuts that have taken place in living standards-the social wage. With cuts in most areas of government spending, assistance and welfare, particularly those that benefit people in their day to day lives, it is estimated that the average tradesman has lost something like $22.50 per week in cuts in the social wage, as we call it. That same tradesman has lost an extra $ 31 per week through tax hikes. In total, $53 per week has been taken out of the wage earner's pocket by the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at inflation which Senator Walsh referred to in his matter of public importance. It is now well into double figures. The most recent figures released in the December quarter show that inflation is running at 11.3 per cent . In the area of growth and employment several key factors of the economy have witnessed a downturn. Generally employment growth has slowed while in sectors such as building construction, iron and steel production, motor vehicle production, primary production and the textile industry there have been significant downturns. Let us look at some of the specific figures in these areas. In the building construction industry in December there was an 11.7 per cent decline in the seasonally adjusted number of private dwelling approvals. In the area of government building there was a 23.3 per cent decline in approvals for the month of December last. There was a 19 per cent reduction in pig iron production in the year from December 1980 to December 1981. One of today's papers indicates that Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd will retrench some 3,000 people from the steel works. The figures for raw steel production for that period show a 15 per cent drop. In the motor vehicle and related manufacturing industries car and station wagon production fell by 34,229 units in 1980-81 and tyre production dropped by 683,000. In primary production whole milk production went down by 231 million litres in 1980-81; cheese production went down by 17,477 tonnes; and beef and veal production went down by 98,400 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the mining sector-the cornerstone of the Fraser Government's economic strategy, as the Government says. The so-called resources boom has not fulfilled the expectations suggested in the Liberal Party policy statements only some 18 months ago. The fact of the matter is that whilst resource development has moved ahead it has not done so at the speed predicted and it cannot solely provide the basis for sound, overall economic development in this country. Yet this Government has relied solely upon that sector as a source of growth in the Australian economy. The top eight mining companies, in the year 1980 to 1981, were facing an enormous downturn in profit of $550m to $150m. The share market, of course, reflects such downturns. The slump in recent weeks is related in part to this failure in the resource sector along with international trends. Let us look also at capital inflow. Another key element of the Government's economic strategy has been the dependence on a large inflow of largely resource-related foreign capital. However, this inflow has fluctuated wildly and unpredictably. February's figures show a sharp rise in capital inflow from $252m in January to $674m in the next month. Much of this has been caused by heavy borrowing overseas because domestic credit has been too tight. </PARA>
<PARA> I have touched on just some of the problems in our economy today. The picture is one of gloom, one of decline and one that was painted pessimistically by our Prime Minister only last week. Falling living standards combined with high taxes , falling production, high unemployment, a credit squeeze and a shaky Australian dollar would surely underline the need for a new economic strategy. But no, not for the Prime Minister; it is the same old recipe for him, a continuation of the monetarist policies. The Fraser Government's economic approach can be characterised in three words-chaos, conflict and confrontation. There is chaos because there is no real organisation in the Government's approach and because no one in our country is really sure of where we are going. There is a downturn in some sectors while others prosper. There are moves for deregulation in some sectors and confusion in others. The point is that the Australian economy is being allowed to drift in line with international trends. The manufacturing sector continues to be pushed aside; public sector endeavours are relegated to irrelevancy while some export oriented concerns are profiting. The stalling of the world minerals market means our resources sector stalls too. </PARA>
<PARA> There is conflict between the competing interests in the economy with no attempt by the Government to resolve this conflict. Recent statements on the one hand, by the Australian Industries Development Association which urged deregulation along the lines of the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and comments, on the other hand, by the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia predicting low production, low sales and high import competition for manufacturing illustrate the conflicts which are unresolved as a result of the attitudes taken by the Fraser Government . The Government has no ability to resolve these conflicts; it seems to have no desire to resolve these conflicts because there is conflict in its own ranks. Fraser, Howard and Anthony cannot agree on the key economic issues before us. The Government can only drag out its well-worn tactic of industrial confrontation with belligerent behaviour in the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and hard-nosed new industrialised legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation before us points surely to the need for the Federal Government to take hold of the situation, to grasp the nettle and to intervene in the economy in an orderly and organised fashion. Labor would seek to do this, not just let economic trends wash over us without any aim or purpose. Central to Labor's approach to economic management would be a program to attack inflation, stimulate production, increase employment and maintain real living standards. In such a program key elements would include a prices and incomes policy which would seek to regulate the inflationary trends of ad hoc, unco-ordinated price and wage rises while guaranteeing the maintenance of existing living standards. Labor agreement and negotiation with the union movement and with employers would be crucial here. </PARA>
<PARA> We need a policy of tax relief for the average taxpayer combined with a no- nonsense approach to tax avoidance which would assist in maintaining real incomes and taxing those with real wealth. We need a firm commitment to public services and benefits in health, education and welfare. We need to work in co- operation with the States. We need a planned policy of overall industrial development and financial regulation which would allow Australia to create and maintain a wide range of industries for employment and production. This could include, and probably should include, government involvement in some key areas but would revolve mainly around government encouragement for private sector development. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given some indication of the way we will go with our more expansionary policies built on a prices and incomes policy. Labor intends to proceed that way . We have been prepared to look at new policies and initiatives. That is one of the reasons why the Australian electorate is turning towards the Australian Labor Party. It is doing this because our policies stand in marked contrast to the failed policies of the Fraser Government which have led to the sad deterioration in confidence and performance in recent months and years. One only has to say: This Government, which will have served more than eight years when it faces the electors in 1983, will have had ample opportunity to put some stability into the Australian economy, to restore some business confidence in the Australian business community and to restore some confidence in the Australian people in their national government. This Government has failed dismally to do just that. It ill becomes a government spokesman in this place to seek to denigrate the constructive opposition of the Labor Party, which seeks constantly in this place to suggest the course of action that ought to be taken by a national and sensible Australian government. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard tables prepared from the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development's 'Economic Outlook' and from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to substantiate the claims that we have made in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a matter initiated by the Australian Labor Party Opposition whereby the Liberal-National Country Party coalition is required to justify its economic policies which have an impact on such matters as inflation, interest rates, taxation, real income, economic growth and unemployment. The incorporation of so many important issues in a debate with such tight time limitations, I believe, is a reflection of the lack of appreciation by the Opposition of many of these critical issues of our time. Indeed, I think that at the same time it is timely that we have had the opportunity to put on record some of the facts and some of the achievements of our Government. I thank the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) for so succinctly and so clearly putting these achievements before the people listening to the broadcast of these proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the Minister for Finance puts on record these achievements I think we have to recognise at the same time that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, has virtually turned his back on economic reality. Regrettably, the shadow spokesman on finance, Senator Walsh, stands alone in his personal economic rationalism. Unfortunately, he has had to hide these virtues behind a cloak of vitriolic attacks on the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). To suggest that we can achieve regulated low interest rates in a world of high interest rates at the same time as achieving a necessary inflow of capital funds from overseas to the tune of $8 billion to $10 billion I think is parallel to trying to defy the laws of gravity. Mr B. T. Loton, the managing director of Australia's largest manufacturing company, the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, said that the surplus world steel capacity was the biggest single issue for Australia's steel making. He went on to say that 'while other steel producers in the countries in which they are operating seek to sell steel at almost any price, we do not really see a diminution of our difficulties unless we can keep some of the imports out'. This BHP story can be told a hundred times over. The threat to Australian jobs is ever present when other countries adopt such policies and when a vocal number of people in Australia stress that Australia should take advantage of such depressed world prices and import such competing goods. This is at the cost of local jobs and at a time when the economy, we believe, cannot afford it. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the magnitude and the proliferation of some recent wage claims, our Government is determined to prevent a wage explosion which could be so destabilising to the other relativities. We are determined to prevent a repeat of the 1973-74 experience of wage leapfrogging. Personally I regret the decision last year to discontinue wage indexation, because now we have a system of collective bargaining without the United States-style penalties for breaches. Coupled with that we have national wage decisions. I submit that we now have almost a jungle situation, with some people getting the best of both worlds and with the stronger unions able to secure wage rises which inevitably lead to situations in which people with the same qualifications but employed by different industries receive vastly different rewards for their services. This happens not because one is better in his trade than the other, but simply because one is employed in a situation in which one union has much more industrial muscle than the other. I believe we now have a situation of industrial difficulties which is a far cry from the comparative wage justice we had up to the late 1960s when there was a basic wage plus margins for skill. This was generally accepted community philosophy, and I believe the sooner we return to that sort of equity the better we will be. </PARA>
<PARA> It is regrettable that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has disbanded its concern for obtaining wage justice across the board, is pandering to the whims of the strong and the militant and is disregarding the unemployed and those who are likely to be unemployed in the near future because of excessive wage demands . The Australian Economic Review, fourth quarter 1981, chapter 1, under the heading 'Domestic Outlook' acknowledges that the short term prospects for the economy have become more uncertain because of the abandonment of wage indexation and the subsequent proliferation of wage claims by the stronger unions in their so-called bid to restore certain relativities.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the positive things that have been achieved. The rate of increase in business investment in Australia in the last financial year, as the Minister for Finance said, was the highest for 30 years. Of the 27 manufactured items reported by the Australian Statistician, 19 registered increased product levels over the last quarter and the major growth sectors were energy and the construction industry. If we look at petroleum exploration development, a key area of resource development, we see that it is predicted that between 280 and 300 wells will be drilled in Australia this year compared with 27 in 1975. That 1982 estimate is double the 1981 exploration program and will involve the expenditure of in excess of $800m. Mr Orchison, the director of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association, says that 'the very significant increase in exploration effort predicted for 1982 reflects Australia's healthy political climate compared with the rest of the world'. That is a very significant matter. It has already been claimed that Australia's household disposable income after tax rose by nearly $300m. It is true that there has been an absolute growth in terms of numbers-we acknowledge that-but significant growth is there. So, let us recognise that it does exist. In the last two years to the December quarter average weekly earnings increased by over $13 in real terms. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicts a growth of over 3 per cent for Australia in 1982. The value of retail sales last December was 13 per cent higher than in 1980. Investment is healthy. Generally overall aggregate of taxation is lower than for most of our trading partners. The OECD predicts a further growth of 3 per cent for Australia in 1982 compared with the OECD average prediction of only one per cent. Consumer demand continues to be relatively strong. In 1981, 83,000 extra jobs were created. Our aim is to try to create a climate in which real tax cuts will be a viable proposition. The Prime Minister has said that the Australian dollar will continue to be devalued in line with the market. It has fallen about 6 per cent in recent times. This is indeed good news for primary producers who have been hard pressed to get realistic prices for their livestock. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems we have to acknowledge in this debate is that the instruments available to any government, be it a Liberal government or a Labor government, unfortunately are very blunt. Let me give an example of some of the problems that individuals face as a result of industrial dislocation. I come from Tasmania, for which the waterfront presents major difficulties. I instance the situation of a small beekeeper at Mole Creek. I think we can appreciate the difficulties when we come down to specifics in a dimension that we can appreciate. This honey producer has built up a nice export market. He produces a quality product and is shipping honey to the United States. But what happened recently? A container of his sat on the mainland wharves for three months because of a demarcation dispute. Being a small businessman, he had a problem of lack of capital; he had to finance a wages bill of about $70,000 per annum. Honourable senators might say that that is not much, but in a small country town in Tasmania that is a very significant amount. We have to overcome these types of demarcation disputes because small businessmen and small entrepreneurs in small country towns are very much at risk because of the industrial muscle of some unions fighting over demarcation issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I used that example because I think it brings home quite significantly and pointedly some of the problems that small businessmen are facing. The BHPs and the Utahs can probably face a bit of dislocation without fear of going out of business, but the small businessman is being pushed out of business daily by strike action. If we are to meet high wage demands with tight monetary policy, one of the fall-outs unfortunately will be an increase in unemployment. That is why I said that inevitably it is unfortunate that the instruments available to governments, irrespective of their political colour, are fairly blunt. </PARA>
<PARA> In my closing remarks I express regret that we use this chamber to denigrate distinguished Australians in their professional capacities. Professor Pollard used certain years to make his comparisons-I suppose everybody has to do that- but he examined real rises in household incomes and compared them with average weekly earnings. He not only examined the ownership of motor cars, which has increased, but also compared the cost movements of the vehicles. Using 1980-81 figures, as was mentioned, he selected an income of $10,000 for a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and found that the tax rate had fallen 21 per cent. In any analysis one has to select certain years and Professor Pollard may have selected years which suited his particular argument. </PARA>
<PARA> As my time is limited, I challenge the Treasury officials and economists to examine the philosophy of the economic consequence of the supply of and the demand for credit, which is recognised as being highly elastic, and of the impact of the elasticity of interest rates on borrowings at various levels of government budgetary deficits. For example Peter Crawford, Vice-President of the Economics Department of Citibank, has suggested that while the United States Federal Government deficit is increasing money supply growth, the 'crowding out' effect, to use his words, 'is mild'. I think the economic debate in Australia would be enhanced if economists could devote some time to looking at these relativities. </PARA>
<PARA> World leaders are seeking single solutions to solve their problems and bring their economies out of the recession. Mrs Thatcher has strongly pursued a monetary policy but at the same time she has presided over large increases in wage payments to public servants. In the United States supply theory economics was supposed to overcome that country's ills. In more recent times a new-found enthusiasm has emerged for the gold standard. I have read of my father's public concern about poverty amidst plenty during the midst of the cruel Depression of the 1930s. Surely that type of situation is one in which we find ourselves today , not only with the Third World and the Western world but also within our own nation. I believe that much of this imbalace is based on greed.</PARA>
<PARA> To introduce a policy of gold standard for coin would bring about austere restraints. The theory is to dampen the increase in money supply and inflation, gold having a limited supply. It is true there was significant inflation during the 1850s when there were large gold discoveries in Australia but gold is a sensitive indicator of monetary policy. It does represent a store value and has a number of inherent characteristics which are significant in this debate. I believe any debate on this issue can only enhance the understanding amongst people in trying to solve not only Australia's problems but also the world economic difficulties in which Australia is playing a very significant part. Australia has provided a lead to many other nations by its sound economic outlook. Other nations are looking to Australia to provide the lead and I believe our Government is doing just that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are essentially debating the basic economic approach of the Government. Is that approach right or is it wrong? I well remember the first time that Milton Friedman visited this country. We were invited to a large dinner and we waited with baited breath to hear what the great man would have to say. We expected it to be complicated and difficult to follow. In fact it was a deceptively simple message. Milton Friedman said that good economic management required only one thing, the control of the rate of increase of the money supply. Providing the rate of increase in the money supply was controlled everything else fell into place. We did not need to worry about excessive demands by trade unions, we did not need to worry about excessive profits by big business and we did not need to worry about interest rates. That was Milton Friedman's very simple message. It is not surprising that the Government adopted this approach hook, line and sinker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has for five years adopted a very firm monetarist policy. If it is going to be successful we should be seeing results by now. What in fact do we see? We see that we have record inflation; unemployment is at a record level; interest rates are at record levels; taxation is the highest in our history and real income and economic growth have fallen. The Government is turning to international events as the cause of this problem. There is no doubt that the international climate is serious and that the world is in danger of falling into a very extended and deep recession. But there are countries that one can point to that have been successful in controlling inflation without creating large unemployment. I refer to countries such as Austria and Japan. What Australia needs is a basic new approach to economic management; no less than that. Using unemployment to control inflation is a crime against society. </PARA>
<PARA> A well-known economist of my acquaintance said in private conversation some little while ago that there was no way to control inflation other than through a deep and sustained period of unemployment. The Australian Democrats reject absolutely and flatly that approach to economic management. We rejected it in 1977, at a time when it was fashionable to be a monetarist and to adopt the monetarist approach to economic management. We still reject it now when it is becoming increasingly apparent to most people that the Government's approach to economic management has to be changed, and changed quickly and urgently. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats' approach to management of this economy has three basic initiatives. The creation of full employment must be the first objective; a genuine partnership between the interests of labour and capital must be the second objective and long term national indicative planning, which clearly sets out national goals so that we know when we are working in the interests of the country and the State, must be the third objective. Such long term planning is essential in the modern world. It is the only way that we can control our destiny. Those who do not plan are inevitably swamped by the tide of history. Those who do plan effectively build a dyke against which fortune beats as she will. </PARA>
<PARA> I well remember, in my company some 20 years ago, suggesting to my board of directors that we had to have a five-year plan. At that time the older members of the board pooh-poohed the idea. They said: 'How on earth can you plan five years ahead? Who knows what is going to happen tomorrow, or next week let alone what will happen in five years time'. Today there would not be a successful business enterprise that did not involve itself in very careful and detailed planning on an annual basis, a five-year basis or a ten-year basis. The sorts of arguments against planning that I heard in the boardroom 20 years ago are precisely those arguments that I have been hearing recently from certain sections of the Government and certain sections of the Department of the Treasury. They are worried about predicting what is likely to happen. For instance, if tomorrow Australia discovered sufficient oil to make it self- sufficient or if we discovered more oil here than there now is known to be in Saudi Arabia that would not be an excuse for not planning; it would be a reason to change the plan. We must quantify our long term objectives, we have to involve ourselves in round table discussions with vital sectors of the community and we have to continually update our plan in the light of circumstances as they occur. </PARA>
<PARA> In August last year the Democrats brought down an alternative Budget. At that time we said that the economy was heading down and what was needed was not a deflationary Budget but a reflationary one; the economy had to be selectively stimulated. We criticised the size of the Government's domestic surplus and said that within the confines of a balanced Budget there could be a 7 per cent increase in spending on education, health and social services. We said that personal income tax could be indexed. We suggested that a special fund should be set up for small business, that preference should be given to manufacture of our defence equipment in Australia, that home buyers should be helped and that spending on roads, public transport and sewerage should be increased by at least $100m in real terms. Above all we said that the home building industry had to be stimulated because this was one area that was efficient, Australian-owned and would respond quickly to additional government stimulation. If that had happened late last year the Government would not now be facing the problem of decreasing revenue. If the economy had been stimulated at that time we would now be seeing revenue increasing and the problem of budgetary deficits would not be occurring.</PARA>
<PARA> At present the rate of unemployment is running at about 7 per cent. The real rate of unemployment is probably of the order of 10 per cent. Because we have under-utilised resources, it is not unreasonable to predict that the gross national product is of the order of 10 per cent less than it could otherwise be if we had full employment. That represents an enormous amount of money, something like $20,000m. We should pause for a moment and consider the easier task that the Government would have if we were fully utilising our resources. While the economy is hampered with this 10 per cent under-utilisation of resources, in total terms it cannot be operating effectively and efficiently. Having large scale unemployment makes a mockery of productivity and increases inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of economic management that I refer to, a genuine partnership between the interests of labour and capital, can hardly be over-emphasised. We have an appalling industrial relations record in Australia. Senator Watson referred to the problems of a small beekeeper in Tasmania. I can only sympathise with the beekeeper. This sort of thing is happening every day of the week. We have to get a basic new approach to industrial relations. I suggest that this can only be achieved by a genuine partnership between the interests of labour and capital. Why should we not have enterprises that are partly owned by the employees? The nineteenth century confrontation between the interests of labour and capital does not have to apply indefinitely. We can get a co-operative attitude. It is amazing what can be achieved when every individual in an organisation uses his or her abilities to the maximum degree. That sort of involvement with people has got to beat a dictatorial approach by management every time. It will certainly minimise the problems of industrial relations in this country. If people were working in an industrial environment that would allow them to use their qualities of initiative, imagination, technical expertise and sociability, and if this sort of environment were engendered in our industrial enterprises, in the Public Service and in the economy generally, we would be amazed at what this country could achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that the United States is now beginning to realise that the fundamental reason why the Japanese are building better and more reliable cars than are coming from Detroit is because the management of human resources in Japan is far more enlightened than it is in the United States. The United States is trying to do something about this. Alistair Cooke said on 'Letter from America' recently that he was surprised in Detroit when he saw the cream of management in that citadel of manufacturing sitting down at a seminar and being lectured by the Japanese on how they could decentralise their management and how control of their enterprises could, to a greater degree, be put in the hands of the workers. This is the new and enlightened approach; this is the approach that the Japanese have proved works. It is the approach that some of the more enlightened companies in this country have proved works. It is an approach that we in Australia have to adopt rapidly if we are to compete, if we are to avoid becoming an industrial backwater. Unless we look at the long term future, unless we worry about unemployment and unless we try to get a genuine partnership between labour and capital, this country will lumber along under the twin strains of tight money and spiralling wages. We can have a new approach. But this requires men and women of imagination and vision. In this country we need a Franklin Roosevelt to cast aside the tunnel vision of the Herbert Hoovers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating an omnibus subject covering a number of different matters. I interpret the central core of this discussion of the matter of public importance to be economic management. It surprises me somewhat that the Australian Labor Party wants to debate economic management because, as my colleagues before me have shown-I intend to reinforce their views-the economic management of the Fraser Government since it came to office in 1975 has, on any basis, been sound and, on an international comparison , has been most impressive. On the other hand, there is no other area in which the Labor Party is so devoid of policy. For that reason, to the Australian public it lacks credibility. It criticises but offers no real alternative. We hear from the Labor Party a cry of pessimism and gloom. But its pessimism and gloom on this subject does not stand objective analysis. I invite the Senate briefly to consider an objective analysis of the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development, the OECD, which, as the Senate knows, compares the economic performances of the highly developed Western nations and makes predictions as to their economic future. In its most recent publication in January this year, the OECD, on the subject of gross national product in Australia said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1978, real GDP has increased at more than twice the average rate for the OECD area as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>On unemployment, the OECD said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . employment has risen strongly contrary to experience in many other Member countries. </PARA>
<PARA>What does it say of the future? Again, in respect of the gross national product, it forecast moderate growth over the next 18 months. That, in the current world economy, is a compliment. Its future prediction for Australia's employment figure is for a further steady increase. That is an overview of the objective analysis of independent experts. How does the OECD come to these conclusions? At least, in part, it must have looked at the statistics that are available for the last full year, 1980-81. On any interpretation they must be regarded as impressive. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the Senate's attention a number of economic indicators. The growth of the non-farm economy for 1980-81 was faster than in any year since the 1970s. The figure was approximately 4 per cent. Where does that lie in relation to the other OECD countries? According to a report put out recently by the National Westminster Bank, it put Australia at the top. There has been a 4 per cent growth as opposed to such countries as Austria which had a negative growth rate of 0.7 per cent. Belgium also had a negative growth rate of minus 0.8 per cent; Canada had a growth rate of 2.5 per cent; France had a negative growth rate of minus 0.4 per cent; Greece had a growth rate of one per cent; Italy had a negative growth rate of minus one per cent; the Netherlands had a negative growth rate of minus 0.5 per cent; New Zealand had a growth rate of 2.5 per cent ; Norway had a growth rate of one per cent; Spain had a growth rate of 1.8 per cent; Sweden had a negative growth rate of minus 0.5 per cent; Switzerland had a growth rate of one per cent; the United Kingdom had a negative growth rate of minus 2.5 per cent; the United States had a growth rate of 1.8 per cent; and West Germany had a negative growth rate of minus 1.5 per cent. Australia is at the top of the ladder. Probably no better indication could be put to the Senate of the economic management performance of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Production, employment, investment and consumer demand were all stronger in this last full year, 1980-81. Private business fixed investment grew by more than 20 per cent in real terms. As the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) said a little earlier, this was the largest growth for more than 30 years-a most impressive figure in anyone's language. Private dwelling investment continued to grow firmly with a real increase of about 11 per cent. Real wages-I repeat, real wages-rose by over 4 per cent. Real household disposable incomes rose by $2.9 billion after tax. There was a strong lift in personal consumption expenditure of about 3.25 per cent. That also is in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Total employment increased by 2.6 per cent-140,000 extra jobs. Growth in the consumer price index was kept at 9.4 per cent, which, when compared with many other countries in the OECD was above average. I draw the Senate's attention, for comparative purposes, to the inflation rate in Canada for the same year, which was 12.4 per cent. In Italy the inflation rate was 19.5 per cent, France, 13.1 per cent, Sweden, 12.1 per cent, the United Kingdom, 11.9 per cent, and the United States of America, 10.4 per cent. That is another example of how comparatively, on that major economic principle, Australia is performing soundly . As we are often reminded by the Opposition, business profits during that year grew strongly. On all of those indices the Government performed well. Do we hear the Opposition give credit for that performance in that year?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What year?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the year 1980-81. We hear no credit for that performance. In the current year, 1981-82, it is, of course, more difficult to obtain statistics because the year is only part-completed. The statistics that are available indicate a trend in the same direction. That is the important thing. One of the accepted guides of consumer confidence is the registration of new motor vehicles . I invite the Senate to look at the changes that are occurring in that field. Last year registrations rose by 4.54 per cent. So there was a rise in 1980-81. The latest figures reflect a continuing confidence. The seasonally adjusted figures for December were still 3.9 per cent higher than for November and 6.1 per cent higher than for the previous December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will expand the argument into the subject of general retail purchases. Seasonally adjusted retail sales generally increased by 3 per cent in December and were 12 per cent higher in the December quarter 1981 than in the December quarter 1980. What of average weekly earnings? Last year they rose by 13.5 per cent-a substantial increase. That rise was budgeted to be repeated this year. Increases in the September quarter of 12.4 per cent indicate that performance is much in line with Budget. Provided that the Government can keep its inflation prediction of 10.75 per cent the result again will be a surplus in real household disposable income. The only estimates that are available for the six months to the September quarter show that a rise of 3.2 per cent is likely and that this is likely to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the area of business investment. This also continues to rise. Private business gross fixed investment expanded strongly at a rate of 22.2 per cent in the six months to last September. Figures issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 24 February this year show that during the first six months of the current financial year new fixed capital expenditure by private enterprises topped $8 billion. That was 29.3 per cent higher than for the same period in 1980-81. The Bureau survey of what businessmen plan to invest for the remainder of the financial year found that the 1981-82 total was expected to reach $16.53 billion. Obviously this is an indication that businessmen see the economic management of this Government to be more than satisfactory. A good indication of the state of the economy is always overseas confidence in the economy. The figures just released for the December quarter last year show an increase of $ 498m above that of the previous quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the figures I have mentioned Australia is in an economically sound position. As an economic manager, the Government has a successful record. That does not mean that we do not see problems. We recognise the problems and we move to find remedies. The OECD sees our main economic concern, in both the short and the medium term, as inflation. But again the Organisation gives credit to the Government. It said in the report to which I referred earlier, the one published in January this year, that the current stance of macro-economic policy seems the only possible way to cope with the containment of inflation in the immediate future. In the longer term it suggests that we need to look at both our protection policy and our wage determination system. In other words, it says that we must moderate protection and restrain wage increases if we are to continue to control inflation and cope with the major economic problem that faces us. That is the policy of the Government. Yet this Government is condemned for that. The Labor Party advocates greater protection and criticises us in our attempts to restrain wages. It is no wonder the Labor Government was able to achieve an inflation rate in 1974 of around 16.4 per cent. Yet today Opposition members are determined to criticise us for an inflation rate which, as I stated, is so substantially lower. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts unemployment as a problem. Although our economic policies have played a part in the creation of 102,200 new jobs in the last 12 months to January and 242,200 jobs in the last two years to January-they are figures that should not be forgotten-we as a government accept that the rate of unemployment remains too high. However, no solution to overcoming that problem that is put forward anywhere in the world is better than the Australian approach of creating a climate for strong economic growth. It is interesting to note the endorsement we received at the recent meeting of OCED Employment Ministers held in Paris only a fortnight ago. They decided, as it has been reported, that efforts to combat unemployment could be successful only in the framework of competent and effective anti-inflationary policy. Again I remind the Senate that that is the policy of this Government. Those Ministers also said that unions and employers should realise the importance of wage restraint in the current circumstances. This Government, as opposed to the Opposition, recognises that. Under this Government Australia has been able to swim against the tide of international economic adversity. That has been primarily due to the sound economic management of its government. This is a record of economic management that is applauded throughout the world. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> I think it is fair to note that the major decision relating both to the aggregate payments and to the relativities between the states for this financial year came from the infamous Premiers Conference of June 1981, after which it will be recalled the Treasurer (Mr Howard), at the bidding of the Prime Minister (Mr Fraser), leaked boastful statements about conning the Premiers out of the $ 70m that the Government had been otherwise willing to give them and he effectively said to the media: 'The Premiers are a bunch of mugs and we are very macho, tough and clever operators'. The only time that the Treasurer has been in real trouble in his political career was when he was doing the Prime Minister's dirty work. I think he has learned a lesson from that and he will decline from doing the Prime Minister's dirty work in future. It is the last time he will take the rap for Mr Fraser. Since then he has backed away from Mr Fraser's unpopularity-no doubt he has good personal and political reasons for that-just as Sir Phillip Lynch did a couple of weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The aggregate increase in funds to the States will be 9 per cent over 1980-81, a year in which the consumer price index, on the Government's own forecasts, will increase by 10.75 per cent and wages will probably increase by something of the order of 13 per cent. Wages are a more accurate indicator of State governments' financial needs than the consumer price index because wages comprise such a very large part of State governments' total expenditure. Either way there is a very significant squeeze in real terms on the States. I might add that in the same year Commonwealth tax collections from pay-as-you-earn taxpayers will increase by 22 per cent and payments to the States will rise by 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just finished debating a matter of public importance on the series of promises made and subsequently broken by this Government and the false expectations raised by those promises. The award for the most spectacular raising of false expectations among the States would, of course, have to go to Senator Sir John Carrick. He was asked, on 27 April 1976, whether he would guarantee, pursuant to a statement he had made the day before, that total payments to the States in real terms would increase by more than 57 per cent in the following three years as they had in the previous three years. He replied: ' My answer is an unqualified yes'. In 1976 Senator Sir John Carrick gave an unqualified guarantee that real payments to the States would increase by 57 per cent. Far from increasing by 57 per cent in real terms total payments have slightly declined. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all the spectacular promises contained in the federalism policy and the false expectations raised by those promises from 1976 right through to mid-1981, in nearly all States in nearly all years the floor on payments to the States was that provided for by the Whitlam formula-the formula much reviled by the State Premiers and governments and, of course, by Mr Fraser and the Liberal Party in Federal Opposition. This year the squeeze has been intensified with this increase in payments of only 9 per cent in a year when the consumer price index is expected to increase by nearly 11 per cent and wages by around 13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The aggregate entitlement of the States for future years is established as being the proportion of total Commonwealth tax revenues, not just income tax revenue, provided for in this Bill. On the vexed question of relativities, sharpened by the release of the Commonwealth Grants Commission report in the middle of last year, this Bill marks time, as was observed by Ralph Willis in the House of Representatives. That question has been shoved into the too-hard basket for the next 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the report came out last year I made some criticism on the public record of some of the assumptions contained in the report. I was about to come to that. Honourable senators opposite will probably be surprised by what I am about to say. I have absolutely no sympathy for this Government when the Premiers and the State governments revile it and complain about its promises to them, which it has broken in the aggregate. The Government has not come good on the false expectations raised by Mr Fraser and most spectacularly, of course, by Senator Sir John Carrick. However, I have a good deal of sympathy for any national government on the separate question of the relativities between the States. No matter what a national government does there will be complaints from some States, or even from all States, that they have been treated unfairly vis-a -vis some other State. That is independent of the general and unanimous complaint about the total level of funds not being high enough. State governments have rarely been averse to spending any amount of money which a Commonwealth Government would provide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On this question the Commonwealth is certainly in a no win position. No matter what it does it will get complaints from some States, or even all States, about the relative share of the total amount which has been more or less arbitrarily determined by the Commonwealth will be distributed to the States. I do not think there is any easy solution to that problem. I am sometimes tempted by the thought that the Commonwealth should invite the States to reach mutual agreement on the relativities or, if they cannot reach unanimous agreement, at least to make some majority decision and submit it to the Commonwealth. However, I suspect that we would have to lock up the State Premiers in a padded cell without food or water for a considerable time before such an agreement would emerge. That, I concede, is an area in which even some of the present Commonwealth Government's more vigorous critics could have a certain amount of sympathy for it, although I might add that the magnitude and intensity of its problems are partly the product of its own failure to deliver what it has promised-quite irresponsibly. I cannot imagine a more irresponsible promise from a Minister in even this Government than that made by Senator Sir John Carrick on 27 April 1976; that is, that in real terms total payments to the States would be increased by more than 57 per cent in three years. </PARA>
<PARA> The other general criticism which I want to make of the Government's policy over the last six years towards funding the States is that for reasons of political expediency it has squeezed the capital expenditure areas much harder than it has squeezed the recurrent expenditure areas. The reasons for that, of course, is that the effects of a neglect of capital expenditure take a good deal longer to become apparent to the electorate than do the effects of reductions in recurrent expenditure. In this area, as in so many other areas, this Government and its Prime Minister, despite their bold rhetoric about taking unpopular decisions and behaving in a statesmanlike way, have behaved as political opportunists to the long term sorrow and damage of the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 to provide, firstly, for the payment of additional tax sharing grants and special allocations totalling $69m to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland and, secondly, the payment of a fixed tax sharing grant of $315m to the Northern Territory. At the Premiers Conference last June at which the Commonwealth Grants Commission report on State tax sharing entitlements was considered it was decided that there would be no change in the relativities contained in the Act in respect of the year 1981-82 and it was agreed to ask the Commission to produce another report on the assessment of State relativities in the light of further submissions put to it by States and by the Commonwealth. The Commission is expected to report by 31 May this year. Because of the likelihood-I would say the certainty-that following this further review the States' relativities will be adjusted in favour of the three most populous States, including Victoria, it was agreed at that Premiers Conference to provide additional grants of $24.5m to New South Wales, $15m to Victoria and $20.5m to Queensland in 1981-82. This Bill implements that agreement. It goes some way towards redressing the disadvantage, perhaps the injustice, which Victorians have suffered for some years under the previous formula for tax sharing grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Victorians pay the highest income tax per capita and the State Government receives the lowest amount per capita of all the States. There is an extraordinary tendency at the moment for people to knock Victoria including, I must admit, some Victorians. Victoria should not be knocked. Let us look at what we have in Victoria. We have the highest per capita income in Australia. We have the lowest unemployment rate of any State in Australia. We have by far the most valuable single mining venture in Australia-Bass Strait oil-which incidentally provides $3 billion a year to the Federal Government, much of which is distributed to other States. We have the most modern container port in the world . We have the largest general cargo port in Australia. We have the best roads and rail network in Australia. We have by far the best metropolitan public transport system. I was astonished in Melbourne the other day to see someone going around with a car sticker which read: 'I am the owner of the worst public transport system in the world'. He is one of the most ignorant people I have ever seen. In fact, we have by far the best in Australia. If he had travelled the world he would have realised that we have one of the best in the world. We have enormous assets because of our central position. </PARA>
<PARA> How has this been done? It has been done partly through the highly efficient management of the State of Victoria over many years. It has also been done by the State Government, in the areas where State governments can impose taxes, imposing nearly the highest rate of income tax of any State in Australia. That is, I submit, unfair to Victorians. We have heard-sometimes with irritation- other States boasting about how they are not using the types of tax that the Victorian Government finds necessary. We feel, and I think justly, that those States are able to do that only because of the subsidy granted by Victoria to them which enables them to get away with lower taxes. This Bill is starting the process of redressing that imbalance. I am sure that when the Grants Commission reports next May it will go further to correct the situation and that the inquiry into health grants will do the same. Victoria will get more revenue, justly, out of Commonwealth reimbursements. This will achieve a great measure of financial fairness. What we have done and what we have achieved in Victoria up to date is quite remarkable. All the knockers should stop knocking. Victoria is the greatest State in the Commonwealth and will continue to go from strength to strength. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable senators who have contributed to this debate for the general support they have given to the propositions before the Senate. The States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Amendment Bill is a Bill to provide additional grants to the States. Without the passage of this Bill through the Parliament the States would be worse off to the extent of $70m. So to that extent it is a Bill which is conferring benefits upon the States and is a further example of the determination of the Federal Government to assist the States wherever possible. The figure contained in the Bill was settled at the June 1981 Premiers Conference and was contained in a Press statement released after that Conference. Further reference to the formula which is to be used is contained in Budget Paper No. 7, which came out with the last Budget, which covers the subject and which gives in detail the formula by which the different calculations concerning the States will be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only point that requires specific reply is that raised by Senator Walsh. It was really a throw-away point. He mentioned that the increase for the States was only 9 per cent while inflation was running at a higher level. I am advised that if we take the 9 per cent increase and look at additional grants which are being made to the States, including grants covered by this amendment, the Bill gives an increase of around 11 per cent. The Commonwealth Government can say that it has kept faith with the States in terms of reimbursement. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill has come into the Senate for the third time. It has twice been rejected in this place and in reintroducing it the Government has given no grounds for treating it differently on this occasion. The second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), in setting out the purpose of the Bill, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . for so long as a person's spouse is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit because of involvement in industrial action; or unwillingness to undertake suitable work; or failure to take reasonable steps to obtain such work, that person will also be ineligible for unemployment benefit. Additionally, a person will be ineligible for unemployment benefit for so long as payment of that benefit to the person's spouse is postponed because of their misconduct as a worker; because they have become voluntarily unemployed; or because they have failed to accept an offer of suitable employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Not even the Minister's first description of the Bill is honest. The word ' involvement' is deliberately misleading. Involvement, by the Minister's definition, includes people thousands of miles away in the same union who have been laid off by a dispute of which they have no knowledge or information. This subjective use of language extends to the spouses of those whose benefits are postponed because of misconduct or voluntary unemployment; both reasons being the results of subjective judgments and different interpretations in different offices of the Department of Social Security throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a Bill which is firstly an attack not just on the families of strikers, as it claims, but also on the families of all trade union members. It is designed to turn belonging to a trade union into a personal liability. As I said , even if a unionist lived thousands of miles away from an industrial dispute and was completely ignorant of the fact that one had occurred, if his factory closed down as a result of the dispute, the fact that he had trade union membership would stop his family claiming social service benefits. If he was not in a union he and his family would be all right. It is the fact that he is a union member that draws the Government's fire. This is not social services legislation; it is a Bill intended to weaken trade unions and trade union membership without entirely forbidding their existence. This legislation comes from a government which weeps crocodile tears about the rights of Polish workers . I will in general refer to a trade unionist as 'he', although of course the legislation applies equally to women unionists with unemployed spouses. It has, however, been labelled by several Ministers and the Press as a Bill affecting the wives of strikers. The Minister has been tediously trotting out examples of payments to wives of unionists in dispute in assorted isolated mining towns to back up his emotional rhetoric, trying to identify these families in the Australian work force as enemies of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> The second feature of this Bill is a further restriction on the unemployed so that the spouse of an unemployed person who is stopped from receiving unemployment benefit for between six and 12 weeks cannot herself-or himself- receive social service benefits during that time at the single rate or their children receive the allowances normally paid to the children of those on unemployment benefit. Both features of this Bill, as they apply to the families of union members and the families of persons allegedly failing the work test or becoming voluntarily unemployed, are extensions of similar vindictive legislation passed by this Government in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the industrial action provisions of this Bill. The Minister has claimed that he is not discussing the merits of strike action, yet almost every word of his second reading speech is devoted to categorising strike action as an assault against the community, the taxpayer and the law. He states that the Government will not be swayed by what he calls emotional and misleading arguments which direct attention from the Government's fundamental concern. I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that he has not heard such arguments in this chamber. He has heard a reasoned case based firstly on the premise that membership of a trade union should not be a punishable offence, and secondly on the strong belief of everyone on this side of the chamber that wives and children should not suffer because this Government, which has so mishandled the economy, is determined to put the screws on two of its favourite scapegoats-the trade unions and the unemployed. We hear continuously in this chamber, in another place and outside the Parliament, rhetoric about the evils of trade unionism and statements about the unwillingness of the unemployed to work. It was this Government which dredged up the term 'dole bludger'. It was this Government whose former Treasurer told the people of this country that unemployment was a myth. Those are empty words after all these years. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Government continues to raise the question of the payment of unemployment benefit to spouses in isolated mining communities, let me deal with it now. Workers in isolated mining communities, if married, are in a family situation in which that family is totally dependent on the money the miner brings in. Only their union membership puts them in any kind of bargaining situation with their employers. If we are talking about mining companies in this country, we are talking, in the main, about overseas owners who direct their work practices towards maximising profits, not necessarily towards towards economic justice. The families in general cannot have a second income, for there are few jobs for women in these male dominated communities. Throughout Australia 21.5 per cent of married women are in the work force. Excluding older women who have never worked and younger women with very small children, most married women take jobs if they can find them for a great part of their working lives. A good many Australian families would find it impossible to have home ownership and an adequate living standard without that second income. </PARA>
<PARA> But this Bill does not attack the two-income family unless the partners are unluckily members of the same union. The two-income family has a backstop if one spouse is getting no pay during an industrial dispute, although it notices the financial chill. It certainly notices the drop in income which occurs with the loss of one income during industrial disputation. The single-income family with a working husband and non-working wife, the ideological favourites of this Government in the family stakes, has no such backstop. We are continuously told about the concern of this Government for the single-income family. This is legislation which says to that family: 'If you want to stay alive in the rough and tumble of a strike, give up your union membership'. I have no doubt that if the man's job had been in metropolitan or regional areas where work is available a good many of the households which Senator Chaney is complaining about would have had two incomes and therefore would have been ineligible for unemployment benefit on income grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister wants the wives and families penalised when they have no access to other paid work in their small towns and in their settlements or in company towns in the mining areas of this country of ours. He refers to them as having ' no genuine intention' of joining the work force. I suggest that this is a totally unsubstantiated statement. To say that they should apply, though they know there is little chance of being offered employment, is one thing, but they are realists who know that if they are offered a job and refuse it they will not pass the work test. To say that they will not accept work if it is offered is to make an unwarranted assertion and is an unnecessary slur on such women in these communities and is unworthy of the Minister and the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister knows that most of the figures he has produced-and I dare say will produce again in this debate-are from company towns where there is only one employer and essentially only one industry. He wants to withdraw all economic assistance from the family of a worker in a company town where that worker is engaged, whether willingly or unwillingly, in industrial action or is affected by industrial action in another company or even in another State. The Minister has absolutely no knowledge of how many wives or spouses of striking or stood- down unionists receive unemployment benefit during any year. He admitted that ignorance in an answer to a question on notice last December. He has simply taken out what he sees as dramatic figures for disputes in isolated areas to reinforce this prejudice against unionists. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to recall for the Senate some figures I cited last November in the second reading debate on this Bill. In 1980, 65 per cent of all industrial disputes lasted two days or less, involving 79 per cent of all workers; that is, only 21 per cent of strikers were involved in disputes lasting longer than two days. Only 8.9 per cent of all strikers were involved in disputes that lasted 10 days or longer. It is worth remembering that unemployment benefit is obtainable only after a 7-day waiting period. The major causes of disputes in the statistics I cited were directly attributable to management. In 39.7 per cent of the disputes, managerial policy was given as the prime cause and in 19.6 per cent of the disputes, physical working conditions were given as the cause. Only 21.5 per cent of the disputes were about wages. Senator chaney, in his second reading speech which was incorporated in Hansard, referred to union members choosing to strike. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . knowing that through the operation of the social security system their members can be largely insulated from the financial effect of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA>He also referred to the absurdity of any argument that benefits should be paid to strikers or their families. I would like to point out how little the families are, in fact, insulated from the consequences of industrial action as things now stand. If a worker is taking part in an industrial dispute, willingly or unwillingly, or is stood down for a period in which unemployment benefit is normally payable, his family loses considerably. I instance a family where the breadwinner is on average weekly earnings. In the present situation where the wife can claim unemployment benefit at the single rate, her entitlement is $69. 70 for two people, or 21.6 per cent of the income to which that family is accustomed. That couple will be down $254.50 a week. If there are children in the family, the couple will be entitled to $99.70 a week for five people or 30.9 per cent of their accustomed income; a drop of $225.50 a week. The present legislation will reduce their income to nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I pointed out that this legislation is, in fact, aimed at trade unionists, aimed at those whom the Government is trying to use in its propaganda in trying to convince the community that our economic woes are due to the small group of people who are involved in industrial disputes. The sad thing is that the legislation is aimed primarily at single-income families; two-income families are not affected. This policy is, in fact, a substitute for a lack of an industrial relations policy. The examples that the Minister for Social Security has used-I dare say he will use them again tonight-were, of course, particular isolated cases of people in company towns with no other recourse to income. I pointed out the difficulties that those people will face if this legislation comes into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Minister will point out that-we all admit this-there are hardship grounds for the receipt of special benefit under this legislation. There are, in fact, very severe criteria. Half the applications for special benefit by workers' wives during the recent coal strike at Maitland were rejected because those applying had money in excess of $300 in the bank. Under this legislation a family of five could get nothing until its money in the bank got down to $300; then they would be given a weekly payment of only $99.70, whether or not they were party to the industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading speech states that there is no good reason why the community should automatically and immediately be expected to assume through unemployment or special benefit payment 'the normal financial responsibilities' of people who are not willing to work. The Opposition proclaims that the community does not expect innocent people to go into penury to appease the prejudices of the Government and its conservative supporters. By no stretch of the imagination can a social services payment of $99.70 a week to a family of five be called assuming that family's normal financial responsibilities. By no stretch of the imagination can stood-down unionists in another workshop or another industry whose families would suffer by this legislation be called people who are unwilling to work. They are people who, being caught up in an industrial conflict not of their own making, are being victimised because they are trade union members. If they are not trade union members they are not affected. </PARA>
<PARA> I now give some actual examples of families in Victoria affected by the legislation of 1979 and leave it to honourable senators with some imagination to envisage how such families will get on if this Bill is passed. I give first of all the example of a couple whom we will call Mr and Mrs N. In fact they are Vietnamese refugees in their late twenties with two pre-school-age children. Mr N. is employed by Carlton and United Breweries Ltd and was involved in a two- week strike late in 1980. At that time the family had been in Australia for only five months and Mr N. had been working for approximately six weeks. The family had recently shifted into private sector accommodation from a migrant hostel with all the expenses such a move entails and consequently with no savings to fall back on. As well as the normal commitments of rent, food, gas and electricity, they were giving support to other members of the family still living in a refugee camp overseas. The dispute caused a total and unexpected loss of income which placed great financial stress on the family and led to considerable anxiety. By the time the strike was settled Mr and Mrs N. had fallen $140 behind in their rent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security referred the family to a voluntary agency for financial assistance. The agency was able to give the family $60 in relief money out of its limited emergency relief funds and negotiated with the landlord regarding payment of overdue rent. The wife applied for unemployment benefit for herself and the children but no payment was ever made although she theoretically was eligible for benefit for the second week of the dispute. Once Mr N. was back at work the family did not want to pursue the claim for unemployment benefit, preferring to put its energies into making up lost earnings. It should be noted that the maximum payment of unemployment benefit to this family would have amounted to $89.70 once the seven-day waiting period had been served. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr and Mrs A. are a young Turkish couple in their early twenties who live with their baby in a tiny flat for which they pay $55 a week in rent. The husband is employed at the Ford Company's Broadmeadows plant as a production line worker and earns approximately $165 a week nett. Apart from the rental commitment of $ 220 a month, paid in advance, the family expends approximately $60 a week on food, $10 a week on gas and electricity and $10 a week on petrol. The family car is used for transport to and from work. The family has no telephone and nothing on hire purchase. Once the family has met its basic commitments roughly $35 a week remains to meet all other family needs. It is virtually imposible for the family to save any part of this amount and it is generally spent on things for the baby, clothing, cleaning materials, et cetera. Mr A. was involved in a six- week dispute at Ford. I remind honourable senators that that is an unusual length for a dispute, even in this country. He and his wife had paid a month's rent just prior to the dispute and sought assistance from their local community health centre only when they were faced with gas and electricity bills which they could not pay. They had $3 a week when they made that approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Their friends, Mr and Mrs Z, were in similar circumstances except that they did not have a car. In this case the husband had been stood down because of the dispute but was no better off than his work mates since he was a member of the same union and was deemed ineligible for benefit. In both cases the family situation could have been improved if the wives had been able to obtain unemployment or special benefit on their own behalf and on behalf of their children--</PARA>

The wives would have been able to obtain roughly $79.70 a week-roughly one-third of the gross salary which their husbands would normally have earned. Neither woman received any payment from the Department of Social Security although both were willing to work. At the end of the dispute both families were facing eviction and both had commitments for fuel bills which were difficult to meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These couples and other couples which have been drawn to my attention by the Australian Council of Trade Unions had pay of about $160 a week-hardly a payment which enables a family to accumulate savings. Nor would, I suggest, such families likely jeopardise their earnings to go on to social services payments. They would not take part in industrial action, as it is so charmingly put, in the second reading speech, 'frivolously or maliciously'. In fact, since the 1979 punitive changes to this legislation I believe it is the Government which is malicious in treating stood-down unionists as though they were active participants in a strike, and more so in this Bill in putting their families, their wives and children, at risk as well. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have remarked before, and as the Minister tries to state, there is no deep division between taxpayers and trade unionists in this country. Trade unionists are workers who pay taxes, who pay pay-as-you-earn taxes and, as we know, that group of taxpayers is shouldering an increasing share of the tax burden in this country. They are taxpayers who generally take prolonged union action only when industrial conditions-do not let us forget that twice as many working days are lost through work injuries as are lost through industrial disputes-force them to take action or they believe they have no other redress. They are willing to make sacrifies for principles, safety, or economic justice, despite what the Minister thinks. </PARA>
<PARA> The community is, of course, inconvenienced by some disputes, but other disputes actually benefit the community if they result in better safety measures and end exploitation of some categories of workers. Of course, the Minister gives the example of those people who take industrial action and, as a result of that industrial action, receive increases in wages or improved conditions from the day on which they took the industrial action. He complains that it is most unfair that their wives and their children should get the basic payments that his Department provides. Of course, in that situation the unionists were right and if anyone should pay back to the community the costs of the unemployment benefits and the meagre payments that are available to their wives and children, it should be either the Government, which frequently prolongs industrial disputes in this country, or the companies which prolong those disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the provisions of this Bill which would deny unemployment benefit to spouses of unemployed persons who, in the view of the Department, have walked out of jobs, have lost their jobs through misconduct or have failed the work test by turning down work offered to them. Senator Chaney in his speech made this remark:</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill prevents them from manipulating the social security system to shift the consequences of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing points out better the wealth of prejudice of the Minister and his colleagues than that statement. I point out that it comes from a government which condones record amounts of tax evasion in this country. First of all, it is worth while pointing out that the Department of Social Security is all too often highhanded in its judgment on these matters. Only a small proportion of persons taken off social security benefits appeal against the Department's decision to terminate their benefits, but the most recent figures that the Minister has given me show that over half the appeals against the Department succeed. In 1980-81 the Department made wrong decisions in over half of those cases. I suggest that that is not a good record. If the Department cannot have a better record, I am not happy about allowing the Department of Social Security to decide that not only those unemployed persons who have their benefits stopped for six to 12 weeks should receive no benefits but also that their spouses and their children should not receive such benefits. The number of people who were deprived of benefit because they refused employment last year was only 500 out of the 782,000 who were granted it. They represent only 0.6 per cent of the determinations. I suggest that this is hardly a blight on our society and that it hardly deserves the emphasis that it gets from Government spokesmen in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the women who will be affected by this section of the legislation are in fact married to persons who have psychological problems, drinking problems which may not be obvious or emotional problems which put them in situations in which they are likely to be considered to be out of work through misconduct or voluntary action when they are seen by officers of the Department of Social Security. These are the sorts of people who may abuse a foreman or boss in anger or who throw in their jobs on the spur of the moment in times of stress. Not only these people but also their wives and children will be deprived of benefits under this legislation and will receive assistance only if they can comply with the very strict criteria which the Department applies to people seeking special benefits, criteria which vary from office to office of the Department and from State to State. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we, as a Senate and as a Parliament, seriously suggesting that a wife and her children should suffer through being married to such a person? Are we saying to her that she should leave him to get social security benefits and thus worsen the situation for him and, in many cases, for her and her children? The Government has given no thought to the complex interpersonal relationships which lie behind this group of the unemployed. To satisfy the crude prejudice of the Government and of some of the Government's supporters, the Government will throw these people on the scrapheap. We believe very sincerely that the Government should think again about this matter. This is a further reason why we will oppose this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation, I repeat, is in fact aimed at trade unionists in the first place. It is aimed, secondly, at a group of unemployed who, as a result of subjective judgment by public servants, by officers of the Department of Social Security, are deemed to have voluntarily become unemployed, to have lost their jobs through misconduct or not to have sought work properly; in other words, to have failed the work test. They are too often subject to moral judgments by public servants. I suggest that people who seek to be in a position to make such moral judgments are in fact the last people who should be given a right. </PARA>

This is an amendment to the social services legislation which has nothing to do with social services. It has to do with the Government's lack of an industrial relations policy. It has to do with the Government's prejudice against trade unions. It has to do, in fact, with the Government's prejudice against those in this community who it sees as being unfit to receive benefits such as the unemployment benefit. We have rejected it twice before. I suggest the Senate should continue to reject it, despite the rhetoric and despite the threats by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that this is a piece of double dissolution legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are presently debating the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981 [No. 2] (1982). The purpose of this Bill is to prevent the spouse of a person who is involved in industrial action from getting unemployment benefit. It is the third time this Bill has been brought before the Senate. On the two previous occasions the Opposition failed to pass it. On those occasions Senator Haines spoke in an emotional fashion and said that some unions were irresponsible and some unionists were irresponsible, but that that was no reason for governments to be irresponsible. She claimed that the Government was acting irresponsibly in bringing forward this Bill, even though it is protecting the taxpayers' dollar. Senator Grimes said that the intention of the Government is to make belonging to trade unions a liability. Of course, that is a lot of rot. The Government is very supportive of moderate trade unionists and has never been otherwise. We are more than a little concerned about the Halfpennys, the Carmichaels and Gallaghers, and the Opposition is not. We recently debated in this place the interim report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union.

The interim report on the painters and dockers which was brought down in this place discussed four areas investigated by that Royal Commission. One area was tax evasion, the next was the gross abuse of social services by painters and dockers, another was the gross abuse of workers compensation by painters and dockers, and another was the intimidation, violence and coercion by painters and dockers. Senator Button, the only speaker for the Opposition on that occasion, spoke about tax evasion only. He said not one word about social service abuse, not one word about the violence and corruption in that union and not one word about the abuse of workers' compensation. He spoke only about tax evasion. He said that because the Government taxed people to such a high extent painters and dockers resorted to tax evasion. If Senator Grimes does not believe that that is supporting the painters and dockers, the Australian public certainly would.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the extent of industrial action by some of the more radical unions in Australia today. In the week ending 27 November 1981 we had 153 strikes; in the week ending 19 February 1982 we had 112 strikes and in the week ending 5 March this year we had 86 strikes. We had 153 strikes in one week. I think it is fair to say that not all of those strikes went for a long time but many strikes go on for months. If anyone is interested, I can table the relevant document. As I have said, the majority of union members look after themselves during strikes. The legislation before the Senate really applies to prolonged strikes only. Let us remember a few things. Firstly, a person has a choice about going on strike. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McIntosh says 'rubbish' and the last time this legislation was debated Senator Haines also said 'rubbish'. Some time ago certain legislation was passed in this parliament and, indeed it has been acted upon many times in this country when members of unions have refused to go on strike. Honourable Senators will remember the national strike that Bob Hawke called about Medibank. Many unionists refused that call and worked through the strike. It was a complete fizzer, a complete debacle. In this country a striker has a choice and it is up to him to make it. Sometimes it is a difficult choice to make. If an employee belongs to such unions as the Builders Labourers Federation or the Painters and Dockers Union he must have a fair calibre of character to go against decisions made by those unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this country we have a conciliation and arbitration system and that should effectively stop all prolonged strikes. But the militant unionists will not abide by the decisions that the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission brings down. Of course employers must abide by them and indeed they do. They do not lock out their unionists. If radical unions do not like a decision made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commision they say 'No, we are going to continue this strike' and they do. I believe that we have reached the stage in this country where people demand that unionists are responsible for the actions they take. Many people-and indeed members of the Opposition-are asking this Government for tax cuts. Tax cuts can come only as a result of cutting government expenditure. There is no other way that this responsible Government is willing to do it. Of course the last Labor Government printed money. That was its way of giving the people what they thought the people wanted in terms of handouts. The Labor Government also had tremendously large deficits and borrowed from sleazy overseas countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Government attempted to borrow money and to leave a legacy to our grandchildren that they would never have paid off. Tonight we have been accused in this chamber of creating extreme hardship for families of striking workers. Senator Grimes brought tears to our eyes when he talked of alcoholic husbands and husbands who had tempers which made them liable to throw something at their boss and so lose their job. Tonight we have been told of wives and families of these husbands going without. That is a complete falsehood . Anyone who has followed this legislation would know that we have made arrangements for families in extreme hardship to be able to claim special benefits. Of course to a large extent this has been ignored in speeches from the Opposition side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill does not prohibit strikes. What it does do is stop enforced payment by the taxpayer for those people who are causing the taxpayer such difficulties. I believe that the Opposition is suggesting that we subsidise strikes. Do not tell me someone who is on strike should be able to put his hand out to the Government. If honourable senators opposite say that it is the striker's wife and children who will suffer, do they mean that the wife will not feed him? Of course he gets some of the money. So he would be putting out his hand to the taxpayer and thus receive a subsidy and enable the strike to be prolonged. As I have said, we have seen that the taxpayer is absolutely fed up with being abused by strikes in this country. We have seen marches; we have seen thousands of people assemble in Sydney and Melbourne. (Quorum formed). The thousands of people who congregated in the streets of Melbourne and Sydney showed their displeasure, their distaste for the inconveniences that they were forced to put up with. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask members of the Opposition-indeed, I ask the Australian Democrats-whether they would be prepared to introduce a levy to force taxpayers to pay for prolonged strikes. Would they be prepared to face the people and say: 'We are willing to introduce a levy this week so that every time we have a strike over a week's duration you will put your hand in your pocket to help those poor strikers maintain their family finances'? I think they would get pretty short shrift if they tried that. Suppose they asked the Tasmanian honey producer that Senator Watson talked about a little while ago who had his honey export produce sitting on the wharves for three months. I wonder how happy he would be to put his hand in his pocket to supply the levy for the Opposition. Would industries in New South Wales be prepared to contribute to a levy should the Opposition be game to carry forward its suggestion that taxpayers should pay for this?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to say that the members of the moderate unions of New South Wales could now well lose $70 a week out of their pay packets simply because they are being forced to work a four-day week. I wonder whether they will be prepared to put their hands in their pockets. I wonder whether they would appreciate it if it were noted on their taxation forms that the Government took X-number of dollars out of their pay packets to pay for the people who are on strike. I wonder whether the Labor Opposition would be prepared to ask them to foot the bill. What happens with the families in Sydney who are, at present, facing blackouts? We have been lead to believe that they will be able only to use two lights in their homes in the coming weeks and that there will be regional blackouts. They will be able only to use two hotplates on their stoves and not all of their appliances. Perhaps we could consult Mr Wran. He may be interested in putting up a levy. He might be prepared to say to the people: 'You people, put your hands in your pockets and pay for these people who are on strike. After all, that will encourage these people to hold even more prolonged strikes.' Mr Wran may even put his hand in his pocket and fish out a dollar or two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is all rubbish. The Opposition and the Australian Democrats know that if they had to put on the taxation forms how much each taxpayer had to pay to support these strikers they would get no support whatsoever from the taxpayer. This Government is at least trying to protect the wages earned by the Australian people and to limit the taxes that they have to pay. We have found that most strikes are held to encourage extra wage demands and better conditions. Let us consider the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd. As a result of intimidation by its workers it has had to grant them a 38-hour week. We know only too well what the result of that will be. It will result in more expensive cars. The people will, once again, be down the drain. They will be paying more for their cars. Actually , the union representative said: 'Yes, it will result in more expense for this company. We will see what we can do to help, but we do want our 38-hour week'. If the people are asked also to pay for the strike that brought about that 38- hour week then I think the people of Australia will let the Opposition know how they feel. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time, I believe, as I said earlier, that the Australian people accepted responsibility for their own actions. This Bill also applies to the spouses of people who are not willing to earn. Again, I have no problem at all in this area . If people want to live the alternate lifestyle, if they do not want to work, if they want to go out in the bush and support themselves off the land and not accept any of the facilities for which the taxpayer pays, then I am all for them ; I am on their side. If they are not willing to work or to make themselves available for work then they should not put out their hands for money from people who are working. That is not justice and this Government will not have a bar of it. Of course, the unemployment benefit is available to people who cannot get jobs. Unfortunately, there are many such people in Australia today. Anyone who is legitimately looking for work has no problems about getting the unemployment benefit. They, their wives and their children are supported by the taxpayers, and supported willingly. There is no problem there at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines will be introducing an amendment to the motion for the second reading of this Bill. This amendment reveals quite strange thinking. It will prohibit payment of benefits to spouses of strikers for two weeks-not one week, but two weeks. That seems to me to be rather illogical. I do not understand the thinking behind it. We have been told by the Australian Democrats that it is cruel not to give the unemployment benefit to spouses of strikers. But, of course, they are willing to take away the unemployment benefit for two weeks. It seems to me that that will end up as a bonus to those unionists who intend to strike for three weeks, If they strike for two weeks they will not get anything but if they strike for three weeks they will get a bonus. If they strike for four weeks they will also do all right. It is no good for strikers to strike for two weeks. It seems that this will be an encouragement. It seems that the Australian Democrats agree in principle that it is not a good thing to give the unemployment benefit to the wives of strikers otherwise they would not be suggesting that this benefit be withheld at all. So they obviously agree in principle but they think it would be nice to give them a bonus if they strike a little longer. Senator Grimes made some extraordinary statements. </PARA>

<PARA> I have before me details of some of the payments of unemployment benefits to wives of strikers, and some of the detail of the costs to taxpayers and industry .

A strike during July and September by members of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union employed by the Utah company in central Queensland over use of apprentices in industrial action lasted 76 days at a cost to the taxpayer of $ 444,934. Those two little strikes in 1981 cost over $800,000-an incredible amount. It seems to me that if the Australian people knew their tax dollar was going into the pockets of striking workers they would be absolutely furious and would consider that the Government was irresponsible. I believe we should act in this fashion to stop this irresponsible payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe the people of Australia are demanding a more responsible use of their tax dollar. Already in 1975 they overwhelmingly expressed their view of governments who use their tax dollar irresponsibly. They overwhelmingly expressed the view that no matter how often a government offers to hand out more and more money that they will say: 'No. We want a responsible government. We want our economy run in a responsible fashion. We do not want the inflation rates of 16 per cent that we had in the 1975 era'. The people expressed that view very clearly by throwing the Whitlam Government out. They do not want their hard earned dollars squandered by any government anxious only to hand out money to gain more votes. This Government will never indulge in that type of exercise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I was scheduled to be much lower on the speaking list than third I could not contain myself any longer; following Senator Walters is not a bonus that most honourable senators get. For the third time in six or eight months we are debating a Social Services Amendment Bill which seeks to extend to the spouses of people involved in industrial action the same penalties as apply to the strikers themselves. It is in fact an identical Bill to the one defeated in the Senate on 25 November last year. It has been reintroduced by the Government, one must presume, in order that the Government may have more than just the rejection of the sales tax legislation up its sleeve in the event of its wanting to call a double dissolution. After all it is much easier for the Government to get emotional about strikes, strikers and strike action than it is to convince the electorate it is doing the right thing by putting its hand in the electorate's pocket again . I suppose this is fair enough. If the Government wants to engineer an election it needs to have something pretty emotional to go to the electorate on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation is iniquitous for a number of reasons. For a start it means that the wives and hence the children of strikers-it concerns the wives and children because, as Senator Grimes pointed out, more men are involved in industrial action than are women-will no longer be eligible to apply for unemployment benefit after one week, which is what obtains now. Of course, the same situation applies under this legislation to the families of people who fail the work test for a variety of reasons. I recall, in either my October or November speech on this legislation last year, questioning just how subjective some of those work test values were. It is very difficult to work out objectively, for instance, exactly what voluntarily taking oneself out of employment means. This is particularly so in the case of women who, for instance , suffer some form of sexual harassment. I raised this matter in my speech last year. I do not want to canvass it again. I make the point that voluntarily leaving a job is often something which is very hard to pin down. </PARA>

We acknowledge the fact that special benefits are available, but the point has to be made that they are available only in cases of extreme hardship. I think that phrase bears repeating because extreme hardship under these circumstances really amounts to absolute penury and nothing less. It is a Dickensian type of alternative to offer people who, up to now, have been entitled to unemployment benefits after their spouses have been on strike for one week. I point out to the Senate that the majority of strikes last 10 days or less. If this Bill has not altered since last year-it has not- neither has the Australian Democrats' stand changed in any way at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any way at all. If Senator Teague just waits a moment he will find out. I know he does not pay attention to most speeches in this place. We believe that social security legislation should not be used as an industrial weapon particularly when, as Senator Grimes pointed out, that weapon is directed at the most vulnerable units in the community-single income families with two or more children. We believe that there still exists the situation that I posited last year when I said that some unscrupulous members of the Government-at this point I specifically exclude the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney)- are gearing up to use the legislation or the Senate's failure to pass the legislation as a means of whipping up general public hysteria over the question of strikes. We believe that this is not in the short term or the long term interests of the Australian community generally. We still believe that it is immoral to penalise financially people who are not the cause of or party to industrial action simply because of their relationship to a person who is involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On a number of occasions the Minister has raised the mythical powers of persuasion that some wives have over their husbands. He said something to the effect that if a unionist knows that his wife is not going to be able to claim unemployment benefits and therefore presumably cannot feed him-according to Senator Walters-he will have second and third thoughts about going out on strike , presumably because the wife will take some steps to point out that they are in a rather parlous predicament. I point out with due respect to the Minister that he is applying middle class values to people who, in essence, are not bound by those values. This morning's Sydney Morning Herald carried an interesting editorial. It referred to the inequities in consortium rights between men and women. It referred to a 1930s High Court decision in which a majority of judges put forward the theory that at common law one accepts the fact that the male has domination over the female but at common law it is not accepted that the female has domination over the male. In the majority of Australian families who are not socially aware, whose education is not up to middle class standards, whose values are not middle class values, that situation still pertains. If a wife presumed in many of these situations to chastise her husband for obeying a union dictate, she would be more likely to get a belt around the ear than to get him to oppose the union's requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, we believe that it is iniquitous to add a further financial burden to a group of people who are struggling for wage justice under an industrial system which has seen government action remove wage indexation and then oppose collective bargaining. We think it is unfair for a further financial burden to be placed on people who are in a social system which, because of direct Government actions, has seen huge increases in the cost of living and increases in the order of $34 a month in mortgage repayments over the last 12 months or so . We cannot blame these people for seeking some sort of security or some sort of balance for that. If they have to resort to strikes they should not be additionally penalised by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters brought up that cute canard that the taxpayer, through the Government, should not be expected to subsidise strikers. With respect to the honourable senator I suggest that, boring though she may find it, she should read the speech that I made last November when I made what I thought was a fairly pertinent point-it certainly holds up arithmetically-that before one can strike one has to have a job and that if one has a job one is paying taxes. Therefore, we could look at those taxes as some sort of down payment on whatever social security requirements are necessary in later life not only to protect the individual but also to protect the individual's family. There is no question about that. It is about the one piece of scientific evidence that can be brought up in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading speech makes a great deal of the fact that this legislation is primarily aimed at one industry town disputes where the women do not normally work and that, therefore, it is a charade that they then apply for unemployment benefit when their menfolk go out on strike. That overlooks entirely the other phenomenon of a one industry town. The industry which predominates in the town is rarely the sort of industry in which most women can get employment. Therefore , like it or not they are stay-at-home wives. There is no question that most of them would work if they could. So there is no point in the argument that this limited opportunity for work in a one industry town should be further compounded by the fact that, when their menfolk are out of work because they are on strike, after one week they cannot then apply for unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The value of this legislation as it stands is extremely limited. I do not believe it was ever intended to have any sort of positive action. I draw the attention of honourable senators to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 14 August 1981 which points out the following:</PARA>
<PARA> Intervention by Federal Government officials--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, by definition, the Federal Government--</PARA>
<PARA>did not lead to the settlement of one industrial dispute during 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Figures released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the year show that 21 per cent of disputes were solved by negotiation and 7 per cent by industrial tribunals under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In 65 per cent of the disputes, work was resumed without negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA> Federal intervention has not led to the resolution of one dispute in the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA>So why the Government should expect this piece of legislation to be some kind of magic wand in solving industrial disputes when it has been able to do nothing about them over the last five years, despite the fact that some State governments, most of which are Liberal, have been able to do something, defies comprehension. A case in point exists in New South Wales at the moment. Let us suppose that this legislation had been passed last October or even last November in its most draconian form-that is, specifying that women who are married to men on strike cannot apply for unemployment benefits at all. Even supposing that, nothing would have changed in New South Wales or in any other situation similar to that which exists in New South Wales at the moment for the simple reason that the problems there have been caused not by strike action but by unionists engaged in go-slows or work bans. Whilst those sorts of actions can cause massive disruptions-nobody is arguing about that-neither of them is covered by this legislation. There can be no question that the motivation behind this legislation had nothing to do with ending or limiting industrial disputes. There seem to be no reasons behind the Government's reintroduction of this legislation other than to try to intimidate some unionists, to cause family disharmony, to punish innocent women and children or-this I believe to be the most likely reason-to take advantage of the average person's ignorance about industrial or legislative matters in order to induce hysteria in the community and then, what is worse, to prey upon this for political advantage. It appears to us to be nothing more nor less than a cynical exercise in scare tactics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is this mischief making behind the legislation which led my colleague Senator Mason to suggest last year that a compromise might be found. There is nothing worse in a community than division between one group and another, particularly when it is bolstered by an outside source for reasons of its own. I refer honourable senators to Senator Masons's speech of 25 November last year in which he said that there were two extremes. He mentioned the case of the New South Wales petrol strike and the number of people who were disadvantaged, who suffered, who were indignant and upset about it. He made the point also that on many occasions family resources are stretched to the limit because of a strike, despite the pontifications by Government senators to the contrary, often the men have no choice but to take part in a strike. He emphasised the point by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . I think this makes it evident that there should be, between the two extremes we have heard in this chamber today, some middle ground which perhaps would be more acceptable to the community at large and which would take some sort of heat out of this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I put the suggestion before the Senate yesterday with an appeal that it be seriously considered as a compromise position acceptable to all parties. It is something I thought the Government might have considered. </PARA>
<PARA> Had it any desire whatsoever to avoid anything other than a direct confrontation on this issue, I would have thought it something it might have said it would negotiate on. But that has not been the case. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the situation last year. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result, I have been induced to the belief that the Government is raising this matter at this stage not because it wants this legislation or because it wants a solution to this problem but purely in a spirit of mischief to cause political trouble and dissention and perhaps also as a sop to its extreme right wing supporters in the community who regularly scream for strikers to be starved out. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier we had the incredible statement from Senator Walters that if we paid them the unemployment benefit they might be able to feed their families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already referred to special benefits. We acknowledge that they are there but they are there under the most extreme of hardship situations. The compromise which we suggest-I do not apologise for putting forward a compromise and I am sure that the concept of a compromise is not alien to people such as Bob Hawke, who made his living for many years out of finding compromises to situations-is put forward in an attempt to find what Senator Mason referred to last year as the middle ground. It is an attempt to take the emotionalism out of this Bill and to limit as much as possible the resentment which is likely to result in the community, with all the attendant divisiveness that this will cause in the country.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just finished quoting from Senator Mason's speech of last year. How can that, even in Senator Teague's warped and twisted mind, be construed as a change of mind? The compromise proposes not the total removal of eligibility for unemployment benefit for spouses of strikers but the extension by one week of the existing ineligibility period. In other words, instead of the wives of strikers being either eligible after one week, as is the situation now, or not being eligible at all, as would be the case if this Bill passed the Senate, the period after which they would be able to apply for unemployment benefit would be 14 days. I know that Senator Walters may not have a brilliant mathematical background but she ought to be able to see the difference between two weeks and an infinite period. There is a vast difference between doing something for one or two weeks and doing it for an indefinite period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe that this is a perfectly reasonable and responsible compromise. It avoids the potential for trumped up anti-union hysteria without unduly punishing the women and children at whom it is directed. To that end I have had prepared an amendment very similar to that which Senator Mason moved last year providing for the extension of the term from one week to two. A similar amendment will be moved in the Committee stage if we get there. I point out that if the amendment to the motion for the second reading is defeated we will oppose the legislation as it stands. I believe that this is something that would be done by any thinking person in the community. If people were given the choice between allowing somebody to go on unemployment benefit after one week of a strike or not at all, and if that were their only choice, I believe that the average Australian of compassion would opt for the operation of the one week provision. In a spirit of what my erstwhile colleague Senator Evans persists in calling 'co -operation and friendliness'-there has been precious little of this in any of the three debates that have taken place on this legislation-in regard to the motion for the second reading I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA> ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill should be amended so as to provide that married persons who would be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit by clause 3 of the Bill shall receive such benefit after a waiting period of 14 days, and that during that period a special benefit is payable to such a person in a case of extreme hardship'. </PARA>
<PARA>I make it quite clear that I move that motion in an attempt to diffuse an already horrendous situation, in an attempt to find a compromise. I am becoming more and more appalled that the word 'compromise' is being treated with ridicule in this Parliament. I move the motion in the hope that in the coming months we will not see a situation in which neighbours are set against neighbours, towns are set against towns and sections of the community are set against each other because of some draconian legislation introduced by this Government. If the amendment is not accepted by the Senate we will oppose the legislation as it stands. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981 [No. 2] (1982). The second set of brackets in the title has been included for some particular administrative reason. The Bill has a familiar ring to all of us because this is really the third time that is has been before the Senate. Granted, the first time it was introduced it was not in the form of the Bill before us tonight. The elements of this Bill first appeared in the omnibus Social Service Amendment Bill 1981 following the Budget but they were rejected in this chamber. After they had been rejected in this chamber they reappeared in the form of the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981. That was rejected before the Senate went into the summer recess. Once again we have the Bill in front of us. It is no different from last year's Bill and I predict that its fate will be the same as that of the Bill which was before the Senate before Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall outline the principal elements of this Bill. I think that Senator Walters in particular did not cover the objectives of the Bill in full. They are to deny the single rate of unemployment benefit, firstly to spouses of trade unionists who are involved in strike action, secondly, to spouses of the unemployed who have not satisfied the work test; and, thirdly, to spouses of those who are alleged to be voluntarily unemployed or who have allegedly been dismissed for misconduct. Even though the spouses may be eligible for unemployment benefit in their own right, the provisions of this Bill would remove that right from them. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to go back to look in detail at those three basic objectives of the Bill . The first one is to deny unemployment benefit to spouses of trade unionists who are involved in industrial action. If those spouses have work when the breadwinner goes on strike they can, of course, continue to work and to support the family but if they do not have work and are willing to work and register for work they will not be able to obtain unemployment benefit. Let us take the case of the spouse of somebody engaged in industrial action who lives in a metropolitan area where some work is available. If she can obtain work, that is fine for her, but if she lives in a place where there is no work available-we have heard a lot tonight about isolated communities and mining communities-even if she is looking for work and wants to obtain it, under the provisions of this Bill she will not be able to obtain unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters, when she was speaking earlier, dwelt on the area of strikes. She spoke almost totally about people being on strike. She did not mention the other two areas. At one stage she said that if people are not willing to work, if they are on strike, they should not put out their hands to obtain unemployment benefit. We are not talking about the people who are engaged in industrial action receiving unemployment benefit; we are talking about spouses and their children being able to obtain some social service payment so that they can continue to live in a reasonable way. We are not talking about the person on strike getting some benefit; we are talking about the spouse. Of course, the spouses are usually the wives, so we are mainly talking about the wives and children. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another objective of the Bill. It will deny the single rate of unemployment benefit to the spouses of those who are unemployed but who have not satisfied the work test. What if a wrong decision has been made in relation to the work test? Most honourable senators would have had people come to them who have allegedly failed the work test and after some degree of negotiation with the Department of Social Security they have found that a wrong assessment has been made and the person should have been obtaining unemployment benefit. But many people do not come to members of parliament when this happens. If a person has been deemed to have failed the work test, even though his wife may want to obtain unemployment benefit by registering for employment and trying to obtain a job, if she is unable to find a job then under the provisions of this Bill she and her children will not be able to get anything from the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area in which the unemployment benefit will be denied is to spouses of those who are alleged to have been voluntarily unemployed or who have been dismissed for misconduct. In those circumstances the breadwinner will not be able to obtain any unemployment benefit for a certain period. If the spouse looks for work and finds it, that is fine. However, if she genuinely looks for work and cannot find it, under the provisions of this Bill she will not be able to obtain any benefit. As Senator Grimes asked, why should we deny the benefit to a wife and her children because she is married to a person who becomes voluntarily unemployed or is dismissed for misconduct? Senator Grimes rightly pointed out that if the couple separates they might be able to obtain the unemployment benefit but should we make people separate for that particular reason? We should not have such a provision which punishes the wife and the children. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployment benefit will be denied to spouses under three basic conditions : If their husbands are involved in strike action-I am presuming it is the male who is the breadwinner but it might not necessarily be so; if they have not satisfied the work test, or if they are voluntarily unemployed or dismissed for alleged misconduct. That denial extends, with extremely minor exceptions, to the special benefit. Spouses who would have received the special benefit would not be eligible for it if they failed on any of the conditions which I have mentioned. This legislation should be seen for what it really is-a blatant, cynical attempt to divert public attention from the real issues facing Australia . It is an attempt to cover up the economic morass into which this Government has steadily steered this country over the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The real issues facing the Australian people are housing, high interest rates, high rates of unemployment, pensions and inadequate health and taxation policies . These are the issues which this Bill that has come to us for the third time is trying to cover up. They are issues for which this Government has no answer. They were not issues which the Government could cover up in the Lowe electorate. The vote in the Lowe by-election was a clear indication to this Government that it no longer has the confidence of the people. The electorate will not have the wool pulled over its eyes by a Bill of this nature. What is the Government's answer to all the problems to which I have referred? It brings forth a piece of legislation that has twice been defeated in this chamber. It was defeated just after the Budget presentation and previously it was defeated in a separate Bill which was introduced in an attempt to divert attention from the grave problems faced by this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The defeat of this measure-I presume it will be defeated-will mean that it will be another Bill which can be used by this Government for a double dissolution. It already has the conditions for a double dissolution if it wants one. When this Bill is defeated, as I presume it will be, the Government will have another Bill which it can use if it wishes. But will the Government go to the people? I hardly think so. If it went to the people at this stage it would be decimated and it knows that. The Government will sit on this Bill and hope that something will happen to its popularity so that it will be able to go to the people. I predict that between now and the time when a normal election can be held in 1983 , the popularity of the Government will not increase to such an extent that it will want to go to the people. Of course, we on this side of the chamber would welcome a double dissolution because we know that after the election we would be in government and we would be able to get this country back on to the rails where it should be. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make some comments on certain parts of the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). At one stage it stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we are not here concerned to discuss the merits of strike action as contrasted with other means open to employees in dispute with their employers to resolve these disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are nice words indeed but that is all they are. I repeat that the speech stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we are not here concerned to discuss the merits of strike action . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course the Government is concerned with the merits of strike action. It condemns it out of hand. The spouses of those engaged in industrial action will be penalised irrespective of how justified that industrial action may be. The Government's attitude to strike action was made clear in the Minister's second reading speech. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> So, the Australian public is attacked from two directions. First, it has to bear the personal disruptions, inconveniences and associated costs that result from the strike. In addition, it is then called upon to meet the cost of providing income support for the families of those involved in the strike. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for not being concerned with the merits of strike action! The Government 's attitude is made quite clear in that statement. It wants to have nothing to do with strike action. It is not surprising to me that this Government should have a fixation that in industrial conflict the worker is always to blame; the worker is always wrong. But is that the case? Certainly it is not the case and the official figures show that it is not. In August last year the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on industrial disputes for 1980. That report showed that 39.7 per cent of disputes-that is, about two in every five-were disputes over managerial policy. Were the workers to blame for this? The report showed that 19.6 per cent of the disputes-that is, about one in every five-were over physical working conditions. The Government conveniently uses the argument that workers and their industrial unions are to blame for every industrial dispute that occurs. The official ABS figures indicate otherwise. As I said, about two in every five disputes were over managerial policy and about one in every five were over physical working conditions. So three in every five disputes were over conditions about which the worker had every right to be concerned and every right, in the final analysis, to withdraw his or her labour.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's attitude towards workers was shown clearly from 1976 to 1981 in wage indexation hearings. Despite the galloping inflation for which this Government has no answer, it tried to deny at Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission hearings any wage justice for Australian workers. I can well remember the first hearing at which the Fraser Government made a submission . Early in 1976 the Commission was deliberating a 6.4 per cent consumer price index increase. The Government proposed that only half of that should be granted . In other words, instead of getting a 6.4 per cent increase to cover rises in the consumer price index the Government felt that workers should receive only a 3.2 per cent increase. I sat in for some of the hearing when it was held in Melbourne. It was illuminating to do so. I almost felt sorry for the Commonwealth advocate. The advocate had his instructions to put a case for a 3.2 per cent increase rather than a 6.4 per cent increase, but he had no argument; he really floundered. Unfortunately by the time the next hearing was held the Commonwealth advocate had got his act together. He did not have his act together on the previous occasion so the full 6.4 per cent increase was granted. </PARA>
<PARA> At the 15 wage indexation hearings between February 1976 and January 1981 the Commonwealth made 10 submissions for no increases in the national wage, two for rises equivalent to a 30 per cent indexation and three for rises of between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of the CPI movement. In 15 hearings no submissions made by the Commonwealth supported full indexation. I mention that because anyone who looks at this type of record would fully understand that the Australian worker will not receive any sympathy or any attempt at understanding from this Government. I would like to mention another part of the Minister's second reading speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There have been numerous cases where the wives of strikers, who have appeared to have no genuine intention of joining the workforce themselves, have registered for work in places such as mining and construction towns where there is no real possibility of employment for them. This has enabled them, under the existing legislation, to obtain unemployment benefits-</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister: What are these numerous cases where wives who have had no intention of joining the work force have registered for work? In the vast majority of the cases that the Minister has referred to where wives have registered for work they would gladly have taken the work if it had been available. Yet the Minister says they had no genuine intention of joining the work force themselves. If the work was there, the majority of the wives in these areas would have taken work. The Minister said that there were numerous cases where the wives have had no intention of joining the work force. Let us be given a list of how many people are involved and let us be told the cost of these numerous cases and of the mining and construction towns referred to by the Minister. It is very easy to make a sweeping statement like that and talk about numerous cases, but let us be given a list of what they are. My assessment is that the numerous cases can almost be counted on one hand. If they cannot, they are but figments of the Minister's imagination. </PARA>
<PARA> The strike in central Queensland in 1981 has been mentioned in the Minister's second reading speech. Much is made of the $450,000 paid to over 400 spouses. Is any assessment made in the Minister's speech of what a great multinational company which made $160m profit in that particular year did to solve this dispute? No mention is made at all of that. It is apparently of no concern to a government which enjoys its own anti-union rhetoric. I would like to refer again to the Minister's second reading speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation as it stands at the moment permits a situation where trade unions can choose to strike, knowing that through the operation of the social security system their members can be largely insulated from the financial effect of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA>Does the legislation as it stands at the moment-it would be changed by this Bill if it were passed-allow those engaged in industrial action to be largely insulated? Let us examine the extent to which they would be insulated. Firstly, we must be mindful that no social security payment would be made to these people in the first week. Secondly, let us consider a family of three and presume that the male is the breadwinner. If he is engaged in some industrial action and if his wife registers as unemployed and is eligible to receive benefits, at the moment she would receive a total of $79.70 a week. Of that $79.70, $69 would be for herself as a single person, plus $10 a week for her child. Is the family largely insulated from the financial effect of their actions, as has been stated by the Minister? They have less than $80 a week, which is well below the poverty level. The amount that they have for all their weekly commitments is $18 less than a Minister of this Government receives in travel allowance for one overnight stay in a capital city. How can it be said that these people are insulated from the financial effect of their actions? A family of three has to live on $80 a week. They are not largely insulated from the financial effect of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am speaking about that matter I am reminded of something Senator Walters said a little while ago. She was talking about Senator Grimes making some extraordinary statements. She then made a statement therafter which I think was an extraordinary statement, par excellence. She said that if we had a system whereby, after 14 days, people were able to obtain some unemployment benefit, they would then say: 'We will now strike for three weeks to get our bonus'. I emphasise the words 'to get our bonus'-a bonus of $80 to keep three people for one week. What an extraordinary statement that is. It is worth examining how many workers who take industrial action would be affected by the passage of this legislation. The number is so small that the Government's motivation for bringing this matter forward must be suspect. </PARA>
<PARA> The publication of the Australian Bureau of Statistics which I referred to earlier indicated that only 9.9 per cent of strikers were involved in strikes of five or more working days. Only 4.8 per cent of those involved in industrial action, which is less than one in 20, were involved in strikes of 10 days or more. This gives an indication of how small the number is that we are referring to. The fact that some of the spouses would already be working gives an idea of the small number of people who would be involved or affected by this legislation if it were passed. I noted that my colleague in the other place, Dr Blewett, had calculated that about 500 or 600 families would be involved in one year. I have not seen this figure contested.</PARA>

If one wife and her children were disadvantaged by this piece of legislation, I would still create some fuss. The relatively low number of lengthy strikes are an indication that, on the whole, workers in this country do not in embark on long strikes unless they feel that they have strong and distinct grievances. Yet it is the spouses and children who would be affected by this Bill. We must remember that it is because of not only industrial action-this was dwelt on by one speaker on the other side-but also other reasons that the spouses and their children would be affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I mention the amendment that was moved by the Australian Democrats, I refer to the use of a social services Bill as an industrial relations weapon. It is an indictment of a government that is so devoid of ideas for a responsible industrial relations policy that it uses a social services Bill as a substitute. If the Government is concerned about the level of industrial action in Australia , why does it not do something positive rather than pursue a negative course through the Social Services Act? It could do something about the managerial policies which the ABS records, as causing so many disputes. Similarly, it could attack the physical working conditions which are so poor that they result in strike action. A realistic wages policy would go a long way to reducing the numbers of disputes. This sort of positive action would be much better than using a Social Services Bill as an industrial relations weapon. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I mention something about the amendment that has been moved by the Australian Democrats. The Australian Labor Party will, of course, be opposing the Bill, but it will not be supporting the amendment which was moved by the Australian Democrats. The amendment in itself singles out some punishment to wives, and their children, because their spouses are members of a trade union . It extends the waiting period from seven to 14 days. We in the Australian Labor Party would not accept that. The amendment has no real teeth. I presume that if the amendment were passed at the second reading stage amendments would be moved in the Committee stage to add some teeth. All the amendment does is express an opinion. The amendment seeks to add at the end of the motion that the Bill be read a second time the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill should be amended so as to provide that married persons who would be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit by clause 3 of the Bill shall receive such benefit after a waiting period of 14 days, and that during that period a special benefit is payable to such a person in a case of extreme hardship. </PARA>
<PARA>If the amendment were passed, of course, it would express an opinion of the Senate. But it would not mean that the Government would have to do anything. We would have to go further in the Committee stage and add something so that that opinion would be backed up by some legislation. The Australian Labor Party does not support the amendment, because it punishes spouses and their children. In fact, Senator Haines said that it does not unduly punish women and children. But there is an element of punishment there. Therefore, we will not be supporting the amendment and we will certainly be voting against the Bill. The legislation which we have before us is nothing but a cheap political stunt. I anticipate that it will be defeated. It certainly deserves to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take up the point raised by Senator Colston last; that is, the statement that he made and the inferences that have been in other statements made by other Opposition senators tonight that this amendment to the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981 [No. 2] (1982) is intended to be some sort of punishment. I put an alternative view: To take away unemployment benefits under certain circumstances is not a punishment. It is to take away an entitlement which should not in justice exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has ranged far and wide in the debate tonight. In the matters raised many points have been covered-very few of them justified. It is all too easy on this subject to skim over the surface of the amendment, to create a false case for the amendment and to ignore the real issues. We have had statements made by Opposition senators in which they quote other people and accept as fact figures given by other people, figures which they have not checked themselves. Senator Colston quoted what Dr Blewett of the House of Representatives said. He said that according to Dr Blewett 500 to 600 families a year would be involved. Senator Colston was saying that very few people were involved and that therefore the amendment was not justified. I point out to Senator Colston that, in just one strike in Broken Hill in 1981, 1,171 spouses claimed and received unemployment or special benefits. That is not the 500 to 600 a year ranging over all strikes which was apparently stated by Dr Blewett and quoted by Senator Colston. If that is the best that Opposition senators can bring up it shows how superficial their approach to the subject has been. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Colston said that if one family were deprived unfairly it would be one too many. The Government has said that if one family were in hardship as a result of this that family would be looked after-it and all other families in real hardship. The Government is saying that the issue is: Why should strikers with spouses and with their own cash resources be subsidised by the taxpayer? There are two issues there. First of all, the striker must have a spouse. That is the striker whom the Opposition seeks to protect. The single striker does not have the advantage of the married striker. The single striker goes without benefit. That is all right apparently, according to the Opposition. This is an issue that has not been addressed. We have been told of heart-rending individual instances from which we have had a false conclusion drawn about how those families would be affected. The range of issues has not been touched. The fact that single strikers are in a different position and that taxpayers are affected was not touched by Opposition speakers on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that these strikers also have their own cash resources. It is entirely possible that people with very low cash resources who are working and paying tax are subsidising people in a superior position. I suggest to Senator Colston that if there is any taxpayer who is unfairly being deprived of part of his or her income as a result of present practices that is one taxpayer too many. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Colston made a statement relating to the profits of the Utah Development Co. The point of his statement was not clear to me because the logic was not followed through. He said that he was making a point in general terms earlier in his speech about the number of strikes that are the consequence of disputes over managerial issues. Further on in his speech the honourable senator made a reference to Utah and its profits as though those two things were connected. I remind Senator Colston that in his State of Queensland in Blackwater in 1980 there was a strike by coal miners which affected Utah as well as the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd and Theiss Toyota Pty Ltd in which 523 wives- nearly the annual total, according to Dr Blewett as quoted by Senator Colston- received benefits at a total cost of $431,475 on the issue of subsidised housing , which had nothing to do with management. There was no managerial dispute at all. But the penalty went in the first case to the strikers because they lost $ 22m in wages. The lost production to Utah was worth $190m in revenue and the loss flows on. </PARA>
<PARA> We forget apparently that there is another side to the equation; that is, that employers and people who provide capital in order to provide employment have some entitlement too. These strikes can have an effect on shareholders, shareholders who are not necessarily wealthy people. It would be as logical this evening to point to individual issues of people who depend on share income, say, in their retirement and their deprivation because of loss of income and profits to companies. I shall not pursue that matter, although it could be pursued, but it is as logical as the case put up by the opposition side. There is another side to the equaton which is just conveniently overlooked. It is also not enough for me for Senator Colston, whose credibility is not good on the basis of what he quoted from Dr Blewett, to say that certain statistics show that a percentage of disputes are about managerial issues. It may well be claimed that the disputes are about managerial issues. That does not mean that the union that went on strike was correct in its assessment of management.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, there are two responsibilities in this debate. One is to deal with the amendment that has been proposed. There is also some responsibility on Government senators to pay a little attention to what has been said in opposition to the Bill. If it were not said, honourable senators opposite would be the first to say that we had no answer. It is certainly impossible in the course of this debate to cover all the points raised by the Opposition because of constraints of time and because they were many, varied and rambling. That does not mean that they were all true. It does not mean that any of them were true. The central issue is the question of responsibility. We have heard some extraordinary statements. Senator Haines, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, said that the Government wants to cause hardship and to deprive strikers of their incomes. She said that if people have to resort to strikes they should not be additionally penalised by the Government. Senator Grimes said that people would be deprived of income through no fault of their own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That comes to the issue of responsibility and fault, which is a word that Opposition senators want to bring up. I would like to know how one can extend the argument of Senator Haines that the Government could be causing hardship and depriving strikers of their incomes. I will accept that people have the right to withdraw their labour and to go on strike. But it was always accepted in that industrial situation, even from the beginning and at the most militant times of union difficulties in the past, that there was a price on both sides of that. When labour was withdrawn, so were wages. That was the other side. The unionist could strike and deprive himself of income at the same time as he deprived his employer of income. There is an issue of responsiblity in deciding to go on strike. It may be that industrial issues are justifiable, but it is not for unemployment beneficiaries or social security officers to be the judges of that. It is not for taxpayers willy nilly to be subsidising that issue, right or wrong . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator is very chatty. Why does he not go to his Whip and get on the speakers' list? Perhaps he does not think the honourable senator is good enough. He should take his turn. I promise I will not interrupt him if he does that. Senator Haines says that the Government is causing hardship , as though in an industrial situation where decisions are taken not to work the Government causes hardship because the employee no longer gets wages and as though the Government is intervening in that situation. The Government stands back in that situation and allows people to make that decision. In more extreme industrial situations the Government may become involved. There is no automatic responsibility on government to come to the aid of people who make decisions, the consequences of which they know full well at the time they make them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Haine's second point was that if workers have to resort to strikes they should not be additionally penalised by the Government. There is a penalty in resorting to strikes; it is the loss of wages. Not getting a supplement in place of wage is not an additional penalty. Getting a supplement is a benefit. The logic is back to front, as it comes from the Democrats. Senator Grimes made a very appealing speech, I will admit. He showed, I think, a genuine concern for people in hardship. He gave us many examples of what would happen to people deprived of income. But in all such speeches from members of the Opposition they overlook the fact that the Government has said, and provides in this amending legislation, that in cases of hardship people will qualify for a benefit. But they have to prove hardship. As it stands, people can go on strike and the spouse can register for unemployment benefit. They can be people with very substantial assets, with cash in hand, but they can draw unemployment benefit from the public coffers. That is not the sort of case that the Opposition talks about, but those cases exist just as much as the cases that the Opposition chooses to talk about. The hardship case that the Opposition chooses not to recognise is looked after in the Government's proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the effects of the present situation? There is an easy option for people when they decide to take industrial action. I would have thought that industrial action was considered by unionists traditionally to be their ultimate weapon, in many cases their last resort weapon. We have many and intricate systems of arbitration and negotiation and it has always been thought by employer and employee alike that strike on behalf of the employee or lock-out on behalf of the employer was the weapon that was resorted to in the last instance. But if employees know that they will have a guaranteed income-they do know it in single industry towns such as mining towns-it becomes less of a last resort, and the question of responsibility disappears. It is too easy to regard the taxpayer as some vague person one never sees. It is too easy to consider the public purse as something that is bottomless, as though one had no responsibility towards either. The easy resort to unemployment benefit is--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I have not been on strike, but I do know what it is like. The responsibility has to go in all directions. It is not enough for Opposition senators to say that the Government has an automatic responsibility just because people are on strike and have families. The responsibility in the other direction-not to want an abuse of the system and an easy resort to taxpayers' fund-is the counter-responsibility. Many of the things said in today's debate by Opposition senators about the issue of entitlement brought with them an implicit notion that someone on strike and with a family was entitled to benefit, regardless of other issues. We have heard reference made to a number of single industry towns. Senator Grimes said that families in Queensland mining towns cannot supplement their incomes as there is no employment available, so that if the wives of coal miners-it is wives in that case-register for unemployment benefit, they are clearly not seriously registering for employment. They know, according to Senator Grimes, that there is no employment available. They cannot supplement their incomes by taking alternative employment, so they register for employment and in due course claim an unemployment benefit. In that case, under the amending legislation, special benefits are still available in the case of hardship-if people do not have other resources such as cash or other income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Colston also addressed himself to this issue and wanted to know which towns were involved in point of fact. Senator Colston is a senator for Queensland and he may have thought that another senator from Queensland would not like to point the finger at a couple of places. Senator Colston, as a senator, should know that there was a strike in Blackwater, a coal mining town, from June to September 1980 on the subject of subsidised housing, during which time 523 wives received benefits. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It is a single industry town. I recall as well as Senator Colston would the almost carnival atmosphere that was portrayed through the media surrounding women registering for unemployment benefits. They made it clear that they did not expect to be offered a job. Indeed, they did not want to be offered a job. They did not want that alternative and the fact that there was not alternative employment, there was not a risk of their being offered a job, was an incentive to registering. The public saw that and understood very clearly what the issues were. That fact cannot be dodged. In Gladstone, Queensland, which is not a single industry town, there was a strike from January to March 1981 in which 53 wives of 176 strikers-presumably not all the strikers were married-received a total payout of $38,607. That is a more diverse town and more employment opportunities are available there but it is essentially a heavy industry town. Those who went on strike were people in heavy industry and were not likely to have their income supplemented by their wives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From February to March 1981 at Broken Hill between 2,000 and 2,500 workers went on strike and 1,171 wives claimed and received benefits to a total value in excess of $369,000. Again, Broken Hill is a heavy industry town and there is not much risk of wives being offered jobs in mines where they could not work. In central Queensland-I am referring to big issues and big strikes-from July to September 1981, 600 miners went on strike and 482 wives, there is a very high marriage rate in that part of Queensland, claimed in excess of $444,000 in benefits. In Port Kembla there was a strike from August to September 1981-again, that is a heavy industry town-and 550 employees were on strike and 85 wives claimed benefits in excess of $41,000. </PARA>
<PARA> In Gove in the Northern Territory, which is not a place which has many alternatives of employment or many options for travelling to get employment, there was a strike from August to October 1981 in which 550 workers were on strike and 105 wives claimed a total benefit in excess of $96,000. In six disputes the figures, as I have just detailed, totalled $1,422,955. It all adds up and it is very clear that it is possible for a lot of money to be involved. I have indicated that a number of wives were paid benefits. In all cases a number of those wives applied for and received special benefits and they did not register for unemployment benefits. So presumably there were a number of wives who would have continued to receive benefits in any event. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines made the extraordinary assertion that if this Bill had applied last year the incidence and length of strikes would not have been affected at all. I am not sure on what she bases that statement but one could draw the conclusion that if the non-payment of benefits would not have affected the length and incidence of strikes the strikers did not need the benefits; they could manage without them. I have no idea on what Senator Haines based that statement apart from an assertion or two. It may well be that this amendment would not affect the incidence or length of strikes. One thing it would affect is the payment of benefits to people who do not need them, who have other resources, who have decided to deprive themselves of income by going on strike and who think that other members of the community owe them some sort of a living . </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth stating what this amendment does. The purpose of clause 3 of the Bill is to prevent payment of unemployment benefit to the spouse of a person where that person is involved in industrial action or where that person has been refused unemployment benefit or has had that benefit cancelled or postponed. They are the conditions. The clause proposes to change the current position in relation to unemployment benefit by the insertion of a condition which would disqualify from receipt of unemployment benefit a married person whose spouse is not qualified to receive unemployment benefit because the spouse , or a member of the spouse's trade union, is involved in industrial action; or has been refused unemployment benefit on one of the grounds prescribed in the work tests other than the ground that the spouse was employed or was capable of undertaking paid work; or has had and unemployment benefit cancelled or postponed on certain prescribed grounds. These are: That a person was voluntarily unemployed; that a person was unemployed due to his own misconduct; that a person did not accept an offer of employment which the Director-General considered to be suitable. In each of these cases, the period of disqualification from unemployment benefit would be the period that the spouse of the married person is disqualified from that benefit due to that benefit being refused, cancelled, or postponed in the circumstances described.</PARA>
<PARA> In no case, in the course of either of these debates in the Senate, have Opposition senators-I refer particularly to Senator Haines-addressed themselves to those simple issues, the conditions under which the benefit would be taken away. We have had generalisations and assertions, some of which I have had the opportunity to demonstrate are just not true. Perhaps at some future time honourable senators opposite will correct that. On neither occasion that Senator Haines has spoken had she addressed herself in any serious way to the payment of special benefits, the exception that would be made. Tonight the honourable senator has spoken, as she did last November, in terms of heart-rending hardship . There is a hardship count out in this Bill. The exception is that in a case of extreme hardship and where there are no other means of support special benefit is payable to the spouse. </PARA>

Instead of addressing themselves to what is in the Bill and the items that I have just outlined, they address themselves to what might be in some future Bill or what might be a future action of the Government. Frankly that is why it is so difficult to follow them. If I have misunderstood the honourable senator I apologise, but I think not. I did understand the points that the honourable senator was making in her first speech. I understood the points that others had some difficulty with or the honourable senator thought they had some difficulty with. The honourable senator made a point, as she said tonight, in her speech in November that there is a central issue here that we really need to understand. I shall try to keep a straight face as I repeat what was said by Senator Haines. She said that if these people are on strike it is very clear that they had jobs to start with and they were paying tax.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. The difficulty is: What is the relevance, not the truth, of that statement? If the honourable senator is suggesting that because people are paying tax they have made a contribution to the public purse, therefore they have an entitlement to unemployment benefit, she is moving some distance towards contributory social security. If contributory social security is the Democrats' policy, terrific. They should proclaim it, argue it and explain how it would have applied in Gladstone during a 60 day strike. On the proposal that the honourable senator is putting forward, how long would someone have had to be in continuous employment in order to have an entitlement for 60 days? Senator Haines should explain how long those miners in Blackwater would have had to have been in continuous employment to make the necessary contribution under contributory social security to keep them on strike for three months. It would have been for long periods. Senator Haines can look at the record. If the honourable senator is serious and has looked at the subject of contributory social security she knows that in order to be out of work for that long one would have had to have worked for some time indeed. One very quickly runs out of credits when one goes on strikes that last for three months, two months or whatever. I do not think that that is possible. The fact that Senator Haines would like to see a contributory social security scheme, which I am sure an awful lot of employees in the community would not like to see, is interesting but not relevant because we do not have a contributory social security scheme; we have a tax system which provides the money for our unemployment benefit and other benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those who work and pay taxes on a continuing basis provided something like $1. 5m in benefits for just the six disputes that I referred to this evening. There are many others. Senator Haines should do her sums on the amount of benefits paid and the amount of tax that might have been otherwise paid or contributed by those workers just as their share of the social security bill. She should not say that all the tax that they pay goes into the social security purse, because it does not. Remember, it would have to be just a share and then she might have a point to be made. But to argue that policy is not to deny the logic or justice of the case that the Government puts forward in this amendment. It is not denied either by ignoring, as the honourable senator has so consistently in debates on this issue, the hardship catch-phrase. I have heard Senator Haines talk many times about hardship that would be caused by this legislation. She overlooks the fact that hardship is taken account of. In doing so she misled the public. If she did not set out to mislead the public it happened because she misled herself . </PARA>

They said that their dispute was justified. The miners won their dispute. Senator Martin says that their wives should have gone without support and benefits yet the strikers won their dispute. The Treasurer of this country, a man praised to the heavens by Senator Chaney in the National Times last weekend as an honest, just and good man, agreed, in the end, that the strikers were right and they won their dispute. Is Senator Martin saying that these people, who were seeking justice and who apparently got justice, because the Government agreed with what they got, should not have received any benefit? This is the crux of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government members have gone on about this being social services legislation aimed at not giving benefits to people who do not deserve them. But Senator Martin, Senator Walters and later, Senator Chaney-if I can anticipate him as Senator Walters anticipated Senator Haines's speech-have made it perfectly clear that this is legislation about strikes, about depriving not the strikers of their incomes but the wives and their children of basic support. That is what this Bill is about and that is why we object to it. That is why we object to Senator Haines's amendment. That amendment does, in fact, do the same thing. The vast majority of disputes in this country last two days. Many disputes last for 10 days and therefore Senator Haines's amendment does not meet our principles. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that if the Government wants to introduce legislation to alter the industrial relations system in this country it should get Mr Viner to introduce it. Let it argue on honest grounds about industrial relations legislation. It should not use social services legislation which is meant to protect people who cannot help themselves. The Government should introduce legislation under the industrial relations head so that we can argue and fight on that basis. It should not use the social services legislation to deprive innocent women and children of benefits. It should not tell us that there is a provision in this legislation for hardship. Even Senator Chaney, the Minister for Social Security, knows the stringent hardship provisions which relate to the payment of the special benefit. He knows that under the present legislation many people are caught up in disputes about which they have no knowledge. They are caught up in disputes which are started in another factory. They are involved secondarily. Under the present legislation, their wives and their children, under all sorts of circumstances, cannot receive the special benefit because of the hardship provisions that exist now, and those provisions will not be eased by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am amazed at the number of times we have heard Senator Martin talk in this place about the rights of women. I was amazed when Senator Martin stood up in this place and castigated people like Senator Harradine for having the temerity to speak for women. I was amazed when I heard her say in this place tonight that a woman who makes herself available for work, a woman who has no other form of support yet is willing to work, should be deprived of benefits, not because she is married to a man who is on strike but because she is married to a trade unionist who is on strike. That is the crux of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is aimed at trade unionists, not non-trade unionists. It is aimed at people who are members of unions who are in dispute or who are out of work because of a dispute by members of their union in another place. We think this legislation is wrong in principle because of that. We believe that if the Government thinks it is justified in bringing in legislation to prevent industrial disputes it should do so in an honest way under the head of industrial legislation, not by the back door through social services. It should not try to prevent disputes in this country by affecting the income of women and children of people involved in disputes either directly or indirectly. That is why we maintain our opposition to the legislation. In fact, that is why we find the amendment moved by Senator Haines, however high her motives, unacceptable. We will continue to oppose this Bill at all stages.</PARA>

Of course, before us we also have the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. I have looked briefly at the amendment and it seems to me it is not all that different from the position taken by the Government. If the Democrats were not so determined so consistently to oppose the Government they might be supporting the Bill with us tonight. I do not propose to confine my remarks so much to statistics.

I hope we can look at the Bill more particularly from a point of view of principle rather than the significance of the number of dollars that may or may not be involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whether to pay unemployment benefits to the spouses of strikers is the question that confronts us tonight. Of course, as we have learned during the passage of the last hour or two, there is a case to be made for both sides of the argument. I believe that probably one argument is significantly based more on emotion than on logic. On balance, I believe that the Government's proposition is realistic and responsible. It is responsible to the community as a whole. It is responsible to the Australian taxpayer. After all, the payment of employment benefits to people who cease to work and who are on strike is surely, when analysed, nothing more than yet another call-of whatever magnitude-on the Australian taxpayer. I do not believe that in this debate tonight we are involved in a discussion on the right to strike. Of course, the right to strike is an acceptable part of a free society just as is the right of free speech, the right of association, and a whole lot of other rights we are constantly talking about not only in this place but also in the Press or wherever Australians gather. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not discussing the right to strike. We are perhaps discussing whether the right to strike in a country existing under the rule of law should virtually be a last resort following negotiations in an attempt to come to a reasonable and responsible conclusion concerning the living and working conditions and wages and salaries that apply in the various industries in this country. Living as we fortunately do in Australia-and as people in a few other democratic societies around the world live-under the rule of law and as a free society surely we have to be aware of the consequences of strike action. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the consequences across the whole community of a great deal of strike action are very sad indeed. Certain honourable senators tonight have talked about the consequences that flow in certain circumstances to the spouse and children of a striker. The consequences of that sort of strike action which has been far too common in this country go much further. The consequences range right across the Australian community. The longer a strike lasts of course then the further those consequences extend into the middle and far distant future. Indeed, they can be so severe that they will not only threaten the development of this country, not only our capacity to supply goods and ultimately our ability to get and to assure ourselves of markets but also, consequent upon those things, threaten the capacity of this country to provide realistic, proper and useful employment for all its people. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, strike action imposes an immense hardship on countless Australians. It is the Government's proposition that those Australians-as Australian taxpayers-should not be held responsible in any way for the payment of unemployment benefits to the spouses of people determined not to work, for whatever reason. The dispute can be, must be and ultimately will be solved by negotiation and discussion in the properly assembled and constituted conciliation and arbitration processes. Indeed, it is very often settled by negotiation in the work place between the employer and the employee group. There is no doubt that the strike will be solved. But there is no obligation on the Australian taxpayer. We must always remember that where we have rights we have obligations. There is no obligation on the Australian taxpayer to provide some sort of succour-beyond that for those in extreme hardship-for people who cease to work and who strike in order to achieve their objective, whatever it might be . </PARA>
<PARA> Considerable reference has been made to special benefits as if in fact they do not exist. If indeed a spouse and the children concerned are not in a position to carry on with whatever liquid funds they have and if they are in exceptional circumstances of hardship this legislation provides a measure to combat and to meet that need. I believe it would be appropriate, as there has been considerable concern about what is a special benefit and what constitutes it, to indicate from the speech of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) on an earlier occasion exactly what constitutes a special benefit. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> I will outline to the Senate the position with respect to the grant of that special benefit. Administrative guidelines have been prepared covering the test of extreme hardship which is the test required by the legislation and which is a precondition to the grant of special benefit under the amendment. These guidelines indicate that extreme hardship may be accepted if the current income and available liquid assets of a couple, for example, money in the bank and cash , are less than the equivalent of two weeks unemployment benefit at the single rate plus, where appropriate, additional benefit for children, after unavoidable fortnightly financial commitments other than general living costs have been deducted from the income and available liquid assets. In such cases special benefit will be paid at a rate sufficient to bring the total income of the couple up to the level of unemployment benefit at the single rate plus any additional benefit for children. Where an applicant is inelligible for special benefit because income and available liquid assets are sufficient to cover unavoidable financial commitments and the relevant rate of unemployment benefit, the position will be reviewed each fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of example, let me take a family with two children and outline a number of situations in which special benefit would not be payable and a number in which it would be payable. If a family had no liquid resources and unavoidable financial commitments, it would get the special benefits at the single unemployed rate with the addition for the two children. In other words, the family's position would be the same as if it were in receipt of unemployment benefits. It would get an amount of $89.70. If a family had liquid resources of, say, $50 a week but unavoidable financial commitments in excess of that amount, it would get $89.70. If it had liquid resources equal to its unavoidable financial commitments, it would get $89.70. If it had liquid resources $50 a week in excess of its unavoidable financial commitments, it would get $39.70. If it had liquid resources in excess of the amount of its unavoidable financial commitments, the single unemployment rate and the amount for children, it would get nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>I have given this definition of special benefit because it has been a matter of considerable discussion tonight. I think it appropriate that it be clearly outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to return briefly to the Bill. The community in which we live is in every sense an interdependent community. The action of any group, large or small , has a much quicker and greater effect on a far greater range of Australians than may well have been the situation some years ago. As a community we must recognise, as I said earlier, that all the rights which we profess, which we talk about and which we defend carry with them obligations. It certainly is not the obligation of the Australian taxpayer to provide the funds to support an Australian who is on strike. It is the obligation and duty of this Government, and of any government, to make sure that the circumstances prevail in which industrial relations may survive and grow more peaceful. It is the obligation of this Government, and any government, to provide the proper machinery for discussion and for the solution of industrial problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in this country of ours the conciliation and arbitration system, as it has been amended from time to time over the past 70-odd years, provides a basic mechanism whereby disputes are capable of being solved. I said before that this debate is not about the right to strike; it is about a responsibility of the Australian taxpayers. I do not believe, and the Government does not believe, that the Australian taxpayer has the duty or the obligation to support men or women who choose to strike. It is their responsibility; they have the right so to do. But they have an obligation in that circumstance basically to look after themselves. That is what we believe, with the proviso that where there is extraordinary or quite discernable hardship special benefits can and will be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to discuss this matter further tonight. The pros and cons of the argument, most of which are somewhat similar, have been canvassed for some considerable time. I close my remarks by again saying that in my view it is not the obligation of the taxpayer to support industrial unrest in the form of strikes-indeed, industrial unrest in any form. That is not to say that there is not a reason for striking, and in many cases perhaps it is a justifiable one. But the obligation for the maintenance of and for looking after the striker remains with the striker and his community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of those who might happen to be listening at this late hour the Senate is debating the Social Services Amendment Bill for the third time. The Bill has been changed on a number of occasions but really there is no basic change to its structure. I was interested to hear Senator Scott say that this Bill does not deal with the right of people to strike. He then proceeded to give us a 10-minute dissertation on whether the consequences of that strike action were covered by this Bill. I think it would be true to say that the hypocrisy of the Government has to be seen to be believed. A matter of a few days ago we listened to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in an impassioned plea in his speech on the state of the nation, calling for 'an increasingly compassionate society'. He said: 'We seek an increasingly compassionate society'. Yet within a matter of hours of that plea from the man at the top-perhaps there were a few people in the community who really thought that he was genuine in making that statement-we found before us again this extraordinary Bill which lacks any for of compassion at all. But here we have the Prime Minister saying: 'We collectively the Government-seek an increasingly compassionate society'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have here a Bill which is specifically designed to divide people, to put Australian against Australian and to attack people, particularly those who happen to choose to be members of trade unions. I contend that the people who would suffer most if this repressive piece of legislation were permitted to go through this chamber-it will not be-would be those who are not in any position to help themselves. It is particularly designed to impose on children the so- called 'sins' of their parents, be they male or female. This legislation is designed to impose a penalty on those children because their parent or parents have decided, whether or not knowingly, to participate in industrial action. The fact that those parents may not be directly involved makes this piece of legislation even more reprehensible. In my opinion it is just another exercise in the Government's continuing endeavours to bash trade unions. We on this side of the chamber are not prepared to sit back and see innocent members of those trade union families suffer because of a lack of compassion on the part of this Government. An increase in compassion was the very thing that the Prime Minister himself called for. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Martin spoke a little earlier of the companies' role. I think that is a particularly interesting area and that she covered it in a particularly interesting way. She spoke of the Blackwater strike. Senator Grimes has now responded to her comments on that matter, but I think it is worth repeating that it was the Government's coalition partner which, as you would be well aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, was encouraging those strikers to stay out until their demands had been met. Mr Acting Deputy President, I am sorry if I cause you some embarrassment but you must remember the actions of your party at that time. The Blackwater strike has been raised here on many occasions during this debate. I think it is important also to note that businesses also are gettin a little tired of trade union bashing. This Government and the Government of Western Australia will not recognise that there are certain basic rights to which every Australian is entitled. They are suddenly finding themselves confronting a very large industry in Western Australia which is the subject of an article on the front page of today's West Australian, which, for those who have not read it, is headlined: 'No ticket-no job, says major builder'. The article relates the situation of a major construction firm which has put up signs at its Perth industrial works pointing out that if either members of its organisation or those people who sub-contract to it are not members of a union they will be denied the right to work. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V4">Senator COLEMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even Sir Charles Court, when he was Premier of Western Australia, did recognise that. As Senator Grimes said earlier, it would have been much easier if this legislation had been introduced as coming within the area of industrial relations. Then we could have had a proper debate about industrial relations. Not only is it unfortunate but I think it is also inopportune of the Government to bring in the legislation as falling within social services. The Bill is designed, as I have already said, to impose a penalty on those people who are least in a position to help themselves. It has been introduced in an endeavour to preclude the spouses of persons involved in industrial action from receiving unemployment benefits. I ask: Who does the Government think the real victims will be? The cause may be in one place but the effect will be felt in a variety of places. We can have the situation which existed in the Ford dispute in Melbourne where people were on strike and others in Brisbane were stood down because no component parts were available. The Minister in charge of this Bill, Senator Chaney, refused those people in Brisbane unemployment benefits even though they had not voluntarily given up their jobs. Even though they were not even involved in the industrial action, those people were not able to claim unemployment benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Grimes has already pointed out that it is members of the single income families, particularly those families with children, who will suffer most. There is a large number of these family units in Australia. There is an especially large number of these family units in places like the north of Western Australia where in a multitude of company towns accommodation may be provided, if it is available, for the workers and their families. As a general rule, accommodation is not available in or near those towns for family support systems, so that those people who are engaged in industrial action are isolated. </PARA>
<PARA> I know the Minister's second reading speech mentioned the insulation of some people under these circumstances but the people I am talking about are those who are isolated and who, if they are affected by the provisions of this Bill, will not have the family support systems to fall back on that perhaps would be enjoyed by people in a similar situation in a metropolitan area or in perhaps a larger country town that was not considered to be a company town. If honourable senators had ever visited or worked in a company town, they would know of the situation which is perhaps unique in that none of these towns has an office of the Commonwealth Employment Service or of the Department of Social Security where it would be anticipated that the spouse of a person involved in industrial action would be able either to apply for a position or to apply for social security benefits. They do not have that facility available to them. It is generally miles away. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V4">Senator COLEMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill does not change that; it simply precludes those people from being able to get a benefit, if it is available, at an earlier time because of the delay required to get those applications to the various departments. Senator Martin made a very interesting statement. She said that the legislation is designed to prevent people obtaining unemployment benefits because they do not need them. I would like Senator Martin, or perhaps the Minister in charge of the Bill, to tell me exactly what is meant by the phrase ' because they do not need them'. Are they expecting that those people would all have money put aside of which they could readily avail themselves in the event that a union somewhere else decided to take industrial action and they were as a consequence stood down? Are they saying that perhaps these people will have a spouse who is working and therefore will not be entitled to unemployment benefits? Are they saying that the children of those family units are not entitled to food, shelter and clothing? Are they suggesting that if the spouse of a person who happens to be working as a labourer, perhaps in an under- educated type of position, is also an under-educated person without employment she and her family must suffer unless they claim hardship benefits?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have already heard of the situation with regard to hardship benefits. I put it to the Government that there is something just a little degrading about having to go to a government authority and admit that one is suffering hardship and is entitled to a benefit. The Government has introduced such requirements on a number of occasions. It has now made it possible for people who are disadvantaged to get medical benefits, as long as they declare that they are disadvantaged. The Government has taken away the very dignity, the very pride, of people by having them placed in a situation where they have to declare their poverty. That is exactly what this Bill provides for. If they declare that they are suffering hardship, they will get a hardship benefit. That is tremendous. If one has not been in that position, one does not know what that does to the little bit of pride a person has left. It is obvious that this Government does not give a damn about pride, dignity or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn very briefly to the situation in regard to work tests. Some extraordinary situations have developed because of failures to pass the work test. I wonder whether the Government has deliberately confused the officers who apply this test to people who are looking for jobs. I wonder whether it has set out the deliberations in such a confusing way that people working in the Department are automatically confused or whether it is a deliberate plot. We have seen how people have failed the work test because they have refused to travel up to 30 kilometres a day and spend dollars they can ill afford. Because they will not take a position in those circumstances they are deemed to have failed the work test. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Colston said, it is unfortunate that we live in a society where people do not know that they have access at least to Labor members of Parliament . I know that many people in the community recognise that they do not have access to Liberal and National Country Party members of Parliament. Unfortunately, we still live in a community where there is a large number of people who would never dream of going to a member of Parliament, possibly because they would see him or her as part of the bureaucratic wall that would take away, once again, some of their remaining pride and dignity if they had to confess that they had refused to take a job which would disadvantage their families further, and, therefore, they have been deemed to have failed the work test and do not meet the criteria for unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke a little while ago about the situation in company towns. One of the facts I failed to mention was that it is almost impossible for both partners to obtain employment in a company town. If they both work they work for the company so that they are both involved in any industrial action. I think we have covered most of the clauses of the Bill that pertain to the rights of people. We have heard Senator Martin and Senator Scott say that people have to accept responsibility. I think that honourable senators on this side of the chamber recognise that people accept their responsiblities when they accept their rights to particular things, such as Australian citizenship and employment. They accept their responsibilities to the people who provide them with the opportunity for employment. </PARA>
<PARA> But ever since this Government has been in office it has taken action against people who want to be involved in their associations. It was interesting that a previous speaker on the Government side said that he recognised the right of people for form an association and to become members of an association. One has to presume that in that instance he was not referring to employer associations but to trade unions. Of course people have a right to belong to trade unions. Under the provisons of all trade unions, under the provisons of basic human decency, every worker has one inalienable right, and that is the right to strike . This Government is intent on taking that right away from workers. In an endeavour to force them to recognise that it will hold the reins it is prepared to penalise the innocent parties to a partnership which may exist purely and simply to provide those people with a decent standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> People are getting tired of this type of legislation. They are certainly getting tired of the union bashing tactics of this Government. As I have already demonstrated by referring to the actions of Multiplex in Western Australia, businesses are also getting tired of this union bashing. The Opposition will continue to oppose any legislation, whether it be industrial relations or social security legislation, which serves to take away the rights of people to a decent standard of living. </PARA>

<PARA> What does this amending legislation seek to do? It seeks to deny the single unemployment benefit to spouses of trade unionists involved in strike action and to spouses of unemployed persons denied benefits because they have failed the work test as a result of alleged unemployment or dismissal for alleged misconduct. In addition it seeks to deny special benefit provisions to spouses of persons who would have been eligible to receive those benefits if they had failed any of the conditions I have just mentioned. It is draconian legislation which is not supported in any shape or form by anybody I know from my experience who has a great deal of knowledge of the industrial relations arena. What we therefore have to ask ourselves as a Senate is this: Why does the Government persist with these amendments in the face of total silence from persons experienced in the industrial relations arena? I can only come to the conclusion that the Government is doing so to lay the foundations for a double dissolution. The Government will fail if it seeks to suggest, quite wrongly, to the people of Australia that the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and I are attempting to obstruct in the Senate some policy measure of the Government to improve industrial relations. I will line up, and I know that a number of my colleagues here will line up, a whole host of people at the next election from both the employer side and the union side to say that the Government's clumsy attempt to involve industrial relations in social security measures is quite contrary to orderly industrial progress. </PARA>

In other words, the basic wage had a family concept, and now it does not. It behoves the Parliament to be very careful indeed about withdrawing rights from the family, from the spouse of the striker, rights which, most importantly by decision of the 1967 national wage case are the responsibility of this national Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think he will go that far. Let us take up the matter which Senator Grimes mentioned earlier this afternoon, that is, the question of involvement. That is a very important question indeed. If this legislation goes through the Parliament, we could see a situation where a spouse of a worker who has voted against a strike or, indeed, who has no vote at all as to whether the strike takes place, will be denied a right that she and her children have under existing legislation. Let us take as a very practical example Victoria. I remind the Senate that Victoria is a State of significant political consideration at the present moment. Geelong is a city which has a stable population and a stable work force. Let us look at the Ford plant at Geelong which makes the Ford engines and the blocks for the engines. They are then assembled into the motor vehicles at the Broadmeadows plant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of the Senate, who are familiar with industrial relations in Victoria, know that over a period of years there have been a number of strikes at the Broadmeadows plant. Those strikes have of course affected the operations of the Geelong plant. Let us imagine that another strike develops at the Broadmeadows plant. That creates a log-jam and Ford lays off workers at the Geelong plant. The workers at Geelong do not have a say in whether the Broadmeadows workers go out on strike and yet the Government intends to penalise those people in a decentralised area because of the action taken at Broadmeadows. Is that fair? Is that equitable? Of course it is not. Let the Minister examine what happened in 1974 or thereabouts when Broadmeadows went out on strike for quite a long period . There was a great deal of agitation at Geelong, so much so that one of the officials of the union concerned was almost chased out of town. Despite the attitude that might be taken by those workers in Geelong, the Government proposes to penalise not them but their wives and children. There is no element whatsoever of social justice in that proposition. I ask the Government to reconsider its attitude on this matter. I ask it to examine what it seeks to achieve out of this proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I take as another example a matter which was discussed in another place. I refer to an accident that occurred on a job site in Victoria where one worker fell from a considerable height and injured himself. The workers immediately went on strike because of unsafe working conditions. As I understand it, one week later, after an investigation had been made into that accident and a recommendation had been made-I understand almost an instruction was made to the employer to remedy the unsafe practice, but that had not occurred-another worker experienced a similar accident. The workers of course went on strike until that situation was remedied. If that situation had been extended for over a week the Government would have denied to the wives of those workers, who after all were only protecting their livelihood, the entitlement that they should receive under this legislation. That is the proposition. Is that just? Is that fair? Is that reasonable? Is that going to do anything for industrial relations in Australia? I will be proposing that this whole piece of legislation be referred to a select committee or a standing committee for futther consideration before it is debated . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I speak on the adjournment motion to bring your attention and that of Mr Speaker to the publication called New Legislation of the Australian Parliaments-that is what the publication says on the front cover. On its inside cover it calls itself 'New Legislation of the Australian Parliament'. At the foot of every page it calls itself 'New Legislation of the Australia Parliaments'. To start with, it is not a very well put together publication. It is one that began, I think, in 1973. It is now up to issue No. 24.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The publication provides a reprint of ministerial second reading speeches on Bills introduced into this Parliament. I do not believe it started off in this way, but it appears to me that these reprints now are generally, in almost all cases, direct facsimiles of Hansard. I wonder, Mr President, whether you would investigate this practice to see whether this is a correct use of Hansard. I presume that copyright would apply to Hansard as printed as distinct from the words which make up speeches, which, I guess it is fair, can be reproduced in any form. I wonder whether permission was sought for this use of Hansard. If so, who gave the permission and why? It seems to me that it is not right for a private publication to make a financial gain from the typesetting performed by the Commonwealth Government Printer. This publication makes it clear that it is an independent non-government publication. It does not actually have the name of a publisher written anywhere on it that I can find although it gives its address as P.O. Box 158 Pymble, 2073, New South Wales. It contains advertising as well as some other editorial matter that appears to be linked to that advertising; that is, certain advertisers get an extra plug in the publication. Overwhelmingly the publication consists of reprints of Ministers' second reading speeches. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is probably a waste for most people to subscribe to the publication because it would be a lot cheaper for them to subscribe to Hansard. People do not get much more from this publication than what Hansard provides. So, it is a fairly useless publication. It is a commercial publication. I think in its misuse of Hansard it deserves investigation. I suppose that some people would say: 'Well, it is not much different from people photocopying a couple of pages of Hansard and distributing them for the information of their constituents'. I think the big difference that is involved is that it is a commercial publication which is sold, which contains advertising and which misuses Hansard by publishing pages precisely as typeset by the Government Printer. I suggest that you, Mr President, and Mr Speaker might wish to investigate this matter. Perhaps the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) should do so as well. It might be appropriate if I tabled this copy of issue No. 24 of New Legislation of the Australian Parliaments. I seek leave to table the document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to draw the Senate's attention to the plight of certain parts of the printing industry in the Australian Capital Territory. There are about 45 small businesses, many of them family businesses, which have been particularly affected by the cutback in government spending which occurred on 12 February. About 600 people are employed by these firms. It has always been an industry in Canberra which has relied heavily on government contracts for its work. As a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions in April 1981, when the work of the Government Printer was seriously cut back, these printing firms have had work from the Commonwealth which has amounted to about 70 per cent of their total business. Many of them, as a result, have bought new equipment and entered into new financial commitments, leasing and other arrangements, to meet the demand that was then placed upon them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of the freeze on 12 February, the impact on these small firms has been quite devastating. There has been significant loss of finance already. Many of them have employees who may have to be retrenched, and many of them are running into difficulties in meeting their financial commitments. Some of them no doubt will even face bankruptcy. I am told that about 300 people are likely to lose their jobs in the quite near future. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter of concern, of course, is that, having run down the activites of the Government Printer and relied on these firms, if the Commonwealth gets around to printing on the same basis as it has done in recent times, the service may no longer be available in the national capital, and the Commonwealth may then find itself delayed in getting its orders filled. That would be a great pity both for the efficiency of government business and, of course, for the firms to which I have referred. If then the Commonwealth had to go interstate to get printing done, it would be a great deal more costly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult for any man in business to plan his affairs when he is subject to overnight cuts of this nature. It is certainly something that has a serious effect on the economy of this community, even if only in a small section of it. There are other areas in which these cuts have had an effect, but it is the effects on our small printing industry that I refer to tonight. It needs its work at a steady and constant rate to sustain the industry, and it involves a group which has suffered as a result. I wish tonight merely to draw the Senate's attention to the impact on this group in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Late this afternoon I had a visit from some people from the north of Queensland. They brought to my attention a matter that is rather important in the light of the fact that the Government of Queensland is looking at the position concerning the reserve lands in my State of Queensland. I made a speech here last Thursday evening about the reserve lands in Queensland and what the Queensland Government was doing in relation to the return to the Aboriginal people in my State of those reserve lands. I want to bring to the Senate's attention a matter that gives a great deal of concern to the people of an Aboriginal settlement in north Queensland, namely Yarrabah, which is a settlement very close to the city of Cairns. I think that it is rather indicative that, whilst the Queensland Government is talking about handing over these Aboriginal reserve lands to Aboriginal people in a very short space of time, these two young people came to me with a matter of grave concern to the Aboriginal people and the traditional owners of the land that has been for a number of years set aside as an Aboriginal reserve in the area of Yarrabah just outside Cairns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter that was brought to my attention, I think, is and should be of very great concern to this Parliament. I am sorry that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, is not in the chamber tonight. Because of a number of events, I did not have the opportunity of bringing this matter to his attention in the last few hours. These young people who came to speak to me are concerned about a place which is part of the reserve land of the Yarrabah community, namely, Kings Beach. On the part of the reserve land of the Yarrabah community which takes in Kings Beach there is a sacred site which is very important to the Aboriginal people, the traditional owners of the area. A sacred water hole and a sacred cave with Aboriginal paintings in it have great significance for the traditional owners of that area, namely, the Gon-gangie people. </PARA>
<PARA> We have learned recently that a number of survey pegs have been established in the area of Kings Beach. In addition, past the settlement of Yarrabah and across a rather extensive flat, water reticulation has been laid heading towards Kings Beach. Also, the electricity commission responsible for the Cairns area has laid electricity cables across this area, finishing up nowhere but heading towards this beach which is part and parcel of the Yarrabah community and which has been set aside by governments for a number of years. The things that these two young people told me about the water reticulation pipes and the electricity cables that have been laid across this area heading towards this beach surely must make anyone suspicious about what is happening in the area. The young people have not been able to get any kind of information from the State Government, from the people responsible for the provision of electricity or from the people responsible for the provision of water reticulation. They are concerned about what is to happen to this area which for a number of years has been set aside by the Queensland Government as an Aboriginal settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the speech I made in this place last Thursday in relation to the Queensland Government's attitude towards setting aside Aboriginal reserves and the kinds of things that the Queensland Government seems to want to do as far as Aboriginal reserves in Queensland are concerned. During that speech, I think I pointed out a number of things that could be done by the Queensland Government and the Queensland Minister for Lands and Forestry. If I am correct in all those things that I stated in my speech last Thursday, we must now look at what is going to happen to the Aboriginal community at the Yarrabah settlement, which is on the coast south of Cairns in north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> If the information that I have is correct, I think that the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs should look closely at what is projected for that community. If our suspicions are correct, the Queensland Government is going to set aside part of that reserve for some other purpose. At this moment I do not know what the purpose is. It does seem strange that a government would go to the expense of setting up water reticulation for an isolated area. If the Queensland Government, through whatever department it may be, is going to provide electricity to that isolated area, I want to know what it has in mind for that part of Kings Beach on the coast south of Cairns, which is part of an Aboriginal community. What does it have in mind for the future development of that area? Without any consultation with and without the knowledge of the Aboriginal community of Yarrabah and without any consultation with the local Aboriginal council, the Queensland Government is taking this action. What is its purpose? If that is what is going to happen to Aboriginal communities in Queensland, what is the Federal Government going to do to preserve and protect the Aboriginal communities on those reserve lands in Queensland? What protection are we going to give to the Aboriginal people?</PARA>
<PARA> We have heard and we have been told by the Federal Government and by the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that negotiations have been going on behind the scenes by the Department and by the Minister to bring about justice for the Aboriginal people of Queensland. I, for one, have listened to him and given him a great deal of support. I will continue to give that support. But I want to know what we are going to do about this matter. We have before us information that the Queensland Government is working in a clandestine way in this Aboriginal community. It should, by all accounts, be one of the communities which, under proposals put forward by the Queensland Government, should have complete autonomous use of its land. But we find that in a very underhand way, through whatever departments or other instrumentality, survey pegs have been placed on that beach and the installation of water reticulation is heading towards it. Electrical facilities are being projected towards that beach which is part of an Aboriginal community. What is going to be set up on that beach, on a part of an Aboriginal community that has been set aside and which will come under the cloak of the proposal by the Queensland Government? That is the question that needs to be answered. </PARA>
<PARA> I have indicated in my speech what the Queensland Government is intending to do which is not in the interests of the Aboriginal people on the reserve land in Queensland. We now have evidence-it may seem flimsy-because Aboriginal people have brought to my attention the types of things that are happening in that area . What else can we expect in the 19 Aboriginal communities in my State of Queensland? If this happens in one community and we in the Federal Parliament sit still and allow these kinds of things to happen, what hope is there for the remaining Aboriginal communities? We should exercise the right and the power that we have vested in this Commonwealth Parliament under the terms of the 1967 referendum. What hope is there for the Aboriginal community of this nation unless the Commonwealth Government has the intestinal fortitude, the courage, to take the steps that need to be taken to ensure that justice is not only done but seen to be done for the indigenous people of this country?</PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that I have taken up the time of the Senate tonight but I believe it is important that I do. I know that I will attract criticism from many quarters because it may appear that I continually fight the battle of the indigenous people of this country. Mr President, I ask you and all Australians to recognise that out of 64 senators and all the honourable members who sit in the other place there is only one Aboriginal voice. If that voice is not raised in support of the indigenous people of this country there will not be any voice raised. I raise my voice this evening and support the people of that small community of Yarrabar because they are concerned, and I share their concern, that something is going on that needs to be investigated. I hope that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) will investigate what is happening to that community and ensure that the Aboriginal people have justice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Some estimates of the peak overpressures obtainable from FAE, conventional explosives and nuclear devices are given in the following table:</PARA>
<PARA> Peak Overpressure in kilopascals</PARA>
<PARA>Nuclear Distance</PARA>
<PARA>FAE HE (small) (metres)</PARA>

<PARA>Footnotes:-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 2,000 kilopascals is equivalent to 300 pounds per square inch or 20 atmospheres.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Peak overpressure is only a partial measure of the potential for causing blast damage. The duration of the blast wave and geometric factors such as the position, orientation and strength of blast reflecting surfaces must be also considered.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The predominant damage mechanism for FAE is blast; HE weapons cause damage through blast and fragmentation; nuclear weapons cause damage by means of blast, thermal radiation and nuclear radiation effects. The blast output of even a small nuclear warhead is equivalent to that produced by 1,000 to 10,000 tonnes of HE.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No trials have been conducted in Australia to assess the effects of FAEs against any of the targets listed. Some classified data is available through the Technical Co-operation Program that involves the US, UK, Canada, NZ and Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 February 1982 (Hansard, page 77) Senator Evans asked the following question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Minister seen the reports of the decision yesterday by the Queensland Supreme Court in the Pine Vale case, drastically reducing the investigative powers of the National Companies and Securities Commission and making a nonsense of the practical operation of the takeover code? Does the Minister agree, following the extraordinarily narrow and technical interpretations of Mr Justice Sheahan in this case and the equally narrow and unadventurous decision of Mr Justice Needham in the Industrial Equity Ltd case last December, that there is a need for urgent amendment of the legislation and an urgent meeting of the Ministerial Council to set that in train? In particular, will the Commonwealth propose the insertion in the relevant legislation, not only of specific remedial provisions but also a provision along the lines of section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act, requiring the courts to have regard to the manifest purpose of the legislation? Finally, has this course of events concentrated at all the mind of the Government any more clearly on the utility and virtue of unilateral Commonwealth legislation in this field, rather than having to rely on the cumbersome and disjointed procedures of the present co- operative scheme?</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Minister, amply briefed as he is, aware that the main section in issue is not in the new takeovers code or any other legislation but the NCSC parent Act, section 36, which relates to the general investigative powers of the Commission? Does the Government have any idea in its collective head as to what it proposes to do about the text of section 36 in the light of its emasculation by the Queensland Supreme Court yesterday?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the judicial decisions to which the honourable senator refers.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Companies and Securities Commission has held discussions with officers from the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs about a number of proposals for the urgent amendment of the scheme legislation in the light both of recent court decisions and experience gained in the administration of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Companies and Securities Commission has now submitted a paper to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities recommending a number of amendments to the co-operative scheme legislation having regard, among other things, to the judicial decisions referred to by the honourable senator.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; On 17 February 1982 (Hansard page 75) Senator Harradine asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it an inflexible rule of the Government never to protest about apparent human rights violations in overseas countries?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Are any exceptions ever made?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Does it depend on the severity of the case or the volume of noise from people in Australia or, indeed, on the colour of the eyes of the individual senator making the request?</PARA>
<PARA> (4) If not, why the different approach taken by the Government on such cases?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA> No, the Government does not of course apply an inflexible rule. Australia has made representations concerning human rights to a variety of countries across the broad political and geographical spectrum and will continue to do so should the circumstances justify such approaches. Recent subjects for such representations include the situation of Baha'is in Iran and human rights violations under martial law in Poland. Australia's commitment to upholding and promoting human rights, both in multilateral fora and through direct bilateral representations to countries involved, is unshakable.</PARA>
<PARA> As there is no such inflexible 'rule', the question of exceptions does not arise. I should mention, however, that some factors influencing the Government' s decision to make representations include the nature and gravity of alleged violations involved, the status of evidence introduced to establish the validity of the allegations and an assessment of the likely effectiveness of the representations (and the related concern about possible counterproductive results). Domestic concern expressed in Australia about the human rights violations in individual countries is naturally also a factor which the Government takes into account in making decisions whether or not to make representations. In short, Australia's approach to human rights is neither arbitrary nor capricious.</PARA>
