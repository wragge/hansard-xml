<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Senators in the Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The students and staff of the University of Queensland express their dismay at the lack of adequate federal government funding to our University, which has resulted, inter alia, in the erosion of our Library facilities. We note that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The opening hours of our main Library have been reduced from 93 1/2 hours a week in 1975 to 72 hours a week in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The number of new books purchased per year has fallen from over 50,000 in 1976 to under 23,000 in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The number of books in storage and inaccessible to students and staff has risen from none in 1977 to over 40,000 in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The number of books discarded in 1976 was over 6,000-by the end of 1981 over 70,000 had been discarded.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 60 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate of the Australian Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that while generous tax concessions benefit established sectors of the now internationally acclaimed Australian film industry, other vital film activities, which are ineligible for tax concessions, have had to be severely curtailed due to the lack of funds available to the Creative Development Branch of the Australian Film Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's Creative Development Branch is responsible for funding low budget films in order to develop new creative talent and ideas for the film industry to draw upon, it assists activities of major national significance such as the Australian Film Awards and the National Film Theatre, and it supports Film Festivals and film organisations in almost every state. All these aspects of the Commission's creative development work have suffered as the result of inflation eroding the Creative Development Branch's budget by over 40 per cent over the past five years.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore your petitioners call upon the Federal Parliament to provide the Australian Film Commission with at least a 50 per cent increase in the budget for its Creative Development Branch in the coming financial year. This would be an essential first step towards ensuring the continuation of a viable and developing Australian film culture and film industry.</PARA>

<PARA> That in recent years thousands of families have lost their homes, the building industry and employment is at an all time low, with social disruption a serious factor.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth concern over plant variety rights (PVR) legislation. We agree that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. PVR will inhibit the free exchange of genetic material for plant breeding.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. PVR will not enhance Australia's access to plant varieties developed overseas but will encourage the dumping of unsuitable varieties on the Australian market.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. PVR will restrict the public plant breeding program to basic research for exploitation by private enterprise and discourage breeding for disease and pest resistant varieties.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. PVR will lead to the domination of the seed industry by foreign interests not responsible to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The proprietary rights granted by PVR will encourage the introduction of seed distribution and marketing monopolies and lead to seed price increases.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate of the Australian Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that while generous tax concessions benefit established sectors of the now internationally acclaimed Australian film industry, other vital film activities, which are ineligible for tax concessions, have had to be severely curtailed due to the lack of funds available to the Creative Development Branch of the Australian Film Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's Creative Development Branch is responsible for funding low budget films in order to develop new creative talent and ideas for the film industry to draw upon, it assists activities of major national significance such as the Australian Film Awards and the National Film Theatre, and it supports Film Festivals and film organisations in almost every state. All these aspects of the Commission's Creative Development work have suffered as the result of inflation eroding the Creative Development Branch's budget by over 40% over the past five years.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore your petitioners call upon the Federal Parliament to provide the Australian Film Commission with at least a 50% increase in the budget for its Creative Development Branch in the coming financial year. This would be an essential first step towards ensuring the continuation of a viable and developing Australian film culture and film industry.</PARA>

Did the Government agree, in considering the increases, that much of the burden would fall on country people as a result of the sharp rise in the cost of short distance trunk calls, which make up the bulk of calls in rural areas?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The announcement was made last night so that the people of Australia would know what Telecom Australia, as a statutory body, was proposing in regard to telephone charges. The charge itself is determined by Telecom as a body and takes into account ordinary costs. As I recollect it, the Government received that recommendation within the last week and, having received it, approved it. The Government fully understands the argument that certain people are disadvantaged by distances and costs. The matter has been under study for many years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a little information on this rubella vaccine. The vaccine to which Senator Walters referred, called Almevax, has been granted marketing approval in Australia by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. So it has marketing approval. Authority for the importation of Almevax has been given recently and it may be that the difficulties of the recent past to which Senator Walters referred may be overcome by this authority for importation. I am not able to confirm Senator Walters' statement about the use of the vaccine overseas because precise statistics are not available. We do know that both Almevax and the Cendehill strain vaccine, Cendevax, are widely used in England and the United States of America. Cendevax is the vaccine currently used in Australia so it is important to realise that there is a vaccine available and in use in this country at present. The rubella immunisation policy and the strain of vaccine to be used are currently being reviewed by a special working party of the National Health and Medical Research Council.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce aware that in the 1981-82 financial year imports of cheese from the European Economic Community increased by 41.5 per cent compared with the previous year and that the majority of such cheese is dumped on to the Australian market with the help of EEC export subsidies which, for example, in the case of blue vein cheese amount to $941 per tonne? By comparison, the Australian tariff on blue vein cheese is a mere $96 per tonne. Does the Minister realise that the only Australian manufacturer of blue vein cheese, the Downs Co- operative Dairy Association Ltd in Toowoomba, Queensland, has ceased production of this cheese directly as a result of competition from subsidised EEC imports? What action is the Government contemplating to protect Australian cheese manufacturers from the dumping of EEC cheese onto the Australian market?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="97" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is aware of the fact that there has been an increase in the importation of cheese and it is also aware of the concern which has been expressed by certain parts of the Australian dairy industry at the rapid growth in imports. There was a claim that European cheeses were being sold in Australia at dumped or subsidised prices, and the Minister for Primary Industry pointed out to the industry the remedies available under the Customs anti-dumping legislation. Following that, the industry has now filed a dumping complaint against imports of blue vein cheese from Denmark. Of course, that is the appropriate action to be taken in cases of the sort outlined by Senator Bjelke-Petersen. The Government would expect the action to resolve whether blue vein cheese is in fact being sold at dumped or subsidised prices and whether that action is causing any injury to the Australian industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been an increase in the number of complaints about dumping generally, not merely in this area. The procedure which is available to any industry which believes it is being damaged is that it may lodge a complaint. Investigations are then carried out in Australia and overseas and there is a meeting of parties at which opposing statements can be tested in the open. This ensures that any decision which has to be taken by the Minister to protect the local industry is based on facts and not merely on allegations. At the moment there are 63 cases in hand, which is nearly double the number of a year ago. The Minister is watching this situation very carefully as it is obviously a growing problem.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The announcement by the Government yesterday of a new three- tier system for pharmaceutical benefits is probably the most major move towards trying to help those in financial need that has occurred for some time. Under the new arrangements there will be three levels of benefit. The groups that have been receiving their medication free of charge will continue to receive their medication free of charge under the Pensioner Health Scheme or under the Repatriation Benefits Scheme. The new group that will be introduced has been identified as a group in financial need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put to Senator Haines that there is a difficult choice involved. Either we try to identify families in financial need or we try a different approach, as Senator Haines has suggested, and look at groups with a particular medical need. It may be particularly complicated to take the road that she has suggested. The Government, in attempting to respond to those with particular financial needs, has gone down one road to increase social equity and to try to relieve the burden on many groups. The honourable senator is correct that the rest of us will have to pay an increased price per prescription and that, therefore, for those people who need a large number of prescriptions an extra charge will be involved. I will pass on to the Minister for Health Senator Haines's concern. I hope she would join with everyone else in acknowledging that the subsidised $2 a prescription does represent a real gain for the new group regardless of whether the prescription charge is increased as has been proposed in the Budget.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that Senator Thomas was referring to an estimate in the Budget statements that net individual income tax is estimated to increase by 10 per cent this year compared with 21 per cent last year, and that the Treasurer said in his Budget Speech that the consumer price index in 1982-83 as a whole could increase at a rate of 10 3/4 per cent. If those two estimates were to be realised, local authorities would receive in 1983-84 slightly less in real terms than they would receive this year. But it needs to be kept in mind that in 1982-83 local authorities in the aggregate will receive a 21 per cent increase in their tax sharing grants and that this follows increases of 16.6 per cent in 1981-82, 35.6 per cent in 1980-81, and 23.6 per cent in 1979-80. During the past five years, ending in this year, tax sharing grants to local authorities have increased from $180 million to $425 million a year, or by almost 150 per cent. By any standards, the Government has treated local government on a most favourable basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Total receipts are estimated in the Budget to increase by 11.3 per cent this year or, in real terms, by only 0.3 per cent. This is not greatly different from the estimated increase of 10 per cent for net income tax receipts. Clearly it is not realistic to expect the Government to change the legislation each year so that local authorities can receive 2 per cent of net income tax receipts or total tax receipts, whichever happens to be the larger.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see this morning's article. Indeed, I am aware of considerable interest in the Australian Capital Territory concerning the question of the establishment of a third Anglican grammar school. Honourable senators will be aware that last night I announced that the Government did intend to give financial support to the establishment of a third Anglican grammar school. I announced then the amounts of support which would be available . In fact, there has been quite extensive consultation with the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority. This is the Authority which operates the government school system in the Australian Capital Territory. I have received and considered written views from the Authority. I have met with the Chairman and the Chief Education Officer. I have received and considered a written report from the Authority entitled 'Impact of the third grammar school on enrolments in the Government school system'. So there has been considerable input from the Schools Authority which has been part of our consideration of the issues, and I imagine it has formed part of the consideration by the Schools Commission in the advice it has put to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third Anglican grammar school has aroused strong passions. The report which was prepared by the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority indicates that if the third grammar school has any effect on enrolments it will be a very marginal effect. The demographers say that it may take two schools to one of the first decision points two years earlier than would otherwise have happened-that is, perhaps from 1975 to 1993. I think it is quite proper that we received this information from the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority, and there are no grounds for saying that the consultation has been inadequate. In addition , I have made it clear to Dr Campbell and Dr Hancock that I am willing to consult the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority on any consequential questions which arise. So any of the consequences of the establishment of the grammar school will be matters which I will raise with the Schools Authority in the Territory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The announcement does mean that a group tax return can be lodged, but the new measure will apply only for losses that have been incurred in or after the 1982-83 income tax year. This will prevent any trafficking in past year losses. There will be a requirement that there be a 100 per cent common ownership of the companies involved. The provision for this group tax return is welcomed, but there is the requirement that it be effective only from the 1982-83 year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In 1975-76, that is, the year of the last Labor Government Budget, pay- as-you-earn taxpayers paid 59.3 per cent of income tax, including company tax. In 1981-82, that figure had risen to 65.8 per cent and from the estimate in last night's Budget of tax revenue in the current year it will rise to 66.4 per cent. I ask: If the self-employed professional speculators who have been dodging tax and other non-PAYE taxpayers had been required to pay the same proportion this year and last year as they paid in 1975-76, would wage and salary earners, that is PAYE taxpayers, have paid $1,700m less tax last year and $2,000m less this year for the same total revenue?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the precise amount that might have been paid by way of relief to PAYE taxpayers if those who have been avoiding tax had been capable of being compelled to pay tax. It is a notorious fact that there has been, over the last decade, a growth of the tax avoidance industry in Australia at both ends of the tax scale. I refer to two areas-the cash payments situation, where a great number of people avoid tax by cash payments and at the other end people avoiding company tax and their own personal tax. It is because of that trend that this Government, unlike its predecessor, has acted very vigorously indeed in a considerable number of ways to stamp out tax avoidance. In fact the Budget is able to report that the Commissioner of Taxation says that the revenue that will flow this year will show positive proof that those anti- tax-avoidance schemes are working.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government proposes to bring down very significant legislation in addition to the great volume of actions it has taken in the past to make sure that tax avoiders do not in future impose burdens on PAYE taxpayers. I repeat that the Government is very well aware that ordinary wage and salary earners have been, over the past decade, paying a greater proportion of tax than their due, largely and significantly because of tax avoidance. The anti-tax-avoidance measures that the Government is taking and has taken, plus the announcements of new tax collection methods to be adopted in future years, will, in the view of the Government and indeed in the estimate of the Commissioner of Taxation, go a considerable way towards obviating that. It is a great joy to the Government that it has been able in this Budget to announce significant tax concessions to the taxpayers of Australia, particularly the low wage and salary earners. I think the Budget last night was able to say that now 75 per cent of all taxpayers would be in the standard tax rate and that that tax rate would be reduced to 30c in the dollar. That is quite a considerable achievement.</PARA>

Interestingly, similar studies have been carried out overseas. The figures produced by Mr Asher from the survey to which he referred show higher figures-that is, I take it, a worse performance-than those shown in overseas surveys. There is a need then for some examination to try to work out why these differences occur and whether there is something peculiar to Australian practice. I am not able to give Senator Missen details of what was actually in the media campaign or whether it has the qualities which he ascribes to it. I am aware that the National Health and Medical Research Council has been concerned about the health implications of television food advertisements. It does have a working party which is considering this and related matters. It has been looking at television advertisements of foods directed at children. The recommendations of that working party are before the Department of Health at present. I take it that there will be some decision by the Department of Health which may lead to some action by it.</PARA></TALK.START>

So Senator Missen will probably be encouraged, as I am, by the fact that some co-operative action is going ahead to try to work out what is appropriate advertising.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the end of his question Senator Elstob referred to the Government's policy position. That position is well known. The Government's policy, as has been stated, seeks to encourage a diminution in the rate of smoking in this country. That was a recommendation which it took up from a committee of the Senate. The honourable senator referred to the very serious disease ulcerative colitis. I can remember that a text book published in 1940, which I looked at for historical interest, recommended that enemas of tannic acid were good for ulcerative colitis. I would imagine that that was probably highly dangerous for the patients. I am interested now that Senator Elstob brings in further antediluvian treatments, saying that smoking is good for ulcerative colitis. It so happens that in the specialty which I practised before coming into this place ulcerative colitis was one of the most serious illnesses. Whatever else does cure it, cigarette smoking does not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Elstob would know of the quite classical work of Richard Doll and his colleagues using cohorts of doctors as subjects which proves, I think quite clearly and statistically, that when those doctors altered their smoking practice their health status improved. Smoking is an individual question for people. We are not out to be proscriptive, but I am quite alarmed when the article in the British Medical Journal, which no doubt was published to promote scientific argument and discourse, is quoted as if it is so authoritative that all the other evidence which exists should be set aside. Smoking is harmful to health, a diminution of smoking is good for the community, and smoking still represents the greatest single preventable health hazard facing Australia today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For quite some months discussions have gone on between the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth Government, in which I participated, with the objective of replacing the existing oil fired power station at Stokes Hill with a coal fired installation. The present installation is grossly inefficient and of course in the long term will depend upon a fuel which is subject to sharply rising costs. I am happy to say that the two governments have reached full agreement and that the Northern Territory Government has expressed itself as very happy with the arrangements we have made . The effect is that in this Budget there will be a grant of $8.3m towards the cost of work in this year on the construction of a new coal fired power station at a site on Channel Island about 10 kilometres from Darwin. It is envisaged that the Commonwealth assistance will amount to about $124m at 1980-81 prices out of a total estimated capital cost of $310m for the new station. That is a very significant Commonwealth contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Budget this year also provides $56m for implementing an agreed formula for assistance towards the operational costs of the Northern Territory Electricity Commission. It includes a load growth factor of 5 per cent and the sharing between the two parties of load growth beyond that level. The formula also includes an agreed basis for calculating the movement of costs over the five- year period for the purpose of determining the level of assistance. The formula envisages that the tariff in the Northern Territory should be similar to the tariff in north Queensland. Knowing the difficulties of the Northern Territory, a reasonable comparison has been made. The formula therefore will give not only assistance by way of capital costs to build the station but also a long term formula of subsidy in the operation of the station. The Government appreciates the difficulties of the Northern Territory with vast distances, remoteness, difficulties in hauling the fuel and a relatively sparse population. I repeat that the Northern Territory Government has expressed great satisfaction with the arrangements.</PARA>

I must say that, as the Minister representing the Minister for Communications in this place, I have had a number of representations from Senator Reid on behalf of her constituents and I am grateful for the interest she has taken in this matter over a considerable time. What Senator Reid says is correct, namely, that a number of people, particularly those of limited means, have television sets which do not have a UHF capacity; and expense in replacing their present sets would be involved for some, who depend on television for contact with the world outside. The Department of Communications has advised the Minister that there are in the Australian Capital Territory no VHF channels which are readily available for the purpose she seeks. Because the provision of any such VHF channel would involve the displacement of another channel it may be difficult to do exactly what Senator Reid is suggesting. Any VHF channel that was chosen for multicultural television in Canberra would involve making changes to existing commercial and national translators in the region. Therefore, there is some difficulty in taking the course that the honourable senator seeks. However, I believe the Minister would want to know of her concern that some of her constituents may find difficulty in getting access to the programs because of this reception problem and I will undertake to pass the matter on to him for his attention.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer to the latter part of my question, in which I asked: If the Minister believes that an increase of $700m in the Budget deficit would force up interest rates, what sort of increase in interest rates does he expect from a Budget deficit of $1,600m?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The increase in the deficit is not $1,700m but rather some $1,200m. A $700m cut in revenue in order to provide income tax cuts would provide less than half, perhaps less than a third, of the income tax relief that the Government has extended in this year's Budget; it would give a very small cut indeed. I believe that a reduction of one cent in the 32c rate which operates at the tax threshold represents a loss in revenue of about $600m. That does not take into consideration the other cuts that have been made. My argument has always been that any substantial increase in the deficit would have the effects described. Indeed, Mr Hayden underlined the fact that he was talking of substantial deficits. I remain of that view also.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question, which is addressed to the Minister for National Development and Energy, by referring to the commendable initiative taken by the Government last night in allocating over $1m for the further development of the SYNROC technique, which was originally developed by Dr A. E. Ringwood of the Australian National University, in order to enable the construction by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission of a pilot plant to produce full-size canisters of SYNROC. Am I correct in recalling that some time ago the Minister stated that Australia was not going to store nuclear waste in this country? If so, does this initiative not indicate Australia's willingness to adopt an international role in ensuring that everything possible is done, scientifically and technically, to find the safest way of storing those wastes? Can the Minister elaborate on the potential for offering economic advantages relating to SYNROC, as was pointed out last night in the Budget document?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps, if Senator Walsh wants to do so, he might indicate his desire. The fact is that there is, and necessarily will be, great development in the world of the use of nuclear power for electric power generation. As a result, there will be in other countries the generation of considerable wastes and a need for its safe and safer storage. A borosilicate, which is a form of glass, is already used for containing and storing nuclear waste. It is believed to be highly stable and successful. Indeed, in a number of countries such waste is now embodied and stored in borosilicate glass.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia, Professor Ringwood of the Australian National University, as a result of research, asserts-and in this is supported by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission-that his product, SYNROC, will be even better than borosilicate glass in achieving these ends. SYNROC, or synthetic rock, is a stable combination of minerals similar to naturally occurring rocks which have immobilised radioactive elements in the earth's crust for millions of years. In other words, it is similar, even identical, to rocks which we know have been absolutely stable for millions of years even in unstable circumstances and which have impounded and contained radioactivity. The aim is to develop such a synthetic rock to contain wastes. It is understood that it would have a great advantage, namely that it would not be necessary to store it for 20 or 30 years as one must do with borosilicate glass for cooling purposes, but that, after being produced, it could be placed in the ground in inert areas such as salt mines in particular. It is strongly believed that it would be inert for millions of years. So the Government has put aside slightly more than $1m for research into this matter. It is one of the great opportunities Australia has to help the outside world with one of its major problems. I think all Australians would commend it. I repeat: We say this against the necessity for the outside world to use more and more uranium and therefore to produce more and more nuclear waste. That is unarguable. Therefore, I take it that everybody wants Australian research to be so pursued that we are able to offer to the world something that will add to the safety, security and health not only of this generation but of the generations of the future.</PARA>

The review is being carried out by a working group of wildlife officers and the results of that review will be considerd by the Ministers at the next meeting of the Council in mid-1983. I think Senator Mulvihill would agree that although the working group has been commissioned it does require some time to do this work and to bring its findings together.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the Fraser Government took office in 1975 there has been a progressive shift of the taxation burden onto pay-as- you-earn taxpayers, or wage and salary earners from non-PAYE taxpayers. In 1975- 76, the year of the last Labor Budget, 59.3 per cent of income tax, including company tax, was paid by PAYE taxpayers. By 1981-82 that percentage had risen to 65.8 per cent. If the non-PAYE taxpayers-that is, the Pitt Street farmers who dominate the Fraser Cabinet, self-employed professionals, speculators and others including those who are in proprietary companies-had paid the same share of tax last year as they paid in 1975-76, wage and salary earners would have paid $1, 700m less. If anyone thinks that that is trivial, or if any honourable senator on the Government side suggests that it is trivial, I remind them that that is more than taxpayers will gain in total as a result of the changes to the taxation schedule announced last night-which amounts, of course, to no more than indexation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1982-83 Budget has not arrested that trend, much less reversed the drift. On the current year's income, excluding the wildcat estimates and illogical figures on recoveries from past years which have been fabricated for the purposes of the 1982 Budget, the proportion of tax paid by PAYE taxpayers will rise from 65.8 per cent to 66.4 per cent. So if the same contributions had been made in 1982-83 as were made in 1975-76, wage and salary earners would be paying $2,000m less tax this year than it is estimated they will pay. That massive shift is partly due to deliberate Government action, through writing concessions into the Income Tax Assessment Act and opening up loopholes pursuant to those concessions, but it is mostly due to tax cheating, tax dodging, tax avoidance or whatever one likes to call it-the anti-social activity which Senator Withers assured us at the end of last month is indulged in by most of his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> This benign government attitude to the social cancer of tax evasion and the huge leakage of revenue which it entails will surprise those who are not familiar with the ethos and structure of the Liberal Party of Australia and the culpable negligence of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). On 27 June this year the Treasurer made a statement, belatedly wrung out of him by the embarrassing disclosures of the McCabe-Lafranchi report. In that statement the Treasurer admitted to having been told as early as May 1978 about so-called bottom-of-the- harbour schemes and the prospect of criminal prosecutions being launched. Of course he did have decisive evidence, as was shown in the House of Representatives yesterday and will be shown again by subsequent speakers in this debate, that there was scope from criminal prosecution long before 1978. But he admitted at the end of June that he was advised by the Australian Taxation Office that these schemes were in operation and that there was a possibility of criminal prosecution. Two and a half years later he got around to taking legislative action. More than four years later, after the disclosures of McCabe- Lafranchi, he threatened, and he continues to threaten, retrospective action. His 27 June statement should be regarded as as much an apologia for failure as was his Budget Speech last night. It was also a confession of what is at best negligence and what could conceivably be much worse. His excuse for not acting when he himself admits he became aware of these schemes in 1978, as put in his Press release of 27 June, was:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . public attitudes against tax avoidance were only in their formative stages at the time the schemes described in the Report were reaching their peak in 1977 and 1978. . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very well, I withdraw. What am I allowed to call him-Mr Howard? Mr Howard was saying in his 27 June statement that he took no action because the public was not angry enough. The public did not know but Mr Howard did. When action, or the promise of action, finally appeared from the Treasurer it was prompted not by moral outrage but by fear of electoral retribution flowing from the disclosures of the McCabe-Lafranchi report-retribution from the millions of honest pay-as-you-earn and other taxpayers whose earnings have been filched for half a decade by tax cheats with the full knowledge of the Treasurer and the Government of Australia. Of course, there have been gainers from this massive transfer of the taxation burden from honest and other than PAYE taxpayers to other people. Some of these gains have been quite spectacular. We do not know all of them. Even if we did, time permits a detailed discussion of only two or three of those gains. The identity of the gainers points towards the reason why nothing was done until all the dirty linen fell out in the Victorian Parliament in the McCabe-Lafranchi report; I should say until the sample of the dirty linen fell out in the Victorian Parliament. A very early entrant into what later became known as bottom-of-the-harbour-type tax evasion was a company called Stirling Court Pty Ltd, which was disposed of in 1973. Another was Kierad Pty Ltd, disposed of in 1977, some of the details of which may be found on pages 203 and 204 of volume 1 of the McCabe-Lafranchi report. In the case of Kierad, the dealer associated with Maher signed an agreement to buy shares in the company. Subsequent to the signing of that agreement an assessment for $203,000 was received from the Australian Taxation Office. The rights to buy the shares were then assigned by the Maher dealer to the sham director O'Keefe. Of course, there was obvious collusion between those still in control of the company at the time the assessment was received and the dealer, those in control of the company passing on to the dealer the information that the assessment had in fact been received and was payable, the rights then being assigned to the sham director O' Keefe. The report says in its summary:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In our opinion the inferences from the assignment are inconsistent with arms length negotiations having taken place. </PARA>
<PARA>The amount of tax evaded by the disposal of Kierad was in the vicinity of $1.3m. Why has no action for conspiracy, or any other charge, been taken as a result of that? At least a liquidator was appointed. That is one of the very few instances where that has happened, which raises other questions. But as to why no real action has been taken I suggest the answer can be found in the fact that the chairman and controlling shareholder of Kierad was one Syd Corser, immediate past chairman of the finance committee of the Liberal Party of Western Australia . There is a more spectacular case than Kierad-Treamog Ltd, reference to which again can be found on pages 204 and 205 of volume 1 and in the appendices to volume 2 of the McCabe-Lafranchi report. The chairman of Treamog at the time the shares were sold was one Denis Horgan. He was also the principal shareholder both directly, but more importantly through his control of Prindiville Holdings Pty Ltd and Metro Industries Pty Ltd. The shares were sold on 10 December 1976. The appendices to the report make it perfectly clear that as a result of the disposal of those shares $1.7m taxation liability on the current year's profit was evaded. Denis Horgan's personal share of that is in the vicinity of $750,000 . I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard two pages from the appendices to the McCabe-Lafranchi report which detail the financial affairs of the company Treamog at the time it was sold and afterwards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Horgan claims to have been an innocent bystander in the transaction, a claim which is about as credible as a prime ministerial election promise. It is not believable for at least two reasons. Firstly, at the time of sale the company was fully liquid. All of its assets had been turned into cash and its shares were exchanged for a cheque at the full face value of the shares without any allowance for the very large current tax liability and less only the discount paid to the dealer. If anyone is making a legitimate sale of a company, one does not turn all the assets into cash before selling the company. One does not sell a company that owns nothing but money. Secondly, while Denis Horgan may not have been aware of the precise details of how the taxation was to be evaded, he did know that a tax dodge was involved. He was an experienced businessman who would have been as aware as anyone of the fact that that company had a current year tax liability of $1.7m, but a cheque was exchanged for all of the cash the company had less only some $400,000 for the promoter of the scheme, the dealer. He knew there was no way that that company could meet its tax liability and pay him the price given for his shares. Denis Horgan is lying. He personally evaded in the vicinity of $750,000 through the disposal of shares in the way he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Denis Horgan is the present chairman of the Western Australian Liberal Party's finance committee. Thus both the present and past bagmen for the Liberal Party of Western Australia are massive tax evaders. Presumably as chairman of the finance committee they contributed to Liberal Party funds, as presumably Harry M . Miller contributed to Country Party funds when he was a fund raiser and public relations adviser to the Country Party, from which we could conclude that the Country Party was funded by money stolen from Computicket. But the Liberal Party is funded by money stolen from the Treasury of Australia. At least Harry M. Miller is now languishing in Long Bay. Denis Horgan continues to swan around the country and to hold the seven sinecures awarded to him by Ministers in this Government. Those sinecures are: Director of the Australian Industry Development Corporation, appointed in March 1981 by the present Treasurer; Director of Aussat Pty Ltd; member of the Australia-Japan Foundation; member of the Australian Manufacturing Council; member of the Advisory Council of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization; member of the Project Australia Committee; and a commissioner of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, appointed only this year. Following the disclosures of McCabe and Lafranchi and Denis Horgan's involvement in the scheme, the Prime Minister was asked at the National Press Club on 2 June what action he proposed to take regarding Mr Horgan. His reply, as published in the Australian Financial Review next day was:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser said individual ministers responsible for the public bodies on which Mr Horgan served should be asked about whether he would continue on those bodies and said the Liberal Party would have to concern itself with Mr Horgan's party position. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know what the Western Australian Liberals did. They not only kept Mr Horgan as chairman of their finance committee; they also voted nine to one to support the tax dodgers and to conduct an advertising campaign organised by W. W . Mitchell, recently described-accurately enough-as Western Australia's Goebbels . That is an appellation which is confirmed by the text of the advertisement published yesterday with references, among other things, to tax terrorism. </PARA>
<PARA> McCabe-Lafranchi also revealed links with another Western Australian Liberal, R . V. Garland, who used the services of a Melbourne solicitor and accountant, Collie and Sheedy, to strip his family companies in 1978. Collie and Sheedy provided the same services for the Horgan company, Treamog, and Collie, significantly, authorised an advertisement in Monday's Australian also opposing the proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It will not surprise anyone who knows those facts that the Western Australian Liberal Party acted as it did. As one very prominent Western Australian Liberal remarked a couple of years ago, the Liberal Party in Western Australia is controlled by a bunch of white-collar criminals who hide their real objectives behind a smokescreen of State's rights. </PARA>

I wrote to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on 2 July pointing out the substance of the McCabe- Lafranchi Report as it affected Mr Horgan and asking about his future as a director of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. I have yet to receive a reply. Yesterday it was more difficult for the Treasurer to avoid that same question in the House. The substance of his reply was that just because Mr Horgan had been named in the report, that did not mean that he was not fit to serve on the AIDC board. In other words, as far as the Treasurer is concerned, as long as someone is not actually in gaol it is all right for that person to maintain a government sinecure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Looking at the treatment handed out to minority shareholders in the McCabe- Lafranchi report, the question of directorial duty also arises.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a very serious matter. As usual, Senator Walsh has personalised it with abuse against individuals. I do not intend to deal with those particular matters in the way in which he has raised them. He has not shown with accuracy the record of the Government and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in particular in dealing with the matter of tax avoidance. There is a chronicle that I can give of action that has been taken over a long time with very great strength by the Treasurer against a lot of opposition from those who may have been described as the general public by Senator Walsh in the earlier part of his address. The Treasurer said yesterday in Parliament, when discussing the Government's proposed special legislation to collect taxation which was illegally evaded under the schemes covered in the McCabe-Lafranchi report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I assure the House . . . that legislation will indeed fall where it may and any individual, irrespective of the position that that individual holds, will not receive preferential treatment from the Government, as it prepares the legislation, or from the Commissioner of Taxation in his enforcement of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Treasurer's response to any of the allegations that have been made with regard to personalities in Senator Walsh's speech. There is widespread recognition in the community of the determination of the present Government to stamp out tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, there is recognition throughout the community that the Government's actions have been effective in stamping out these practices. The Government regards it as totally abhorrent and unacceptable that some people shirk their responsibilities to the community. One of the responsibilities of living in a modern community is that one pays one's way through the taxes, contributions and charges which the Government levies on all people under particular legislation which should be upheld and should be enforced. The Government's record in stamping out tax avoidance contrasts particularly with lacklustre efforts made by the Labor Government when it was in office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We did not have the legislation or the activity that we see from the present Treasurer to deal with matters that we now know arose in 1974. There were other people who held positions of responsibility then. The issue of tax avoidance really only started to gain public attention as a result of the publicity surrounding this Government's clampdown on paper schemes of avoidance, such as the so-called 'Curran Scheme'. From that time onwards there had been increasing community awareness of it. It arose directly from the attitude of the present Government to schemes of this nature. Public awareness grew as the very damaging revenue impacts of such schemes became more generally recognised and as the Government intensified its campaign against tax avoidance by making such schemes the subject of remedial legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is hypocritical for Senator Walsh to attack the Government when the Labor Party's own record in attacking tax avoidance and evasion has been so poor; in fact, it was negligible. In recent days we have had the new Labor Party policy on tax avoidance, and in view of the rhetoric that we have just heard-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The honourable senator may have all of those opportunities some time in the next century. In view of the rhetoric of Senator Walsh on this matter, it is extraordinary that the policy can be described in the Press as offering nothing to suggest that the Labor Party can do better than the Government. Indeed, the journal that is often quoted in this place, the Australian Financial Review, in its editorial last Wednesday, said that Labor's proposals in some areas on tax avoidance are naive. It is also absurd for Senator Walsh to complain about the burden of PAYE taxpayers when his own party effectively supports increasing the share of direct taxes in the overall tax mix . Senator Walsh may talk about comparisons between groups of shareholders, but if he were really worrying about the PAYE taxpayers, he would be looking at the level of tax that they have to pay. The policies which the Labor Party has pursued throughout its Federal conference recently and in other places would inevitably lead to a vast expansion of tax and a lot of burden that would be placed on the average Australian, in particular, the PAYE taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All the evidence is that the persistent attack on tax avoidance by legislation in recent years, particularly the introduction of the new general anti-tax avoidance provisions of Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, has had a signal impact on tax avoidance. Scheme promoters have publicly stated that tax avoidance is now dead. Their view is largely supported by comments from responsible practitioners also. For example, in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald recently, Mr Roderick C. Cameron, the national chairman of one of Australia's largest accounting firms, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax avoidance is now dead. I refer to avoidance (use of artificial schemes) as distinct from evasion (the cash economy). When are the media going to give due recognition to the achievements of the Treasurer, Mr Howard, in relation to tax avoidance?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cameron went on:</PARA>
<PARA> There continues to be widespread coverage of the avoidance of huge sums of taxation in past years in such a way that the public must believe that a major problem still exists. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cameron continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Extensive coverage given recently to the rather emotive remarks of Mr John Miller, the president of the Australian Society of Accountants, would have added further to that impression. The fact is that tax avoidance is finished. Mr Howard has had to overcome enormous problems, particularly those arising from certain High Court decisions in years past. The war has been won by the Treasurer and the public should be left in no doubt of it. Mr Howard deserves the highest praise. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of advice received from the Commissioner of Taxation, the Government has for the first time in several years made no allowance in this year's Budget estimates for leakage of tax revenue through tax avoidance. There should in fact be a substantial contribution to the revenue in 1982-83 as a result of this collection of unpaid tax in tax avoidance cases as a result of the Government's action in doubling the rate of late payment penalties and other measures that were announced on 10 August. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to action against tax evasion, three matters are relevant. Firstly, the Government acted in 1980 to make the evasion of company tax through so- called bottom-of-the-harbour tax evasion schemes a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to $50,000, or five years imprisonment, or both. Secondly, the Government announced on 25 July legislative measures to obtain from vendor shareholders payment of unpaid company tax from bottom-of-the-harbour strips of pre-tax company profits. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer announced that these measures would be extended to include recovery of evaded Division 7 tax on undistributed company profits. Thirdly, on the subject of evasion through the cash economy, the Treasurer announced in his Budget Speech details of a deduction-at-source system to operate from 1 July 1983 for payments for labour and services which are not currently subject to the pay-as-you-earn system. </PARA>
<PARA> Later I will seek leave to table a summary of anti-tax avoidance legislation enacted since 1 July 1977. This details a very large volume of legislation which has been introduced by the Government in recent years to counter specific tax avoidance arrangements. The list includes the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act (No. 2) of 1977, which dealt with deceased estates and companies; an amendment Act of 1978 dealing with bonus shares, trading stock schemes, tax rebates in respect of dividends which arose from modified dividend stripping, the denial of a deduction for gifts made under certain arrangements, and so on; the Sales Tax Assessment Amendment Acts of 1978; the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act of 1978; a further Act in 1979; that is, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act (No. 4); the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act (No. 5) 1979; the Income Tax Laws Amendment Act 1979 related to sections 56, 59, 59AA and 62. I could go on to 1980, when amendments were made which very effectively deal with many of the matters which have been the subject of some concern. Going to 1981, there are pages and pages of amendments that have been introduced directly by the present Treasurer to deal with many of the matters about which we are speaking today in this matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> In concentrating on the more sophisticated schemes, the media have perhaps not given sufficient attention to the enormous losses to revenue which can occur through the so-called cash economy. In this and in the Budget of last night the Government has given careful consideration to the most effective and appropriate way to deal with this matter. It has consulted industry representatives and organisations and has analysed methods adopted in other countries. The measures introduced in the Budget are aimed to catch those people who are not declaring income that consists of payments for labour and services. This system will be the subject of further consultation. By the time it is put into effect I am sure it also will be an effective scheme that will collect for the Commonwealth revenue a large amount that has been uncollectable because no system was in place to deal with this aspect. The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that something like $500m a year could be expected to be raised as a result of dealing with the cash economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; No, it is an omission of a PAYE system which did not deal with those who did not declare their income. It is a matter now of taxing at source payments made for labour and services that previously had not been part of a PAYE system through a person's employer. I believe it will be a very effective measure. It will deal with something that has been an important part of avoidance of the payment of tax. The Treasurer has stated that this new system will be seen as protecting contractors, the vast bulk of whom are honest, from unfair competition from those who are currently evading tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition to the measures I have detailed that have been the subject of legislation, set out in the summary which I will table, the Government has also introduced a package of general measures which are designed to foil arrangements which have the purpose or effect of avoiding Australian income tax. The first part of this package-the general anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act-is a most significant and far reaching measure. Another key feature of the legislation is the statutory imposition of additional tax equal to double the tax sought to be avoided on tax payers whose schemes are struck down by Part IVA. As I said earlier, it is because of this Government's active campaign against tax avoidance and the publicity it has attracted that the average Australian has become aware of the extent of the practice. This Government has done more to fight tax avoidance than any other government that has had to deal with matters of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> At Question Time today Senator Evans mentioned some statements that were made earlier. A number of statements have been made on the subject dealing with the advice that was available to the Government at various times. I wish to refer to the statement made by the Treasurer on 27 June of this year dealing with the McCabe-Lafranchi report, which was the result of the Victorian Government's inquiry into related matters. On page 12 of that statement the Treasurer noted:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, in August-September 1974, the Commissioner, through his Deputy, sought legal advice from the local Deputy Crown Solicitor as to whether the facts available would support a prosecution against any person under income tax legislation, the Commonwealth Crimes Act or the Companies Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Commissioner received this opinion in January 1975, and it was to the effect that on the material presented by the Commissioner to counsel, grounds existed for prosecution under Section 67 of the Companies Act and under Section 86 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and that proceedings could be instituted under Section 367B of the Companies Act. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 13 of that statement the Treasurer noted:</PARA>
<PARA> Discussions and correspondence ensued and in April 1979 the Commissioner received Crown Law advice to the effect that there was insufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of 'conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth'</PARA>
<PARA>That was part of the statement made by the Treasurer on 27 June. In his statement of 25 July headed 'Recovery of tax evaded in schemes to strip companies of untaxed profits' he referred to new legal advice on action against promoters. On page 3 of that statement he noted:</PARA>
<PARA> The Solicitor-General has now advised, in relation to a particular case, that action is available primarily against people other that the vendor shareholders under Commonwealth and State laws that offer avenues for recovery through procedures under the Companies Act whereby funds could be restored to the stripped company to enable it to meet the as yet unsatisfied income tax assessments that had been raised on it. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement goes on with further comment. A further statement issued on 17 August by the Treasurer headed 'Recovery of Division 7 tax evaded in company strips' shows a further determination of the Commonwealth to deal with tax that has been evaded in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that all the matters to which I am referring concerning the whole principle of tax avoidance show the determination of the Treasurer to do whatever is needed by legislation to assist the Commissioner of Taxation to collect tax. It ought to be remembered, as was stated by the Commissioner of Taxation yesterday, that the first and most important point to be made is that the revenue involved in such schemes has not been lost. The announcement by the Treasurer on 25 July that legislative measures would be introduced to obtain payment from vendor shareholders of unpaid company tax from these strips indicated that a substantial amount of the $500m-odd attributable to such activities prior to the introduction of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 would be recovered in 1982-83. I repeat that the Commissioner of Taxation says this revenue has not been lost. It will be recovered; it will be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point made by the Commissioner is that the Government has introduced legislation in the form of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 to make a specific criminal offence the kind of activity to which the McCabe-Lafranchi report drew attention. That legislation was introduced and passed through the Parliament in 1980. Since that Act was passed only isolated instances have been uncovered of continuing activity of this kind. Those cases are being actively investigated to gather sufficient evidence on which to bring criminal prosecutions and to expose participants in the courts. The Australian Taxation Office is continuing to raise assessments against companies that had been stripped before the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act commenced to operate. That action is moving ahead in a co-ordinated way to ensure that earliest effect is given to recovery of tax under the measures announced on 25 July. On an associated front, in light of the Solicitor-General's recent opinion, action is being taken to bring before the courts promoters and their associates under provisions of company law and criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA> By what I have said in detailing and outlining the statements that have been made by the Treasurer, and which are available for reading, I think it can accurately be shown that a consistent and persistent effort has been made by this Government to pursue those people who have been avoiding their responsibilities in the payment of tax that was rightly a debt to the Commonwealth. I would suggest that if we were to look seriously at what has been achieved and the way in which we have harnessed community opinion to support the Government in these measures, it ought to be said that the Treasurer, John Howard, deserves the praise of the community for his relentless approach to collecting the proper share and burden of tax throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying what I think the Treasurer said today in answer to a question. He was asked whether there was continuing concern in the community about tax avoidance, despite the Government's legislative program directed against it. He was also asked to what extent the legislation is proving effective in containing tax avoidance. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think probably the two most contemporary and best pieces of evidence of the success of the Government's campaign in this area are, firstly, the fact that I was advised by the Australian Taxation Office that it would not be necessary this year to make a downward adjustment in the revenue figures on account of tax avoidance losses, as has been done on earlier occasions. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, he drew attention to quite a bit of Press and other comment from legal and accounting firms, including some correspondence in the national Press from major accounting firms, indicating in very clear terms the success that the Government's legislation has been having in stamping out tax avoidance. For these reasons I would suggest that the wording of the matter of public importance is inaccurate and unwarranted. I seek leave to table the list of legislation that has been enacted by the present Federal Treasurer since 1977. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we examine the record of the Fraser-Howard Administration in tackling tax avoidance and related evasion, the most striking feature is the yawning gulf which appears between the Government's claims of achievement on the one hand and the cold reality on the other. The Government's orgy of self-congratulation, in which the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) has enthusiastically participated again today, is based on no surer foundation than the belief-a kind of Lewis Carroll belief-that if you say something often enough it must, some day, come true. But the trouble is, of course, that unless you really act instead of just talking, it never does come true. There is ample ground for suspicion, indeed conviction, that this Government has simply not solved the rampant problem, the rampant crime, moral and legal, that tax avoidance and evasion constitutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be that certain kinds of tax avoidance are now dead, to quote the overquoted Mr Cameron of recent times. That indeed ought to be the case, given the massive losses to revenue there have been and the extraordinary time it has taken since many of those schemes first came to public attention. But it cannot simply be asserted, as it has been asserted again by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle here today, that the situation is under control. It has to be demonstrated, and demonstrated by some kind of reasoned evidence other than the self-serving statements of the Australian Taxation Office which the Minister quoted at the end of her speech, and the even more self-serving statements of the senior members of the accountancy profession whom she also quoted. There is no such evidence produced. There is no such demonstration made in the Budget Papers which were tabled and presented to this Parliament last night. The closest we get to it is on page 249 of Budget Paper No. 1 when the information is given to us that there will in fact be a substantial improvement in the receipts obtained by the Treasury by one means or another as a result of effective measures against tax avoidance. But each one of the figures that are there set out lacks credibility, I would suggest, in one way or another. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, it is said on page 249 that there will be no revenue at all lost this year from blatant or artificial schemes. That is an extremely convenient assertion for a government to make when it is anxious to promote in the community an impression that it has in fact been successful in its barrage of legislation, to which the Minister referred. But that is not an assertion which can be accepted at its face value unless, as I say, it is accompanied by some kind of reasoned evidence to support it. Certainly it does not sit easily with the kinds of figures which have been produced in the whole run of previous years about the amount of tax that is outstanding or believed to be outstanding in respect of such schemes, and certainly it does not sit with the kinds of reactions I get making a quick trip around the legal and accountancy professions to determine what in fact is happening. The team that gave us Curran and son of Curran and dry Slutzkins and wet Slutzkins and all the rest of the exotic zoo of tax avoidance and evasion creatures which have reared their ugly heads in recent years is alive and well and waiting only for yet another demonstration of failure of will on the part of this Government to get to work systematically again in doing what it has been doing so well for so long, that is, ripping off the Treasury and ripping off the ordinary wage and salary earners of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The second figure that appears on page 249 of that Budget statement comes equally out of the blue. It is a figure of $255m which is said to be the estimate of the amount of money the Government will recover from its proposed retrospective legislation which, of course, we do not oppose-on the contrary, we support it-when it is in fact introduced. But given that the Government has not yet let us into the secret as to what the commencement date, backdated, of that legislation will be, and given that it has produced no data whatsoever to make clear the basis for that particular assertion about the sum of money claimed to be about to be recovered, there simply can be no particular credibility attaching to that figure, although I, for one, am prepared to believe that there are, of course, very substantial sums potentially able to be recouped in that area. But the oddest and really most implausible figure of all those that appear on page 249 is the figure of $615m which is estimated as likely to be collected this year as a result of the increase from 10 per cent to 20 per cent in the penalty rate applicable to the late payment of taxation. In that respect I cannot do better than to quote this morning's Australian Financial Review editorial, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> No reliance can be based upon the estimates of recovery as a result of anti-tax avoidance measures or of higher penalties for delayed tax payments. </PARA>
<PARA> For this latter category, the Budget papers provide the extraordinary estimate that in the current financial year an extra $615m will be collected as a result of the increase in penalty interest . . . . even though this will not be retrospective but will apply only from the date of passage of the appropriate legislation through Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>This figure is simply not credible without some evidence as to the details of amounts outstanding. I suggest it is very much incumbent upon later speakers in this debate, if they want to restore any shred of credibility to the Government' s case in respect of these sorts of figures that are being bandied about, that that kind of information be in fact produced. The reality of the matter is that when we read together the figures that appear in relation to the likely recoupment from anti-tax avoidance measures, we find a situation in which the Government is clearly trying to convey the appearance that those measures will generate some additional revenue return but at the same time they are trying to create an impression that there will not be all that much money to be gleaned from the operation of these measures because all the other measures which have been operating in the past have been so successful. The figures in themselves have no inherent credibility. They come across, they shriek across, to an observer, as the product of a manipulative exercise by a government anxious to make a political point but quite unable to make an accounting point or an arithmetical point that will withstand any kind of scrutiny whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> There is simply no reason to believe this Government when it claims to be operating effectively in the tax evasion-tax avoidance field. The evidence for that assertion that I now make is amply before us. It appears in the long record of failure to take quick remedial legislative action against various things that clearly demand and have demanded such remedial action. I will mention some of those delays in a few moments. It becomes evident in the extraordinary failure of the administrative side of the Government's tax collection operations as evidenced, for example, by the extraordinary delay that took place in chasing up those large numbers of people involved in the sales tax rort, particularly involving new cars. I raised this matter in the Parliament on 21 May 1980. On the information available to me it had obviously been known to the Government for a year or so before that. But the first raids which took place to bring this malpractice to a halt did not occur until a few months ago, in May 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The best evidence of all of the Government's failure to respond effectively-its inaction, its timidity, its pathological lethargy in these matters, as I said yesterday in referring to this subject-is the Government's own statement out of the mouth of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on 27 June in the context of the McCabe- Lafranchi report. My colleague Senator Walsh has taken us through some of the key elements in that saga. So too has Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle today, in reminding us, as I reminded her in Question Time today, that as early as January 1975 opinions were coming out of the Crown Solicitor's Division of the Attorney- General's Department to the effect that criminal action could have been taken then against those people involved as promoters, vendors and certainly as purchasers of the companies in question in the bottom-of-the-harbour arrangements. It was not incumbent upon the then Labor Government to take that any further because when that opinion was received in 1975 it was immediately referred, as it should have been, to the police for the further gathering of evidence. The police did not report until November 1976, after we were out of office, saying: 'Yes, there is ample evidence to support that legal opinion. You can go ahead and prosecute'. All of this is in the Treasurer's statement. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened? The whole thing disappeared into that limbo land of lost causes which has been constituted by the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury over the last six or seven years and nothing further happened. It was all put into the 'too-hard' basket. The saga of inaction continued. No criminal actions were brought and, as a result, while the Government fiddled, while Mr Brian Maher and his criminal conspirator cohorts prospered and while the revenue burned, nothing was done. The problem has been more than one of simple inaction on the part of the Government; it has been a failure of the whole legislative strategy the Government has adopted towards taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me spend the last few minutes available to me to speak on this matter explaining constructively, I hope, for Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in a demonstration that we are not simply scoring personal points in this matter but have a very serious policy point to make about the way in which the Government has been proceeding. I will explain very briefly what the Government's legislative strategy is, if it can be dignified with that description, and what by contrast ours is and why it is better. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose there are four elements in the Government's anti-avoidance strategy. The first is piecemeal legislation, which is essentially designed of course to close the stable door after a particular horse has bolted. The Minister, in the document she tabled, gives us a list. If it is the same table as the one the Treasurer was wavering about a couple of months ago, as I suspect it is, it will no doubt retail the 50-odd legislative measures involving 700-odd pages of legislation of a piecemeal kind that this Government has been responsible for. That is the first element in the strategy. We have seen lots of bits of legislation of that kind, most of them coming along two, three, four or five years after the horse in question has bolted, but they have come along and there have been quite a lot of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The second element in the strategy is the purported general anti-avoidance provision, the famous Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which followed the notorious collapse of section 260 through the iniquitous interpretations of the Barwick High Court of Australia, commencing, not in 1978, as the Treasurer would have us believe in his statement of 27 June, but in fact commencing that chain of interpretation back in the early 1970s and only finally dragging the section to a grinding halt in 1977 in Cridland's case. The third element in the Government's strategy, apart from Part IVA, are the criminal penalties that are involved in the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act of 1980 for crude evasion behaviour of the particular kind involved in bottom-of-the- harbour schemes and certain others of like kind. The final element in the Government's strategy- again if it can be so dignified with that description-is the use now of retrospective legislation, not as an all-purpose weapon for dealing with contrived, blatant, artifical schemes, but to be used in very exceptional cases such as the Government acknowledges exist, in its words, in the case again of bottom-of-the-harbour vendors. </PARA>
<PARA> There are obvious weaknesses in that four-part strategy. Let me say, as succinctly as I possibly can, what they are. In the case of piecemeal legislation, there is no doubt that particular remedial legislation to deal with trusts and partnerships and certain other problems which show up will go on being necessary. The Labor Party certainly accepts that and advocates that. Our proposed amendments to section 26A in relation, for example, to capital gains, is a demonstration of some of the kinds of piecemeal measures that are needed. But piecemeal legislation is no good at all to deal with blatant, contrived artificial schemes because one can only ever come in after the event. It is not a prospective solution that is needed when one is talking about blatant and contrived schemes; it is a retrospective solution. The kinds of measures that are writ large in the table that has been brought down by the Government today and incorporated in Hansard are simply not the kinds of measures that are calculated to deal effectively with blatant and contrived schemes. The solution for those, as we have said so many times in this chamber, is retrospective legislation, not just in odd and isolated cases when the Government steels its electoral nerve and takes the risk of doing so, but in all the cases which satisfy that description of blatant and contrived in the nature of the schemes involved. What is needed is: Firstly, piecemeal legislation; secondly, retrospective legislation on an across the board basis against those schemes which satisfy that description; and, thirdly-this is where we finally differ from the Government-a general anti-avoidance provision, not of the kind contained in Part IVA, which is a very draconian measure designed of its very character again to be effective against only blatant and contrived schemes and accordingly conferring very narrow discretions on the Commissioner of Taxation, but a proper re-write of section 260, the details of which we have spelled out on numerous occasions. I did it at length in this place on 11 June 1981 and I will not do it now in the 30 seconds available to me. But that combination of approaches is a rational legislative response and not an irrational one of the kind that the Government has produced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure I can say on behalf of the Government that it is very grateful to Senator Evans for the clearly well intentioned advice it has just received from him. I sat here listening with great interest to what he thinks should be the Government's philosophical and administrative modus operandi of approaching the subject of tax evasion. It has been very interesting and I am sure we will think very deeply about it. On the whole the debate from the Opposition has been quite a disappointment to me. I remind those honourable senators who still have any shred of interest left in them of what this debate is all about. Senator Walsh proposed that the following was a matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's continuing failure to take effective action against tax cheats and the oppressive burden this has placed on honest PAYE and other taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>A couple of serious issues are involved in that. The first one is an allegation that the Government has had a continuing failure to take effective action against tax cheats and the other is the statement that this has resulted in an oppressive burden being placed on honest pay-as-you-earn and other taxpayers. I rarely hear speeches that Senator Walsh makes, but I was interested to sit here and listen to him because I thought I might have to play some role in replying to it. However, there was nothing in his speech to reply to, except the question : Where are the Western Australian Government senators? I suggest that during Senator Walsh's speech the Western Australian Government senators were in the same place as all the Western Australian Opposition senators. They were not in the chamber. They were in the place most senators are when he speaks. They go somewhere else and do something useful. I certainly learned nothing useful about tax avoidance during Senator Walsh's speech. After all, it was he who raised the subject. I thought I might have learned something I might need to know as a member of the Government. I thought he might have had a contribution to make to this debate. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Evans did give us a fair run-down on things he has had to say in the past on the subject of tax evasion. He did congratulate himself-some might have thought a little inordinately-on how clever he has been on this subject. But it was, as I said earlier, interesting, and we will take it on board.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator says that this is schoolgirl debating. I would like to suggest that what I was getting from him was schoolmasterly lecturing-nothing terribly helpful on the subject. However the allegation of failure to take effective action against tax cheats and the assertion that tax cheating places a burden on honest pay-as-you-earn and other taxpayers is serious. We totally agree with the second part of that statement. People who avoid tax place an additional burden on honest PAYE and other taxpayers. I would like to say here and now, because Senator Walsh wanted to extrapolate from something that one of my colleagues said some other time, that I am an honest PAYE taxpayer, I do not have any other sources of income and I am not any form of tax cheat. Let us just get that straight. I identify very strongly with the second part of the matter of public importance, as I think most Australians do. It is therefore a little disappointing that the Opposition has chosen totally to leave out of this debate the subject of the cash economy. I am going to quote Mr Cameron again. Senator Evans says that he overquoted Mr Cameron. If one is to initiate debate such as the Opposition has here today I am sure it gets a little tedious when people keep on quoting Mr Cameron. I am very grateful that Roderick C. Cameron, the National Chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand of O'Connell Street, Sydney, wrote to the Sydney Morning Herald and had his letter published on Tuesday, 17 August, because I now have from a New South Wales source what I have been told by tax accountants all around my own State for several months.

Tax accountants have been saying to me for some time that the Treasurer, John Howard, has effectively killed the tax avoidance industry. I could have got up and said that today and honourable senators would have had to take my word for it. I hope they still do, because it is the truth. But it is very nice to see that somebody who has been saying this sort of thing to people for some time has actually put pen to paper and is prepared to go into print on it. I will read into the record just what these words are because they are worth noting and they are highly relevant to this debate. In his letter to the editor of the Sydney Morning Herald published yesterday Mr Cameron said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tax avoidance is now dead. I refer to avoidance (use of artificial schemes) as distinct from evasion (the cash economy). </PARA>
<PARA> When are the media going to give due recognition to the achievements of the Treasurer, Mr Howard, in relation to tax avoidance?</PARA>
<PARA> There continues to be wide-spread coverage of the avoidance of huge sums of taxation in past years in such a way that the public must believe that a major problem still exists. Extensive coverage given recently to the rather emotive remarks of Mr John Miller, president of the Australian Society of Accountants, would have added further to that impression. </PARA>

<PARA> The Treasurer will not make much headway in overcoming it without the active co -operation of all members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that includes members of parliament. Mr Cameron went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We should all resist making payments in cash (even if offered a lower price) and should not co-operate with those who obviously evade their responsibilities to the community in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to say: 'Hear, hear!' I could not have said better myself. They are exactly my sentiments. The much overquoted Mr Cameron, whom Senator Evans referred to, raised two issues-tax avoidance and tax evasion. He referred to tax evasion as the cash economy. The Labor Party continues to ignore and has ignored in this debate a subject that it raises itself-the tax cheat aspect of tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle gave a very comprehensive and very capable rundown of legislation directed against tax avoidance. Last night in the Budget Speech Mr Howard announced a very important move which is now to be taken by this Government-a move against the tax cheat who operates in the cash economy. All I can say to that is: 'Hear, hear!' It worries me that there are people in the community who think they are getting something cheaper because they pay cash and do not require a receipt when they know very well the person to whom they are paying cash for certain goods and services intends to pocket that money without declaring it as part of his income when the money was received through his particular form of endeavour and should have earned a tax liability. It worries me that people think they are getting things cheaper that way because they are not. They are paying through the nose for those goods and services. They are paying for them through the tax they pay week in and week out. They are paying much higher tax than they would have to pay if these tax cheats, the people in the cash economy, were paying their share of tax. We would all pay a little less if everybody paid his due share. But that is ignored by the Labor Party. For some reason it is a sensitive subject with the Labor Party. </PARA>

I think it should be pointed out that Mr Howard and the Government have been hindered in some of their efforts by certain rulings of the High Court . There was legislation and intentions of administration by the Government against tax evaders which were hindered because of rulings of the High Court. The High Court rules on law and it rules quite properly as it sees fit. But there had been an expectation by the Government that certain taxation schemes would not have operated until the High Court rulings were given, and that was a set back which had to be overcome. But to give credit where it is due, Mr Howard in particular and this Government have done a great deal on the subject of tax avoidance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to quote from a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 8 June, not by someone who has any stake, as someone might suggest in Mr Cameron's case, because he is a member of the Liberal Party. I have to say before Senator Evans asks me the question that I do not know whether the reporter called Alan Mitchell who worked for the Sydney Morning Herald as at 8 June 1982 is a member of the Liberal Party. But an article written by him stated:</PARA>
<PARA> ' ''. . . tougher federal legislation-including the sweeping Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980-has put the bottom-of-the-harbour, Slutzkin, trust-stripping and other paper tax avoidance schemes out of business.'</PARA>
<PARA> We have no knowledge of their current use at all'', says Mr Jon Kirkwood, a partner in charge of taxation for Ernst and Whinney, chartered accountants, when asked about these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> ''The use of bottom-of-the-habour schemes would be ridiculous risk for both the vendors and the purchasers'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that they are the words that have been used by a number of tax accountants in speaking to me. The article went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> ''As for trust-stripping, there must be very little left in this area and what is left can only be said to be very risky. </PARA>
<PARA> ''The Treasurer has made it clear that he intends to stamp it out and I would not recommend it to a client''. </PARA>
<PARA>A partner in charge of taxation for Ernst and Whinney, chartered accountants, is saying that the Treasurer has made it clear. The article went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bruce Fisk, a partner in Touche Ross &amp; Co., another large Sydney firm of chartered accountants, agrees. Asked if he believed the use of bottom-of-the- harbour schemes was still widespread, he said ''No. At least not in NSW. </PARA>
<PARA> ''Our experience is that tax avoidance in the form of paper schemes are not now available in NSW.'' '. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to confirm that the experience of tax accountants in Queensland indicates the same, and two out of two might indicate that it is the same in other States. I am sure it does. That seems to be the consensus. So let us give credit where credit is due. The allegation by Senator Walsh of continuing failure by the Government to take effective action fails on the evidence of people we must accept as objective advisers. We are not saying that all tax evasion has been overcome. Indeed, the Treasurer continues to move vigorously. But at least there can be no doubt in anyone's mind now that many tax avoidance schemes that were in existence a couple of years ago have been stopped, stamped out, eliminated; they are gone. Others that have since shown up are being moved against and will be moved against with the same resolution.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans took Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle to task for, as he put it, simply asserting certain things. He said they simply cannot be asserted as they were asserted by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle here today and apparently as we continue to assert, according to Senator Evans, that this is so. It can be simply asserted, Senator Evans, if the evidence is there and if those who know it say it and vouch for it and are prepared to put their name to it in writing, in public. </PARA>

In fact, it is interesting to note that on the real challenge of the subject of tax evasion Labor Party members are concerned only with rhetoric, not policies. Even those policies recently framed remain sufficiently vague to be raising more questions than they are answering. The policies of the Labor Party in relation to tax evasion are causing many people worry not because they think they are going to be caught out on something but because they do not know what the devil the policies mean. They do not know what the Labor Party's policy is. They suspect that it is going to turn out to be something else.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Dalai Lama must have been looking after me. Had I preceded Senator Martin in the debate no doubt I would have withered under her remarks of scorn which she directed at my two colleagues. But she did not manage to demolish the case that they have mounted. In fact, I am very pleased to follow Senator Martin in the debate because amongst some of the more outrageous remarks that fell from her lips was one that the Australian Labor Party has totally ignored tax evasion through the cash economy. In fact, one week ago-as usual the Liberal Government has followed the Labor Party in the tax avoidance and evasion area-in a public document circulated by Bill Hayden and Ralph Willis, widely reported in the Press, although obviously not read in Queensland, this was said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition Labor will take action in areas where tax evasion is rife such as the building and entertainment areas, by extending the PAYE system to these industries so that employers of contract labour are required to deduct tax instalments before such payments are made. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was clear, precise and concise. It is a warning of what will happen when Labor sweeps to office in the very new future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government stands condemned not because it has done nothing-it would be dishonest to claim that-but because what it has done has been done reluctantly and without that robust approach which should characterise any Treasurer attempting to defend the revenue against the greedy predations of tax bludgers in our society-those who want to subvert our society by creating inequity between taxpayers and permitting month after month, year after year, for too long the tax avoiders and the evaders in our society to get away with their failure to contribute to the revenue which is so necessary for the functioning of our democracy. The Government stands condemned, as I have said, for acting only by piecemeal legislation, eventually, after many years, culminating in the reform of section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. But always it has acted only after public anger has been voiced and articulated throughout the community and in this Parliament by the ALP, admittedly supported in part by the Australian Democrats. But it has been the ALP which has given voice to the cries of anguish of the ordinary taxpayers as they, the ordinary wage and salary earners, have continued to bear the cost of subsidising the failure of this Government to recover the billions of dollars which those who have been able to pervert our legal and accounting system to their own greedy ends have managed to avoid paying into the Treasury-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I could give three examples because I do believe in giving precise evidence to back my remarks in any debate in which I am involved. If one looks at the Government's recent actions and statements concerning its desire retrospectively to recover moneys which were not paid into the Treasury, as they should have been, because of the use of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, if one looks at the belated announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) that he will launch prosecutions in regard to those matters and if one looks at the staffing arrangements in the Australian Taxation Office which the Government has reluctantly made in order to ensure that it gives the Commissioner of Taxation the sinews of war that are necessary to win this battle, it will be found in all those circumstances that the Government has acted slowly and, as I have said, without that robust approach which one would expect of the Treasurer defending Treasury revenues against the greedy predations of these tax avoiders. One finds that the Government acted only after public pressure had been generated by the ALP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to special retrospective legislation that has been foreshadowed to recover moneys lost to revenue by bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, can any listener doubt that this complete and utter reversal of Liberal Party policy is in direct line with the policy that has been advocated in this chamber not for weeks, not for months, but for years by the ALP? It is the ALP which clearly and properly has said that society has rights to recover these moneys. Those who avoid their commitments must know that eventually when society identifies the highly artificial and blatantly contrived avoidance schemes which have been manufactured by their lawyers and accountants, the moneys which should have been paid to revenue will have to be paid whenever the transaction concerned was entered into. There is no doubt that the Treasurer has been forced to that position by public opinion led by the ALP. There is no doubt that fully retrospective tax legislation is the only means which will engender that fear amongst the promoters and benefactors of these schemes, such that will lead to their eventual demise from our society. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note what was stated on Tuesday in the editorial of the Australian Financial Review. This is not a radical journal; it is not well known for its aggressive promotion of social change in Australia. In respect of the matter of retrospectivity and tax justice the editorial said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . non retrospectivity of the tax law is by no stretch of the imagination an absolute moral or political value, . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the bottom of the harbour schemes the abuse of the tax system and the injustice is so gross that justice and fairness are on the side of retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Financial Review came to that conclusion a few days after the Treasurer came to that conclusion. The Labor Party has been saying it for years, and the public knows that this is right because it is fair. </PARA>
<PARA> As to prosecutions, does any honourable senator or member of the public doubt for one moment that the Government has decided to prosecute those who indulged in some of these tax avoidance schemes only because of the vigorous public efforts of Mr Cain, the Labor Premier of Victoria? It was Mr Cain who disclosed the substance of these bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. In May when these schemes were divulged to the Victorian Parliament, Mr Howard's immediate reaction was to say quite bluntly and angrily that he was not interested; he had not read the report; it was all dead 18 months ago. He has now been forced into the position in which he concedes that prosecutions may be launched. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans outlined the legal opinions which have been available to the Government for some time to enable the Government, had it had the political will , to undertake these prosecutions. It is also part of Labor Party policy that prosecutions and penalties will be pursued, not retrospectively. I must say that to make it very clear-</PARA>

What a pathetic spectacle that was. It is in relation to the staffing of the Australian Taxation Office that we see most clearly the failure of this Government to come to grips with the question of tax avoidance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate itself might be said to have taken something of a lead in this matter. It exposed last year the absurdity of the Government's stating that it was waging war on tax avoiders while at the same time, by resolution and adoption of the report of the razor gang, reducing the number of investigating officers in the Australian Taxation Office. Last October one of our own committees reported to the Senate on the Government's proposal to reduce staff in the Taxation Office by 167 persons. It was supposed to achieve a 'saving' of $1.5m to the Government. Senate Estimates Committee C investigated the matter, and I will remind honourable senators of its conclusion. It came to the conclusion that $46.8m could be recovered by the activities of those 167 officers in the investigating and audit fields who were to be sacked. In other words each of those officers, by dint of his expert and professional skills, recovers some $250,000 in revenue from the tax avoiders. This Government's bad faith was exposed by Senate Estimates Committee C at that time. In its report it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that staff reductions should not take place in the enforcement branch, and that steps should be taken to ensure that this revenue is not lost. </PARA>
<PARA>That report was signed by the Chairman, Austin Lewis. Senator Austin Lewis will follow me in this debate and will try to defend the Government against the Australian Labor Party's charge that it has failed miserably time and time again , until pressure has built up to provide the sinews of war to fight this battle against the tax avoiders. The Estimates Committee made that statement in October last year. Mr Hayden took up the matter much earlier, in May of last year. In other words, it has been a question of months of delay and procrastination on the part of the Treasurer, Mr Howard, which has been remedied, as I said earlier , only in recent months. It is true that now some of those staff ceilings have been lifted. In the opinion of many people there is still quite inadequate provision of investigating and field officers to undertake the sort of battles that need to be fought. It is as though the Government, in passing a myriad of legislation, was providing new weapons to armed forces currently engaged in some battle but refusing to send troops into the combat zones. In refusing to send troops into combat zones over the last four or five years the Government's legislation program is revealed for what it is-a matter of rhetoric. Until recent times when the pressure has become inexorable the Government has not done anything to bring about the demise of tax avoidance with consequent burdens on the ordinary taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The ordinary Australian people are not conned. The spectacle of Mr Fraser, the Prime Minister, last night handing out a few dollar notes as though they were how-to-vote cards is absolutely pathetic. Every recipient of his promises holds them up to the light to see whether they have that thread through the middle, the thread of authenticity. They do not trust the Prime Minister any more. Certainly this Government is not trusted by the general public to bring about a fairness and an evenhandedness in the tax reforms which are so necessary to lift the burden off the ordinary wage and salary earner. The ordinary wage and salary earner has known of the tax avoidance problem for years. For the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to suggest that the Government has led public opinion in this regard is actually an utter reversal of the truth. The cries of anguish of ordinary Australians, the feeling of unfairness which pervades society, the articulation by the Labor Party of those complaints, eventually penetrated even the hallowed fields of Nareen and some action has been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget that was brought down last night to my mind reinforces the view that the Government really believes that the income tax system cannot be made as equitable as it ought to be. The heavy impost by way of indirect taxation demonstrates to me that the Government feels that income tax is no longer a fair and evenhanded way in which to raise revenue. The move to increase tax savagely on cigarettes, petrol, beer, common items of every day use and enjoyment, and the introduction of new taxes on many items-this has not got out to the public yet but soft furnishings, curtains, blankets, sheets and other ordinary things for household use will be taxed indirectly-show that the Government has given up its hope to construct a fair income tax system. The Labor Party is dedicated to producing such a system, a system with progressive tax rates which will enable the ordinary wage and salary earner to bring up the family and to conduct his or her life in a manner which befits the dignity of ordinary Australians, without the tax bludgers of our society subverting their claims to a government program, properly funded, to bring about the sort of society we all desire. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tate, who preceded me in this debate, said that the people of Australia have a look at the dollar notes they get from Mr Fraser to see whether they have the thread of authenticity. Let me just say that under an Australian Labor Party government the people would not bother to look for any thread of authenticity in the dollar notes because they would not get any dollar notes from the ALP. They would not have to worry about looking to see whether the dollar notes were authentic. Senator Tate referred to a letter I wrote seeking additional staff for the Australian Taxation Office. I do not resile from the request I made at that stage, nor do I resile from any of the statements I have made since coming into this Senate about the need for this Government to catch up with tax cheats, who are referred to in the matter of public importance which has been submitted for debate today. It fascinated me to hear Senator Tate, with all his learned training, totally unable to relate his remarks to the genuine difference between avoidance and evasion. He was talking about evasion when he was talking about tax cheats. Then he started to talk about schemes that were clearly schemes of avoidance. He made no differentiation between them and I was surprised to note that a man as learned as Senator Tate was unable to make a simple distinction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me use some words which I happen to have picked up today: 'Tax avoidance is now dead'. Those are not my words; they are the words of Mr Roderick C. Cameron, a senior accountant in New South Wales. 'The tax avoidance industry is dead. Even if it were not retrospective tax legislation cannot be justified.' Those are not my words; they are the words contained in an advertisment placed by someone named I.D.S. Collie in the Australian on 16 August. The advertisement endeavoured to persuade my party not to go ahead with the proposal which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has announced to collect from the shareholders of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes the tax which they should have paid on the liquidation of their companies. 'Tax schemes as we know them are a thing of the past.' Again, those are not my words, they are the words quoted at a seminar in Geelong as recently as June 1982 by an accountant who was talking about tax planning. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid that I do not know his name. This tax planning scheme dropped off the back of a truck on to my desk. The name was not included. It is a very interesting paper. I would like to quote some parts of it, for instance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The use of tax schemes in the broadest spectrum became popular during the years of the Labor Government in the early 70's, and it is fair to say that only a smattering of tax avoidance took place prior to that time. Why was it that in the space of approximately ten years, an essentially honest tax paying community -a tax moral business and professional community-turned into a raving assortment of tax dodgers and avoiders, which is in fact what happened. it wasn't sufficient to reduce the amount of tax payable for participants-they had to have a total tax wipe-out. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that comment. I really do not understand what happened to the morality of this community during the period of the Labor Government. Prior to 1972 we had people who were prepared to save for their old age, to put away for their retirement, to pay their proper share of taxes, to live in this community and make their contribution to it. Then, from 1972 to 1974, the Australian Labor Party showed us the way. It got the Public Service of this nation going ahead granting itself all sorts of wages and privileges to which it was not entitled- leading the way under Mr Whitlam. The private sector had a good look, shook its head, had a second look and said: 'Well, we can do better than that'. In 1974 and 1975 the private sector of this community started to develop schemes, not only to pay itself retiring allowances and large salaries but also to pay these totally clear of tax. Seriously, I say that all this arose during the three years of Labor Government in Australia. The result is that we now have a community which lacks the morality, the moral fibre that it should have to make a genuine contribution to the society in which it lives. As a result, we now have a Treasurer who, in the words of this paper has to become like an Ayatollah to try to recover in some way the taxes avoided throughout the community. The paper states further:</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer . . . started making announcements in rapid fire to wipe out schemes as and when they became known of. In almost all instances the legislation which subsequently followed was prospective from the date of the announcement, thus avoiding retrospectivity. This has continued to the extent that it is fair to say the Treasurer has effectively killed the tax avoidance industry for the general taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Those words are supported by Mr Kieran Kelly in the Australian Financial Review of Monday, 19 April. Like Senator Martin, I am unable to say whether on 19 April Mr Kieran Kelly was a member of the Liberal Party-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Martin says, if he was, he is a man of good sense. Mr Kelly states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Make no mistake-1982 will be a very hard year for tax avoiders. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, Mr John Howard, has been quite successful during the past year in closing off some of the most exploited loopholes in Australia's much abused tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA> His achievements would make a Labor treasurer blush with pride. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting observation. Let me come back again to the letter written by Mr Roderick C. Cameron and published by the Sydney Morning Herald on 17 August because it really puts a nail in the coffin of this nonsense of the Labor Party. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to avoidance-</PARA>
<PARA>For Senator Tate's benefit, I note that Mr Cameron puts in brackets the explanation '(use of artificial schemes)'-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . as distinct from evasion. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the cash economy, Senator Tate. He has that in brackets too. </PARA>
<PARA> When are the media going to give due recognition to the achievements of the Treasurer, Mr Howard, in relation to tax avoidance?</PARA>
<PARA> There continues to be widespread coverage of the avoidance of huge sums of taxation in past years in such a way that the public must believe that a major problem still exists. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, there is no major problem at all. The tax avoidance industry is dead. What is still alive is the tax evasion industry. I hope that the people who are listening to this debate understand what it is that Senator Tate and the Labor Party are talking about. The tax evasion industry is synonymous with the cash economy, which is operated by people who do not declare income which they have earned. They may very well be the same people who are referred to in this paper as honest PAYE and other taxpayers, because in some cases they will be PAYE taxpayers who, during the week, work for wages and have their tax deducted then, during the weekend, work for cash and do not disclose that cash income, putting it in their pockets. Those are the people of whom the Australian Labor Party is saying: 'If you put us in government we will guarantee to collect the revenue from them'. How it is going to do that is not made clear. Again, it is simple ALP rhetoric. It is much easier to just say, 'We will do something about this' than it is to try to put forward some scheme as the Treasurer has done. Last night, following the Budget Speech, the Treasurer put forward for consideration within the community a proposal as to how this might be done. He has given people a decent length of time in which to consider and apply their minds to how we might best deal with this cash evasion, which is a matter of great concern to this Government. It is nonsense for the ALP to advance propositions that the Government has not concerned itself about the problem because the Government has given it great consideration. The amount of legislation that this Treasurer has brought forward has been incredible, especially when one looks at what happened during Labor's period in office from 1972 to 1975. All it could do then was say: 'Well, we know about Curran schemes but we are not going to do anything about them at this stage. We will be having a look at what we might do about them.' In three years in office it did nothing whatsoever about the tax avoidance industry , let alone look at the cash economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back again to the great letter by this gentleman Cameron, because at the very end of it he talks about the cash economy. Having said that Mr Howard deserves the highest of praise for what he has done about tax avoidance, he turns to tax evasion:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax evasion, however, by those engaged in 'cash' business continues to be a major problem and involves a vast amount of lost revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not know how much revenue has been lost but according to the papers that the Treasurer brought down last night the loss may be as high as $500m. Again, that was obviously an estimate. Mr Cameron states further:</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer will not make much headway in overcoming it without the active co -operation of all members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>That has reference to the morality about which I have been speaking. Unless the Australian community gets back some morality we shall make no progress. I am not talking about religion, spiritualism, et cetera. I am talking about pure, simple morality. I do not care whether the people concerned go to church, but surely they can adopt principles by which to live. That is what Mr Cameron is talking about here. The active co-operation of all members of the community is needed. Just listen to what he says:</PARA>
<PARA> We should all resist making payments in cash (even if offered a lower price) and should not co-operate with those who obviously evade their responsibilities to the community in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>I thoroughly support those words. I recommend their adoption by the Australian community. I think that we have had enough debate on this subject and I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the business of the day be called on. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This is a Bill to amend the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962</PARA>
<PARA> Recently the High Court of Australia handed down a decision in the case of Mrs Nancy Law v the Repatriation Commission. The decision was favourable to Mrs Law and reinforced the determinations and opinions that had been handed down in two previous Federal Court cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The broad details of the case were that the late Mr Law was a WWII veteran who had been a POW (J). He had developed a psychiatric condition as a result of his POW experiences. He smoked and died of lung cancer. The argument for his widow was that his psychiatric condition, in part at least, was causal to his smoking habit which in turn appears likely to have caused his terminal cancer. Therefore his death should be accepted as due to war service. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of the case are not the important issue as there are better examples of the adverse effects of war service on our veterans: for example, the disastrous effect of Agent Orange on Vietnam Veterans and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> The case of Mrs Nancy Law v the Repatriation Commission, however, gave hope to Vietnem Veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, this case had spelt out to the determining authorities what criteria they must adopt in their decisions. The determinations had gone into great detail to define the entitlement provisions of the Repatriation Act. Once again the value of the ''arisen out of'' provision (101 (1) (B)) in the principal act (Repatriation Act 1920) was brought to public attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Vietnam Veterans do not have an equivalent provision in their Act, the Special Overseas Service Act, it has been thought that they are covered by an equivalent provision-the ''Occurrence'' provision in Section 6 (1) of the Special Overseas Service Act viz: ''Has resulted from an occurrence''. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately this appears not to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Repatriation Commission has already appealed against a determination in Mr Kenneth Jacobs' favour on the principal basis that:</PARA>
<PARA> ''the Tribunal misapplied section 6 of the Act by treating the expression 'has resulted from' as if it were 'arising out of'.''</PARA>
<PARA> Other grounds for appeal are given but that is the substance of the case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious then that the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962 needs to be amended-and quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a major anomaly between the eligibility for repatriation benefits for Vietnam veterans who are covered by the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962 and the eligibility for repatriation benefits for WWII veterans who are covered by the Repatriation Act, 1920. </PARA>
<PARA> The anomaly arises out of the existence in the Repatriation Act 1920 of a section designated as 101(1)(B). This section is very short but it is of crucial importance. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Upon the incapacity or death . . . of any member of the forces whose incapacity or death has arisen out of, or is attributable to his war service . . . the Commonwealth shall, subject to this Act, be liable etc . . . ''</PARA>
<PARA> This section allows for the acceptance of a disability which can be said to have ''arisen out of'' war service. It is under this section that a condition may be accepted that has developed as a consequence of an earlier accepted disability. For example, a serviceman may have a nervous condition accepted as being due to war service, and later develops a heart condition because of his '' nerves''. The heart condition can then in turn be accepted under Section 101(1)( B), as it can be said to have ''arisen out of'' war service. Although war service itself may not have directly caused the condition, it is a sequel to another accepted disability. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators will appreciate that as Vietnam veterans get older, a decreasing number of their claims will be based on direct service causation and an increasing number of claims will be based on a condition arising as a consequence of an earlier accepted condition. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately the Vietnam veteran does not have this extremely valuable clause or an equivalent clause in his Act and so this highly relevant line or argument is denied him. He is thus surely discriminated against in in comparison with WWII veterans. It is a most inequitous situation. </PARA>
<PARA> For a Vietnam veteran the grounds of acceptance of a condition as being due to service lie in Sections 6(1)(4)(5) and (6) of the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. Broadly this is the equivalent of Sections 101(1)(A) and 101( 2) of the Repatriation Act 1920. </PARA>
<PARA> The grounds under these sections are far more restrictive, confining the acceptance of being on the basis of direct origin from an ''occurrence'' during his service. This, by and large, rules out acceptance of ''sequel'' conditions and diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this puts Vietnam veterans at a great disadvantage already in comparison to World War II veterans and as they get older and develop more ' sequel' type conditions this disadvantage will become increasingly marked. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that Senators realise that Vietnam veterans' eligibility for Repatriation benefits lies in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act and not in the main body of the Act, which is called the Repatriation Act 1920. </PARA>
<PARA> The two Acts are quite distinct and there is a major anomaly between them. This anomaly, which greatly disadvantages the Vietnam veteran as distinct from his World War II predecessors, can be rectified simply with the amendment I have proposed today. </PARA>
<PARA> This amending Bill which the Australian Democrats have presented to the Senate simply inserts an additional sub-clause viz. 'has risen out of or is attributable to his special service'. </PARA>
<PARA> The former clause 6 (1) which read:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Upon the incapacity or death of a member of the Forces whose incapacity or death has resulted from an occurrence that happened during a period of special service of the member (including the contracting of a disease during such a period), the Commonwealth is, subject to this Act, liable to pay to the member, to the dependants of the member or to both, as the case may be, pensions in accordance with Division 1 of Part III of the Repatriation Act as applied by the next succeeding section;is now amended by omitting this sub-section and substituting the following:</PARA>
<PARA> '(1) Upon the incapacity or death of a member of the Forces whose incapacity or death- (a) has resulted from an occurrence that happened during a period of special service of the member (including the contracting of a disease during such a period); or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) has risen out of or is attributable to his special service,</PARA>
<PARA> the Commonwealthis, subject to this Act, liable to pay to the member, to the dependants of the member or to both, as the case may be, pensions in accordance with Division 1 of Part III of the Repatriation Act as applied by section 7.'. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may now refer back to the Law v Repatriation Commission case, it is important to realise that the Law case has not opened up a legal 'loop hole' for veterans and their dependants to exploit. It means that the Repatriation and associated Acts are to be administered with the spirit and intent that always should have been the case but unfortunately were not. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the spirit and intent of the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962 was to put Vietnam veterans on an equal footing with World War II veterans. It has not turned out to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The appeal against Jacobs by the Repatriation Commission on the grounds I have outlined has shown this. It is important now that we legislate to put the spirit and intent into the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> My arguments to you are not based on legal technicalities but on the grounds of compassion and equality. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, Vietnam veterans served their country in a theatre of war-many of them against their will-just as did World War II veterans and I can see no rational reason why their grounds of entitlement should not be on an equal footing. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment will give equality to Vietnam veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Senator Durack) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening before the presentation of the Budget I was speaking on the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment ( Countervailing Duties) Bill, drawing attention to the closer economic relations with New Zealand which are designed to have a commencement date of 1 January 1983. I pointed out that this particular arrangement is being sold to the Australian people as an overall package which will be beneficial, not in each of its elements but as a package. One can appreciate the need for our two countries to move together in certain matters. One can also appreciate the benefits that will be derived from having a larger market-18 million people. However, I believe the relative advantages flow disproportionately to New Zealand. It effectively means that its market will be six times larger than previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did point out yesterday that, of all the States, Tasmania has the potential to be damaged most. This is the matter that does concern me. I also expressed concern that the level of debate was much more sophisticated and much more advanced in New Zealand than it was here in Australia. This is also a matter that concerns me. I join with my colleagues Senator Peter Rae and Max Burr in calling for an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry into this whole matter, not only to look at the economic aspects but to widen the general framework of usual IAC inquiries and to look also at the social implications, because of all the States, Tasmania has the potential to be most damaged. I refer to paper products, wood, timber and horticulture; I could go right through the whole list . About 80 percent of the items imported from New Zealand are also produced in Tasmania. I believe it would be a travesty of justice to allow such an important agreement to take place without some sort of inquiry. True, there is some level of public debate, and I have encouraged the setting up of panel discussions between producers in Australia and producers in New Zealand, but there is a flaw in this argument because no matter what sorts of agreements and understandings are reached between producers in the respective countries, unless we can tie up the merchants and marketeers they will drive carts through these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need for a comprehensive examination of this whole scheme. The New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement was very one-sided. Australian entry to New Zealand was restricted in so many ways. Import licensing has been a continual problem. So NAFTA had to come to an end; we had to have something better to take its place. We all appreciate that in respect of Third World markets Australia and New Zealand can work co-operatively rather than competitively against each other, which would force down the price. We see that in relation to meat products and we saw it last year in relation to onions in New Zealand. What does worry me, because of the market support schemes and the export incentives which are to be phased out over a very protracted time in New Zealand, is that New Zealand will be able to move in and capture Tasmania's mainland markets. These markets, once lost, will be very difficult to recover. We all know of the difficulties Tasmania, as an island State, experiences in regard to reliability of transport to the mainland and in keeping costs down. Our Government has done quite a lot to extend freight equalisation. In the event of a strike affecting goods that are normally carried by sea, freight equalisation will be available on a north and south-bound basis. But that does not overcome the problem that once those markets are lost they will be very difficult to recover. </PARA>
<PARA> The phasing-out period will be critical; it will be the time when these active marketeers from New Zealand will move in. Let us acknowledge it, they are far better than most of their counterparts in Australia, with the exception of those in the wool and wheat industries and probably the sugar industry. Let us look at the other industries; at the flow of imports of wood products, including wood pulp, and all the other things that are causing problems at the moment. Already we are reliably told that a major distributor in Australia has come to some sort of contractual arrangement for the supply of peas next year-we do not yet know the extent of it-with Waties-Pict in New Zealand. This is the thin edge of the wedge. Tasmania has the potential; its north-west coast makes it Australia's garden State. We could lose that advantage. I pointed out that the two potential growth areas in Tasmania are tourism and horticulture. Will we sacrifice these industries without even an inquiry?</PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about the customs tariff anti-dumping legislation. As far as most people in Australia are concerned this legislation is pretty hopeless. One has almost to be able to prove oneself bankrupt-it is too late then-before any recognition is made of the scheme. Are we going to wait for our industries- depressed as they are in Tasmania, which has the highest unemployment rate in the Commonwealth-to be further disadvantaged without any sort of major inquiry? It does concern me that the chief negotiator is about to retire next year, so we will put it in place and will not have to carry the can for some of the potential residual problems. Who is going to carry this can? The people of Tasmania. It will be the small industries that are affected. There has been agreement with some industries. I give a lot of credit to the dairy industry, which has worked very hard to come to some arrangement. Arrangements have been made with the wine and other industries. But there will be gaps because there are not always adequate panels and discussion has been left far too late. If the agreement has to come into effect on 1 January next year agreements will have to be signed well before that date. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told by the chief negotiator that we will introduce quick track anti- dumping provisions but, after inquiring what they were to be, we were told that some of the red tape would be cut by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch). What is the difference between these new arrangements and the previous ones that have proved so ineffective? It has really been quite a racket . The New Zealanders have brought certain textile goods from Asia, had buttons sewn on or some other minor alteration made and sent them to Australia under an incentive scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need is some contractual arrangement during the phase-in period. New Zealanders may believe they need this advantage over a fairly extended period after 1985, but we need some limitation on imports from New Zealand to protect our industries. At the same time we need a high ranking inquiry. Despite all the reservations I have about the Industries Assistance Comm- ission-I feel it has prejudiced employment opportunities in Tasmania in the past-I think at this late stage it is the only body that can effectively conduct such an inquiry within the limited time frame. The alternative is to defer the commencement date so that there is adequate time for inquiry and examination. We all know the world economy is in difficulty. To embark upon this sort of thing would put industries at risk in economically vulnerable States. The Callaghan Inquiry into the Structure of Industry and the Employment Situation in Tasmania said that Tasmania is beautiful, Tasmania is tranquil but Tasmania is economically vulnerable. Are we going to disregard these opening remarks in the Callaghan report and suddenly open up the industries of our State to this sort of unfair competition? We ask for fairness. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am frightened of is that if comparative advantages are seen because of New Zealand export incentives and support schemes some of the processors could conveniently move their operations to New Zealand and ship into Melbourne and Sydney at the cost of the growers in Tasmania. Despite the panel discussions between the growers in Tasmania and New Zealand the processors could shift. These are the things that we have to be somewhat concerned about. There has to be some sort of agreement at least to minimise the imports from New Zealand, certainly during the phase-out period of these export incentives which are so beneficial to exporters. They are so beneficial that some New Zealand manufacturers will disregard the local market and send their goods into Australia because it pays more. </PARA>
<PARA> We have problems and we have to make sure that we put into place quick track anti-dumping provisions and not just use a term which is flamboyant, which is meaningful to most people, but does not have substance. We have to put some sort of substance into this type of arrangement; otherwise many people in Tasmania will be in trouble. Tasmanian producers are concerned about this. I wish this concern would filter through to a few more people who have the responsibility to try to put this closer economic relations package into place. So many people say : 'It will be all right. You don't have to worry. We will look after that sort of thing'. It is time we asked for a deeper examination of some of those platitudes and what lies behind them. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned before, the track record of the New Zealanders exporting to Australia has not been good. What can this Parliament do about it? If major changes are not to be made to the anti-dumping provisions, changes will not come through this Parliament but will be a result of Executive direction. So despite what we might say in this place, if we cannot get an inquiry under way or any legislative action or agreement within either the House of Representatives or the Senate we will be presented with a fait accompli. There is danger to Tasmania and I believe Tasmanians should stand up for their State to make sure that there are adequate safeguards. At least let us have an inquiry so that we can ease our consciences. I believe it would be irresponsible if we Tasmanians representing one State did not put our State ahead of some future overall package. That offers more benefits to New Zealand. The New Zealand Government is staking its political life on this. It is talking about the big benefits that will flow to New Zealand. True enough, there will be benefits, but at whose expense? If they are to be at the expense of Tasmania I will not have a part of them. If we do not stand up now all the things we have said in the past will be just mere rhetoric. Time is running out and we have to take some sort of action. I draw this matter of concern to the attention of the Senate and I invite the participation of all Tasmanian senators at least. I applaud Senator Peter Rae, Max Burr and others who have expressed their concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment ( Countervailing Duties) Bill gives Australia power to retaliate against our major trading partners in the event that they use unfair and unscrupulous tactics against exports from Australia to their countries. To the degree that this Bill gives us some additional power in this area in a very restrictive field, the Australian Democrats support it. We support the fact that Australia is prepared to stand on its dignity and to negotiate in a bilateral way with its major trading partners. The Australian Labor Party has said that this Bill embraces the much wider issue of our general trading policy. I agree that it does. I believe it is now urgent for our country to have a fundamental look at how we are conducting our trading negotiations with our trading partners. The Labor Party has said that the Government should devise a more consistent and responsible trade policy in line with the principles of the multilateral trade negotiations and the ideals of the Kennedy and Tokyo rounds of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I want to query that cosy little suggestion. Is it in Australia's interest to talk about trading relationships on the basis of multilateral principles or should we be more concerned with a bilateral approach ? Should Australia not look at its trading association on a country to country basis?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill arose because we were concerned that the export of Australian lamb to the United States of America was being discriminated against. The Australian Government objected. The matter was settled amicably, but only because we threatened to introduce countervailing duties in Australia. In other words, when we stood up for our rights something was done. A stronger approach to bilateral trade means that we can talk about a quid pro quo. When Australia is a party to a multilateral trade negotiation, it is far too easy for its voice to be swamped by the attitudes and points of view put forward by much larger and more powerful trading countries. Australia has a very important trading relationship with Japan. Why can we not say to the Japanese. 'If we are to allow more Japanese cars into this country, why will you not allow more of our beef, for example, to be exported to Japan?' There should be some give and take on a country-to- country basis. </PARA>
<PARA> We tend to look on our trading arrangements as a matter of principle. We are all too ready to squander our hard-earned foreign currency on the altar of some principle which we may call one day free trade, or some other such principle. In the hard cold world of trade, most countries do not talk about principles; they look on trade negotiations as a matter of hard business negotiation, and we should do the same. Many years ago I happened to be sitting in the Visitors' Gallery of the House of Commons. I was amazed to sit there for a whole afternoon while important British parliamentarians debated whether they should drop the tariff or excise on Spanish sherry by a few pence per gallon. That would not seem to us in Australia, I am sure, to be a very important matter. It occupied the British Parliament for a whole afternoon. Its members wanted to know, if the tariff on Spanish sherry was dropped by a penny and that represented to Spain an additional market of X million British pounds, what Britain, as a trading nation , would get in return. It was the principle of a quid pro quo, and it concerned the British Parliament. I suggest that this approach with our major trading partners should concern the Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter has arisen in the case of exports of our primary products to the United States. I ask the question: What about unfair practices that are all too frequently applied against our exports of manufactured goods to countries such as the United States? I cite an example. A very large Australian manufacturer negotiated an important contract to supply to the United States turbine blades for aeroplane engines. It negotiated it fairly. Its quality was thoroughly investigated. Its price was satisfactory. The contract was drawn up. The ink on the pen was wet. The contract was about to be signed. Suddenly the American Government said, 'Halt'. Some lobbyist had said, 'We can make these blades in the United States. Why should we be buying them from Australia?' The 'Buy American' Act was imposed against Australia and that contract was never consumated. These sorts of things apply in most trading countries. The Japanese have all kinds of non-tariff mechanisms to limit, to stop or at least to control the flow of imports into their country. They have these mechanisms for a very good reason. They are concerned about hard earned foreign currency. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's trading account is in a critical situation. Our balance of paymens blew out this year by $8 billion. That means that we spent on imports $8 billion more than we earned from our exports. This deficit was covered by the inflow of foreign capital. One wonders how long we can continue to attract this inflow of foreign capital. Certainly it means that to keep trading in this way we must maintain very high rates of interest in Australia, at least comparable with those in the United States. This Bill raises the basic question of how Australia should trade-whether we are going about our trading negotiations in a businesslike way, whether we are prepared to negotiate as other countries negotiate, taking into account the cold hard facts of life, or whether we are too ready to drop tariffs and to spend our foreign exchange without getting anything in return. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Government will look to this area. We commend this Bill. It is a step in the right direction. It undoubtedly raises the question of multilateral negotiations as opposed to bilateral negotiations. Australia has important exports to sell. Countries need them. We are in a powerful position to exert our rights as a trading nation. I hope that in future the Government will look at this area in a much more forthright and realistic manner and that we shall not be talking principles while our trading partners laugh all the way to the bank. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to support the Customs Tariff ( Anti-Dumping) Amendment (Countervailing Duties) Bill 1982, I take up a matter to which Senator Watson referred, which may not be strictly and closely related to the Bill but is the subject matter akin to it. That is the development that is taking place concerning closer economic relations with New Zealand and the fears which have been expressed by many people that the negotiations for closer economic relations, which are to the considerable advantage of New Zealand and of some Australian industries, are potentially to the considerable disadvantage of some other Australian industries, many of which are located in Tasmania. I would not wish to take time in developing in detail again what Senator Watson has very ably put to the Senate, but I want to emphasise the point that the potential damage to Tasmania of the unfortunate or unanticipated results of the development of closer economic relations with New Zealand is higher to that State than to any other. It is far higher and far more potentially serious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look back at the history of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement, and some of the steps taken under that agreement and some of the industries damaged as a result of it. Let us consider the length of time that was necessary. As Senator Watson said, one had to file one's bankruptcy petition before one could prove that one would be adversely affected and therefore one was entitled to special consideration and review. In view of that, we cannot approach with total equanimity the negotiations which have taken place and some of the assurances that have been given. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past I have asked certain questions about this matter. I have an answer to a question which I asked on 16 February of this year. To save the time of the Senate I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard as part of my speech today the question which I asked and the answer which was given. I believe honourable senators can see some of the points made from that. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The question and answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sir John Carrick: On 16 February 1982, Senator Rae asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, the following question, without notice:</PARA>
<PARA> What research work has been undertaken to assess which industries and which areas in Australia will be most adversely affected if the closer economic relations with New Zealand proposals go ahead? If such work has been undertaken, what are the results and will they be made available? If the work has not been undertaken, will the Minister put to his colleague a suggestion that the work should be undertaken before any further discussions take place with New Zealand?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with guidelines contained in the Joint Comminuque issued by the Australian and New Zealand Prime Ministers in Wellington in March 1980, officials on both sides have undertaken a series of studies on methods and detailed arrangements by which the two governments might proceed to implement progressive moves towards a closer trans-Tasman economic relationship (CER). </PARA>
<PARA> A report by official, was presented to the two governments early in 1981. The report contained the basis of possible new trading arrangements, including those for the gradual and progressive elimination of tariffs and quantitative restrictions and measures to ensure fair competition in trans-Tasman trade. The report indicated that officials had established a broad area of common ground. However, as confirmed by the Minister for Trade and Resources in discussions with Prime Minister Muldoon and other New Zealand Ministers in May 1981, differences of view remained in respect of a number of issues which are seen as fundamental to any new agreement. These include the setting of a firm date for the ultimate elimination of quantitative restrictions between the two countries, the future of performance-based export incentives in trans-Tasman trade, the position of dairy products under a CER, and sensitive horticulture issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Officials have continued to study these and other outstanding questions, and as appropriate consultations have taken place between Australian and New Zealand industry groups including the two dairy industries. Senior officials meetings are to be held in April, as preparation for early Ministerial level negotiations aimed at reaching agreement on a CER package which could then be submitted to the two governments for final decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Several of the issues identified for study by the Prime Ministers reflected recognition of the fact that further liberalisation of trans-Tasman trade could have unfair adverse impact on certain industries in each country given differences in the nature and extent of agricultural support/ stabilisation arrangements, export incentive schemes and tariffs applied against third countries. It was also necessary to take account of such factors in devising possible new trading arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Any assessment of the potential impact of a CER on Australian industries needs to have regard to features of the trading framework that has evolved under NAFTA . Under existing arrangements, imports from New Zealand enter Australia either free or at very low rates of duty. New Zealand exporters also have the benefit of generous performance-based export incentive arrangements. On the other hand, many Australian exports to New Zealand face duties which are generally higher and are further restricted by import licensing. Under an appropriately structured CER, these and other factors contributing to inequality of trading opportunity and unfair competition would be gradually removed. The proposed new arrangements would have, as their primary purpose, the elimination of imbalances in opportunity confronting Australian producers in trans-Tasman trade. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not expected that any Australian industries would be adversely affected at the outset of a CER. However, over time it could be expected that some rationalisation and restructuring of industry would occur with the removal of trade barriers leading to increased trade and competition between the two countries. However the gradualism inherent in CER mechanisms should ensure that any adjustment pressures in either country can be accommodated. Overall, such pressures are unlikely to be of major significance when compared with those occurring within the domestic economy and as a result of Australia's trade with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that consultations with State Governments and interested industry organisations have been held at key stages in the CER exercise. The Government is committed to making public the proposed new arrangements and consulting fully with interested parties before final decisions are taken. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst I accept what was said in that answer, that is, that there have been forms of inquiry and consultation, I do not know that there has been anything of the nature of an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has done an occasional paper on the comparative efficiency between Australian and New Zealand dairy industries and the implications for trans-Tasman trade. There is information in that paper which does nothing to reduce the concern I express. That is one of the papers which is of some benefit, but when one tries to find published information in relation to the work that has been done, which was referred to in the answer to my question, one finds it very hard to locate a real examination of the extent to which certain industries in Australia may be damaged by the developments and, if so, which industries they are and where they are located. That is expressly what I tried to get an answer to in my question. First of all I received a non-answer. I then put the question on notice and asked, if I was not going to get an answer , whether I could have a reason for not getting one. I received an answer which certainly did not allay my fears.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned about matters that have been subject to continuing discussion, such as the length of time which the New Zealanders propose will be taken before the removal of export incentives. I am concerned, as Senator Watson was about the complete destruction of Australian, and particularly Tasmanian, producers and manufacturers which could take place during the period when the New Zealanders are able to export on to the Australian market with a very clear competitive advantage. In other words, it is not that we object to competition; from past history we fear that the competition will not be fair. We are concerned to ensure that there is adequate and public inquiry in relation to the potential effects on Tasmanian industries of going ahead with the proposed terms of the new closer economic relations provisions. I do not want to be taken as saying that I do not think closer economic relations with New Zealand is a good thing. I support the negotiations which have taken place, but I do not think we ought to be adopting this position blindly. I do not think we ought to be doing it without satisfying ourselves and the people of any State that is likely to be affected in the most detailed way possible that there has been adequate inquiry, adequate consideration, and that adequate provision will be made to ensure that some people do not have to carry the cost of the development. I support the call for an IAC inquiry, which has been developed very ably by Senator Watson and has been referred to by the honourable member for Wilmot, Mr Burr, in the House of Representives. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to speak briefly in relation to the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all honourable senators for their support of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment (Countervailing Duties) Bill. As is very often the case, the Bill has been used as a vehicle to discuss issues which are adjacent to the Bill rather than central to its operation, but that is an important part of debate in this place. The points raised by two Government senators who spoke, Senator Watson and Senator Peter Rae, related to their concerns about the possible effect of the closer economic relationship between Australia and New Zealand on industries which are important in Tasmania. That is a contribution to the debate which I have no doubt will be of interest to my colleague the Minister for Trade and Resources, Mr Anthony, who has the conduct of this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can perhaps allay some of the fears of the honourable senators by pointing to the very long period of detailed discussion which has already occurred and which led to proposals being tabled in June of this year to enable further discussion and consultation to take place. The proposals were released on 4 June and the Government set aside two months for public comment. No commitments have been entered into at this stage and no substantive decisions have been taken or will be taken on the package until public examination of the proposals has been completed. The results of this examination will be fully taken into account in the Australian Government's consideration of what future action should appropriately be taken on the matter. The contribution of the two honourable senators will certainly be drawn by me to the Ministers' attention so that all of these matters can be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I do have some advice on the possible benefits which can flow through to the Australian industries from the removal of some of the present export incentives which are available to New Zealand producers. I do not think it is my place to go into detail on this now, but rather that I should refer the matter away and see that it receives consideration at Government level. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Siddons also made a contribution which touched on our whole conduct of trade policy. He is concerned that we should base our policy more on bilateral relationships than on a multilateral approach. Again, that is a matter of some interest. The fact is that Australia, whilst it is a very important trading nation and a country which has a very large part of its economy tied up with trading, is not among the most powerful trading nations in the world. I understand that there are some deficiencies in our multilateral trading system, and we are working to overcome those deficiencies. It would be a mistake-I doubt that Senator Siddons would really be advocating this-to abandon completely the multilateral arrangements which serve Australia well in many circumstances and which operate in our interests. So again I would simply acknowledge the points which have been raised by Senator Siddons. I undertake to see that they are drawn to the attention of Mr Anthony, who is the Minister responsible in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans made a very brief speech, which might be copied in this place more often. Indeed, it was not an unusual speech. It referred to the fact that the arguments had all been put in another place and he did not propose to repeat them. I wish to emulate his brevity on this occasion, although I would not want to emulate his usual brevity! To some extent the points made in the other place by the honourable member for Parramatta, Mr John Brown, have been overtaken by events since the Bill was debated. I do not think we need to go into any great detail for the simple reason that there is unanimous support for this Bill. I thank the Senate for that and I commend the Bill for a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, could we have some indication about what stage we are at in respect of the Fertilizers ( Subsidy) Amendment Bill? I appreciate that we are dealing with the Bill in Committee but it will be recalled that at the time the Senate rose in June we were in a somewhat difficult position because there was some difference between the view of the Senate and the view of the House of Representatives. As I understand it, the House of Representatives has subsequently decided to submit the Bill for reconsideration by the Senate and has made certain amendments in respect of this legislation. Really, I think the Senate needs to be advised as to what actually is before it for its consideration now; whether it is a fresh piece of legislation from the House of Representative or whether we are back to the debate which was adjourned. In the controversy that followed that consideration, it was deemed that the Senate had failed to pass the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us a Bill which would permit the payment of bounty from 1 July this year. The Government has checked the position. The Bill is still before the Senate and the Government is seeking its passage through the Senate to enable the bounty to be paid. The Government has considered the matters which were raised in the previous debate but believes it appropriate for the Bill to be passed in the form in which it was introduced in the Senate, that is, containing the amendments which were moved and carried in the House of Representatives. As I understand it, there may be some further debate in the Committee stage but the Bill is likely to have passage in that form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot prejudge what honourable senators opposite will do and what stance they will take, but from talking to the representatives of the Australian Democrats and the representative of the Opposition, Senator Walsh, I understood that we would be dealing with it, he would be moving an amendment which he understood not to have the support of the Democrats, the Democrats would be raising a matter in Committee and the Bill would therefore be likely to secure a passage. I say all that with some diffidence. The Government is anxious to see this Bill passed so that any doubts about payment of the superphosphate bounty can be laid to rest. I understand that really would be the wish of the Democrats and the Opposition now, but I am not sure of that. I would invite them to clear that position with the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has, I think, made the position clear. I would now like to raise three points for the Minister's response. First, could the Minister clarify for the Senate the context of what will now be a subsidy as from 1 July? The Bill mentions 1 July and on my understanding there will have been no interruption whatsoever in the payment of the subsidy. Could the Minister inform the Committee of the exact status of the period from 1 July to the period when this Bill is given royal assent?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, on our rather torrid last day, I had circulated an amendment, which I do not intend to proceed with. But I do want to raise the substance of that amendment. The amendment was an identical clause to a clause contained in the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Amendment Bill. Basically, it imposed an obligation upon the Government to look at dumping of nitrogenous fertilisers, in this case the dumping of phosphatic fertilisers in Australia. I believe that one of the strengths of the rural industry's case has been its consistent stance that it has been able to argue in overseas forums that it is seeking not to allow the dumping of products and therefore itself would be unwilling to engage in that practice, or to promote the dumping of inputs to those products. I believe that by continuing that very rigorous, hard-headed approach in international forums, the industry does need to rely upon the Government to make quite clear to our trading partners, particularly those we are concerned with in terms of our rural exports, that we will not countenance that type of operation which has led to what now has grown, since even our last discussion, to be an enormous stockpile, particularly in Florida, which could very easily be dumped in Australia. I would flag the possibility that the Australian Democrats have been looking at, that is, the parent legislation under the customs tariff anti- dumping legislation. We have been looking at an amendment to that legislation to see whether some obligation may be placed upon the Government-quite apart from the legal capacity of the Government to involve itself in these matters-as is imposed in the nitrogenous fertilisers Act to actually make sure that that type of dumping does not go ahead. I wonder whether the Minister would like to respond to that point also. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I raise is something that the Minister referred to on the last occasion he was speaking in relation to this matter. Since that time we have had a report from the Department of Home Affairs relating to Christmas Island. Could the Minister indicate whether since the tabling of that report the Government has any response, particularly to that part of the report which talks about the exports of phosphate products, being a leading sector of the Christmas Island economy, in the foreseeable future? Could Senator Chaney also indicate whether the Government, having now had the opportunity to consider that report, in the period since we last discussed this matter, in some way wishes to amplify the points that he himself made in the previous discussion on this matter?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to the question of dumping, I think the point was made on the last occasion that this matter was debated that it is the Government's view that this industry, like others, should follow the procedures which have been established for seeking assistance against import competition. In other words, it wishes the industry to avail itself of the normal processes of inquiry and so on as the standard means which has been adopted to ensure that protection is provided only in appropriate cases. Manufacturers are, of course, free to seek increased assistance against import competition and normally levels of assistance would be determined by Government in the light of reports and recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission or, in the case of a request for temporary protection, by the Temporary Assistance Authority. Both of those procedures provide for public inquiries into the question of protection of the goods concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Concern has been expressed tonight by Senator Macklin about the possibility of dumping, given the general condition of the world market and the large stocks which are available in Florida and elsewhere because of the downturn in the market. This industry is able to avail itself of the same anti-dumping protection as any other industry, which means it is entitled to approach the Department of Industry and Commerce with a request that anti-dumping measures be taken. If the claims of dumping were found to be sustained then dumping duties could be levied. Those provisions also provide for the imposition of cash securities when the danger of material injury is imminent. Obviously the Government would be concerned to see dumping in this area, as in any area. </PARA>
<PARA> During Question Time today I acknowledged that the incidence of allegations of dumping had increased. I think there are 63 cases before the Department at the moment; a significant increase on the number for the same period last year. The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) advised me that he would be paying very careful attention to the availability of adequate resources in that area. The Government would see that mechanism as being available and appropriate for the protection of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point raised by the honourable senator related to payments. As was indicated in the debate in the Senate in May, the failure to pass the Bill gave rise to an interruption in the payments which were made under the expired legislation. The passage of this legislation would enable retrospective payments to be made. In other words, it would enable the situation to be remedied. Manufacturers would need to provide details of sales-quantities, prices and so on-since 1 July 1982. I am advised that manufacturers have maintained adequate records of sales since 1 July 1982 in anticipation of legislation being passed. The Department will, on the passage of this legislation, pay manufacturers a subsidy based on the information provided and will ensure that the subsidy is passed on to puchasers. So it does now lie within the capacity of the Senate to remedy the difficulty which the adjournment of this legislation gave rise to, and I trust that the Senate will follow that course. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sweetland report on the Commission of Inquiry into the Viability of the Christmas Island Phosphate Industry has not yet been considered by Cabinet and there are matters still requiring to be dealt with by the Government. I am not in a position to advise the Senate in any definitive way of our response to that report, so I am not able to assist the honourable senator with respect to the third inquiry he has made in Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendments, as they appear, do not make a great deal of sense because they cannot be read in isolation. However, their effect quite simply is to continue the payment of the phosphate bounty in the form which has existed for almost all of the past 20 years. They seek to restore the Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill 1982 to its original form when it was introduced into the House of Representatives in April this year. The Opposition's amendments seek to undo the amendments which the Government introduced at the eleventh hour on the Wednesday prior to the House of Representatives adjourning to enable the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) to take off on his second-last overseas junket. The effect of restoring the Bill to its original condition would be to enable the assistance to continue to be paid in the form of a bounty instead of a subsidy. The significance of that is that it would not be available on imported material. I will go into the reasons for that in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter has been the subject of a great deal of misrepresentation, deliberately and maliciously inspired, of course, by the National Country Party in particular. It has been asserted by a number of National Country Party members of parliament that the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats combined to defeat the Bill. That never was true, and they know it. They have had as scant a regard for the truth on this matter as they have had for the truth on matters generally. Both the honourable member for Werriwa, Mr John Kerin, and I made it perfectly clear, when the legislation was before the Parliament in May, that we would support the continuation of this payment in one form or another, either as a subsidy or as a bounty. We preferred it to be paid as a bounty; we still do, and I have moved accordingly. But if these amendments are not successful we will not vote against the legislation. We have always made it perfectly clear that we will not vote against it. </PARA>
<PARA> We repeatedly sought assurances from the Minister primarily responsible-that is , the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon)-that the Government in this session, irrespective of whether the Bill is amended in the way we seek, will backdate the payments to 1 July. No such assurance, indeed no response at all, came from the Minister for Primary Industry, who is supposed to be responsible for that area. That gave a very good indication of how genuine his concern on this matter actually was, as distinct from his habitual propensity to politic, to attempt to gain political advantage from misinforming the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, on 22 June I think it was, there was a response. For some reason the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Mr McVeigh, acted as Mr Nixon's replacement when he was overseas, instead of Sir James Killen. We were assured by the Prime Minister that when Sir James Killen was made Vice-President of the Executive Council he would normally become the leading Minister when another Minister was overseas. That did not happen in this case. Mr McVeigh became the leading Minister and he said: 'Yes, the legislation will be backdated to 1 July 1982 provided the Bill passes through the Senate'. He meant the legislation as it was originally presented to the Senate and not, of course, as it was originally presented to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter on which the National Country Party quite deliberately sought to misinform the Press and the public was on the procedures which were followed in the Senate. Whether an amendment which was forecast by the Australian Democrats-which I now gather they do not intend to proceed with-was carried, whether the amendments which I have now moved are carried or whether further consideration of the Bill is deferred, makes absolutely no difference to the commencement date of this Bill because, for reasons I have already explained-the Prime Minister's indecent haste to take off on his 25th overseas junket-the Prime Minister had already lifted the House of Representatives for the winter recess. Which of those three procedures is followed will make absolutely no difference to when the Bill would finally be enacted, given the decision the Prime Minister had already made for his personal convenience and his personal aggrandisement. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason the Labor Party is moving these amendments has not changed since the decision to move them was made. Habitually world fertiliser prices have been highly variable. Indeed, they have been wildly erratic. Over the long term Australian production has been more than competitive with imports. There is no reason to believe that in the long term that will change. Now, that is not the case, and it has not been the case for some six months or thereabouts. Because of excess production, particularly in the United States, imported fertilisers, adjusted for their active constituents and so on, have been able to undercut at least some of the fertilisers manufactured in Australia. There could be a short term gain to farmers, and for the moment we will disregard everyone other than the farmers. The National Country Party, of course, in its assessment of this Bill, has always disregarded everyone other than the farmers. For the present we will do the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible, indeed likely, that in the short term farmers could gain some advantage from a Bill passed in the way the Government wants this Bill passed instead of the way in which the Labor Party wants it to be amended. To do that, of course, fertiliser would have to be imported. Some fertiliser is being imported over the long term. It is likely-possible, I would say, rather than likely-that there would be a substantial increase in the volume of fertiliser imported. If that happens, obviously there will be reductions in Australian production and the possibility, at least in some areas, of the complete closure of fertiliser works, which once closed--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator is referring to changes in fertiliser or phosphate prices which took place in 1954, the removal of the bounty was a minor factor. Another major change occurred in the financial year 1974-75, that being that there was a large fall in farm incomes. Lest Senator Thomas be tempted to try to echo the National Country Party and say that was caused by the Labor Party, I add that a fall in farm income of comparable magnitude is under way right now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Phosphate consumption has been shown to be responsive to changes in farm income rather than to changes in price of the commodity, and that was brought out very clearly at the IAC inquiry. However, I should not have allowed myself to get sidetracked. The point I am making is that, given that a number of fertiliser imports are able to shade Australian products in price, if the subsidy is also payable on imports obviously that price advantage will be magnified. This will cause imports to be substituted for current domestic production and our fertiliser works will inevitably operate at a reduced level or some will close. In either of those cases, and certainly in the latter case, that capacity, once destroyed, will be difficult, if not impossible, to restore at some time in the future when the more normal pattern of world fertiliser prices is resumed and Australian production is cheaper than imports. If that happens-I suggest that ' when' would be a more appropriate word to use than 'if'-Australian farmers will be more fully exposed to wildly erratic world prices than they are now or than they have ever been, and that will not be good, even for the agricultural sector . </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the National Farmers Federation is not the only organisation that takes a shortsighted view; the present Government obviously takes an even more shortsighted view. Although there is the potential for some gain in the short term to the agricultural sector if the Bill goes through in the form the Government wants, there is a likelihood, a probability, of longer term losses which will more than offset the short term gains. For that reason we will continue to press the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say a final word about the National Farmers Federation. The Federation has issued a number of Press releases in response to the assertion that unless the legislation continues in the form in which it has existed for almost 20 years Australian domestic production will be to some or to a substantial degree replaced by imports. It says that this proves that the existing law has been breached based on the assertion in section 7-it may be section 12 of the principal Act, which I do not have before me right now-</PARA>

I suggest to the NFF that the meaning of that section is not that Australian manufacturers should be able to increase their profit margin ipso facto by, in the case of superphosphate, $12 a tonne because a subsidy has been paid but that their price must be reduced by $12 a tonne. The Federation has taken that section out of context and either misunderstood or misrepresented it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make one or two comments and put a query to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). I think we should never lose sight of the fact that although it is proposed that the Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill should pass money on to manufacturers, the sole purpose of this Bill is to reduce farmers' cost of production. The farmer has no final say or control over the price that he gets for his end product. The Government recognises his difficulty in this regard and seeks by this legislation to reduce his costs. As I understand the position, very little phosphatic fertiliser comes into Australia. The fertiliser that is imported is of a special type. I would like the Minister to give me some information on this matter. I understand that last year something less than 100 tonnes of double or triple strength fertiliser was imported. I also understand that the Industries Assistance Commission is keeping its eye on the situation to make sure that dumping does not occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must confess that I share Senator Walsh's concern about the future of the industry. I would not like to see the demise of our indigenous fertiliser industry. I am very concerned about what might happen to the Duchess deposits in north-west Queensland. By the same token, I think we should never lose sight of the fact that we have to keep down farmers' costs-it is as simple as that. For the life of me I cannot see why farmers who are using special imported fertilisers which are not available in Australia should at this stage be discriminated against without good reason. I understand that there is no evidence of dumping. Therefore, I am not convinced that the amendments should be carried at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The amendments moved by the Australian Labor Party are, I believe, reasonable. However, the Australian Democrats will not be supporting them and I will indicate the reasons why. Senator Walsh alluded to what has occurred, particularly in the rural Press, since we discussed this legislation last session. I must admit that it was amongst the grossest of misrepresentations that I have ever seen-certainly the grossest coming out of Ministers' offices. It seems to me a pity that in attempting to discuss this issue which is of vital concern to the rural sector and of vital concern to a growing industry within Australia we should have been put into a position of all or nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to refer to the Industries Assistance Commission recommendations which were to continue the bounty for three years. The Government has now announced that it will phase out the bounty. The IAC report referred to the amounts of money currently being spent in this area. Historically the reason for the introduction of this bounty was not to help the people who were using fertiliser but it was to assist in making productive marginal lands. Some very interesting and I believe far reaching propositions were put to the IAC particularly by the Western Australian Government in relation to rural research. I believe, and probably most people who have taken an interest in this matter will probably agree, that the money would be better spent in rural research particularly in terms of marginal farms. I believe that position is not very far from the position that the National Farmers Federation itself has taken. However , the position that it put-I must admit that it weighed very heavily with me-was that if the Government removed the bounty or the subsidy the rural sector could not be at all confident that it would even retain that amount of money, given the very niggardly arrangements that have often been entered into vis-a-vis this area and other sectors of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we have now got to the stage at which unless we accept the Government 's proposition in relation to the subsidy-this is illustrated by the types of misrepresentation that went on in the interim-the Government will probably be quite happy to drop the thing entirely. I for one do not believe that the rural sector is being supported to anywhere near the tune that we could in any way risk losing the small amount that is currently given to the rural sector vis-a- vis the other sectors within the economy. But I would like to refer to the position in Queensland. I am quite sure that Senator Collard who preceded me in this discussion also is aware of the situation. I believe that unless the position is monitored very closely we could have a very serious problem at Duchess and Monument. I believe we need to be excessively careful to ensure that we do not jeopardise our long term sources of production in this country for the sake of a short term gain. I hope that the Government will be monitoring that particular aspect of the implementation of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Possibly some of the Tasmanian Senators will comment on the situation in that state. The problems that may arise for Tasmania in terms of waste products from industrial manufacturing processors within that State may very well leave some of those processors with nowhere to sell their surplus sulphur. That could cause a very serious economic problem in Tasmania, a State which is already suffering from the very bad effects of the recession. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right, and I certainly raise those matters again. We are in the unfortunate situation, I think, of being forced by the Government to accept what is basically an unsatisfactory situation. The Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney) has indicated that the Government has not yet been able either because of pressures of other matters of for some other reason to consider the inquiry results into the long term future of Christmas Island. I believe it is unfortunate that this chamber is being asked to pass a Bill which could have long term repercussions on that Australian dependency which has as its only economic base, phosphate. I believe all of those factors are extremely important . I think they make it unwise for us to be proceeding with this measure at this time. However, I am also cognisant of the political fact that the Government probably would like this Bill to be defeated and to use that fact in an early election campaign, if there were to be one.</PARA></TALK.START>

Unfortunately, as a result a very large number of problems may arise which I hope the Government will monitor extremely closely. I believe that Senator Chaney in his speech the last time we discussed this subject did indicate that in relation to Christmas Island. But I again indicate our grave concerns in those areas which I have mentioned and I hope that the Government may be able to respond a little more effectively than it has done to date in relation to those matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may well be that I am wasting my time in this Committee discussion because it appears that no matter what anyone says or what questions may be asked on this matter the responses do not come forward in any reasonable way, and that is no criticism of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) who in most other respects is quite reasonable. But I point to the questions that I asked about this matter, as they appear at pages 2516 and 2517 of the Senate Weekly Hansard. Those questions related to the matter that has just been referred to in this discussion in respect of the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australia Ltd. They related to the Duchess mine in Queensland. They related to the extra burden that the Australian National Line will have to bear. They related to the viability of the operation in Christmas Island and what alternative arrangements have been made for the workers at Christmas Island. Most importantly, bearing in mind that the bounty or subsidy is really meant for the farmer, they related to what effect this decision to extend the subsidy to include what in effect will be triple phosphate from overseas will have in the long term on trace elements in Australian soil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did raise at that time the question of the long term effect that the Government's proposal would have on the farming community Australia. Is the Government aware that overseas producers of fertiliser attempted in 1974 to establish an OPEC-type arrangement? What would happen if, by cashing in on the short term benefit, there resulted a decline in the capacity of the local manufacture of fertiliser and the farmers then at a later stage were thrown to the mercy of overseas suppliers? It has been suggested that it is most likely, given the current rate of production of Australian fertiliser and given circumstances in overseas production, the cost of Australian fertiliser will be cheaper at some stage in the future than overseas fertiliser which at present appears to be cheaper. What happens at that stage when, for example, the capacity of the industry in Australia to meet the fertiliser demand of the farming community is not there? How would section 7 of the principal Act operate ? Section 7 of the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Minister is not satisfied that the prices being charged by a producer to purchasers in respect of the sale of bountiable products, or fertilizer mixtures, produced by him at registered premises are such as to pass on to the purchasers the full benefit of the bounty in respect of the bountiable products, or the bountiable products used in the fertilizer mixtures, as the case may be, the Minister may direct that bounty shall not be paid to the producer. </PARA>
<PARA>As everyone knows, the Department of Primary Industry does keep a check on that matter. If any Australian producer steps out of line, then it is up to the Minister, given proof of the misuse of this benefit, which really should be for the farmer and not the manufacturer, to direct that the bounty not be paid to that producer. I now ask: If in the future the situation arises in which the farming community is relying on imports of fertiliser, does the Minister have authority under the principal Act to cancel the subsidy for that overseas producer? If he does not, then why should not the Minister suggest an amendment to section 7 of the principal Act to clothe the Minister, in the interests of the farming community, with the power to withdraw the subsidy so far as it affects the overseas producer who is trying to cash in at the expense of Australian farmers? I am a little disappointed that the points I raised in the previous debate have not yet been answered to my satisfaction. I should like to hear what the Minister for Social Security has to say about that additional point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far we have had a slightly shorter debate in Committee than I recall our having had last time, although perhaps the lengthy debate was at the second reading stage. It was started by Senator Walsh, who made a series of allegations about the behaviour of National Country Party Ministers with respect to this legislation. That is not an unusual line of argument for Senator Walsh, who seems to spend a deal of time in this place attacking National Country Party Ministers for whatever he can lay his hands on. He referred also to statements by the Australian Labor Party which made it quite clear that this legislation would be passed so that the bounty would be paid. He referred aslo to the apparent reluctance of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) to make any public statement which would respond to that offer. I might say that any offers made by the Australian Labor Party probably represent a death-bed repentance or an understanding of the concern in the rural community about the action it has taken in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to a media release put out by the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, Mr John Kerin, on 15 June. I mention that date because it was not put out in May . I do not know whether he put out some other Press release in May but this release seems to stand as a statement of his intent. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Australian Labor Party will maintain its support for the three year extension of the super bounty and the nitrogenous fertilizer subsidy by supporting retrospective legislation when Parliament resumes in August', said Mr John Kerin . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 'I have today written to Sir Phillip Lynch, Minister for Industry and Commerce, and Mr Peter Nixon, Minister for Primary Industry, advising them of the Australian Labor Party's guarantee . . . </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Committee recessed for dinner I had just referred to a statement put out on 15 June 1982 by Mr John Kerin, the shadow Minister for Primary Industry in which he indicated that he had, on that day, written to the Minister for Primary Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) and the Minister for Primary Industry 'advising them of the Australian Labor Party's guarantee on the fertiliser legislation for the next three years to June 1985.' It is not apparent from the face of that that there was any earlier public indication. I do not know whether there was or not. In any event, that was Mr Kerin's public statement on 15 June. It was responded to on 22 June by a Press release put out by the then Acting Minister for Primary Industry, the Honourable Tom McVeigh, who pointed out-I quote a couple of paragraphs from his Press release-that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . farmers would receive the superphosphate and nitrogenous fertiliser subsidies after July 1, 1982, providing the legislation, currently deferred in the Senate by the actions of the Labor Party and the Democrats, is passed in its existing form. </PARA>
<PARA>So a very clear statement was made on 22 June. A little later in the Press release, the following appears:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr McVeigh said ensuring that the subsidies could be paid to farmers in the period between July 1, 1982 and at the time the legislation is passed, would involve the co-operation of manufacturers, who would have records of sales made.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the public record is fairly clear-that the Government indicated that it was proposing to proceed with the legislation in its present form and saw the bounty or subsidy being paid retrospectively to 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted that, in his speech on the amendment, Senator Walsh conceded that there could be a short term advantage for farmers-that was his expression-in passing the Bill in its present form. I do not wish to canvass the matters that we canvassed at some length in the second reading debate, when I pointed out-I think it has been largely accepted in this debate, unlike the previous debate- that this is a measure which is meant to provide assistance for farmers. The other very important collateral issues which have been raised by honourable senators of the Opposition and of the Australian Democrats are not central to this legislation and really need to be dealt with in another context. Senator Collard, who spoke in support of the Bill, emphasised that this is a measure that aims to reduce costs to farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin indicated that the Australian Democrats would accept the legislation on the premise that the Government would be happy to drop the legislation if it were blocked here. I can only put on the public record that the Government's wish is to see this legislation in place and operating as soon as possible. Senator Macklin again addressed the issue of Christmas Island and the concerns that he had about that place. I can only say to him again what was said in the earlier debate, namely, that this is an issue about which the Government is also concerned and regarding which the Government is alive to its administrative and other responsibilities. Clearly, the whole world situation with respect to superphosphate can affect Christmas Island, whatever is done in this legislation, and will be a matter on which the Government will have to keep a careful eye. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine asked in the course of the Committee debate for answers to some questions which he had raised previously. I must say that I had a little difficulty upon referring back to the Hansard in following some of the questions which were asked by him, as recorded, at page 2520 of 27 May 1982. I must say that there appeared to be some misapprehension about certain facts in those questions. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA> What will happen to the workers of Christmas Island? Has the Government given consideration to its guarantee to the manufacturer on Christmas Island which in turn has given a guarantee to Australian National Line that it will subsidise the shortfall in the carrying of phosphate from Christmas Island?</PARA>
<PARA>I am very puzzled about that because the existence of any such guarantee is not known to me or to my advisers and, of course, there is no manufacturer of superphosphate on Christmas Island. Certain people have contracts and, in turn, an arrangement or contract with the Australian National Line with respect to the carriage of phosphate from Christmas Island. But that is not a matter in which the Government is directly involved. Senator Harradine's next comment was:</PARA>
<PARA> When the ANL took over the ships of the British Phosphate Commission, a guarantee was given by the manufacturer, backed up by the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that backing of the Australian Government is not a matter that is known to me or to my advisers. The fact is that they are commercial matters which have to be dealt with by the commercial parties and will not be resolved by the passage or non-passage of this legislation. I think that underlying much of Senator Harradine's concern in this matter, is, of course, the position of local manufacturers. In wishing to pursue the legislation in its present form the Government should not be understood to say that it is not concerned about the position of local suppliers. It will, in fact, keep the position of local suppliers under review and will, if necessary, consider action to assist the industry. In the meantime, of course, the industry has access to the normal anti -dumping measures, which have been the subject of some comment in the Senate earlier today. So the difference between the position of Senator Harradine and that of the Government on this matter is not one which involves the Government saying: 'This is not a matter which ought to be of government concern or interest'. Rather we say that, if one is concerned about the industry, the proper course is not to amend this legislation but rather to look to the normal processes used to protect industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine made to the Committee a number of comments which expressed his concern about the possible long term position of farmers, given that there might be a reduction in the capacity of Australian manufacturers to manufacture phosphate for Australian use. That reflected the sort of concerns which I think underlaid Senator Walsh's comments when, in leading for the Opposition, he spoke of the long term interests of farmers, as against possible short term benefits. It occurred to me, as I was listening to Senator Harradine, that really one could use the same argument to justify almost any amount of protection for any sector of Australian industry. The fact is that a trading country such as Australia is a substantial exporter and a substantial importer of a great variety and range of goods and products. I do not believe that the sort of analysis which was made by Senator Harradine can really become a basis for action in this case or, indeed, in others because I think one could apply his words equally to almost any area of activity in Australia and reach the conclusion that in all cases action should be taken to preserve whatever happens to be the status quo. The rural industry, having to live as it does in international markets, understanding their deficiencies and fluctuations, is able to make the judgments that, I believe, it has made, namely, that it wants access to international sources of fertilisers as well as to Australian sources- understanding that there are pluses and minuses in that proposition taken over a range of years. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the other concern which was expressed by Senator Harradine about what authority the Minister might have under section 7 to withdraw a subsidy insofar as it might affect some overseas producer who might not be passing the subsidy on, I think that if one looks at the amending legislation it appears that that precise point is adequately covered. I refer to proposed new section 7 of the Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill, which replaces existing section 7 and states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Minister is not satisfied that the prices being charged by the producer or importer to purchasers in respect of the sale of goods, being goods in respect of which subsidy is payable, are such as to pass on to the purchasers the full benefit of that subsidy, the Minister may direct that subsidy shall not be paid to that producer or importer. </PARA>
<PARA>So that, in the case of material that is imported as against material which is manufactured in Australia, the ministerial power extends to the passing on of the subsidy by the importer rather than the direct manufacturer, who might be out of the jurisdiction. It seems to me that that is quite an appropriate provision which provides a safeguard to both the revenue and to the farmer, about which Senator Harradine was concerned. I ask the Senate to support this legislation in its original form. It is, as a number of honourable senators have pointed out in the debate, a measure which is meant to provide some assistance to the rural community which, like so many sections of Australian industry, has been faced by difficulties of rising costs. This is one of the very few areas in which assistance of this nature is given to the rural industry and I commend the legislation to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I wish to say a few words on the amendment moved by the Opposition. In doing so I want to put the record straight insofar as Senator Chaneys's remarks are concerned. At no time did the Australian Labor Party, in Opposition, decide to deny the farmers the subsidies or benefits which they would gain from the passing of this legislation. We had in fact agreed at a meeting of our caucus resources committee to oppose the Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill in its original form. However, when the Bill came into the Parliament at a very late hour of the sitting of the autumn session, we found that the Government had decided to amend it and to include in it a subsidy to be paid on imported fertilisers. That was not in the original Bill when we made our decision not to oppose it. The Government could well have introduced this legislation at a much earlier date and given the Opposition time to have a good look at it, but it did not do that; it introduced it at a very late hour in the other place and by the time we got it here the House of Representatives had adjourned for the winter recess. Because the Bill has been deferred we have been accused of voting against it and, in so doing, of having denied the farmers of Australia the benefits which they would have got from the subsidy. That is not correct and the record has to be put straight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chaney, in his reply, mainly to Senator Walsh, talked about a Press release to which Senator Walsh referred, which had been put out by Mr Kerin. He quoted some dates. I want to put the record straight again because I have a copy of a letter which Mr Kerin, our spokesman on primary industry, wrote to Phillip Lynch, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on 11 June. In a part of this letter, Mr Kerin said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is not opposed to the extension of the existing levels of bounty for phosphatic and nitrogenous fertilisers as our actions in the House of Representatives clearly indicated. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter was sent to the Minister on 11 June and some six weeks or more elapsed before the Minister put pen to paper to reply to Mr Kerin and acknowledge the letter which had been sent to him, setting out the position of the Labor Party. So in no way can the Opposition be rightfully accused of endeavouring to take away the subsidy which is to be paid to the farmers. In fact we said in that letter, through Mr Kerin, that we would agree to the payment being made retrospective to 1 July by allowing the passage of this Bill through this place when we came back. </PARA>
<PARA> It ought to be put on record that it was a Labor Government in 1941 that first introduced a superphosphate bounty in Australia. That was some 42 years ago. It was introduced by the then Labor spokesman on primary industry in the other place, a Mr W. J. Scully. I spoke at length on this legislation on 6 April 1976, more than six years ago, and detailed the history of the superphosphate bounty and the fact that a Labor Government had introduced the legislation. I also reminded the Senate that it was members of the Country Party who howled their heads off about the Labor Party not being prepared to pay a subsidy. I quote another small part of that speech just to remind some of the honourable senators who were not here at the time, and who are probably not aware of it, of what the late Jack McEwen did to the farmers back in 1950. I quote from Hansard of 6 April 1976, when I said:</PARA>
<PARA> We come now to the very interesting part in the history of this bounty. The document continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Superphosphate Bounty Repeal Act 1950 was introduced in November 1950 by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Hon. J. McEwen). </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he belonged to the Country Party-</PARA>
<PARA>He was one of the people who were always prattling and accusing the Labor Party of not being prepared to pay a bounty to the farmers. The document from which I was quoting went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to cease superphosphate subsidy payment as from 30 June 1950. As justification for the legislation, the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister then talked about the repeal of the superphosphate bounty. I will not waste the time of the Committee by quoting it all, because it is written here. I then said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to note that Mr Pollard-</PARA>
<PARA>Now the late Mr Pollard-</PARA>
<PARA>who was a Victorian member of the House of Representatives at the time, when speaking about the repeal of the bounty-Mr Pollard in that debate was not agreeing with Mr McEwen-went on to say that during the election campaign the Liberal and Country Parties did not mention that they were going to remove the bounty. </PARA>
<PARA>So, they went to the people letting the farmers think that the bounty would remain. After the election Mr McEwen came into the Parliament, in November, and brought in the Superphosphate Bounty Act Repeal Act, to repeal that bounty. That meant that all of the farmers in Australia who had placed orders for superphosphate, many of whom had had it delivered and had used it, then found themselves faced with an account from the manufacturers which did not embody in the price the bounty to which they thought they were entitled. That is how the Country Party misleads the farmers of this country, so never let its members stand in this place again and accuse the Labor Party of doing something which harms the farmers. It is clearly stated in Mr Kerin's letter to Minister Lynch that we had decided at our meeting, as I have said, not to oppose this Bill, until such time as the Government by a back door method at a late hour of the last sitting sought in the other place to embody in the Bill a bounty to be paid on imported superphosphate. </PARA>
<PARA> All members of this place have received correspondence from local manufacturers pointing out that many jobs will be lost. We have had lots of correspondence from people in Queensland who are fearful of what might happen, not only to industry there, to business enterprise, but also to employment. That is something with which this Government will have to live. It is its decision to pay a bounty on imported fertiliser, to the detriment, as these manufacturers say, to our local industry. The Government will have to live with that in the months to come and we will not be trying to get it off the hook. Never let it be said again by way of accusation that Senator Walsh wrongly accuses the Country Party. What he says about the Country Party is quite legitimate; he is not talking rubbish. He has been a farmer for many years and he knows how that party operates and how it tries to manipulate farmers into the false belief that the Labor Party does not support them. What we have done for primary producers over the years is on the record for anyone who likes to read it. Whilst these accusations continue I will stand in my place in this parliament and rebut them on every occasion available to me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfair for the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) to put into my mouth words which I did not use. He seemed to suggest that my concern over this matter is one principally based on the premise that the bounty measure is for the benefit of producers rather than for the benefit of the farming community. That is not so. I made it perfectly clear that I supported the viewpoint that the purpose of the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act was to ensure a benefit to the farming community. Quite obviously that is intended by section 7 of the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act, to which I referred in my previous comments in the Committee stage. Still the Minister has not answered a number of the questions that I raised in respect of the effect that this is likely to have in the long term on those who it is designed to benefit; namely, the farming community. For example, he has not answered the question that I posed at page 2516 of Hansard of 27 May of this year relating to the long term effect on trace elements in Australian soil of the possible change in the quality of superphosphate purchased by the farming community as a result of the subsidy being extended to imports. That has not been addressed by Senator Chaney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, I would like the Minister to respond to the question that I raised previously about the Australian National Line. In view of the fact that the operation of ANL is most important to my State of Tasmania, and indeed to the whole of the farming community in Australia, will he give the Senate a guarantee that the additional burden that might be imposed upon ANL as a result of the operation of the Bill now before us will in some way be offset by ANL and not be a charge against the people of Tasmania, or indeed the people of Australia. That is what it boils down to. The Minister cannot give a guarantee. He has skirted around it by saying that there are no manufacturers. We can always cross that out. My information is that a guarantee was given when ANL took over the ships. The Minister shakes his head. My information is that there was a guarantee. If his advisers say that they are not aware of one I would like to remind the chamber that this question has been on the books of he Senate since 27 May 1982 and the Minister still cannot give an unequivocal guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us think of some of the effects on producers. It is important not only for the long term benefit of the farming community but also in the interests of those persons directly involved in the production area in Australia at this time , particularly at a time of grave unemployment. What effect will it have on Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd in Tasmania? What about the chemical waste which is the main element in the production of phosphate by that company? Has the Government had constultations with the EZ company on that problem? The other question that I raised at that time related to the Duchess mine in Queensland. Will that resource project proceed? These questions have not been answered and in my view it is important that they be answered, not so much to do justice to those who are currently employed in the production of fertilisers in Australia but more importantly in the long term interests of the Australian farming community, which surely must have a vested interest in the maintenance of productive capacity for fertilisers within Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that I ought to speak on this matter although my colleague Senator Macklin has already spoken. The implications of the Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill are quite important. In the previous session of Parliament the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party objected to the passage of this Bill. We were accused of blocking the fertiliser levy to farmers. That was utterly untrue. We made it plain then and I will make it plain again now that our concern is about eventual damage to the Australian farming community and to Australian industry through a free market situation, if I may call it that, which will lead eventually to the dumping of fertiliser. Having been in the United States of America a couple of months ago, I know that prices there are the lowest on record. Dumping of fertiliser from the United States could occur quite easily in Australia. What then would be the consequences? In the intervening period since this legislation first came forward why has the Government not agreed to an iron-clad guarantee that there will not be dumping of superphosphate in this country to the detriment of the Australian industry and eventually to the detriment of the Australian farmer. It seems to me to be a relatively simple issue. It is one which has been evaded and one which has been misrepresented. Our desire to represent the interest of the Australian farmer has been misrepresented in a most cynical way by the Government as militating against that interest. I find this political cynicism which is most regrettable, to say the least.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certain points have been made. We would support Senator Harradine's point. Surely there is reason for the Government to look at any legislation, be it the parent Act or this Bill, and to give an assurance to the Australian people, to the Australian farmer and to us, the Opposition, that indeed it is levelling on this and that it does not want dumping here. So far we have not had that assurance. I ask the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) whether he is prepared to give that assurance to us, whether he is prepared to say that there will never be a situation in which dumping takes place that the Government is prepared to take definite action to that end. If we have such an assurance we will have no further problems. That is what the farming community, the superphosphate industry and any reasonable Australian wants to see. It now devolves on the Minister to give us that undertaking. I hope he will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a faint Alice in Wonderland air in this debate which reminds me of the previous debate. It seems to me to be very difficult to sustain the proposition that although honourable senators opposite refused the legislation passage they had nothing to do with the disruption of the fertiliser bounty. The point was very clearly made in the May debate. I made it in reply, and again before the debate closed in the Committee stage. The point was that if there was a delay of the Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendmendment Bill then of course there would be disruption to the normal payment of bounty. That has occurred and it is impossible for the Opposition and for senators who voted in a way which caused that to occur to escape the responsibility for that action. Of course, all senators who voted in that way believe that they were doing so for correct reasons. But it seems to me to be quite extraordinary to try to escape what flows from that action, namely that there has been delay in the legislation and there has therefore been a disruption to the bounty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to Senator Mason's point. I was on my feet a few minutes ago and perhaps Senator Mason was not in the chamber. I am not sure; I was not looking in his direction when I spoke. I made the point that the Government would keep the position of local suppliers under review and if necessary would consider action to assist the industry. I made the point that the Government's wishing to see the legislation passed in no way suggested that we were not concerned with the industry and so on. Of course the industry has access to the normal anti- dumping measures which are available to any part of Australian industry. That has been discussed in the Senate on a number of occasions. Today it was raised in Question Time by Senator Bjelke-Petersen, who is here this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> There does not seem to me to be a barrier. I cannot really understand the barrier which exists in the mind of Senator Mason. I do not believe that the Government can give a categorical assurance that there will never be an attempt to dump this or any other commodity in Australia. That is not the sort of undertaking that can be given. I can only point to the fact that the Government has established procedures which are accessible to this and any other industry if dumping should occur, and those procedures are available if that state of affairs arises. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a little confused about some of the various questions raised by Senator Harradine. He has referred several times to a page of Hansard which records a speech by Senator Crichton-Browne, but I think that he was probably referring to page 2520 of Hansard. That seems to contain the questions he is asking, and it was the page to which I referred a few minutes ago. I dealt with the questions asked on the right-hand side of the page at that time. Concerning the long term effect of trace elements in the Australian soil, if farmers opt for triple superphosphate instead of single superphosphate, I suggest that matter can be dealt with by farmers. The absence of trace elements can be dealt with in a number of ways. I think that it is more likely to be a difficulty involving an absence of sulphur, but again that can be dealt with in a number of ways. Frankly, the farm management type of question and soil management questions, which were effectively raised by the honourable senator, are not particularly relevant to this legislation. In any event, I am not really able to assist the Senate further on the matters raised. I have tried to give the responses to the best of my ability, and I commend the legislation to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the second time in a couple of months that Senator McLaren has quoted his own earlier speeches. I am reminded of the old legal rule that one should only quote an author after he is dead, and I now understand why that old rule has been instituted. I can imagine how irritating it must have been for judges to hear lawyers quoting their own textbooks. But in any event, I note the honourable senator's quotation of his earlier comments in this place in respect of a similar piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important piece of legislation. It is also complex and difficult. It concerns the Australian Public Service, which is a most important organisation. But appeals and the structure of the Commonwealth Public Service are probably not of great interest to the community at large; so before I commence my remarks perhaps I may say that anyone listening to the broadcast should probably switch off now, unless he is particularly interested in the structure and appeals procedures of the Commonwealth Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill is a combination of the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill 1981 and substantial and important amendments moved to that Bill by the present Government in the House of Representatives. The Bill in turn amends the Public Service Act 1922 and numerous other Acts. As I have said, the legislation is complex and far reaching. It should have called for substantial and detailed consultation with the Public Service organisations and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, being those organisations directly affected by the proposed changes to the legislation. Whilst it is true that in respect of many of the changes that are proposed by the Bill there has been a good deal of consultation and, indeed, agreement between the Government and the appropriate unions on necessary changes which might be made, in respect of several very important and contentious matters the degree of consultation between the Government and the unions has been at best perfunctory and at worst non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the important matters contained in the Bill saw the light of day only a few weeks ago, before the Bill was debated in the House of Representatives, when the Government circulated its amendments to the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill 1981. On other matters there has been a history of consultation and discussion going back in some instances to 1973. There has been consultation via the Joint Council and by other means. I make these preliminary comments to indicate the context in which this legislation has been introduced. It is fair to say that the Government has been somewhat slipshod in its handling of this legislation, as indeed it is in respect of most other matters. Perhaps if the Government had had the sense to embark on a thorough-going process of consultation with the unions involved, there may have been a greater measure of agreement on proposed changes to the Public Service legislation. At the very best, a great deal of the confustion and haste surrounding the introduction of the present Bill could have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to indicate the extent of interest in and the magnitude of the promotion appeals system in the Australian Public Service. I understand that in 1980 approximately 20,000 appeals were lodged, involving some 70,000 appellants, of whom at least 55,000 were not engaged in merely technical protective appeals, trying to protect their then existing status. If this circumstance is correct, it seems plain that legislation affecting the promotion appeals system should not be introduced without very thorough consultation and an earnest attempt to seek agreement on the matters proposed.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I wish to make it clear that the Opposition supports many of the proposed measures in the Bill. Many of the reforms have had a long history, and we think that they are eminently sensible reforms. Those have our firm support. But unfortunately the same cannot be said for some other parts of the Bill. This Bill has two main objects-firstly, to abolish the divisional structure of the Australian Public Service; secondly, to make changes to the promotion, selection and appeal processes within the Public Service. The Opposition supports the proposal to abolish the divisional structure of the Australian Public Service. Although to many this proposal sounds radical, it is soundly based and there is broad support for it. Indeed, there is a history of support for the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, the so-called Coombs Commission, reported in 1976. That Commission considered that the present divisional structure was outmoded and of doubtful utility. The hierarchical nature of the Service at present is composed in the following way. Firstly, the First Division of the Public Service consists of permanent heads of departments and on occasions other very senior positions as determined by the Governor- General. Secondly, the Second Division of the Public Service consists of senior executives of the Service, deputy secretaries, first assistant secretaries, and some others. Thirdly, the Third Division consists of clerical and professional positions, entry to which is controlled by examination or by special qualification in some instances. Finally, the Fourth Division comprises the rest of the staff of the Australian Public Service, and most of the Government's work force is in the Fourth Division. In fact, more than 70 per cent of the Public Service staff are engaged in that Division. The Coombs Royal Commission, to which I have referred, criticised the divisional structure, pointing out that it is a source of caste and status and prohibits mobility in the Public Service. The Coombs Royal Commission report had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Criticisms of the divisional structure include the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) It has inhibited an objective assessment of the working requirements of lower Third Division positions;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) it precludes the promotion to Third Division positions of officers of the Fourth Division of proven capacity. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commission went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The validity of these criticisms is accepted by most departments and staff associations and by the Public Service Board which proposes the abolition of the divisions and their replacement by a series of occupational groups. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission went on to recommend that provisions for divisions be removed from the Public Service Act. This recommendation had the support of the Public Service organisations involved and naturally the support of the Public Service Board. So there is common ground between all major parties that this proposal of the Coombs Royal Commission be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst supporting the proposal to abolish divisional groups, it is necessary to say that the full details of the restructuring and identifying of the occupational groups called for by the abolition of the divisions have not yet been made public. I think it is fair to say that the abolition of divisions is not in itself a means of effecting the removal of undesirable barriers to mobility within the Service. The Coombs Royal Commission acknowledged this but considered that its recommendations on entry and selection would assist in eradicating barriers to that mobility. The Opposition has taken up some parts of the Commission's report on this aspect and will be moving as an amendment proposed new section 33AA to ensure that barriers to mobility are as few as possible as a result of the abolition of these divisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major area of the Bill concerns itself with the proposed changes to the promotion, selection and appeals procedures. Many of the proposed changes are eminently sensible and non-contentious and, in fact, are the result of consultative processes with the Joint Council. However, others are not, and in fact the Government has refused discussion in some areas. In October 1981 a specific request was made by the Australian Council of Trade Unions that certain portions of the Bill be put aside to allow further consultation and discussion. That request was not acceded to by the Fraser Government. In saying that, it is not a question of saying that the Government has to follow the dictates or requests of the ACTU in relation to these matters; but it is foolhardy, in this area of industrial relations, not to allow proper opportunities for affected parties to talk about proposed changes. Every treatise on industrial relations and every commentator on industrial relations make the point about the importance of consultation and discussion before reforms of this kind are implemented. Perhaps this Government's failure in this area is indicative of its handling of the whole area of industrial relations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to mention briefly some general areas of concern with the Bill. Clause 21 of the Bill repeals section 33 of the principal Act, which makes provision for the appointment of officers to the Second, Third, and Fourth divisions of the Service. This section is to be replaced by proposed new sections 33, 33A, 33B and 33C which make general provisions for the appointment of officers. Proposed new section 33A sets out the matters which the Public Service Board will determine in relation to the recruitment of staff. This provision is consistent in general with the recommendations of the Royal Commission for the details of the recruitment procedures to be delegated from the Board to departments, with the Board retaining a sort of monitoring role. However, this Bill fails to take up an important set of recommendations which are designed to declare in the statute itself a commitment to merit as a determinant to recruitment, selection and promotion. I would have thought that the Government would have been concerned to commit itself to merit as a determinant and a criterion of recruitment, selection and promotion. The Coombs Royal Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems desirable to the Commission that the commitment to merit in recruitment and promotion should be declared by statute in a form which does not depend on particular techniques of measurement and leave scope for the Public Service Board to adopt its procedures in the light of growing knowledge and experience. </PARA>
<PARA>In the view of the Opposition, the full scheme proposed by the Royal Commission for enforcing merit selection as an ingredient of the development of a representative bureaucracy should be adopted. I repeat: One would have thought that would have been the view of this Government. I indicate that at the Committee stage we will be moving an amendment which will be directed towards emphasising the question of merit as the sole determinant in recruiting and promotion. We wonder why the Government has not also grasped that nettle because it is a very important and qualitative change which can be made to the whole structure and morale of the Australian Public Service. It is important to emphasise that merit and nothing but merit should be the determinant in creating a strong and efficient Public Service. The Royal Commission recognised this. It is clearly of importance that measures be taken to enshrine that principle in legislation. We regard that as a matter of the utmost importance and one which goes to the heart of improving the efficiency and creativity of the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 28 of the Bill seeks to repeal the existing provisions in the legislation and proposes new legislation in regard to promotions and appeals. Under the old section 50 (8A) of the Act a promotions appeal committee was required to make full inquiries into the claims of the parties. That language has been subject to judicial interpretation. However, the proposed new section 50D (1) departs from the original language and proposes a substitute duty in the following form:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Committee shall inquire into the claims of each party to the appeal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason for this change is not disclosed, either in the second reading speech or in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill. I hope that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) will see that the reasons for that change are disclosed in the course of the debate which will follow, either tomorrow or on another day on which the Senate is sitting. The effect of the change will be to create needlessly a basis for judicial distinction to recent court decisions based on the existing wording of the Act. This is an important and fundamental change. The fundamental requirement of how a tribunal should go about its duty to inquire is now proposed to be changed without any obvious explanation being given by the Government. In our view, this is not a satisfactory situation at all. It should be remedied, and we propose to do so in the Committee stage of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed new section 50D(2) also merits some attention. It proposes a highly detailed code of procedures to be followed when a promotions appeal committee conducts its inquiries. It is worth asking why these procedures have been detailed in this matter when the question has recently been the subject of judicial interpretation. I refer to the judgment of Ellicott, J., a former Attorney-General, in the case of Finch v. Goldstein, a matter heard by the Federal Court last year and known as Finch's case. In Finch's case, Mr Justice Ellicott held that the Promotions Appeal Committee had two basic duties. These were the duties he emphasised: First, the duty to be fair, and, secondly, the duty to make full inquiries. The learned judge went on to say that the Promotions Appeal Committee should afford, first of all, the right of each party to know the case put against him or her. I would have thought that an impeccable principle of British judicial precedent. Secondly, he said, that the Promotions Appeal Committee should afford the right of each party to put his or her case- again, I would have thought, a fundamental principle which should have been enshrined in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Ellicott, J., did not hold that committees were obliged to conduct formal hearings or to allow legal representation. They were not obliged to do that. He considered that the regulations allowed the committee to prescribe the procedures to be used, subject to the duties, the overriding duties, which he had outlined in the course of his judgment in Finch's case. Regulation 109F made under the existing provisions instructs the appeal committee to 'make its inquiries without regard to legal form or solemnity'. Mr Justice Ellicott went on to conclude that in the circumstances of the case before him, the Promotions Appeal Committee had failed in its duty to act fairly. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedures in proposed new section 50D(2) have clearly been introduced as a reaction to the decision in Finch's case. But whether they reflect the more open and flexible approach recommended by Mr Justice Ellicott is, in our view, a matter of some debate. This Bill appears to place defined limits on the flexibility of response to particular cases which Mr Justice Ellicott was at such pains to preserve as a discretion of particular appeals committees. It just might be that a setting out of procedures to be followed by committees could assist in achieving a greater degree of fairness in hearings, but such a setting out should be the result of consultation with those concerned and should at all times preserve the approach which Mr Justice Ellicott recommended. Proposed new section 50D(2) exhibits none of these features and, if I may say so, we rely very much on the principles enunciated by Mr Justice Ellicott. Perhaps when he was in this place he never heard such commendation from Opposition spokesmen as he is getting tonight. In fact, it would seem that the flexibility of response advocated by Mr Justice Ellicott's decision has been cut down by the Government in this legislation. In this regard, attention should be drawn to the Minister's second reading speech in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent court decisions appear to indicate that, as the Public Service Act is presently worded, the promotions appeal system should be conducted within an adversary framework and require a greater degree of legal formality than has in practice applied or is necessary or desirable to see that an appellant's case is fairly and fully heard and determined. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement of the Minister is a misreading of Mr Justice Ellicott's judgment . In fact, Mr Justice Ellicott held that the adversary or inquisitorial system, as it is sometimes called, or the distinction between the adversary or inquisitorial method, was not a useful way of analysing the function of committees; that what was needed was not necessarily a greater degree of legal formality but a higher standard of fairness in proceedings than had hitherto been applied. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should be very wary of attempts to cut down the obligations which the general principles of administrative law place upon bodies such as the Public Service Board and other tribunals dealing with employee rights and duties . Since the decision in the Finch case, it is clear that the general principles of administrative law do apply to promotions appeal committees. There is always a danger that the detailed setting out of procedures may enable committees to ' read down' the obligations imposed on them by administrative law principles. In the content of this Bill that danger is apparent. I understand that parties to promotions appeal committee hearings report that the relatively greater openness and attention to fair practice now being observed by committees since the 1981 court decision is working well and is well received within the Public Service. It is difficult, therefore, to see why the Public Service Board has reacted in the way it has to the decision in Finch's case. Because of these views, the Opposition will move, in the Committee stage of this Bill, to preserve the flexibility recommended by His Honour Mr Justice Ellicott. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with the other main contentious area of this Bill as I move a conclusion. I refer to proposed new sub-division F which deals with the furnishing of reports in cases of transfers, promotions and appeals. In part, these proposals deal with the issue which was involved in the disallowance by the Senate, on 23 March this year, of Statutory Rule No. 274 of 1981, made under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. I think it is necessary to understand that section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act creates a duty to provide reasons for certain administrative decisions. Schedule 2 to the Act had exempted from this requirement, for a period of 12 months or such longer period as was prescribed, decisions relating to promotions, transfers or appeals of individual members of the Australian Public Service. The initial 12 months' exemption of promotions appeal bodies in the Public Service had the support of the unions involved, as it was considered that it was an appropriate move in order to allow the Public Service Board time to develop measures to conform with the obligations imposed by the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The attempt by the Government to extend this period of exemption in March this year was quite unjustified and it was of little wonder that the Senate disallowed it. The Government has thus introduced this new sub- division F as its attempt to conform to the obligations imposed by section 13 of the Act to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is concerned with the effect of proposed new sub-division F. In our view, it does not provide a similar level of protection as is afforded by section 13 of the Act. The reasons that must be provided under proposed new sub- division F are significantly different from those under section 13 and, in fact, the new proposals cut down substantially the rights afforded under the latter section. This was argued in meetings with the Public Service Board by the Australian Council of Trade Unions but the arguments were not accepted. We think the arguments should have been accepted. In our view there is no justification for treating one class of administrative decisions-those concerned with Public Service matters-differently from any other class of administrative decisions. Persons seeking reasons for a decision under the Public Service legislation should have the same rights as other persons can obtain under section 13 of the Act. We do not oppose the idea of a public service setting out in detail the rights of parties to obtain reasons for a decision, but any such provisions should reflect the principles embodied in section 13 of the Act. There are some provisions of this very important Bill to which the Opposition takes exception, but these will be dealt with and taken up in discussion at the Committee stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me say that although this is a technical Bill and perhaps not of much interest to the community in general, it is an important Bill which is regarded as important in terms of the morale, efficiency and imagination, as it were, or the capacity for constructive imagination and development of the Australian Public Service. There is much to commend in the Bill. Many of the matters in it will improve the efficiency of the Australian Public Service. But it is unfortunate, in our view, that on some major points the Government has acted with characteristic clumsiness and insensitivity to the rights of those involved. having said that, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I propose at the end of my remarks to invite the Senate to adjourn the debate and to postpone the Committee stage for particular reasons which I shall set out. I believe that the Government will be putting forward a series of amendments that have emerged from discussions since the Bill first saw the light of day. I think it only fair that honourable senators should know that before they discuss it during the Committee stage. We are interested in the comments made by the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is of tremendous importance, and if there are others to be circulated or any questions, we would be very grateful to have them . Basically, as Senator Button said, this Bill emerges primarily from the 1976 Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. It is also sensitive to the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing. It is a Bill which looks towards the structure, the promotion process and the promotion appeals process of the Commonwealth Public Service. I do not propose to speak in any detail on this tonight. I believe that the main points of contention will emerge in the Committee stage. Senator Button has acknowledged, as has been acknowledged in another place, that much of this legislation is highly acceptable to both the Opposition and the Government, and I thank him for that. It is inevitable that there will be points of contention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Public Service in Australia plays a most significant part in the community and in society. It is essential, as an objective, skilled and expert body in the development of government. It is the wish of government that the conditions of the Public Service should be the optimum that the community can provide. It is the wish of government that matters relating to the structure, to promotion and to appeal should be eminently fair and practicable; that is, divorced as far as they can be from time wasting legalisms, at the same time, exposing the vital information to particular individuals while preserving the rights of all in that regard. Therefore, in the debate on individual matters of the Bill essential principles will be raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button raised the question of the Finch case and Mr Justice Ellicott. It will be a matter for the Senate to see where the equity should lie in a matter of both the nature and the conduct of appeals, whether the adversary system is good or bad, how much particular kinds of information should be exposed-all these kinds of things which I think get to the very heart of matters . I think all of us believe that the repeal of the provisions which established the Third Division and Fourth Division of the Public Service would be good. All of us, I am sure, believe that the provision to abolish seniority and to say that efficiency and merit shall be the bench marks is good. All of us want to ensure that the promotions and appeals systems are the best we can devise. </PARA>
<PARA> In that sense I will endeavour to have circulated to honourable senators the proposed amendments of the Government. The Government will welcome the availability of any proposed amendments by honourable senators on the other side of the chamber, by the Australian Democrats and by Senator Harradine. Since in these complex matters there is always a variety of questions, I wonder whether we could have forewarning if specific detail is needed so that I can ask the Public Service Board to have not only its technical officers but also the best of all possible advice in that regard available. I think that would be the civilised and effective way to conduct this debate. If any honourable senator of any party would like specific information on the Bill, the Public Service Act and the proposed amendments, the officers of the Public Service Board have informed me that they would be very willing to make themselves available for that type of discussion. I wonder whether, before we come to the Committee stage , that can be done. I thank Senator Button for his contribution. I commend the Bill, at its second reading, to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party has circulated to all honourable senators a proposal to delete clause 4 and to insert a whole number of new clauses at pages, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill. In the first instance I want to refer to the debate that took place at the second reading stage and remind honourable senators that part of their obligations and responsibilities is to act on behalf of the public. We believe there is a public interest consideration here. With the threat of an early election I appreciate that we are placed in a somewhat difficult position in that the proposals for which we seek the support of the Committee would have the effect of altering the amount of compensation in respect of persons injured or killed in aircraft accidents. Whilst we will certainly be arguing that our proposals ought to be agreed to, it has been intimated to us that it would be difficult to defeat the Government's legislation and send it back to the House of Representatives for further consideration. Nevertheless, there is a case for suggesting to the Government that it ought to accept the amendments that we will place before the Committee for consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Committee that we are seeking to have the limitation and compensation raised from the proposed $100,000 to $130,000. For a long time-in fact, since 1976-the present Government has failed to take into account the rate of inflation when determining the level of compensation despite calls by both the Australian Labor Party and even Government members that there was a need to increase the amount of $45,000 payable in the event of death arising out of an aircraft accident. We do not believe that the public interest is being protected by arbitrarily fixing a figure of $100,000. Since this matter was first dealt with by the Parliament in 1959 there has always been a relationship between the amount of compensation and average weekly earnings. That criterion has been departed from in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we reject the concept that a passenger has the right to take out special or additional insurance to protect himself if he feels that inadequate compensation is likely to be paid in the case of injury or death. We do not believe that such a situation serves the best interests of the travelling public . Many cases in the civil courts involve passengers or the families of passengers injured or killed in aircraft accidents who have been disadvantaged by inadequate compensation. We are of the view that it would be in the best interests of the travelling public if the airline operators accepted the higher level of compensation that we suggest should be paid. They should do this rather than concern themselves with the frills and in-flight services that have been part of airline competition. We are more concerned with the lives of passengers. We want to ensure that in the event of injury or death adequate compensation is paid to them or their families. </PARA>
<PARA> As was said in the second reading debate, we have a very high standard of aircraft safety in this country, particularly in the major airlines. The Department of Aviation's very high standards have resulted in a very low overall accident rate. I think it should be drawn to the attention of the Committee that over the last year there has been a rather heavy increase in the number of accidents involving privately owned aircraft and small charter aircraft. The Australian Labor Party is concerned about this because people, for work or leisure reasons, often quite unexpectedly travel by this type of transport. In many cases they are not aware of or do not think about compensation entitlements . After all, when one travels by air one does not think of the unexpected or the unthinkable. It is only when the unexpected happens and tragedy occurs that the question of compensation comes to the fore. </PARA>
<PARA> There are adequate reasons why the Committee and the Government should be prepared to take on board what the Opposition has had to say on these matters. We have taken into consideration not only the public interest but also the Government's own estimations in years gone by of the yardstick by which limited liability insurance should be gauged. Our very long-winded and extensive amendments are based on what we see as the responsibility of the Labor Party and also the Committee. In proposing $130,000 in the event of death we seek to relate compensation to average weekly earnings. We do not believe that increasing the level of compensation would represent a great amount of money to carriers but it would certainly represent a great amount of money to the persons affected by any accident arising from their travel on aircraft. The amendment which has been circulated in my name and which, as I have said, covers some five pages, seeks to amend clause 4 of the Bill and to insert a new sub-clause for the purpose of achieving our objective. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, the Government itself proposes to amend its own legislation as a result of the work of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills to the extent that it has decided to move amendments to clause 4 of this Bill and also amendments to the associated Bill. The Government's proposed amendments will give more flexibility to the responsible Minister in the form of regulations. The Opposition will not oppose them because to a minor degree they do seem to meet some of the objections that have been raised by the Labor Party' s shadow Minister for Transport, Mr Morris, when he very ably debated this matter with the Minister for Transport in the House of Representatives back in May. As the consideration of this piece of legislation was not concluded at the end of the last session, obviously the Government requires that it now be passed by this chamber. In moving our amendment I ask that the Government give serious consideration to it as we have done to its proposed amendments which also were circulated just prior to the commencement of this debate. I seek leave to move my amendments together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many of the arguments that Senator Gietzelt put during the consideration of the amendments related to the second reading debate in which he strongly argued the case for improving the base on which indexation of the limits was to be established. In particular he sought the level of benefit to be established at $ 130,000. During the second reading debate I did draw attention to the fact that there was much doubt about what would be the appropriate level but that in the Government's view $100,000 appeared to be reasonable in the circumstances. We did state at that time, and I reiterate it, that on the basis of an indexation movement since 1959, on a $15,000 limit which was then applicable, the level would have risen to $60,000 but that on the basis of average weekly earnings, the figure would have risen to $110,000. I think that indicates the level and nature of the problem. The Government has settled on a level of $100,000 at this stage as being reasonable in the circumstances and we seek the Opposition's concurrence with that amount at this point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would seem, though, that average weekly earnings which do reflect a somewhat higher figure than $100,000, albeit only to the extent of $10,000, may not be an appropriate indicator. Perhaps in the circumstances in which we view this matter , the increase in the consumer price index may be the more appropriate means by which this should be calculated. In addition, we know that the States have complementary legislation that adopts the terms of the Act and applies them to intrastate air transport. We therefore have to consider whether all the States would agree to a proposal such as this. The Government's proposal allows for greater flexibility to consider the range of issues; I include that of the consumer price index versus the average weekly earnings proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to have regard to the situation of international limits. These were points which we did make during the second reading debate. The Government considers that the limits should of course be reviewed regularly-more regularly than has been done in the past perhaps-and to that extent the legislation does make provision for the introduction by regulation of an arrangement which will make it easier for more regular adjustments to be made to the limit. I am sure that would be the objective of the Opposition. The method that has been adopted would seem to be reasonable in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons the Government does not accept the Opposition's amendments on these matters. Senator Gietzelt does remind us of our intention to move further amendments in line with the report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills which was handed down this afternoon. That, indeed, will be the subject of further discussion later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just make some comment at this stage following the remarks of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) solely on the proposed amendments as a result of the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. As Chairman of that Committee I thank the Government for the very speedy way in which it has taken into account the report which we have given. The Committee was concerned that in regard to the regulations which provided a limitation on the liability of carriers the limit could, without recourse to this Parliament, be reduced. If the amount were under $100,000 it could be greatly reduced. In our view, it could, in a bad way, possibly affect the rights of citizens who travel on airlines if the amount were reduced. The result is that the Government has now agreed to move amendments to provide that there will only be regulations that increase the liability to an amount over the $100,000. I think it is quite reasonable that that should be done by regulation. Accordingly, the Government proposes to move consequential amendments to this Bill and to the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Amendment Bill.

<PARA>These are somewhat technical amendments. They seek to extend the maximum liability of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority under Part II of the Principal Act in respect of any one person by reason of his death or injury resulting from an accident. These amendments are consequential upon the Opposition's amendments to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Bill, which have just been defeated. They provide for an automatic increase in the limit of carriers' liability in line with increases in average weekly earnings. The amendments proposed by the Opposition would replace the proposed new sub-section 8 (1). The Opposition's proposed new section 8 (1) of the Air Accidents ( Commonwealth Government Liability) Amendment Bill 1982 would ensure that the limits of Commonwealth liability are the same as the limits of liability of carriers under the legislation we have just dealt with, which amended the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959. I remind the Senate that since the regulations will not be made under that Act in relation to liability for death or injury, the references to regulations have been replaced with reference to the applicable amounts ascertained under that Act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are delighted with the amendments moved by the Government. I am sure that the Australian Labor Party is delighted also. However, I suggest that this is hardly the way to deal with such an important matter. I am not blaming the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) because it is not his responsibility. He simply represents the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife), and the Minister for Aviation is one of the most courteous people in the Parliament. I would have thought in relation to a matter such as this, where significant amendments are being made to a Bill that a letter to leaders of parties in the Senate would have been an appropriate courtesy to extend so that we would have known that the amendments were coming in tonight. Honourable senators on this side of the chamber could have assisted the Minister and the people on the floor of the Chamber, even the Liberal back benchers--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to respond quickly to that point. Indeed, as Senator Missen has pointed out , there were some rapid changes in attitude and some very quick decision-making took place this afternoon which brought this matter to a head. I apologise for not having contacted Senator Chipp directly, but the matter was settled only half an hour ago. Therefore, we did not get the machinery that is available to Ministers available in time to send letters to the leaders of parties in the Senate. Nevertheless, the point is made and in the event of such changes in the future we will certainly take into account the points raised by Senator Chipp. Senator Haines and I have had discussions on this matter.

As will be seen, those costs are tremendous, but it is not just a question of money.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The intention of my major proposals is to incorporate into law the permanent and serious commitment which I believe is necessary in a marriage, to ensure that there are no easy ways out of that commitment and to re-establish quite definitely within the laws of marriage and divorce the concepts of innocence and justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the matter of consolidation, the Attorney-General's amendments are really a serious waste of an opportunity to consolidate the Family Law Act and the Marriage Act. They are both about the same substantial matter. The very first line of the Family Law Act states that it is an Act relating to marriage. Then, of course, section 43, which I think it is always important to incorporate in a debate such as this, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Family Court shall, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act or any other Act, and any other court excercising jurisdiction under this Act, shall, in the exercise of that jurisdiction, have regard to- (a) the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life;</PARA>
<PARA>The subsidiary parts of section 43 back up that statement but, as I have said before, nowhere else in the Family Law Act is there anything at all which consolidates marriage as a permanent commitment. Basically, the rest of it provides a mechanism by which marriage can be broken up. That is the scandal of the present Family Law Act. Fundamentally, consolidation is a matter of convenience, good sense and good law. There is no pressing hurry for the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to go ahead with his amendments. Certainly, there is no great demand in the community for immediate action. In fact, there never has been, in my judgment. Even before the family law inquiry there was no demand by people for immediate answers. They realised that these were very serious and pressing problems-pressing in the sense of human failure and disaster, but felt that so much that was bad had been wrought by the existing Act that it was better to hasten slowly in straightening the matter out. So there is no pressing reason for the Attorney to go ahead, no pressing reason for the Parliament to finalise the matter during this session. There is very good reason indeed to take stock of the whole matter and consolidate the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act in one piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard certain draft model provisions which show in detail how consolidation and other relevant matters that are dealt with in my amendment may be effected. I realise that they are lengthy, but they will be the only other material that I shall seek to incorporate. In view of the time constraint I cannot go into great detail and it is essential to illustrate by incorporating in Hansard how these proposals might be possible of fulfilment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again I thank the Senate. Finally, I feel that if there is to be consolidation it can work only if all of the amendments that I have put forward are incorporated and the principles outlined in the draft are accepted. To some people that may be an entirely too rigid point of view to accept but after my participation in the Family Law Act inquiry I am convinced that it is essential to restore some of the solid provisions that existed prior to the introduction of the family law legislation. Paragraph (b) of my proposed amendment, which seeks the abolition of the Family Court of Australia, would reverse the undesirable trend which has separated the Family Court from the mainstream of Australian jurisprudence. This massive separation was brought about principally as a result of the concept and operation of no fault divorce. It is emphasised by the special conditions of judicial appointment which appear in the Family Law Act. According to the present Act, one must have special sociological qualification before one can be considered for appointment as a judge. My friend Senator Missen, who will oppose me quite strongly when he gets the chance, surely cannot support such conditions. Some of them might preclude him from becoming a judge of the Family Court. It seems to me that this host of novel procedures, rules and practices is not good in the whole field of Australian jurisprudence and that it is necessary to bring family law back under the umbrella of well established Australian jurisprudence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My dissenting report to which I have already adverted has made several suggestions about this but I do not intend to trespass on the good nature of the Senate by seeking any more incorporations. The Attorney-General recognises that the present situation presents great difficulties. This, I believe, is an argument for what I am suggesting-the abolition of the Family Court. The very first of the Attorney-General's reference notes states that consultation with four States on an appropriate reference of powers is continuing; that it is unlikely a reference will result in the near future. Why will not the Attorney go the whole hog and try to bring the matter back totally under the umbrella of Australian jurisprudence, recognising the particular functions of the separate States in the matter? Some of my proposals, which have now been incorporated in Hansard, indicate ways in which this can be done. The creation of a family division of the Federal Court involves the satisfying of four or five very simple conditions. The original jurisdiction must be taken care of. That can be done easily enough by amendments. The position of the appellate jurisdiction also can be taken care of by way of simple amendment. The transfer of jurisdiction and the necessary transitional procedures are par for the course to this Parliament, which can have drafted simple amendments to achieve very easily what I have suggested. Not only will my proposals be good for family law, they will also be good for the concept of federation. Much of the worry and concern of individual States, which has contributed to their failure-as the Federal Government keeps reminding us-to refer these powers to the Commonwealth, can be attributed to their natural antipathy to impingment upon and interference with their sovereign rights. I think it is important for us to bear that in mind when considering family law. Always we must consider how this Commonwealth is constructed. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (c) of my amendment covers several matters. I refer first of all to the bugbear of having no objective tests for divorce. Much of the pressure for divorce comes from the so-called hard cases which are the cause of special pleadings before the courts. I have always maintained that these are matters of law only and should be dealt with as matters of law, not of sociology. The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, of which my friend Senator Missen is a member-he probably was a member when it looked into this matter-believed that the Family Law Act would bring a degree of honesty and dignity to divorce proceedings, instead of which, as we have seen in examining the short history of this family law and the Family Court, it has created a whole range of new bitternesses and difficulties, particularly in relation to children. I believe that we have to protect marriage from raids by outsiders and I believe that the provisions which I have previously incorporated will tend, in their quite definite attitude to the permanence and the commitment to permanence of a marriage, to give that stability and a consideration of matters of law which in my judgment is not now part of the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA> Many matters associated with annulment were wiped off by the Family Court almost in a couple of sentences. As every honourable senator knows, there is only one ground for separation, for the breaking up of a marriage, and that is the irretriveable breakdown of marriage which is defined as 12 months' separation. That is the only ground for divorce; there are no objective tests. It can create great difficulty for those who wish an annulment. Some people have religious problems with annulment. </PARA>

It is impossible for people of several religious persuasions in this country to have their marriages broken up because in many cases the only way those marriages can be broken up is by annulment. Of course annulment is the statement by an authority-a court in some instances, church authorities in others-that the marriage is null and void. There are no adequate provisions in the Family Law Act now to cover that and it is one of the reasons for consolidation. I would like to cover an enormous number of other things but time does not permit it. But I think that a fair and objective examination of what I propose will lead to a better Family Law Act in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite difficult to believe that Senator Martyr is serious about the amendments that he placed before us in relation to the Family Law Act. We have read his dissenting report to the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act, so we know he is not joking. We are also very well aware of the fact that he makes considerable use of the terms ' innocence' and 'objectivity' and, by inference, guilt and subjectivity. This evening, on a previous occasion and certainly during the inquiry into the Family Law Act these terms were thrown about with gay abandon by the honourable senator . I could not get him to define innocence 'when I gave evidence to the joint select' inquiry and I still do not know what he means. I suggest that an innocent, in his terms, might be shocked and horrified rather than amazed by the grounds for amendment that he suggests. They cover an amazing range of so-called evils as laid down in his dissenting report and in his amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To remind honourable senators, I will go through just a few of them. In his terms, annulment would be allowed if either party were not of full age, if there were mistaken identify, if either party were suffering from communicable venereal disease unknown to the other party, if either party were not of sufficiently sound mind or if one party had been or was actively engaged in homosexual activity. If this was intended to be a comprehensive catalogue of evils within the honourable senator's definition, I suggest that it is not a particularly comprehensive list and that he has left out a few things which I think might quite reasonably be included. Are we to understand that the honourable senator actually approves of some of the things he has omitted such as incest, pederasty, sodomy and sado masochism? One could go on all night, but perhaps no more is needed to indicate the ridiculous nature of some of the amendments suggested by the honourable senator. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a considerable amount of reference, too, to the sanctity of marriage. I have attended with great care the arguments of those who believe genuinely that clause 41 will somehow lessen the gravity with which people regard the dissolution of marriage. This, if I may recall, for the benefit of honourable senators, is the clause which would allow that final decision, a decree nisi, to be delivered without the attendance of either of the parties or of their legal representatives. This line of argument also includes frequently an allusion to the sanctity of marriage and I believe this assumes that the majority of Australians attach deep religious significance to the marriage ceremony. However, the statement of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) read at the opening of the Opas Memorial Library on 6 February 1982 by the Honourable Neil Brown included the statement: 'traditional moral and religious values have been rejected by a large section of the community'. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is clearly shown by the rapid acceptance of marriage by a celebrant as an alternative to the religious ceremony. In the 1950s and 1960s the annual average percentage of marriages celebrated by ministers of religion was in the high 80s, nearly 90 per cent. Since 1975 this has dropped markedly and in 1980 it was 63.7 per cent. I appreciate the fact that most of those who have divorced under the provision of the Family Law Act of 1975 were married in a church, initially for a variety of reasons, many of which had nothing to do with religious conviction. Many of them had to do with the opportunity to get dressed up and to be photographed in a rather pretty setting, not to mention church marriages for the sake of pacifying relations. One has every respect, of course, for the opinions of those for whom such life crises as birth, death and marriage need this extra element of supernatural sanction, but there is no justification in fact for extrapolating this belief to the whole community, especially in a not very religious country such as Australia. There is even less justification for using this as a reason for insisting that a decree nisi should not be issued except in the presence of the applicant or applicant's counsel. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this particular amendment is eminently sensible. It acknowledges that at this point in many applications for dissolution there remains only the formality of issuing the decree, and valuable time and resources can be saved for the benefit of other less far advanced cases. It acknowledges too that the expense to the parties of another court appearance cannot be justified in the circumstances enumerated by the clause. Women, the majority of applicants, are particularly at a disadvantage because of their lower earning capacity and legal aid is not generally available for dissolution. If the applicant is domiciled in a rural town, and engages a local solicitor, the costs, including the costs of travel-for example, from places such as Esperance or Kununurra to Perth-can be considerable. Surely it is for the applicant to decide whether some psychological benefit is to be derived from attendance at the last rites, the analogy used by those who advocate compulsory attendance at such ceremonies. Where the emotional ties and conflicts remain unresolved observance at a brief hearing, although an expensive one, is unlikely to heal the scars and it should not be presumed that it is an adequate or sufficient substitute for the long term counselling and support which may be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Examination of the details of those marriages of the 1950s and 1960s which constitute the majority of those marriages which have been the subject of the 1975-80 divorce applications indicates some of the reasons for the increased incidence which is erroneously attributed to the introduction of the no-fault Act. The increase in the proportion of teenage marriages in those two decades has been an important factor in the upward trend, such early marriage being demonstrably subject to a high risk of breakdown. Page 47 of volume 2 of the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . of the dissolutions granted in 1977, 11.7 per cent of husbands and 40.7 per cent of wives were married before age 20 years and the proportions were only slightly lower in the early seventies. The combination of youth of both parties, premarital pregnancy and relatively low income status of the husband seems to have offered the greatest threat to the survival of marriage. </PARA>
<PARA>More counselling at the time of potential dissolution is apparently having its effect and the improved success rate is commendable and encouraging. An equally or more valuable use of funds would be comprehensive and formalised premarriage counselling and information as advocated by both the Family Law Council and the Joint Select Committee and, I am happy to hear, also Senator Martyr. Marriage aspirants should be informed of the legal and social implications of being married and each given a written summary of rights and responsibilities of married persons. Some of us look forward to the day when such premarital procedures include defined property rights of husbands and wives which, when introduced, will help to reduce the length of hearings, long delays, high costs and the resentment which accumulates against the process of law which currently characterise too many property settlements. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of indicators of breakdown of marriage, page 35 of Volume 2 of the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Harvey from the Attorney-General's Department, suggested that the number of deserted wives is a more accurate measure of instability than divorce rates and that, if there were fewer deserted wives but more divorces, it would follow that there was a better sorting out of relationships. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately our culture prefers to cling to old myths about fairy-tale romances, the future wreathed in tulle and orange blossom and suffused by a rosy glow. Expectations in too many instances are quite unreal and if they were ever real, which I doubt, they are now totally outmoded. There is little understanding of the legal position or changing social patterns and trends. Examination of data from earlier decades shows what dramatic changes have occurred in family patterns. Late age at marriage and high proportions of people who have never married, especially amongst men, contrasts with almost universal and comparatively very early marriage in recent decades. Early in the twentieth century women bore their families over the length of their productive years, the last pregnancy usually occurring in their forties so that a woman still had a child to care for during her fifties and she rarely attained her seventieth birthday. It was truly an adult life spent bearing and rearing children. Of course, she would work to supplement her husband's income, but rarely outside of the home or of the immediate neighbourhood. </PARA>
<PARA> The woman of the 1960s and 1970s has married much younger-the median age has been between 21 and 22 since 1951-but many have postponed their childbearing until their late twenties, restricted their family size to two or three children and by age 35 or 40 are embarking upon another 25 years of productive rather than reproductive life. The opportunity to obtain paid employment outside of the home has undoubtedly been a factor in providing the sense of economic independence as an alternative to marriage which has gone sour or which has not lived up to expectations. Dr Holger Stub, a researcher in social gerontology at Temple University in Philadelphia, is quoted in an article in the West Australian of 25 November 1981 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> You have to take a realistic view of the emotional toll of longevity on marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> Longer lives mean more time for strains to develop in marriage and, consequently, more divorces. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased longevity also allows men and women virtually to bargain for two marriages-one for the young family years and one for the post-parental period.</PARA>
<PARA> Though this sounds amoral to romantics or the religiously-oriented, it is not merely a possibility but is actually taking place. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> And, while this introduces a certain chilly planned obsolescence into marital relationships, it may indeed, he says, become a trend. </PARA>
<PARA> Two categories of divorce have increased in recent years-couples with young children and older couples who have been married 20 or more years. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Longevity', says Dr Stub, ''has added as much as a quarter of a century of close living to many marriages. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The high level of insight, good fortune and adaptable personality required to have a 50-year marriage are, as yet, not too plentiful among applicants for marriage licences. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the moralising and obsession with innocence and guilt still discernible in the written and spoken declarations of some of our colleagues, I am assured that in a majority of cases which are currently in the course of dissolution there is no third party involved. Even where the purpose of a dissolution is to establish a fresh liaison only the most harsh and hidebound would, I suggest, seriously argue for regression to divorce based on fault or on narrow sectarian prejudice. </PARA>
<PARA> Referring to another amendment which is before us, I believe that attaching the power of arrest to injunctions is a welcome addition to the Act, providing substance and credibility to its stature in the eyes of those who are most at risk of violence and those who seek to protect them. Maureen Kingshot, in a paper prepared for the Labor Women's Conference in January 1982, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Vexatious litigants, judge murderers, and policemen who don't want to know about injunctions against domestic violence still exist, and continue as a symbol of the Family Court's struggle to exert its authority and have itself taken seriously, as part of our ordinary court system. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the notion still exists in the community that a man owns his wife and family and has the right to vent upon them the anger and frustration for which he perceives no other outlet. We have seen the recent extraordinary approach of the senior counsellor of the Family Court, Mr McKenzie, who sought support from trade unions for his opposition to hand over facilities, suggesting as he did that much domestic violence was engendered by passive women exercising their lack of influence, thus provoking physical attack. His distorted view has been totally rejected by the Chief Judge of the Family Court and also by the Director of the Institute of Family Studies, the latter having, I believe, requested that the individual concerned be asked to relinquish his committee position on the Family Law Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as a Western Australian, I draw to the attention of honourable senators the position of the judges of the Western Australian Family Court, who had been collectively guaranteed appointment to the Australian family law appeal court. They are angry and disappointed that only one of their number has been so appointed. The historic and geographic isolation of Western Australia makes it particularly desirable that Western Australian judges be afforded the opportunity of participation in the national appeal process and that they should be also able to contribute to the development of family law, which development is at present seen as the sole province of the dreaded eastern States. If some decision has already been made that the integration process is to stop with the appointment of Mr Justice Barblett to the Australian family law appeal court, I request that the matter be urgently reconsidered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the second reading stage of the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. During this debate members of this chamber will express their personal views-the views which are the basis of their experience and the representations that have been made to them over many years concerning the operations of the Famly Law Act. It is significant that at least we are now reaching a point at which perhaps the second reading stage of this Bill may be concluded and we will commence the more important stage, the Committee stage, at which we shall deal with a considerable mass of amendments which are before the Parliament already.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth reminding ourselves that consideration of the Bill has taken a very leisurely course. In July 1980 the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act, consisting of members from both Houses of Parliament, on which I had the honour to serve, reported to Parliament. It made a number of important recommendations- I think in all 72, of which 27 found their way into the Attorney-General's Bill. On the basis of the discussion of that Bill many others may be considered as well. The Government announced its views on dealing with the Bill. This is not a Government Bill except in the sense that it is presented by the Government. But, of course it involves matters on which traditionally all members of parliament exercise their own judgments. We have had a debate which commenced on 20 October 1981 and resumed on 16 and 24 March of this year, and now tonight it resumes again. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an important debate on a very important subject, because, in my view, the Family Law Act 1975 was the single most significant and valuable social reform of the 1970s. It managed to make a very dramatic difference to family law arrangements in Australia. It updated them a degree which had long been thought impossible. We have really started leading the world-truly we can say that we have done that-in the way in which the Family Court of Australia has operated and in the various other machinery provisions which have been provided in that legislation. I say, as one who served on the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which likewise made a full investigation of the Bill in 1974-most of its recommendations were adopted by the Parliament; unfortunately, not quite all of them-that the Parliament, in adopting that Bill, showed by the solid majority of people who supported a change in family law, that there were great expectations for improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the results of the massive committee report that I have before me, based on 15 months of investigation and involving a great number of expert witnesses, vindicates and justifies the general system of family law which we adopted in 1975. We conducted an examination very soon after that Bill came into operation. We did it in the absence at that time of the Insitute of Family Studies which has, unfortunately, commenced operation only in recent years. But with those limitations, I think that there was sufficient evidence for the great majority of the Committee to come down solidly in favour of the operation of the Court and, while making a number of useful proposals and suggested amendments, to come to a conclusion that the ground of divorce based on irretrievable breakdown proved by one year's separation was indeed adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Martyr asked why there was not an objective test. I must assure him that there is nothing more objective as a test than one year's separation. That is an objective test. It was recommended to the Parliament at that time and was adopted by it. It is in the law and in no way is it recommended by the Joint Committee that it should be changed. I make one other reference to Senator Martyr's views expressed earlier. He says that this is just a matter of law, and not a matter of social need or sociology. I could not disagree more with that view. The whole family law situation is not just a matter of law. Laws are important for society, and it is important that they be clear and effective. But there is a great deal more to family law than that, and the whole operation of the Family Court, which is based on unit operation, on the use of experts and on the need for conciliation, counselling and so forth, covers a great deal more than merely setting up a system of law. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Martyr and some others who are critics of the system talk about the restoration of guilt and innocence. I do not propose to go into those worn out concepts to any degree tonight. As one who practised in the family law area for many years-when we passed the Bill in 1975 I think that I was the one practising lawyer in this area serving in the Parliament-I can say that one does not want to return in any way to that area of guilt and innocence, to the ridiculous waste of money and time and of people's lives that was based upon trying to prove whether someone was guilty of some offence. Guilt was always spread between the parties. Guilt and innocence were useless concepts and only did damage, particularly to the lives of children. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that time, fortunately, we have had the opportunity to see in practice what has been done. I do not intend tonight to go into all the details of the operations of this Bill or the Act as it stands. Senator Evans, in a speech in March of this year, dealt comprehensively with the area covered by the Bill. With the exception of statements which he has made on open courts and publication of proceedings-on which I stand strongly in disagreement-I am in total agreement with him. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that the Joint Committee report adopted in 1980 was a vindication of the no fault system as adopted-that we would hereafter determine that divorces would be granted if one year's separation occurred, and that we would not seek to find the faults of the parties. We set up the Family Court to operate this system, with specialist judges who have been appointed, with particular interests and knowledge in these areas. By and large, although perhaps with some exceptions, we have found dedicated, valuable, excessively hard-working judges who have performed an enormous amount of valuable work in the community since that time. But in addition to that many experts have been used in the court. The conciliation and counselling that takes place and the use of deputy registrars to look at the financial affairs of parties to try as far as possible to eliminate a great deal of conflict have been valuable. The report , which I urge everyone to read, shows the justification. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the Committee's deliberations about 200 individuals made submissions. There were many more than that-700 or 800 altogether-but about 200 individuals had complaints about the way in which their cases had been handled. Of course, it was not possible for the Committee to examine these cases in detail. It would not have been possible, because the Committee would have had to examine what the other parties had to say about the situation and to ask the judges how they reflected on the whole matter. That, of course, was not possible . However, the significant thing about the 200 cases is that at that time 200, 000 people had been through the Family Court, and of the 200,000, 0.1 per cent, or about 200 people, chose to put criticisms before the Committee. The significance is in the numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems which the Committee found were quite considerable, because apart from the desire that we had to create a system which would cover all family law matters, unfortunately it is still the position today that that unity of jurisdiction does not exist. I lay the blame essentially on a number of State governments over the years that have failed to do the obvious-to refer power to the Court to deal with the custody of ex-nuptial children-not legitimate children. They should be dealt with within the same Court and receive the same type of justice. That fundamental absence of justice is not due to any fault on the part of the Courts themselves. It lies essentially at the doors of the State governments, which have dilly-dallied for years and have refused the request of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to surrender the powers which are of no use to them but which lead to people going from one court to another obtaining separate determinations in respect of their children. The same problem arises in respect of property matters, where people may have to jump from court to court- State court or Federal court-depending on whether divorce proceedings have been commenced. Again, the States have failed to surrender those powers. It is a wicked situation which has caused perhaps millions of dollars of loss to people. A great deal of hardship must be laid at the doors of State governments for their neglect in regard to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Act came into operation the divorce figures showed an early rise. This caused the Jeremiahs in our midst-some of them quite close to me here-to be very unhappy. Marriages could break down; the floodgates would be opened; divorce rates would go up tremendously, and so forth. In the first year of operation of the Act the figure went up to 69,000. People had only to look at the previous figures to see what happens when a substantial change is made to the divorce law. People tend to hold back, to wait for the new law. They do not proceed until it comes into operation. The figure went up to 69,000 and then went down to under 40,000. The figure is now rising again slowly, in accord with the growth in the divorce rate which is to be found in most Western societies. There has been a change in society's views and in the wishes of the people which have led to some increase in divorce over the years. The Family Law Act was not responsible for that. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who criticise this Act constantly ignore the difference between the divorce rate and the marriage breakdown rate. As Senator Coleman, who was the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, and I realise, and the experts indicated this to the Committee, the breakdown rate has been fairly constant throughout society . There have been people who could not divorce, people who had to continue living together or stay separated, unable to remarry or create new families. Of course, that is the fundamental figure about which we are concerned, not the divorce rate. We have seen fall away the hysteria which was apparent immediately after the Act came into operation. Speaking of hysteria, I turn to my colleague Senator Martyr, who sits next to me. With the greatest degree of kindness in the world, I think that, unfortunately, he is afflicted with the problems of the Bourbons, who learnt nothing and forgot nothing. I am afraid that Senator Martyr now girds his loins to fight again this general question, as of course he and others fought it in 1974.

I could also be reading here tonight the article which he recently wrote to the Institute of Public Affairs of New South Wales in which he repeated the same mistake. Senator Martyr stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The terms of reference of the Joint Select Committee of the Family Law Act give no definition of 'the institution of marriage', but there was general acceptance among the Inquiry of the definition of marriage contained in S.43 of the Family Law Act, which is as follows . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is the quotation which he gave as appearing to come from section 43 of the Family Law Act but from which it does not come:</PARA>

What one sees when one looks at section 43 as to what the court is required to have regard to-this is what Senator Martyr is referring to-is the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. It is nothing more than that. There is no reference in that so-called quotation of Senator Martyr's of marriage being publicly entered into or for the partners to afford mutual help, comfort, protection, support and so on. If Senator Martyr would argue like that in a formal document and then repeat it in a published document to the Institute of Public Affairs, to which I have now replied, then I am afraid that very little credence can be given to his argument. The only matter in his speech with which I can agree is the fact that the law does influence behaviour. He said that in a speech on another occasion and I agree with him. The law does influence behaviour, but it does not determine what people do in life. It is an important influence, and a good family law is an important and valuable influence on behaviour in this community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall turn from the martyrdom which Senator Martyr has made of the Act to deal with what we are doing in regard to this Bill. We are providing here running repairs on the operation of the Act. As a Committee we found certain defects, certain things which will work better if we change them. As a Committee we were concerned at the delays which take place in the courts and we made recommendations about this. Fortunately, in the period since the Committee sat, more court cousellors and deputy registrars have been appointed. At the Melbourne Registry, which was one of the worst affected by delays-this was a serious matter for litigants-the delays have been greatly decreased. I believe that for undefended divorces there is now a delay of about six weeks or eight weeks and for defended cases the period is usually six months to eight months or so. A great deal of improvement has occurred in the operation of the law since then. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters I dealt with in my dissenting report-I will not table it, but I hope that honourable senators will read it because it deals with certain things about which I thought the Committee needed to be stronger-concerns a reference to the attitude of lawyers which early in the operation of the Act was inadequate. I wish to quote a reference on page 206 of the Committee's report to remarks made by Mr Justice Butler. In relation to the approaches adopted in the early stages by judges as well as other lawyers under the Family Law Act Mr Justice Butler stated:</PARA>
<PARA> However, if the attitude is adopted that lawyers have no need of sociological approaches, but simply need to know the law and to adopt a forensic stance which is no different from that in other courts, then we have made no progress-the legal profession spells the beginning of its own end in the family law jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>Fortunately I think one can say that there has been great improvement there, that lawyers and other experts have specialised in and are now knowledgeable in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill that is before us-the Attorney-General's Bill-incorporates, as I said, some 27 of the recommendations of the Committee. I think one may say that one of the highlights is that the Government is now proposing to use all the constitutional powers that it believes it has. It will stretch the custody and property powers to the extent that they can go. It may be that it will fall foul of the High Court of Australia which, regrettably, has done a fair amount of damage, I think, to the operation of family law in some of its rulings in recent years. But we would hope that these powers will be upheld in the High Court and that will therefore mitigate the deficiencies which the States have imposed upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the recommendations in the Bill there will be less requirement of attendance at courts. Of course, there was a certain amount of hysteria earlier on by some people who thought that this was divorce by post and things of that sort. This Bill will allow divorce without court attendance. But of course for years that has been the position, that the only requirement necessary is an attendance by a lawyer on behalf of one of the parties. There is no requirement necessarily of the parties to be there. The paper work, the details, the investigation and whether the children are properly being attended to are matters which are dealt with well before the matter comes before the court and the saving to people of expense which is proposed by the Attorney-General's draft will be very valuable. We should certainly avoid any hysteria on the idea that we must have a parade of parties or, as Senator Shirley Walters wants, all the parties, to attend the hearing so that a great deal of expense and difficulty will occur unless the judge excuses someone from attendance. I find her amendment in this respect quite unsatisfactory also. I think it would be a very backward step so far as the courts are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney's Bill also strengthens the injunction power so that it will be protective particularly of wives who are suffering bashings or who are unable to get protection. At the moment there are difficulties about this and the proposals are sensible ones. It also overcomes something which unfortunately has been in the Bill since 1975-despite the attempts of the Senate committee in 1974 -and that is the requirement that the wishes of 14-year-old children have to be observed; at some magic stage when they reach 14 years of age their wishes have to be observed. Before that they were just taken into account. Now there is a general provision that all such wishes will be taken into account by the court but the court will be left with the fundamental discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, among the major highlights of the Attorney's Bill, are the provisions which will help with regard to people's rights to superannuation. People will not find that because they are divorced now and their marriage is severed the rights they have also worked for-perhaps as a wife to help and support her husband for years-will disappear so that in three years he will be entitled to a great lump sum of superannuation and she will be entitled to nothing and he will be able to get away with it. These provisions which are made at the moment to allow the adjournment of these applications for longer periods will, I think, do greater justice to people in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, I have quite a number of amendments which I will be moving in the course of this debate. It is important that after all this delay we get the best Act that we can now and that we do not just take some amendments and then come back next year. We have seen how difficult it is to get the Parliament to turn itself to consideration of these matters. Among the amendments which I will be moving are some 11 which have been drafted on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Phillip Ruddock. These are recommendations which were in the Joint Committee report but which were not picked up in the Attorney's Bill. They are recommendations which will promote the early settlement of cases so that they will not drag on, with great cost to the parties. It is important that settlements should not be forced on people because they do not have legal aid but it is important also that every attempt should be made to settle claims at an early stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision will be sought to be made through amendments that will be moved to protect a child following the death of that child's sole custodian. The provision will be that in such an event the child will automatically be made a ward of the court. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Committee recommended, proposals will be presented for criteria to be set out for custody decisions. At the moment criteria in regard to maintenance and other matters are set out in the Act. However, when determining custody the court is left very much at large. Of course it is concerned to decide what is in the best interests of the children, but no guide is given to it that it should take into account certain matters. The Committee felt that these should be specified as at least guidelines in the Act and we will try to do so. There are amendments which will seek to reduce litigation in regard to custody. Long drawn out custody cases and constant returns to the Court are some of the real bugbears of the system and have been for many years. This is a course of great expense to the parties and the Commonwealth and is a course of great anguish for children. </PARA>
<PARA> I will also move an amendment in respect of the way in which Commonwealth departments should disclose information that they have about the whereabouts of a child. There are difficulties in getting this information now. I think it is high time that Commonwealth departments, under proper supervision and with proper respect for people's privacy, should give this information which is in their possession. There is also an amendment proposing the annual review of child maintenance which, of course, as a result of inflation ought to change more regularly otherwise people must go back to court at great expense to achieve what they seek. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments that I will move include some which were suggested by the Family Law Committee of the Australian Law Council. They mainly seek to overcome practice defects and, I think, would be sensible and valuable improvements on the Bill. Likewise the Family Law Council has suggested a number of amendments, some of which are picked up in the more recent amendments which the Attorney- General has tabled. However, there are others, particularly in relation to the principles that ought to operate in this Act. Conciliation and readjustment, not just reconciliation, should be part of the aims of the Act. What the Court does mostly is not just reconcile people who have fallen apart. That is not something the Court can generally do. It is important that it conciliates to reduce the amount of friction and help people readjust their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Family Court judges also have cause for complaint. I hope to move an amendment regarding their emoluments. I want to see the restoration of the level of their remuneration to that of the Federal Court judges' scale which they were on but from which they have slipped. We must consider that matter and also whether there should be an appeals division which is proposed in the Government' s Bill. There is a great deal of criticism from Family Court judges-I think with some value-of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The important matters in this debate are not once more those which were considered in 1974. Surely the purpose is not to fight the Family Law Act and the system-the 1974 show. That would fly entirely in the face of the bulk of evidence and the recommendations of the Joint Committee. Of course what will be debated substantially-I will not go into details on this aspect-is the question of open courts which the Committee, by a majority, recommended. I and a number of others were not happy with that proposal. It is a question whether one believes in publicity, freedom of information perhaps in regard to the Family Court, overriding privacy which, in this area, I think is important. But more important than open courts is the question of publication. This Bill contains proposals which I regard as quite crazy. They are ones under which anybody with any ingenuity, who in the past through the gutter Press tried to deride people, will operate with a great deal of ease. I hope the Bill, with suitable amendments, will pass. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I join in the debate on the second reading of the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981 out of concern for the future of marriage and families in our society and the widespread implications of the legislation. In doing so let me say at the outset that it is not through any lack of compassion or understanding for those in our community who are in the unfortunate position of going through divorce or custody proceedings that I wish to raise some doubts about the proposed changes. Indeed, since the whole matter came up for discussion people with every viewpoint on this issue have come to see me. Divorce is a time-consuming, emotionally draining and financially taxing procedure. I can appreciate that those involved would want to reduce these factors as much as possible. However, more than the considerations of cost cutting and time saving is involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Family Law Act 1975, which came into operation on 5 January 1976, made a major change in the law relating to divorce by providing that the sole ground for divorce in Australia was to be the irretrievable breakdown of marriage, the proof of which was to rest only on 12 months' separation of the parties preceding the date of the filing of the application. To quote the words of the then Attorney-General Senator Lionel Murphy, the reason for this was:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to eliminate as far as possible, the high costs, the delays, and indignities experienced by so many parties to divorce proceedings, under the existing Matrimonial Causes Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Family Law Act proposed to buttress the stability of marriage and encourage reconciliation. The more popular understanding, however, was that it was passed to make divorce easier. As Senator Missen said, the number of divorces rose from 24,307 in 1975 to 63,267 in 1976, after one year of operation of the Act. Of course, we acknowledge that one contributing factor for the increase in divorces in 1976 was the backlog which built up before the implementation of the new Act. I guess people thought that when the new Act came in they would take advantage of the more acceptable provisions. There was a gradual drop in the number of divorces each year after that until 1980. In that year the number of divorces granted exceeded by 1,404 those of 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> No one would deny that the institution of marriage and the family unit have undergone significant changes over time, by demographic changes on the one hand and economic, social and technological changes on the other. Furthermore, the degree of responsibility which the so-called welfare state has taken upon itself for support of the family has taken some of the pressure off the marriage partners and opened up new material possibilities, such as housing, security of income, health, education, day care for pre-schoolers and the prospect for women particularly of greater participation in the labour force with the psychological and financial benefits that come with it. All of this has contributed in no small way to a lessening of the strength of the family unit. Today people are becoming more and more concerned at the incidence of marriage and family breakdown. Indeed some submissions to the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act showed that people believed that the Act actually encourages them to look upon marriage as a temporary arrangement, with no commitment to permanency.</PARA>
<PARA> I was sorry to hear Senator Giles quote a statement by the Attorney-General ( Senator Durack) indicating that he felt the traditional moral and religious values had been rejected. I feel that is probably why so many marriages are breaking up. According to the Family Foundation of Victoria the Act discourages the commitment necessary for marriage to flourish. The Catholic welfare organisation, Centacare, asserts that legislation itself affects community standards, that the law is so phrased that for many people it becomes moral law and that civil law generally becomes a standard of behaviour. Women's Action Alliance feels that the legislation counters the stabilising influence on marriage which it believes is Parliament's role to maintain. I believe there is truth in the notion that one can reach a point where making a practice easier actually promotes the practice. I also believe that clause 41 of the proposed amendments actually reaches that point in relation to divorce. It makes the dissolution of marriage a mere bureaucratic process. I disagree with Senator Missen in that I believe that, as we have witnesses to a marriage, there ought to be somebody there when we are dissolving a marriage. It should not be a case of just writing in and getting a divorce. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is not just a case of divorce by post. I do not like it at all. The Anglican Archbishops of Australia have a valid point to make in their comments on this part of the proposed amendments. They say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Marriage is not simply a private arrangement between two individuals. It is also a public act, significant for the community. The law recognises this by requiring the presence at a marriage of an authorised celebrant and at least two witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA>This bears out what I said before. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> It is indeed regrettable when a marriage ends in divorce, but if a divorce does occur, it is no less a public act than the act of marrying. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if there are children of the marriage, the act of divorcing may have even more important public significance than the original act of marrying. </PARA>
<PARA>To my way of thinking there is something very superficial and short term about the concept of sparing parties the trauma of separation proceedings. Whether by death or divorce, separation is a painful experience but the grief has to be accepted and dealt with. I believe that the solemnity of marriage demands that clause 41-proposed section 98A, which relates to divorce by post-is not passed into law. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many aspects of the proposed changes which are to be commended, particularly changes in relation to the settling of maintenance and property issues, including the right of a party to share in the former husband's superannuation or other such benefits when they become available. These provisions should prevent financial hardship in many cases and allow for greater justice in the settlement. Likewise, the amendments relating to children have generally made provision for their welfare in a way which the existing Act has failed to do. However, whilst I commend some of the provisions of the 1982 Amendment Bill, I feel sorry about the fact that no attempt has been made to restore the dignity of marriage and to safeguard the stability of marriage. I make specific reference here to clause 18 of the Bill relative to section 48 of the principal Act. No mention has been made of any change in the grounds for the dissolution of marriage. Indeed, the single no fault, year's separation continues as the sole ground for the dissolution of the marriage contract. Senator Missen said there was no way in the world that that would not remain as it is now. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that this is not in the interests of marriage and the family and that, indeed, the separation period could be extended to two years. Too often these days couples are inadequately prepared to enter into a permanent commitment and, being aware of the present legislation, look on marriage as a temporary arrangement which is easily terminated. Since the Family Law Act was enacted in 1975 over 300,000 children have been affected by divorce in their families. Many of these victims will be ill-prepared to enter into a stable marriage when the occasion arises unless provision is made for them to receive more adequate marriage preparation and, when appropriate, premarital counselling . </PARA>
<PARA> The Catholic Family Welfare Bureau in Brisbane has provided marriage counsellors for the Family Court since its inception and has been in a unique position to study the effects of the legislation. It has found that greater stability in marriage can be ensured only through requiring more adequate preparation for those entering marriage and by making divorce less readily available. I therefore think, as I said earlier, that much more energy and legislative thrust should be put into providing more adequate marriage preparation and premarriage counselling. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to say that we, as elected representatives of the people of this nation, and indeed all Australians should consider carefully the changing face of marriage and ultimately divorce. Are we giving enough care and consideration to the future of the institution of marriage and to the children who are the victims of broken marriages? In our endeavours to reduce costs and minimise emotional trauma, are we not contributing to the ultimate demise of that which we are supposedly trying to help-that is, the family unit? I feel that marriage is much more than a legal contract. It involves both a personal and social commitment and should not be dissolved without ensuring that both parties have the opportunity to be present and to be heard. I do not think that we want to think of marriage just as being a temporary arrangement-and that, I am afraid, is what some of the amendments to the Act might bring about. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity for obtaining a decree of dissolution of marriage by the presentation of false affidavit evidence ought not to be widened, and to allow this to happen on the basis of eliminating the cost of personal attendance of an applicant who conducts his own application at the hearing-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not the case. You want to read the clause. It is where it is an undisputed case where both parties agree that the marriage has broken down.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes remaining for debate tonight I wish to commence my remarks on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1981. The Bill is particularly important as the first comprehensive review of the 1975 Family Law Act. It follows a thorough investigation of the Act and its operation by the parliamentary Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act which reported in 1980. Additionally, there have been the annual reports of the Family Law Council, which was set up to make recommendations to the Attorney-General concerning the workings of the Act on an ongoing basis. The Bill takes up certain of the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee and others of the Family Law Council. In some cases, provsions of the Bill have the support of both the Committee and the Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the second reading debate I intend to put to the Senate my attitude to the provisions of the Bill as they relate to the views I hold on the subject of family law generally and the Family Law Act in particular. Those views I have formulated as a practitioner of the former Matrimonial Causes Act and from daily contact with practitioners of the Family Law Act. Under provisions of the Marriage Act, the celebrant is called upon to state to the parties:</PARA>
<PARA> Marriage according to law in Australia is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 43 of the Family Law Act similarly obliges the Family Court Act of Australia in the exercise of its jurisdiction to have regard to the need to preserve and protect the instititution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. Unless we wish to challenge that basic premise it must be the starting point of any family law debate and it is a premise with which I have no quarrel. </PARA>
<PARA> Closely related is the obligation of the Family Court under the same provision to have regard to the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly when it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children. Again, I support that objective. The proposal for the Family Court of Australia was the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which was assisted by a paper entitled 'An Australian Family Court' written by Mr R. Watson, Q.C., as he then was. In it he said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the family is the linchpin of a civilised society, the preservation and protection of marriage is a constantly sought goal of a good society. Therefore, marriage breakdown, particularly in its effect on children, is seen as a social ill to be prevented if possible. </PARA>
<PARA>So, marriage at law has a meaning but the institution of marriage goes much further. It goes to the exchange of vows and the moral consequences of breach of those vows. It goes to the role of the family as a linchpin of our society and to the responsibility of the community to offer it the widest possible protection and assistance. It is the relationship between the institution of marriage, with all the social connotations of that expression, and the responsibilities of the statute law of Australia insofar as it should play a part in the support of that institution that raises such deep public debate and concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Marriage is not a contract in the normal legal meaning as attached to that expression. Our law does not provide that upon marriage the parties shall be deemed to have entered into some form of contract covering their relationship with each other, the offspring of the marriage, or the property of the parties to the marriage. It is not a contract capable of being enforced by legal action and that, upon a breach, a party to which has some right of action. Marriage at law does, however, have consequences at law. Such consequences reflect what the community expects of marriage and what it sees as the responsibility of marriage . For example, the community has traditionally seen marriage as a life-long institution. It has not, therefore, been prepared to accept dissolution at the will of the parties. The community has, however, evolved to the view that where there has been an irreconcilable breakdown-where the fabric of the marriage has been lost and all that remains is the legal tie-there should be a procedure at law whereby the legal tie can be severed. Furthermore, the community sees a responsibility of married persons to children of the marriage. This is reflected in the law that they should be responsible for the care and maintenance of those children until otherwise determined by law. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be argued that the law should go further and specifically regulate marriage between the parties and their obligations to each other. This is certainly a possibility which is open and in the case of some jurisdictions with marriage contracts and principle of community of property it has, in fact, gone that far. It is from the ecclesiastical laws and the notion of breach of vows or breach of obligations of marriage that the basis of the grounds for dissolution under the Matrimonial Causes Act-that of matrimonial fault-can be found. The law reflected a community recognition that if one party destroyed the fabric of the marriage by an act of adultery, desertion, cruelty, or some other specified matrimonial offence, the other party should have the right to dissolve the legal tie. Although it was not the language of the law, in fact, in today's terminology, the matrimonial offences were evidence of irreconcilable breakdown and are still used for that purpose in the United Kingdom today. But there was soon a recognition that marriage may irreconcilably break down without the specific guilt of one party and so developed the ground of separation. </PARA>

<PARA> Certain changes were made in February of this year to eligibility for supplementary assistance. One change was that tenants who had accommodation in public housing authority buildings and who applied for it after February 1982 were not eligible to receive supplementary assistance. Those who were already in such accommodation prior to 1 February 1982 were not to be disadvantaged and still were able to receive some supplementary assistance, albeit not at the higher rate that was allowed after February 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to ask what happens in a situation like this: Suppose a person is renting a housing commission home-a public authority home-in Queensland, was there prior to February 1982 and is receiving a pension plus supplementary assistance at the old rate. Suppose that person takes a job for a short period but earns only enough so that the person is still eligible for a full pension.</PARA>
<PARA> The case that I am thinking of is that a person goes out and works for a certain number of weeks but does not earn beyond the maximum annual rate that would preclude that person from obtaining the full pension. While that person is out working, certainly no supplementary assistance is payable because that person is receiving more than the eligible limit of income. </PARA>
<PARA> What I would like to know is this: When that person is no longer earning an income, can that person go back onto supplementary assistance? In other words, there has been a break in the receipt of supplementary assistance; the person is still in a housing commission home; the person was receiving the supplementary assistance prior to gaining some income; can that person then go back onto supplementary assistance or is it regarded as a new case? Because that person is in public authority accommodation, is that person not then eligible for the supplementary assistance?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The changes made last February to the supplementary assistance were aimed, firstly, to provide greater assistance to those who paid high private rents and who were therefore seen as being most in need of assistance and, secondly, to remove the effect of double subsidy that applied when people were tenants in State housing commission accommodation-that is, accommodation which is provided under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement at a rigidly controlled rental, usually a maximum of one-fifth of the pension. So there is usually in those cases an effective subsidy probably in the order of $20 a week or more. It does vary from place to place according to the rental value of the house. To avoid the hardship which can be felt-hardship is usually a relative matter-when there is a diminution of income the Government determined to have a no-detriment provision which meant that those already in public housing in receipt of supplementary assistance would continue to receive it, as Senator Colston said this evening, at the old rate and therefore did not suffer a diminution of what is of course a fairly limited income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The precise example that Senator Colston has raised is not one that I have had to consider. A comparable example, however, is when a tenant ceases to be a tenant in public housing and then subsequently becomes a tenant in public housing so that there is a break in entitlement for a different reason than the one Senator Colston has put before the Senate tonight. In that circumstance my recollection is that the entitlement to supplementary assistance ceases. I think by way of analogy that the entitlement to supplementary assistance probably ceases also in the case that Senator Colston has put before us. Although I was told that Senator Colston would be speaking on the matter of supplementary assistance I was not sure of the precise point that he wished to raise. I have not considered before the precise point that he has raised. Therefore, I give that as an answer which is subject to confirmation. I will seek that confirmation by examining carefully the rules governing this particular benefit as early as I can tomorrow. I will try to give him a final reply tomorrow. </PARA>
