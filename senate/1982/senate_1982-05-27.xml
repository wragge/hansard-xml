<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia, concerned about the high and increasing rate of divorce and family breakdown, convinced that the Family Law Act has weakened marriage by making divorce a trivial matter, the present Act paying scant regard to its own definition of marriage as a life-long union, and believing that the legal bond of marriage should be strengthened, humbly petition for the Family Law Act and the Marriage Act to be amended in order to:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Reject any moves towards divorce by post</PARA>

<TITLE>Employment of Early Childhood Consultant</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That citizens of South Australia are gravely concerned over a recent decision by the Commonwealth Public Service not to renew the employment of Miss Joan Fry with the Commonwealth Department of Education and to eliminate her position as Early Childhood Consultant and Assistant Secretary to the Educational Planning Group of that Department.</PARA>
<PARA> Since June 1976, Miss Fry has served the Department in the capacity of Early Childhood Consultant and Assistant Secretary to the Educational Planning Group of the Department of Education. Miss Fry is a distinguished early childhood educator whose contributions to education are widely recognised. During 1973 she served as chairman of the Australian Preschools Committee which produced a report ''Care and Education of Young Children'' known as the ''Fry Report''. The extensive nature and worth of her contributions to children's services were recognised when she was awarded an Order of the British Empire in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that no useful purpose could be gained by terminating Miss Fry's appointment to the Educational Planning Group and, further, that Australia would be deprived of the services of a distinguished person, and that children's services would be adversely impacted by the elimination of the early childhood consultant position on the Educational Planning Group.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled , should take every step as necessary to ensure that the Australian Government retain the services of this distinguished early childhood educator and that the position of Early Childhood Consultant and Assistant Secretary to the Educational Planning Group of the Commonwealth Department of Education be maintained.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Durack, is almost a question with notice. I refer the Minister to a letter that I wrote to him, dated 26 May, in which the following questions appeared: 1. Senator Chaney told the Senate yesterday that the Minister for Primary Industry did not know of the misuse of funds by dairy manufacturers until last Wednesday. That being the case, did Mr Nixon comply with recommendation 8.7 of the Bowen guidelines by informing the Prime Minister or Acting Prime Minister that the matters raised a real or apparent conflict of interest for him? 2. Did the Prime Minister, if he was informed by Mr Nixon, comply with recommendation 8.7 (a) by arranging for another Minister to deal with the matter or giving explicit authorisation to Mr Nixon to proceed with it; (b) by recording the matter? 3. It was indicated at Question Time that the Minister for Primary Industry was obliged to hold shares in the Murray Goulburn dairy co-operative because he was a dairy farmer. Is he, in fact, still deriving his farm income from dairying or has he been involved for some time exclusively with beef cattle raising? 4. If he is no longer a dairy farmer, why does he continue to hold shares in a dairy co-operative with which his Department has dealings? 5. What steps have been taken to impose penalty interest payments on companies which have withheld Reserve Bank advances? 6. What is the period for which the misuse of advances of $11.7m, as indicated by the Australian Dairy Corporation on Monday, has occurred? 7. Are similar arrangements made by the Reserve Bank for other primary industries? 8. If so, what checks are made to see that the same abuses are not occurring?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the series of questions which Senator Button has just asked, and of which he gave me notice yesterday, are as follows: As to whether Mr Nixon informed the Prime Minister or the Acting Prime Minister that the matters raised a real or apparent conflict of interest, he did not, for the following reasons. On 19 May Mr Nixon was advised of the present situation after the Australian Dairy Corporation investigations revealed the extent of the breaches. Immediately on receiving that advice Mr Nixon asked the Chairman of the Corporation, Mr Vawser, to return to Australia from London to deal with the matter personally. This is the only involvement that Mr Nixon has had with the ADC investigations. Mr Nixon has not been involved in any way in any decision making with regard to the question of certain dairy companies breaching ADC rules covering the provision of financial advances to those companies. The rules are laid down and administered by the ADC. It is the ADC that has detected these breaches and the ADC is quite properly following up with further investigations. The ADC has already taken action to ensure that all moneys so far found to be due for repayment, totalling $11.7m, either have been repaid or are properly accounted for. Mr Nixon expects to be kept fully informed of developments in the investigation by the ADC. Mr Nixon is well aware of recommendation 8.7 in the Bowen guidelines and will comply with them as circumstances may require. Question No. 2 does not arise, for the reasons given in answer to question No. 1 .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to question No. 3, Mr Nixon is not involved exclusively with beef cattle raising; he is a dairy farmer and has also been a beef producer for many years. As to question No. 4, Mr Nixon and his family continue to hold 1,244 out of a total of nearly 18 1/2 million shares in the Murray Goulburn Co-op. because he continues to be a dairy farmer and supplies Murray Goulburn. For geographical reasons Mr Nixon has to supply Murray Goulburn and it is a policy of that co- operative to require regular suppliers also to be shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA> As to question No. 5, the ADC management is currently examining in detail the circumstances which have given rise to the situations which, prima facie, involve breaches of the Corporation's rules. At the same time, the ADC management is taking legal advice on the extent to which penalties can be enforced under the terms and conditions which apply to the ADC finance arrangements in relation to the purchase or loan of dairy products. Legal advice will be taken into account by the board of the ADC when it considers whether any penalties should apply. As to question No. 6, the ADC has advised that the amount of $11.7m was found to be immediately due to the ADC by the 10 companies nominated as a result of checks by ADC staff during the period 19 April to 21 May 1982. Further checks are being carried out as part of the Corporation's present investigations to ascertain the precise dates on which the breaches of the ADC terms and conditions occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> As to question No. 7, similar arrangements are made by the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank for the Australian Egg Board, the Australian Honey Board, the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation and the Australian Wheat Board. As to question No. 8, the systems used by the abovementioned organisations are, as with the ADC, determined and supervised by each individual organisation. In the light of the situation regarding the ADC, other statutory authorities with similar systems are being asked to check their systems to ensure that similar situations have not occurred and cannot occur. However, it should be noted that all of these systems are subject to scrutiny by the Auditor -General.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. Recently I drew to the attention of the Minister for Administrative Services the matter of stolen trucks in Australia. My information, which came from a constituent who has spent many years working in the road transport industry, is that some 160 heavy road trucks were stolen and not recovered in Australia during the last three years. Some trucks that have been recovered indicated that the trucks are changed in such a professional way as to make them virtually unrecognisable to the original owner and that they are invariably resold in a different State from that in which they were stolen. My suggestion was that this could be the subject of discussions between State and Federal Ministers responsible for police. Can the Minister tell me the outcome of those discussions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I recall the attention of the Senate and the Government being drawn to the question of stolen trucks. We feel particularly indebted to Senator Thomas for bringing our attention to the fact that these trucks are sold across State borders. The Government has taken action on this matter. Indeed, I understand that as recently as a week or so ago the Minister was in discussion, through the Australian Police Ministers Council, with Mr Hinze from Queensland. There has been a reference from the Police Ministers Council to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. This co-operative body, which was recently announced and organised by the Federal Government, is proving its worth in terms of finding answers to the kinds of questions raised by Senator Thomas. As to any further information, I am unable to point out whether there has been any success in finding the culprits involved in these episodes. I will endeavour to obtain further information on the matter for Senator Thomas.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I do not expect the Minister representing the Minister for Health to have read the Manly Daily of last weekend, I wish to point out to him an article in it which states that valuable relics from the North Head quarantine station have disappeared over the years, with some of them ending up in private antique collections as far away as Western Australia. In view of this claim, and bearing in mind that the Federal Government will be handing over the land now occupied by the quarantine station to the New South Wales Government in the near future, why is the Federal Department of Health not co-operating with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales by assisting it to make a survey of this area so that it can catalogue the artefacts and relics which are found there? Does the Minister not agree that such a survey is vitally necessary now, particularly when there is a distinct likelihood that the changeover will leave this section of North Head vacant for some time and thus susceptible to acts of vandalism?</PARA></TALK.START>

I am aware of the negotiations that have gone on in relation to the North Head quarantine station, negotiations in which my colleague Mr MacKellar was vitally interested. As honourable senators will know, the area falls within his electorate of Warringah. If there are relics which are in danger and if they do need to be put on a register, that is something in which the new Minister for Health, who, as Senator Sibraa will know, represents the seat of Mackellar in the Warringah Shire, would want to have an interest.

They include amalgamations in Senator Martin's State of Queensland. I am also aware that the Queensland Minister, recently, in letters which he sent to a number of parliamentarians has expressed concern that the Commonwealth may not intend to press ahead with the remaining six amalgamations. I am seeking an early opportunity to meet with the Minister of Education in Victoria and with the Minister for Education in New South Wales to discuss the remaining six amalgamations, all of which fall within those two States. It is essential that these amalgamations be settled to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth by the end of July of this year so that appropriate arrangements can be made by the end of this year. I advise Senator Martin that there have been no provisions for recurrent financial assistance for these institutions beyond December 1982. It is the intention of the Commonwealth that the amalgamations should proceed, as announced in the decision. In fact, action is now under way by me to put those amalgamations in place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I think I read the same Press comment this morning which has obviously prompted the question from Senator Ray. I would imagine that there are some concessions and deductions to target groups in the taxation system that are costly to administer. I did note the comment with regard to the mortgage interest relief. I do not know what to say in answer to what is implied by the question, other than to state what was stated by those who gave evidence, to the committee reviewing the matter yesterday, that a cost is involved in proceeding with concessions, deductions or other matters that are raised through the taxation system. Whether what is implied by Senator Ray is that he would like to see a flat tax with no concessions, target group deductions, rebates or whatever, I do not know. But I noted the comment that there is some complexity with regard to a particular one and that many of the deductions or schemes do have administrative costs. I am not aware of the relationship of those costs to the total tax collected. I can say only that the comments were noted. No doubt the committee which is reviewing the matter will make some response which would receive the attention of government in due course .</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; As I have said, I do not know whether it is possible to do that. I think the committee which is looking at the matters raised yesterday by those who gave evidence will no doubt make a report in due course which would, in the normal process, receive the Government's attention. Administrative costs may be one factor considered in looking at the operation of schemes or the policy related to them. But I do not know whether information on the individual cost of an individual deduction, rebate or concession within the taxation system would be readily available or whether the importance of such information would warrant the cost that might be involved in extracting it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Honourable senators may be aware of the land claim lodged over Beetaloo station, where one group of Aboriginals who we believe are already entitled to thousands of square miles of land is seeking to dispossess an Aboriginal family group which holds the Beetaloo station as a pastoral lease and which has held and worked the station for generations. My question of the Minister is: How is it that legal aid has been granted immediately to the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress, which, I understand, has some $250,000 in accumulated reserves, when it took over 12 months to obtain a grant of legal aid for the Bathern family of Beetaloo, which has no funds, and when one member of that family who has sought additional legal aid in his own right has not yet been granted assistance? Further, does the Minister believe that the Bathern family will have further difficulties in obtaining legal aid until such time as the land claim proceeds?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think part of Senator Kilgariff's question does not really fall within the administrative responsibility of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It may not be possible for me to give an answer to that part of the question which relates to access to legal aid. But I would like to comment on the issue which has been raised by Senator Kilgariff's question. It is an unsatisfactory part of the working of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act that one group of Aboriginal people is able to lodge a land claim over a property held by another group of Aboriginal people. The situation at Beetaloo is one of the situations that have caused considerable distress. The other situation honourable senators might remember is the one which occurred in relation to the Borroloola land claim. Mr Steve Johnston has a holding on Vanderlin Island which has been subject to claim. That is one group of Aboriginals seeking to dispossess another Aboriginal land holder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The negotiations which have been going on in relation to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act have tried to take this, among other matters, on board. If it is possible to put in place a package of amendments, it is to be hoped that this is one thing that would be overcome. I can confirm that the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress is in receipt of large amounts of money for the various functions it carries out. It is one of the few organisations of that size in the centre of Australia. I regret that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is not able to advise Senator Kilgariff on the rules which regulate access to legal aid in the Territory. That part of the question may have to be directed to another Minister.</PARA>

Does the Minister agree that, if this is the case, there may be others whose deaths from cancer or whose contraction of that disease can be attributed to their duties, military or civilian, on the atomic test sites of Monte Bello, Emu Field and Maralinga, as well as those serving at Nagasaki and Hiroshima after the bombings?

Further, if it is the function of the Government Information Unit, as has been constantly claimed by the Government, simply to disseminate to the public information relating to the decisions and actions of the Government, on what conceivable basis did the principal officers consider that the GIU needed or deserved access to these already extraordinarily overburdened resources? Is one of the reasons that this kind of decision came to be made by the Library the fact that it clearly lacks direction from the top following the failure for 10 months now to appoint a new Librarian following the departure of Mr Weir? Is the central reason for that delay the failure of the Speaker to agree upon the candidate preferred by the other members of the selection panel with neither the Speaker nor the President being prepared to authorise the appointment of each other's candidate? Is the President aware of the mounting concern that this bizarre, almost Monty Python, situation in the Library is creating in many quarters?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a report of the evidence which was given by officers of my Department to the Public Accounts Committee. I think some of the public reports were somewhat misleading, because at least one newspaper report suggested that a large proportion of those overpayments was caused by administrative error, whereas a very small proportion is caused by administrative error. The main cause of overpayments is that people neglect to advise the Department of changes in income which would result in pension reduction. They are discovered some time after the event in the course of reviews initiated by my Department rather than by the client. The figure for actual adminstrative error is perhaps indicated by the volume of these payments which are written off. I think they would amount to a little over a million dollars a year which, in terms of the totality of the budget of my Department, is quite miniscule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to recovery, I regret my lack of a photographic memory. I have a clear picture of the page that was put before me, but I have to say that I am guessing. My recollection is the figure is somewhere around an annual recovery rate of $16m to $17m. Part of the $45m referred to by the honourable senator in her question is a cumulative figure with carried forward overpayments being part of that total. The annual level of overpayments is around the $20m mark. A substantial proportion of that annual amount is recovered.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the carry forward is quite simple. Quite often the overpayment is caused because there has been some increase in income which leads to an entitlement to a lower rate of pension. Because reviews are not conducted on a weekly or a monthly basis but at less regular intervals, for reasons of not wanting to interfere unduly with people and the administrative burden, sometimes people are not able to repay immediately the amount which is sought to be recovered. We are usually dealing with pensioners and beneficiaries who are substantially reliant on the pension or benefit received. The normal method of recovery would be by way of a small weekly deduction. So there is a carry- forward situation and this means that repayments may be made over quite a lengthy period. Obviously cases vary considerably. There is a relatively small number of fraudulent cases. There are cases where people simply have not realised or have not got round to notifying us of some income variation. But we expect to recover a substantial proportion of overpayments and I think the figures show an increasing level of recovery year by year. That is in part probably because of the factor mentioned by the honourable senator, namely, the more regular reviews which are now conducted.</PARA>
<PARA> That whole answer is descriptive. I would not want to be held closely to the figures I have mentioned. I will check all the figures and let the honourable senator have a detailed reply. Should any of the figures I have put before the Senate be misleading in any substantial sense-and from the way Senator Grimes is poised in the starting blocks they may be-I will certainly bring to the attention of the Senate any change I would wish to mention.</PARA>

In recent weeks the fall in the short term bank lending rates has reflected a general fall in interest rates on the short term money market. The general fall in short term interest rates is due both to the passing of the period of heavy provisional and company tax payments and to the continuing strong inflow of capital from abroad. While resulting in a welcome addition to our foreign exchange reserves the strong capital inflows have added to the liquidity available to financial institutions and hence have added to the rate of monetary growth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will remember that in the field referred to by the honourable senator in his question there was a very considerable expansion of activities by the Commonwealth in the last Budget and considerable expansion of the amount of money made available. That expansion was somewhat obscured by the controversy over the one negative decision in that area, which was not to continue with the Community Youth Support Scheme. The considerable furore which followed that announcement tended to distract attention from the very positive approach which the Government had in the rest of its program for youth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have seen a note recently which I do not have with me but will try to get by the end of Question Time. I think that the problem is, in part, related to the expansion of activity. It is certainly not meant to be or should not be taken as any indication that the Government will be winding down the program. With regard to the request from Senator Foreman that we have some sort of make-up next year, the important thing is to have adequate financing for those people who will be available to benefit from the programs. In other words, I do not think one can set an arbitrary limit on the basis of some figure added on to what may not be spent if there is underspending this year. Rather, I say simply that I would expect the Minister whom I represent in this place to address his attention to those programs to see the extent to which there are people in the Australian community, particularly young people, who can benefit from them and ensure that there is adequate Budget provision to meet the demand which exists.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator's question ranges over the responsibilities of a couple of other Ministers also. Interest rates on housing loans will, of course, reflect market rates. However, I draw attention to the schemes that were introduced by the Government to assist those who have bought houses in recent years or will buy them in the near future, and are thus subjected to the payment of the present rates of interest. They are measures which the Government introduced in order to be of assistance. The question of assistance to welfare agencies, in the form of grants or by way of emergency assistance, falls more properly within the area of my colleague Senator Chaney. Again, a great deal of assistance is given by many of the family support projects and other projects that are developed through the Department of Social Security and through the giving of assistance to the States. The whole housing area was canvassed very widely at the time that we introduced those measures of assistance and changes to the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. Those schemes recognised the priority given by the Government to housing policy and to the granting of assistance when that is possible. We believe that these measures, combined with the extra funds released and made available through the banking system, have been of assistance. It is not denied that difficulties exist in regard to present housing market costs, in some States particularly, and in regard to high interest rates.

I believe that the best way to answer the honourable senator's questions would be to outline briefly the circumstances surrounding the matter as they have been advised to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Dairy Corporation has advised that the $130,000 was advanced to the Colac Dairying Company Ltd between September 1981 and November 1981 in respect of cheese produced by that company. The advance was subject to the usual condition that the product should not be sold or removed from store prior to repayment of the advance. The Colac Dairying Company Ltd subsequently sold the cheese to McMahon Dairy Products Pty Ltd. The ADC has been advised orally by both the Colac Dairying Company and McMahon Dairy Products Pty Ltd that a condition of the sale was that would reimburse the ADC with the advance money involved. When the ADC inspection on 18 May 1982 revealed that the cheese was no longer held in store by the Colac Dairying Company Ltd, the ADC sought immediate repayment of the advance. Reimbursement was received from McMahon Dairy Products Pty Ltd on 19 May 1982. As the ADC has not yet examined the Colac Dairying Company Ltd's sales records to determine the date or dates of the sales to McMahon Dairy Products Pty Ltd, I am not yet in a position to advise the Senate of the exact period in which repayment of the advance was due to the ADC.</PARA>

I have received further advice which I will now give to the Senate. If Senator Bolkus does not think that it is adequate, he might let me know in what particular aspect it is inadequate. The further advice is as follows: The Nestle Company did not receive any ADC advance on its production of whole milk powder during the period that Mr Peter Lever-Naylor was associated with that company. The advances by the ADC were made after Mr Peter Lever-Naylor retired as Manager, Production Division, of the Nestle Company on 30 June 1978. A subsidiary company of Nestle, the Girgarre Cheese Co.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to Senator Foreman who asked a question about employment and industrial relations programs and an article which had appeared concerning certain under spending by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. Advice from the Department is that some of the expenditures are not running at the levels envisaged when estimates were originally made for 1981-82. However, for some items expenditures will be greater than original estimates although these are not referred to in the article. In relation to the School to Work Transition Program, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations originally estimated $13m for transition allowance expenditure for 1981-82. This estimate was later revised to $10m, reflecting later and more precise knowledge of trainee numbers and entitlements .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While there may have been some shortfall in the numbers originally envisaged, the 36 per cent reduction mainly reflects the difficulty of making the initial estimate. The transition allowance applies not only to Commonwealth funded tertiary and further education transition courses but also to approved State funded courses, so precise estimating is not easy as DEIR cannot predict accurately State provisions. The revised estimate of $10m for the transition allowance represents approximately 13,000 trainees. Allowances had been provided for 9,000 as at the end of March 1982, which was on target. As far as program funds are concerned, estimated under spending for 1981-82 will be under 3 per cent. This is caused by recoveries from States of advances not spent in 1980, the first year of the program, when some programs took time to become established.</PARA>

I am advised that administrative arrangements and regulations to be discussed with the States are currently being prepared to enable the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act to be brought into operation. It is currently planned that the Act will be brought into operation in June 1982, which is almost upon us, with the dumping convention being ratified in July 1982. A draft model State Bill prepared for consideration by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is being used as a basis for the States and the Northern Territory to implement the provisions of the dumping convention in the territorial sea adjacent to their coast through State or Territory legislation. When a State or the Northern Territory does not wish to enact separate legislation the Commonwealth Act will apply in the territorial sea adjacent to that State or Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PROCTEXT><INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="The DEPUTY PRESIDENT" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Questions have been raised with me in connection with an incident which occurred in the chamber yesterday afternoon in which the Chair requested the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Chipp, not to remain standing in a passageway talking with persons on the gallery side of the rail that divides the chamber from the senators' guests' gallery. Senator Chipp properly indicated that as no seating was available for advisers to the members of his party comparable with areas beside the members of the Ministry, the Opposition shadow Ministry and the major party Whips, arrangements had been authorised by the President for those advisors to sit in the gallery closest to the seats occupied by Senator Chipp and his colleagues and for that area to be reserved for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable senators are aware, Standing Order 402 provides that senators shall not stand in any of the passageways. In addition, all Presidents, in the exercise of their responsibilities to maintain order, have consistently called to order any senator attempting to speak to visitors in the galleries. The request from the Chair yesterday was based on those two factors. It appears to me that the special arrangements approved at the request of Senator Chipp have, perhaps unwittingly, given rise to the problem that arose yesterday insofar as it might be thought that the members of the Australian Democrats should be able to talk directly over the dividing rail to their advisers, in a fashion comparable to that by which Ministers, shadow Ministers and Whips talk to their advisers in the benches on my immediate right and left.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is a sufficient distinction between the two situations inasmuch as the space set aside for the Democrats' advisers is, of necessity, in the senators' guests' gallery, which is open to and used by many visitors to the Senate, while the places on my right and left are exclusively set aside for the purposes of advisers. It is perhaps regrettable that this is so, but I draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that, principally to overcome the problem which arose yesterday, a special door was cut in the dividing rail to provide direct and easy access for the Australian Democrat senators to the area set aside for their advisers. I understand that the special arrangements made by the President were referred to the leaders of the Government and the Opposition and to Senator Harradine for their consideration and this statement by me will now inform the Senate as a whole of those arrangements. They are no doubt less than perfect but I believe that they do provide an appropriate, workable solution to the problem which Senator Chipp originally raised.</PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the Standing Order, the practice of not permitting conversations between persons inside and outside the defined chamber area and the structural alterations referred to above, I trust that any repetition of yesterday's problem might be avoided by the co-operation of Australian Democrats senators in making use of the special access arrangements provided for them to talk with their advisers. I take this opportunity also of reminding all honourable senators that they should keep very much in mind Standing Order 402 that prohibits standing in passageways in the chamber. Because of the considerable interest this matter aroused yesterday I propose to discuss the matter with the President at the earliest opportunity. I inform the Senate also that I held a meeting this morning to discuss the matter with the temporary chairmen of committees, all of whom are required to occupy the chair from time to time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Last night during a debate Senator Walsh said that I had passionate objections to the proposed Federal crimes commission. I must say from the outset that I do not associate passion and politics. However, Mr Deputy President, with your indulgence-I will seek to be as brief as I can-I refer you to the only public or private comment I have made on this subject which was by way of a question directed to the Attorney- General (Senator Durack) on 6 May 1982. I am sorry that I have to read the question but it is the only way I can explain the position. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware that very effective co-operative working arrangements have been developed between the States and the Commonwealth in the last two years through the Australian Police Ministers Council? Is he further aware that the Council has established the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and is close to finalising agreement on a national police research unit? Inasmuch as no discussion or consultation took place with the States before the Prime Minister made his statement, is it his intention to set up a national crimes commission in consultation and co-operation with the State governments, which have considerable constitutional power in this area? Does he concede that the effectiveness of such a commission would be considerably diluted without proper Commonwealth-State consultation and co-operation?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, with respect I suggest to you that what I am proposing is that establishing such a crimes commission has a great deal of virtue providing it is set up in close and effective consultation with the States. If Senator Walsh so misrepresented the truth on this occasion, in my view that can be only a reflection on his integrity. I believe that the coalition partners, part of his own party and the public at large have already made their judgment about him and I do not intend to make a judgment. But it is not without significance to note that in 1977, when Senator Walsh headed the Australian Labor Party's Senate ticket in Western Australia, that party got the worst vote that it has ever had. Going back to 1944-I can show the statistics-the same thing applied. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, I speak very briefly to outline the Committee's report. The two annual reports which are the subject of our inquiry were referred to the Committee last year by Estimates Committee B. The tabling of both reports was considerably delayed and, in fact, at the time that the Estimates Committee reported to the Senate early in May of last year, the Special Broadcasting Service second annual report for 1979-80 had yet to be tabled. The report was subsequently tabled on 12 May 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that the SBS first annual report dealt with a period of 18 months, contrary to a legislative requirement that the Service report for each 12-month period of operations ending on 30 June. The decision to prepare an annual report for an amalgamated period was made by the SBS board. The Minister then responsible for SBS affairs apparently consented to this course of action. The Committee realises that the administrative pressure upon Ministers makes continual oversight of authorities difficult. Nonetheless, timely tabling of annual reports in accordance with the legislation governing an authority is the Minister's responsibility. The Committee has expressed its disappointment that the Minister did not ensure that the SBS report to the Parliament was made as required by statute. </PARA>
<PARA> The SBS plays an important role in communications and community relations in Australia. It is an example of a statutory authority whose performance and achievements are of interest to the Parliament and the community. The Committee therefore intends to note the timeliness of its future reports to the Parliament . I seek to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>for Aboriginal Affairs,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, Australian Capital Territory 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir</PARA>
<PARA>ABORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION</PARA>
<PARA>In compliance with section 41 (1) of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980, the accounts and records of financial transactions and records relating to assets of, or in the custody of, the Commission have been inspected and audited for the year ended 30 June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 July 1980 the Commission commenced operations with the following functions :</PARA>
<PARA> land acquisition (previously carried out by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission )</PARA>
<PARA> housing loans and enterprise loans (previously carried out by the Aboriginal Loans Commission)</PARA>
<PARA> enterprise grants (previously carried out by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs). </PARA>
<PARA> From 1 July 1980 to mid September 1980 all payments, including salaries, were made through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs after which the Commission maintained its own accounts and records. </PARA>
<PARA> The first audit conducted to review and evaluate accounting systems and controls disclosed a number of unsatisfactory features. Representations to the Commission on 13 May 1981 indicated weaknesses including the absence of written instructions and procedures, no formal chart of accounts, limited internal audit and incomplete accounts for fixed assets, advances, investments and shares. The maintenance of accounts and records, and of personnel records, was not up to date nor, in some instances, accurate. In response the Commission advised some 6 months later on 9 November 1981 of remedial action taken or proposed with respect to the matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the inadequacies revealed during the first audit, substantive detailed testing was undertaken during the course of the final audit so that reasonable assurance could be obtained that transactions were correctly recorded and that assets were adequately safeguarded. Draft financial statements were received on 9 November 1981 and necessary corrections were referred to the Commission by this office on 30 November 1981, 16 December 1981 and 5 January 1982. Signed financial statements were received on 26 February 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> My report on the financial statements of the Commission for the year ended 30 June 1981, in terms of section 40 (5) of the Act, together with a copy of the Statements, has been forwarded to you today under separate cover. It will be noted that my report outlines the unsatisfactory aspects of the keeping of the accounts and records during the financial year ended 30 June 1981 and thereafter and includes three qualifications:</PARA>
<PARA>Terms and Conditions of Employment</PARA>
<PARA> Following Public Service Board approval on 2 September 1980 to the terms and conditions of employment for persons engaged by the Commission under section 33 of the Act, three part-time employees were paid at rates in excess of that prescribed. The Commission advised that the officer in charge of the area at the time was unaware of the relevant Public Service employment provisions applicable . This situation has since been remedied. </PARA>
<PARA>Engagement of Consultants</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission did not obtain Public Service Board approval for the terms and conditions for engagement of consultants, as required by section 35 of the Act. The reason given by the Commission was a misunderstanding and/or misapprehension of the relevant Public Service-Engagement of Consultants Provisions. It has now sought retrospective approval from the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>Delegation to Invest Funds</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the information of honourable senators, I present a response by the Government to a report by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts entitled ' Preparation for the Workforce'. Apart from paying a tribute to the Committee for the work it put into this report I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Report of the Senate Standing Committee entitled 'Preparation for the Workforce' was tabled in Parliament on 2 June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee inquired into the effectiveness of Australian schools in preparing young people for the workforce, with particular emphasis on literacy and numeracy, and the Report made recommendations for action by Commonwealth and State authorities. The majority of the recommendations are, however, directed to the responsibilities of the States and the non-government schools.</PARA>
<PARA> In summarising its findings the Committee stated that a major part of its inquiry was concerned with an apparent mismatch between the education system and the students it produces and community expectations. The Committee formed the opinion that employers tend to see education in strict utilitarian terms and are not fully appreciative of the difficulties and uncertainties facing educators in preparing young people for contemporary society. The Committee was equally convinced that the schools have become insular in their views on what education is for and are not appreciative of the needs of industry and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered that these misunderstandings can only be resolved by educators and industry representatives sitting down together and engaging in rational discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major area of concern expressed by the Senate Committee was the view that an estimated 20 to 25 per cent of young people who leave Australian schools each year are educationally disadvantaged in basic literacy and numeracy skills and life role competencies. The Committee therefore focused on the need to increase the overall proficiency of primary school teachers. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts has recognised, its recommendations require the attention of educationists and administrators at various levels. The proposals are directed at the Commonwealth and State administrations, non-government school authorities, the teacher education institutions, and the schools and their communities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's Report raises and comments on a wide range of issues, most of which are of current concern and importance. It cannot be expected that there will be universal agreement with the committee's proposals; some concern controversial areas or look for solutions to difficult problems. However, I believe that the raising of these issues in such a direct and compact form has already had an impact in the education community and, now that the Government has had an opportunity to review the Committee's recommendations, I propose bringing them formally to the attention of the Australian Education Council and the non-government school authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of the Committee's proposals cover similar ground to that of the report of the National Inquiry into Teacher Education (NITE) and the associated State Reports. Many of the recommendations in these reports are also essentially matters for the States and the teacher education institutions to consider. For its part, the Commonwealth is continuing in 1982 its extensive support for the in-service education of teachers through the programs of the Commonwealth Schools Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The rest of this statement summarises the recommendations of the Committee under the sixteen areas for action which it identified. The Government's responses in respect of recommendations in each area are outlined. </PARA>
<PARA>1. Areas of Disagreement and Misunderstanding</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended that Commonwealth and State Education Departments initiate debate and discussion at the educational regional level within schools and between schools and the community, particularly local employers, to resolve the disagreements and misunderstandings about the aims and functions of schooling. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: The Commonwealth accepts the importance of school-community consultation and in its own area of direct responsibility for education, the Australian Capital Territory, the Schools Authority and its schools are already required by an Ordinance to involve the community in decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Schools Commission is also committed to involving parents actively in the school decision-making processes. The previous Minister approved $28,000 for a project to stimulate public and professional awareness of the report, ''Schooling for 15 and 16 Year Olds'', through seminars, workshops and school based activities organised by State and Commonwealth funded teacher education centres. </PARA>
<PARA> The Curriculum Development Centre commissioned a study on the school and the community, the report of which, ''The Curriculum and the Community'', was published in September 1981. With funding from the Commonwealth's Transition Program some States have introduced community awareness programs which are aimed at developing an understanding of issues in the transition from school to work among teachers, parents, employers and the community. </PARA>
<PARA> From its examination of the areas of disagreement and misunderstanding, the Senate Committee concluded that immediate and pressing problems in schools needed to be tackled as soon as possible in order to make a serious attempt at reducing the large numbers of educationally disadvantaged children. The Government, of course, is well aware of this problem, and it was to assist such school leavers and others that the Transition from School to Work Program was introduced in November 1979. Under the Transition Program the Commonwealth has funded programs in 1980-82 to develop improved services and techniques for identifying potential early school leavers, to expand school counsellor, vocational education and guidance services to provide more comprehensive assistance for students ''at risk'' and their parents, and funded the development of alternative courses in schools for potential early school leavers . </PARA>
<PARA>2. Teachers</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended that greater attention be given to identifying teachers whose proficiency is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> If in-service training cannot remedy such deficiencies, education departments should require such teachers to take early retirement or alternative employment. To reconcile the responsibilities of bringing up a young family with those of teaching, provision should be made so that, where appropriate, young married teachers may be employed on a half-time basis and/or have one or more years leave without pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: The Commonwealth shares the view that the quality of teaching is a key factor in determining educational outcomes and maintaining that quality. The NITE Report recommended that greater attention be given to in-service education and projected that by 1985 new graduates would account for as little as 6% of the teaching force. </PARA>
<PARA> This recommendation is primarily for the States and non-government school authorities to consider. However, it is relevant to note that in at least two States consideration is now being given to introducing re-certification for all teachers at regular intervals. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of provisions for young married teachers, discussion of the possibility of offering permanent part-time employment might extend to any male and female teachers, not just young married female teachers, particularly in view of the reduced demand for teachers. </PARA>
<PARA>3, 4, 5 Class Size, School Size and School Design</PARA>
<PARA> For the first two years of primary school, class sizes should be significantly smaller than for later years and all classes should be as small as practicable for the teaching of cognitive skills. Schools should introduce sub-school units in which children can identify and develop relationships and education authorities should establish upper limits for school sizes taking into account research in this matter. Teacher training programs should include practical courses specifically designed to improve teaching proficiency both in conventional classrooms and open-plan settings. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: These three recommendations are directed at policy decisions to be taken at the State and individual school or tertiary teacher training institution level. However, the Commonwealth accepts the merit of the objective that class sizes be as small as practicable for teaching and learning, consistent with available resources, and it agrees that all teachers during their training should gain the necessary skills and knowledge to teach in a variety of settings, including open-plan classrooms. </PARA>
<PARA>6 and 7. Teacher Training and Trainee Teacher Selection</PARA>
<PARA> Pre-service teacher training programs should include a compulsory core of studies including such elements as teaching techniques in English and Mathematics, diagnosis of specific learning difficulties and remediation methods , stucture and sequence in curriculum development, organisation and methods of teaching for conventional school rooms and open-plan and the uses and abuses of teaching aids. Teacher training institutions should specify the minimum standards they require trainees to achieve in the teaching of English expression and comprehension and in the teaching of Mathematics. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended that teacher training institutions take action during the selection of trainee teachers to ensure that all teacher trainees achieve minimum competence at Year 12 level in Mathematics and English and have non- academic and personal qualities relevant to teaching such as a sense of responsibility, motivation, resilience, self-discipline and compassion. Where trainees do not measure up in these respects, they should be required to withdraw from teacher training. Potential teacher trainees should be counselled on these requirements of training institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: Because of the autonomy of tertiary institutions responsible for teacher education programs, it is a matter for individual institutions to adopt the recommendations and to implement appropriate programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth agrees with the general thrust of the recommendations relating to teacher training institutions, and endorses the view that pre-service teacher training courses should include teaching techniques designed to facilitate pupils' acquisition of literacy and numeracy skills. In the ACT many of the Committee's recommendations in this area are already incorporated in teacher education courses at the Canberra College of Advanced Education. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Senate Committee's recommendation concerning in-course assessment of the non-academic and personal qualities of trainees is concerned, the NITE Committee recognised the problems associated with selecting individuals with suitable personal qualities for entry into the teaching profession, but suggested that there may be certain disqualifying criteria which could be used to ensure that grossly unsuitable individuals are screened out during initial selection or are counselled out during the pre-service course. These criteria might relate, for example, to the qualities of emotional instability, inflexibility and unfavourable attitudes towards children, since these are deep- rooted qualities which do not readily change in late adolescence or adulthood. ( Par 8.21.) However, this is an area which is acknowledged by educators as difficult to measure and evaluate. The trainee teacher's experience in teaching practice, together with assessment and in-course counselling on a continuing basis, would seem to provide an appropriate form of practical preparation for the classroom. </PARA>
<PARA>8. Remediation</PARA>
<PARA> Teacher training colleges should ensure that all trainees complete courses in remedial teaching of Mathematics and English and acquire the ability to diagnose specific learning difficulties. Suitably qualified remedial specialist teachers should be appointed to schools with priority given to appointment in primary schools and, in particular, to the first two years of schooling. Specialist remedial teachers should be carefully selected and receive salaries commensurate with their qualifications and experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: The Commonwealth Schools Commission through its Services and Development Program has provided funds which can be used to train experienced teachers specifically in remedial techniques. However, the Government considers that it is desirable for all teachers to have a wide range of skills and an understanding of the techniques and methods of diagnosis and remediation. </PARA>
<PARA> Significant provision has been made at the Canberra College of Advanced Education in recent years for qualified practising teachers to undertake further specialist teacher training at the postgraduate diploma and master's degree levels. The ACT Schools Authority makes provision for remedial reading teachers in schools. It also allocates resources for English as a Second Language programs and for Slow Learner programs. </PARA>
<PARA>9. School Leadership and Morale</PARA>
<PARA> School principals, encountering difficulties in school management, should receive counselling and guidance. Where this is unsuccessful, the principal should be replaced or transferred to a new role appropriate to his skills or, where appropriate, be encouraged to accept early retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: The Commonwealth Schools Commission in its 1982/84 triennal report has drawn attention to the urgent need to provide appropriate training for principals before they take up their appointments and for a regular development program thereafter. The Commission has approved in principle the allocation of $ 75,000 in 1982 from its projects of national significance to support a project related to the professional development of principals. </PARA>
<PARA>10. In-Service Training</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended that Commonwealth and State Governments allocate special grants to schools for in-service training programs on a continuing basis . The priority should be workshops in methods of teaching English and Mathematics and diagnosis and treatment of learning difficulties. These courses should be available to all teachers but those identified in need of such training should be required to attend. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: While this is primarily the responsibility of the States and non- government schools, the Commonwealth will provide $17.5m within the programs of the Commonwealth Schools Commission for such purposes in 1982, including grants to education centres operated by teachers. </PARA>
<PARA>11. Teaching Aids</PARA>
<PARA> Against the background of uncertainty concerning effective use of teaching aids the Committee recommended instruction as part of teacher training in the use and selection of teaching aids, caution in the purchase and use of television as a teaching aid and evaluation by schools of their own stock of teaching aids in order to sell those that are ineffective and further reduce purchases so that equipment funds may be applied to more effective purchases. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: The Commonwealth notes the Senate Committee's recommendation, though it should be recognised that instruction in the use of teaching aids already forms part of most current teacher education programs. However, the recommendation raises matters which are essentially ones for State Education authorities, individual training institutions and schools to consider in assessing their own needs and priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>12. Core Curriculum</PARA>
<PARA> A core curriculum in literacy and numeracy should be introduced into all schools and implemented systematically to achieve continuity of teaching experiences through all years of schooling. The details of curriculum construction should be the responsibility of education departments and experimentation with school based curriculum restricted. National monitoring of literacy and numeracy standards should continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: It should be noted that the Curriculum Development Centre Core Curriculum which the Report wants introduced is not a specific syllabus, but rather an attempt to identify broad areas of knowledge and experience which could be included in the curriculum. Responsibilities in these areas in the States essentially rest with State and non-government school authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In the ACT the Schools Authority is committed to school-based curriculum development which has been undertaken on a continuing basis as part of the normal government schools system since 1974. A comprehensive external review of the curriculum development procedures in the ACT for Years 11 and 12 was conducted in 1979 with positive findings. Refinement of procedures associated with school-based curriculum development (such as the provision of guidelines and example materials) in the ACT is currently under review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth supports the recommendation to continue with the national monitoring of literacy and numeracy. At its meeting of 22-23 October 1981 the Australian Education Council reaffirmed its intention to continue sponsorship of a nationwide program to monitor performance of students. It decided that monitoring should take place at regular intervals. The Council will be making decisions at its June 1982 meeting on the form and frequency of the monitoring program taking account of the findings of the final report of the 1980 testing. Development of the diagnostic and achievement tests to be used by teachers at the classroom level will proceed and a report made on these to the June 1982 meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>13. Home Environment</PARA>
<PARA> Headmasters should be required to give priority to establishing closer involvement and understanding between parents and schools and public relations campaigns should be mounted to support this. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: This recommendation is essentially a matter for State authorities and schools themselves to implement. The concept of community involvement in schools is supported by the Government, and the Commonwealth Schools Commission has funded projects in which parent school interaction has been a key feature. It is also encouraged under the Transition Program. </PARA>
<PARA>14. Career Guidance and School Counsellors</PARA>
<PARA> Student counsellors and career guidance officers should be appointed to all secondary schools and such services introduced into schools as part of the education program. Action should be taken to expand training provisions for counsellors and guidance officers and to award them appropriate specialist qualifications and status within the teaching profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: The Commonwealth accepts the importance of adequate services being available in this area and it should be noted that the States have significantly increased the numbers of such officers in 1980-81 with funding from the Commonwealth Transition Program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's recommendations that counsellors and guidance officers be appointed to all secondary schools, and that appropriate qualifications and status be awarded within the teaching profession, fall within State and non- government school responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In the A.C.T. in-service courses in career education are provided by the Schools Authority and these include short industrial placement of teachers, courses and sessions with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, labour market seminars, regular meetings of career co-ordinators and other relevant courses. Teachers employed as counsellors in A.C.T. government schools are required to have completed at least the first year of a Master's degree in School Counselling. </PARA>
<PARA>15. Secondary School System</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Education Council should urgently convene a conference of Commonwealth and State education departments to draw up plans for restructuring the secondary school system to provide curriculum structures directly serving school leavers with non-academic outcomes. In considering such a proposal particular attention should be given to Years 11 and 12 of secondary education being conducted in separate institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Response: The Commonwealth would be happy for the AEC to sponsor such an activity. In his statement to Parliament of 4 June 1981 concerning the outcome of the Review of Opportunities for Youth, my predecessor indicated that the Commonwealth wished to accelerate the development of appropriate transition courses in secondary schools, with emphasis on basic changes in curricula relevant particularly to the needs of low achievers. However, the Commonwealth recognises the rights and responsibilities of the States in respect of structuring their school systems and would not seek to impose specific developments upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee's wish that particular attention be given to having Years 11 and 12 conducted in separate high schools or colleges is already in operation in the Australian Capital Territory and in Tasmania. While the separate senior high school has advantages, no clear evidence is yet available to indicate that such schools better prepare students for entrance to the world of work or result in higher academic achievement. Many link courses and the less academic alternative courses now operating in the States which the Senate Committee saw as part of the restructuring of secondary education have been supported from the Commonwealth Transition Program. </PARA>
<PARA>16. Educational Research</PARA>
<PARA> Priority for educational research should be directed towards solving practical problems and findings translated into statements for policy development and practical propositions so that more effective use can be made of the research. Educational research should be more effectively co-ordinated.</PARA>
<PARA> Response: The Commonwealth accepts this recommendation and will continue to encourage the co-ordination of research through the Australian Education Council , and meetings of State and Commonwealth education researchers. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's major concern was to encourage closer links between industry and educators, and between schools, parents and the community in order to make what is offered and taught at schools more relevant both to the demands of working life and to the demands of modern society. The Committee has produced a thoughtful and constructive report which is producing a worthwhile contribution to the transition debate. I commend the Report to all who are interested in this important area of education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night, before the adjournment debate, I was debating the extension of the bounty covered by the Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill 1982. I turn again to the discussion held by the National Farmers Federation on this matter. It has been suggested that the overall effect of tariffs on the farming community in 1979-80 was $340m or 6 per cent of the total farm costs. On the basis of calculations of the Industries Assistance Commission, that protection adds 2.8c per kilometre to the cost of running a car and about $112m of that total cost can be attributed to the tariff on motor vehicles. Indeed, in Australia the motor vehicle industry and the clothing, footwear and textile industries are the main beneficiaries of the import tariff system. By way of example I point out that, in 1980, 387,400 people were employed in agriculture and associated service industries in Australia. The cost attributable to tariffs affecting primary industry if they had not been incurred and had been distributed by way of wages to those people instead, would have resulted in an average wage increase in the order of $900 a person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1975-76-these figures have not been able to be updated-it was estimated that the cost of tariffs borne by farmers was $2.60 a sheep, $8 a head of cattle and $31.20 per tonne of grain. This is the sort of debilitating effect which the current tariff structure is having on primary producers today. It is important to note that the same effect, to a greater or lesser extent, would be spread right throughout the community. The underlying rationale behind tariffs is to protect Australian industries which might otherwise be disadvantaged by free competition from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that, with the high prevailing wage rates and the unacceptable level of industrial unrest in Australia today, there are cost factors which are not necessarily imposed upon our competitors. However, recent history of this country shows that there has been a great temptation from many union leaders who know that, if they press firmly enough upon the employers for unrealistic wage increases through strike action, ultimately they will receive the unrealistic wage demands which they pursue. In many sectors of the secondary industry the employer knows that all he has to do to recoup his additional wage payout is to go cap in hand to the Federal Government for additional tariff levels which, of course, the users and the exporters in the end have to carry. </PARA>
<PARA> These additional burdens, of course, are placed upon the rest of the community and cause no pain to the employers. Need we go past the example of the recent case of the metal trades industry which, last December, negotiated an agreement which amounted to a 38-hour a week and a simultaneous $39 a week wage increase? Cynics might be tempted to ask how an industry such as the metal trades industry can on the one hand negotiate such a generous agreement and, on the other hand, ask for a continuation of government support by way of tariffs to enable it to compete on the domestic market. According to one report, that agreement amounts to a 22.5 per cent increase in costs for metal trades employers or, to put it another way, it amounts roughly to the same as the average rate of assistance which is presently rendered to the manufacturing sector by way of tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not sound to me like a path between what the Director of the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia, Mr Albert Evans, called the economic capacity of the industry to sustain higher costs and the industrial reality of constant strikes and disruptions. It sounds to me like an industry caving in to union pressure. If it can afford that, surely it can afford to reduce its tariffs for the benefit of all other Australians and all other sectors of the Australian economy. The manufacturers, of course, are able to hide behind a tariff wall and pass on their costs to consumers without fear or threat of real competition. However, if the employer is an exporter, such as a farmer, who is unable to pass on his additional costs because he has to compete on an open world market and who knows that people buying his products are not concerned about his profits or additional costs but simply about what the market will bear , he must absorb all these additional costs himself. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, added to this direct additional cost are wage demands and the like. The farmer is required personally to carry the further enormous burden of the weakness, selfishness, expediency and, in may cases, incompetence of some other employers who create these additional inbuilt costs in the community, often through unnecessary, unfair, unreasonable and improper agreements with unions. I accept that if Australian industries were able to compete effectively most of the benefits of tariff reductions would have to be ploughed back into plant and equipment and they would not necessarily be distributed on an ad hoc basis as undeserved wage increases. I remind the Senate of the Federal Government's policy statement in 1977 in its White Paper on manufacturing industry which said :</PARA>
<PARA> Australian manufacturing industry needs in the long-run to achieve a greater degree of specialisation, with less reliance on government assistance. As a long term objective the community will be best served by a manufacturing industry with a structure which requires minimum levels of government support.</PARA>
<PARA>In this case I stress manufacturing because that is the area which is receiving the most government support by way of tariffs and quotas. According to the 1980- 81 annual report of the IAC the average effective rate of assistance for the manufacturing sector as a whole in that year was 24 per cent. That same level of assistance was effectively rendered to the manufacturing sector in the two previous years, 1979-80 and 1978-79. Looking at individual industries, the clothing and footwear industries effectively received assistance in the order of 130 per cent, the motor vehicle industry effectively received 90 per cent and the textile industry effectively received 49 per cent. By comparison, the effective rate of assistance for agriculture in the years 1978-79 was 8 per cent , in 1979-80 it was 4 per cent and in 1980-81 it was one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I argue that it was the view of the Federal Government in that 1977 White Paper that, rather than increase the level of government aid to industry, whether it be primary or secondary, it should phase it out altogether or at least allow it to fall to very minimal standards. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that unemployment ought to be looked at in totally different terms. I am sure that if we restructure industry effectively and efficiently we will find that we can absorb a great many of the work force. I am not suggesting for a moment that we immediately dislocate industry because that would, in the short term, cause very real problems in terms of employment. The effect which a substantial reduction of tariffs on manufacturing will have on the Australian economy will be a forced restructuring whereby inefficient industries will disappear and the industries which are rendered more competitive will achieve greater growth. What will be the effect of that? In a freer trade situation the dollar can be devalued because the incentive for efficient industries to export will be greater and those developing industries will take up a greater share of the labour market. The farm sector would be the one to benefit from this change, and the mining sector, already beset by falling world commodity prices and ever increasing costs, would be another. They would be more competitive in the world scene, their input costs for imported equipment would be lower and their share of world markets and the price they can achieve would improve dramatically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the additional costs which farmers are being forced to bear due to the present tariff structure, a subsidy on fertilisers is essential to redress the imbalance. The Government cannot take away on the one hand without offering some measure of assistance on the other hand. The debates in the other place indicate that the Opposition seems to have some reservations about the extension of the provisions of this Bill to imported fertiliser as well as the local product. Yet the honourable member for Werriwa, Mr Kerin, expressed the fear that cheap superphosphate would be brought into Australia. In fact he cited Adelaide and Wallaroo Fertilizers Ltd which in 1981 produced 650,000 tonnes of single strength superphosphate and suggested that if one 20,000 tonne shipload of double superphosphate were imported it would comprise 40,000 tonnes of single phosphate or about 6 per cent of Adelaide and Wallaroo's annual production. It is not that simple, but perhaps I should quote an observation by the Industries Assistance Commission which is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> AFL (Australian Fertilizers Ltd) stated that about eighty per cent of Australia 's fertilizer phosphorus is through single superphosphate . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There appears to be a strong trend away from the use of single superphosphate on crops in Victoria and Western Australia. It appears, therefore, that the proportion of the market for phosphate fertilizers that could be subject to import competition is increasing. In response to the draft report, the Electrolitic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited expressed concern that, if this occurred, imported high analysis fertilizers could pose a serious problem for local manufacturers because of the possibility for the substitution of these products for low analysis products . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that to be a problem which the Opposition is envisaging. I quote further the IAC views of the validity of these fears. The IAC stated:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons for the widespread use of single superphosphate in Australia , compared with other fertilizer using countries, is the widespread sulphur deficiencies in Australian soils . . . (but) single superphosphate has a much higher sulphur content than high analysis fertilizers. </PARA>
<PARA>Later the IAC concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission considers that the removal of fertilizer assistance, or its extension to imported phosphatic fertilizers, would not be likely to lead to a significant reduction in the local manufacture of these fertilizers. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe we should draw two conclusions from the IAC report. Firstly, removing the current 2 per cent import duty on fertilisers and extending the bounty to those fertilisers would have only a limited effect. Secondly, the removal of the subsidy completely would have only a minimal effect on overall fertiliser production and therefore, by implication, only minimal effect on the rate of usage. Fertiliser is a necessity in Australia and demand for it is relatively inelastic. Without the subsidy which we are discussing today farmers would have little choice but to face even higher costs. These subsidies recognise the fact that farmers are unduly burdened by the effects of tariffs which are designed to protect inefficient manufacturing industries. Bounties are one of the measures of redress available to farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> I give my unqualified support to this legislation. I hope that when the presently proposed period of extension for the bounty on phosphate and nitrogenous fertilisers expires in 1985 the need for the bounty will have largely been removed. I trust that by June 1985 the levels of assistance through high tariffs presently granted to often inefficient industries, which are placing heavy pressure on the agricultural industries, will be sufficiently reduced to allow primary industries to compete properly with their overseas competitiors on their own merits. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The central intent of this piece of legislation, according to the second reading speech of the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), is to 'ensure that farmers have adequate access to fertilisers at competitive prices'. I accept that that would be extremely useful and beneficial and I am sure it would have the support of this chamber. However, the legislation has had a rather chequered history. The Fertilizers ( Subsidy) Amendment Bill, in the form in which it was introduced merely extended the status quo of the bounty for a further three years to 1985. The Government introduced a range of amendments to that Bill, the main import of which was to allow that bounty to be changed to a subsidy, thereby to apply not only to locally produced fertilisers but also to imported fertilisers. This chamber and the other place have no quibble with the initial Bill. I am sure some honourable senators would like further assurances about that Bill but I think the original Bill would have no problem in having a speedy passage here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The crux of the problem is the extension of the bounty, changing its nature to a subsidy and placing it on imports. The support for this move again raises some confusion. I refer to the differences between the draft report on phosphatic and nitrogenous fertilisers produced by the Industries Assistance Commission and its final report. The space between those reports led to a very interesting situation. The first recommendation of the final report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Assistance, by means of bounty, be accorded the consumption of phosphatic fertilizers produced in Australia and sold for use in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The draft report omitted the words 'produced in Australia'. If one turns to the rest of the report to seek the argumentation for this change one finds that it becomes even more confusing. There does not seem to be in the report substantive arguments as to why the IAC changed its first recommendation. Indeed, it goes to some lengths to try to point out what little effect this would have on the manufacturing industry in Australia. Nevertheless, it makes a recommendation that it would be far better to retain the status quo and to phase out the bounty over three years. I certainly support that proposition. However, the Government, in its response in the second reading speech, did not address itself at all to that recommendation of the IAC. It did not state whether the Government would phase out the bounty over three years. The supporting argument given by the IAC was that, if the Government announced now that it intended to phase out that bounty, the industry in Australia could adjust. This seems an entirely proper and reasonable way for us to reduce some of our bounties and tariff barriers, that is, to allow the industry to adjust.</PARA>
<PARA> The Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill does not give the industry that benefit. The arguments as to why the industry ought not to have that benefit really boiled down to the fact that the original intention of the bounty-this I accept as being the intention of the Act-was that it should be given solely to the consumer. The legislation makes it quite clear that it was not meant to be at any stage a protective measure for local industry. However, I think we all must agree that it eventually turned out to be a protective measure for local industry. The incidental protection that is involved in placing that bounty only on local products, as Senator Walsh pointed out most persuasively last night, has the effect of giving a protective incidence to local manufacturers. I do not believe that, while the Act has a particular intention, if spin-offs have another intention we can ignore them completely. We have to address ourselves to what may be the likely consequences for the local manufacturing industry of the development of a subsidy rather than a simple bounty. When we address ourselves to that question we immediately discover that there is a fair range of complications. I will go through some of those. </PARA>
<PARA> The first complication that needs to be raised, which was not addressed at all in the Minister's second reading speech, concerns Christmas Island, a dependency of Australia to which we have a particular responsibility. I think that most people would agree that it seems that in the short term Christmas Island will be mined out. It may very well be that its mining life will be no more than five to 10 years. This depends on whether there is a possibility of developing a successful economic operation in mining low yielding ores. Leaving that aside, I do not think that anybody is really giving the fertiliser industry of Christmas Island a terribly long life. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, I believe, has a peculiar obligation to inform the legislature of its intentions in this regard. I refer to a comment that Senator Chaney made last night in answer to propositions by the Australian Democrats. He made what I thought was a cheap gibe about the possibility of our being in government and hence our ability to take unreal positions. Quite frankly, I was not elected to be a part of government; I was elected by the people of Queensland to be part of the Parliament and the Parliament's sole responsibility is in relation to legislation. I take that responsibility seriously. It is the one that I was elected to take and it is the one that I will pursue. I will not, in any way, accede to the Minister's implication that I could be totally irresponsible with my vote because I may or may not be in government. I believe that that is a proposition which casts aspersions on every member of an opposition, whether it consists of Liberal or Labor Party members. It implies that members of an opposition are able to take up totally irresponsible positions in relation to legislation before this House. I utterly and totally reject the implication against me and other members of my Party. When I cast my vote I cast it in as responsible a fashion as I can in relation to all the material that is available to me. If the Minister wishes to debate that matter further I will be quite happy to do so. I have been at great pains to discuss with the Minister our problems not only with this legislation but also with many other pieces of legislation. We have put a great deal of work into every piece of legislation that has come before this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Minister made no comment on Christmas Island in his second reading speech. That is an omission that I hope he will address in his reply. The second problem concerns discussions that the Government has undertaken with the Government of the Republic of Nauru. Again, I believe that we have statutory obligations to accept certain amounts of fertiliser from the Republic of Nauru. In addition to that, we have certain moral obligations to the republics that are in our neighbourhood. I refer particularly to those of the Pacific. Nauru's economy is involved quite intricately with its fertiliser industry. I would be very interested in the Minister's response as to what discussions the Government had with the Government of the Republic of Nauru before this legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives and what assurances our Government was able to give to the Government of Nauru. Failing any discussions, what does the Government believe are its obligations to the Republic of Nauru? I believe that we must foster close and continuing links with the countries in our region.</PARA>
<PARA> The third problem, which I believe to be of crucial significance to this Bill, is the failure of the Government to lock into place any anti-dumping legislation as is contained in the Act governing nitrogenous fertilisers. Clause 6 of the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Act 1966, a parallel Act, addresses quite extensively the issue of when subsidies will not be paid. The intent of that clause is that Australia not be involved in promoting dumping within the agricultural community of the world. I believe that in the long term interests of our agricultural community we must avoid at all costs the adoption of inconsistent positions-for instance, by criticising the European Economic Community for engaging in dumping in valuable markets that we wish to develop in South East Asia and then ourselves being a party to possible support of dumping operations on the part of the United States. In that regard I hope that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) will respond concerning the precarious position of the phosphatic fertiliser industry in that country, and in Florida in particular. On Monday of this week yet another three major plants in the United States closed down completely. Undoubtedly there is a glut on world markets and, I believe quite rightly, the farmers, the consumers of fertiliser in this country, wish to take some advantage of lower world prices. But I wonder whether, in seeking that quite legitimate end the farmers may very well neglect their own long term interests which may be tied up more closely with those of our own producers than they may have recognised in their submissions to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Government's intention, in relation to the protection tariff debate, possibly to isolate one industry, fertiliser manufacturing. Why has the Government chosen at this time to take in regard to this industry the particular stance that it has? I support totally the types of propositions that have been put to me and to other senators by the National Farmers Federation in relation to the development within this country of some coherent, cohesive, rational policy on tariff reductions-that, indeed, putting into place such a policy will do far more for our rural industries than will any tinkering with subsidies or bounties. I agree totally-I believe the point has been made by other senators also-that our rural industries, in comparison with manufacturing industries, are not in any way supported, in regard to type and development, although seemingly, it is the settled view of the community that they are. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe it is just the settled view of the newspapers. I believe that all of the evidence confirms that the rural industries of this country are not supported to anywhere near the extent that our manufacturing industries are supported. Whether one accepts the general proposition of the Industries Assistance Commission that the difference in that regard is of the order of 2 per cent and 24 per cent, or whether one agrees with the recent comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that those figures are exaggerated-I notice that he did not say they were totally incorrect-I believe the margin between effective support for our rural industries and that for our manufacturing industries is very wide indeed. We must address constantly the problem of assisting our rural industries to be competitive in the world market. The world market is a very simple market in that in almost every other country rural production is heavily subsidised by one means or another. In this regard, in the National Farmers Federation Newsletter of May 1982, Mr Davidson, its President, is reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is clearly established that high levels of protection to some manufacturing industries add to the cost of farm inputs, reduce the international competitiveness of Australian rural exports, limit the development of new export markets and completely undermine Australia's case for reduced protectionism in other countries such as the EEC . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I concur with those comments. One has only to point to the problem with farm machinery in Australia to see that the Government's attitude is causing enormous problems for rural industry. Many other examples can be cited. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think he might. Mr Davidson said further:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The NFF will not relent in its long-term policies to effect moderate, progressive reduction in protection. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that accords totally with the propositions that Senator Siddons has put forward time and time again on behalf of the Australian Democrats in seeking long term indicative planning in this country so that we may settle on the direction in which we are heading. Mr Davidson said further:</PARA>
<PARA> In simple terms, the Government cannot expect the rural sector to accept reductions in assistance when assistance to other sectors is being maintained . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In two areas-the motor car manufacturing industry and the clothing and textiles industry-the Government has recently found its way clear to make massive decisions, but it has apparently not been able to make similar decisions which would benefit farmers. This measure has the problems that I have enunciated- those with regard to Christmas Island and Nauru and the long term interests of the rural sector, which are linked inextricably with the Government's overall policy on tariff reduction. A further problem concerns whether the Government at any stage will make any announcements, following the IAC's recommendation to phase out the bounty. I believe that if the Government had introduced the original legislation, had agreed with the IAC on a phasing-out operation and at the same time had pointed to the other changes that it would make, either in monetary policy with regard to the value of the dollar or in other assistance for the rural industry, such a package would have made much more sense than does the one-off, ad hoc proposition that we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I believe that the Government has an obligation, which it has not fulfilled to date, to explain to the legislature the particular items that I have raised. It is excessively difficult for people in this chamber to vote for Government legislation unless the Government is willing to enter into a comprehensive debate on it and thus permit sufficient understanding of its intentions in associated areas to enable honourable senators to cast a responsible vote on the issues. I await the Minister's reply to my comments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the legislative program we must get through this day I will not delay the Senate much further. Obviously, had there been any chance of the amendments made to the Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill 1982 in the House of Representatives being extracted in the Senate, it would have warranted a more detailed speech and approach. As I understand the current situation, it is not the majority wish in the Senate for those amendments to be deleted, since that could well lead to the passage of the Bill being deferred until August. I make my position very clear. I regard the action of the House of Representatives in amending the Bill at the instigation of the Government as an insult to this chamber. The House of Representatives knew full well that the Bill would expire on 30 June. The Government, which instigated the amendments to its own Bill in the House of Representatives knew it and also knew that the House of Representatives, would be in recess when the Senate was considering those amendments. It therefore placed us in a position of having a gun at our heads. It was a case of: 'If you do not pass this legislation you will delay the payment of the bounty'. If Government senators believe that to be a proper situation, let them say so. In my view it denies to this chamber its rightful role as a House of review. Effectively it cuts off that role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the National Farmers Federation or any bureaucrat tries to accuse the Opposition, the Australian Democrats or me of tampering with the bounty, they stand condemned. It has been this chamber's role of review that has saved the farmer time and again. I would be prepared to travel the length and breadth of Tasmania to speak to my contacts in the rural industry to make known my views on this matter. Yesterday Mr David Trebeck, Deputy Director of the National Farmers Federation, in his address entitled 'Superphosphate Hypocrisy and Frustration', said about the debate in this Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> The whole sorry saga is due to culminate today when the Senate votes on the legislation. It all hinges on whether the Democrats decide to support the ALP and defeat the Bill. If such outrageous and hypocritical action is successful, it will mean that the bounty as a whole will expire on 30 June, given that the House of Representatives is not likely to be reconvened before then to consider the Senate's action. </PARA>

<PARA> A number of honourable senators have made a number of points on these matters. I will not canvass those, but certain questions arise which have not been answered. They include: The question of the long term effect on the farmers of Australia if the Government's proposal to extend the bounty to imports is adopted. We have not heard what effect this would have in the long term. It has been suggested to us by the lobbyists that there is some short term benefit but the long term benefit has not been suggested. What will be the long term effect on the trace elements in the Australian soil if, for example, farmers opt for triple superphosphate instead of single superphosphate? That is another question to which the Government appears not to have addressed itself. If it has addressed itself to that problem, then it has not confided in the Senate or the House of Representatives. What would be the effect on manufacturers if the bounty were extended to imports? That has not properly been determined nor could it properly be determined in the short period between the time when the Government decided to amend its own legislation in the House of Representatives and the time when the legislation was introduced here. It has been suggested that a number of Australian manufacturers are on a knife edge. It has been suggested, for example, that the Duchess mine in Queensland was operating on a knife edge basis and that it has been resurrected only in the last 18 months or so. What effect will the legislation have on that mine's operations? What effect will it have, for example, on the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australia Ltd in Tasmania? If it means that that company's operations are no longer viable, I ask the Government to tell me how the asset will be disposed of by the company. These are the sorts of considerations that should have taken place but obviously have not been given to the effects of the amendments made by the Government in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen to the workers of Christmas Island? Has the Government given consideration to its guarantee to the manufacturer on Christmas Island which in turn has given a guarantee to the Australian National Line that it will subsidise the shortfall in the carrying of phosphate from Christmas Island? When ANL took over the ships of the British Phosphate Commission, a guarantee was given by the manufacturer, backed up by the Australian Government. Has the Government considered the effect on the Treasury of having to subsidise ANL even further to the extent guaranteed by that undertaking given by British Phosphate at the time? What will be the add-on effect of that further subsidy in respect of ANL operations in coastal Australia, including its operations from the mainland to Tasmania? These are the sorts of things about which we have heard nothing from the Government but which are of vital importance if we in this chamber are effectively to discharge our role as a House of review. Allegations have been made that the manufacturers in Australia are not passing on the full benefit of the bounty. They are very serious allegations, given the provisions of section 7 of the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Minister is not satisfied that the prices being charged by a producer to purchasers in respect of the sale of bountiable products, or fertiliser mixtures, produced by him at registered premises are such as to pass on to the purchasers the full benefit of the bounty in respect of the bountiable products, or the bountiable products used in the fertiliser mixtures, as the case may be, the Minister may direct that bounty shall not be paid to the producer. </PARA>
<PARA>As we all know, the Department does keep a check on the matter. I understand the proposition that various factors could substantiate the allegations but they have not been brought to the fore at present. If they exist, which I doubt, let those who are making the allegations against the manufacturers come forward with the proof. I am sure that it would be in the interests of the manufacturers and indeed the farmers themselves if some investigation could be made of these allegations. One of the statements by Mr Trebeck in his address yesterday was:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me say at the outset that NFF has lobbied this matter, in support of the proposed extension to imports, more intensively than any single issue I can recall in recent memory (broad protection matters such as motor vehicles aside).</PARA>
<PARA>That appeared on the front page of his statement. Yet in conclusion he talked of the bounty as being rather symbolic. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It remains symbolic. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder what benefit has come out of these lobbying efforts by the National Farmers Federation which have been more intensive than on any single issue. I have supported the superphosphate bounty and I have been accused of thereby helping the big farmers. What the National Farmers Federation has done in its lobbying to date is to raise the question of whether the bounty ought to continue to apply. That is the danger which occurs when this type of lobbying goes on. If such outrageous and hypocritical action is successful-my name was not mentioned in the accusations but the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats were mentioned-I intend to engage in a bit of outrageous and hypocritical action by, as a senator, exercising my role of the review of legislation that comes from the House of Representatives. I would have voted to extract the clauses if that course had been available to us in the Senate by means of a majority vote, but I understand that is not the situation at present. That would have thrown the onus back on the Government to put its own house in order. The Government would have come back to us in August with a reasoned submission rather than something that it has dreamed up off the top of its head and amended in the House of Representatives. Of course, the second best thing would be to defer consideration of this measure until August. The onus would then be on the Government to say that it does intend to support the continuance of the bounty, which I have supported against a lot of criticism in this chamber for a considerable number of years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have enjoyed the four or five speeches which have been made on the Fertilizers ( Subsidy) Amendment Bill. No doubt I have been educated by them. The debates have circulated around the quite different propositions which various members of the Senate seem to think are the critical points of the Bill. I was relieved to find that Senator Macklin, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, did make a concession on a point which I think is rather central and that is that the intent of this legislation is to help farmers. That seems to have been largely lost in the general debate around here. I acknowledge and thank him for that although I do not believe that the rest of his contribution really took that worthy sentiment into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second area of debate that the Bill has produced is the need for protection of phosphate manufacturers in Australia. Quite clearly that is burning deep in the heart of Senator Harradine. Obviously some honourable senators have a deep concern about the possible effects on phosphate manufacturers. They are not consoled by the rather soothing words of the Industries Assistance Commission over a period of years that this is a competitive industry, an industry which has various advantages and which is able to face up to international competition . There is a second quite separate element of the debate which involves the protection of phosphate manufacturers. We had a third area of debate which concerned the whole question of protection generally. I believe the contribution of Senator Walsh and indeed the basic contribution of Senator Macklin revolved around their attitudes to protection policy generally. Both of them are, at heart, free traders. Both of them find artificial interference with the markets offensive. They find offensive the distortion of the markets, which is so often the result of tariffs and subsidies. They brought their concerns very much into the open in their contributions to the debate. That question provided a third and quite separate strand of argument. The fourth quite separate strand was that we have to protect the interests of the Christmas Island workers. Within the last half hour or so of the debate we even got a mention of Nauru. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a fifth and, I think, rather more offensive strand of the argument which related to the fact that whilst we can all get up in here and say whatever we like about whoever we like in terms as base and as vile as we like, if somebody has the cheek to put a strong view to us that person is damned. I did not know that one could manage to squeeze into the word 'bureaucrat' such contempt and loathing. I must say that it reminded me of the way people use the word 'scab' around here. 'Bureaucrat' is not really a term of offence. Quite frankly, if Mr David Trebeck or anybody else wants to put strong views about what we do in this place I suggest that they are entitled to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of unseemly language in this place is not infrequent, including language about people who are not in a position to defend themselves. I am not very impressed by those elements of the debate which say: 'How dare the farmers, through the National Farmers Federation, use strong language about us'. I receive a great deal of strong language in the communications which come to me in the range of duties that I adopt on behalf of the Government. I do not find it pleasant but also I do not feel it is desirable to indicate that the use of that language is something which will colour my judgment on the issues with which I am called to deal. I do not say: 'How dare you say that I might be regarded as a hypocrite or whatever'. I simply suggest that we should get back to the substance of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the basic substance of the Bill is that we should provide some assistance for farmers through the payment of a fertiliser bounty which will now become-if this Bill is passed-a fertiliser subsidy. We have had a deal of academic argument about whether there should be any form of assistance. I remember part of the contribution of Senator Walsh where he used words to the effect that there was no case for transferring income from taxpayers to farmers, particularly wealthy farmers. That was the part of his argument which was really against there being any form of assistance in this area at all. As a matter of pure logic and as a matter of a principle which would be applied in a world where principles were applied equally across the board, I think that Senator Walsh is quite correct. There would be no logic in transferring taxpayers' money to farmers in a system where transfers against farmers were not taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> But it has been admitted in the debate and it is part of the IAC report that, in fact, there are transfers which are inimical to the economic interests of farmers. There are very heavily subsidised sections of Australian industry which cost farmers dearly. Part of the conclusion which is brought out by the IAC and, I think, adequately explained by it-it is surely generally understood in this chamber-is that what has been described in this debate as the diminishing assistance provided to farmers through this subsidy, or bounty as it is at present, is but a tiny offset to the disadvantages of one of the few sectors of Australian industry which genuinely in many cases trades internationally on a free market or on a market which is loaded against it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Crichton-Browne, speaking in support of the Government, put views which were particularly related to Western Australia and talked about the problems and the costs of inputs in that part of Western Australia. I acknowledge those arguments. But, to my mind, the really strong point is that, given a scheme of assistance to industry generally which is weighted in favour of manufacturing industry, it is hard to gainsay that there should be some continuing provision of assistance to farmers. I suppose that reality is reflected in the fact that all parties in this chamber and even independents are paying at least lip- service to the proposition that the bounty should continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now deal with the other strands of debate which were part of it and which appear to be central to the fact that a group of honourable senators is determined to delay this legislation notwithstanding the break which that will involve in the provision of bounty assistance. The protection of phosphate manufacturers is a point which has been made by a number of speakers. I can do very little more than refer the Senate to the various pronouncements of the IAC which has examined this proposition over a period of years. In 1976-which is some time ago now but it is interesting to see the consistency-we find the IAC saying that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is aware that its recommendation for payment of bounty on imports--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, of course, the proposition before us now-</PARA>
<PARA>and for the sale of phosphate rock from Christmas Island at commercial prices will remove protection presently available to Australian fertiliser manufacturers. It sees such removal as being consistent with the recommendations in its report of 21 August 1975 on Superphosphate Production that assistance be not accorded to the production of superphosphates. If removal exposes the fertiliser manufacturers to damaging competition, the appropriate course would be a further examination of the question of assistance for their industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I will quote only briefly from the Commission's more recent report of 26 February 1982. The IAC said:</PARA>
<PARA> Given the advantages of locally produced single superphosphate, the minimal protection currently afforded manufacturers of nitrogenous fertilisers and the low price elasticity of demand for fertilisers, the Commission considers that removal of fertiliser assistance, or its extension to imported phosphatic fertilisers, would not be likely to lead to a significant reduction in the local manufacture of these fertilisers. Even if this reduction could be shown to be significant, it has not been demonstrated that fertiliser manufacture should be shielded from import competition or that consumption assistance is an appropriate means of achieving this. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, that is the expert advice which is available from the independent IAC to the Government. It suggests that there is something of an over-emphasis on the problems of manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point for consideration is that, if the world market is so difficult, it remains true that Australian manufacturers have access to other sources of rock. If there is such a deep and abiding problem that problem is not merely one which relates to the import of finished fertilisers. It is presumably a problem which can also arise with respect to the importation of the rock which is presently imported, in the main, from Nauru or Christmas Island. So, there is no answer to the longer term problems of the manufacturers with respect to international competition in the propositions which have been put forward by those who are opposing this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that in this country we have an established system of providing temporary and long term assistance for those industries which need it. It is a system which I think people such as Senator Walsh and Senator Macklin would suggest usually results in over-protection of many sections of Australian industry. They are not arms of government action which are open to the accusation of inadequate protection. Rather, the accusations from those honourable senators at least are usually the reverse. I suggest that the simple answer to the manufacturers' point is that this is legislation which looks to providing some compensating adjustment to the rural community. If, against the view of the IAC, there really is a significant risk to manufacturers, they should be seeking to use the mechanisms which are available to gain the protection that they say they require. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government takes the view that it should not make decisions on protection without reference to those authorities. That is a view which I would have thought would have the support of everyone in this chamber. Yet we have people wishing to move in a way which says: 'No, you do not need to do that. We have made our judgments. I live next door to EZ Industries and I know they might be in trouble. Therefore, we ought to be imposing protection by this'. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that second leg of argument has little or no weight. If it does have weight against the views of the IAC, it is a matter which should be subjected to references to either the Temporary Assistance Authority or the IAC. I suggest that that is the course manufacturers should follow. I believe that one or more of them are intending to or, in fact, have already set off along that course. The argument about protection generally is an argument which I believe we would properly address in debates which touch on broader sections of industry than this debate does. I do not believe that this bounty-to be a subsidy-is the vehicle which ought to be used to stress or to press upon the Parliament that we want, generally, a lower system of protection in Australia. It seems to me that the farmers of Australia are entitled to ask: 'Why us?'</PARA>
<PARA> Protection for Christmas Island and Nauru is a matter which is, of course, of serious concern to the Commonwealth Government, but not because there are some mysterious contractual arrangements which seem to be in the mind of, I think, Senator Harradine. I advise him to address inquiries to the Government or to the Department of Primary Industry if he feels that there are some arrangements in place of which I am not aware. But the obligations that we have with respect to the administration of Christmas Island are clear. We, of course, have no similar obligations with respect to Nauru. The concerns which have been expressed about the future operations on Christmas Island are in that sense, the concerns of the Government as well. We have the responsibility for the administration of the Island and that responsibility is intimately linked with the operation of industry on the Island for the limited periods which remains. I stress that it is a limited period. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of the IAC report and in light of the Government's examination of the factors relevant to sourcing decisions by manufacturers, the Government is of the view that this legislation is of little relevance to the problems of Christmas Island. The future of phosphate rock production on Christmas Island will be influenced by a number of considerations which will have a much greater impact than will the proposed variation to the basis of fertiliser assistance payments. Again, I do not wish to delay the Senate unduly but I remind the Senate that the deposits on Christmas Island have an extremely limited life. We are looking at but a few years, even if all goes well with production on that Island. There are prospects of sales to other markets, including sales for lower grade rock. There is, of course, the internal influence of the exploitation of the Duchess deposit which can have a very considerable impact on the market for imported rock in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Christmas Island as an entity faces threats to its continuation which are acknowledged by the Government and which are the concern of the Government. We see the threat offered by this legislation as being minimal, if any threat does indeed exist. From the point of view of Christmas Island, the Government certainly does not see it as being necessary to change its approach to this legislation. I should like to make clear, however, that we are concerned with the long term future of the Island and, as is consistent with our responsibility to the Island community, we are trying to make sure that we plan the future of the Island in a way that protects the interests of the people of the Island. </PARA>
<PARA> We have commissioned a second report from Mr Sweetland dealing with the long term future of the Island. It has yet to be considered by the Government. I do not think it has been printed; it may be in the process of printing. It has certainly not yet been published. If, contrary to the Government's and the IAC's expectations, the changed arrangements which flowed from this Bill appeared to have some effects, those effects would be taken into account and would be part of the Government's consideration of what it should do with respect to the long term future of the Island. I can undertake that the Government would monitor the changing situation on Christmas Island very carefully. It is, of course, already doing that, and this legislation is certainly not seen by the Government as something which is threatening to the Christmas Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been foreshadowed that the attitude of at least some senators-indeed, it has been said that it is a majority of senators-would be that they would wish now to see this legislation delayed. I put it very warmly to the Senate that that is not a course which is to the advantage of anyone. It is clearly not to the advantage of the farmers of Australia, who I am sure, have no wish to see any break in the availability of the bounty on superphosphate. I do not believe that it is to the advantage of the phosphate manufacturers. But in any event, if an advantage is required for them, I put it very seriously to the chamber that it is an advantage which should be processed in the normal way through the Temporary Assistance Authority or the IAC, and that we should not regard this bounty or subsidy as being a protective tool. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to those senators who have a genuine concern about and interest in Christmas Island that it is the Government's judgment that this is a measure that will have a nil or, at worst, a marginal effect on the difficulties which Christmas Island already faces and that the Government will carefully monitor that situation and take into account any changes which occur as a result of this legislation and, indeed, the changes which occur because of larger factors that I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no satifaction to me that we are dealing with this legislation in the absence of the House of Representatives. That is a matter of fact. It is not a matter which has been in any sense planned by the Government. All honourable senators are aware of the way in which the program for this session has proceeded. But I want to take issue with Senator Harradine's suggestion that in some way the position is made different by the fact that the House of Representatives adopted Government amendments to the legislation before it was sent to this place. If one dispassionately and honestly looks at this situation, I think that one's attitude to the legislation should not be affected by the initial form in which it entered the House of Representatives. If it is objectionable to some senators in the form in which it now appears, presumably it would have been objectionable if it had been amended at the original time, before it was introduced into the House of Representatives. I ask any honourable senator who has that factor weighing on his or her mind to take into account the fact that it is really irrelevant to the merits of the Bill and does not go to the question of principle raised by Senator Harradine about the ability of the legislation to be dealt with here in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of the farmers of Australia, I ask the Senate to give this legislation speedy passage. To fail to do so would almost certainly result in some hiatus in the payment of subsidy in a situation in which it is the unanimous view of this chamber that the subsidy should continue to be paid, and I think that that would be a matter for considerable regret. I commend the legislation to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. So in other words, because of the Government's actions, there was no opportunity for the Labor Party as a whole to consider the amendments that the Government introduced to its own legislation in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two Committee stage amendments have been forecast. One is to be moved by me, the reasons for which I outlined last night. This morning Senator Chipp indicated that he intended to move a second amendment. The purpose of both amendments is related. It is to insulate the Australian industry against the quite violent cyclical swings in world prices. Senator Chipp's proposal is to insert into the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act a clause identical to that which is already in the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Act. It could be described as an anti-dumping clause. Senator Chaney has suggested that devices aimed at protecting Australian industry should not be inserted into the phosphatic fertiliser bill, but that obviously begs the question of why such a device is already in the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Act, and why, if it is the Government's view that such provisions have no place in legislation on this matter, the Government has allowed that clause to remain in the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Act. </PARA>
<PARA> A fact crucial to Senator Chipp's proposal is the present price of phosphatic and, I suppose, nitrogenous fertilizer in the United States. I have not been able to obtain information on that this morning. I have been told by the United States Embassy that, as far as the Embassy is concerned, it would not be possible to get such information in less than 24 hours. I do not want to take up too much time or explain why, but that information is critical to the operation of an anti-dumping provision because the crucial test is whether the f.o.b. price is lower than the American domestic price. We do know fairly accurately what the present f.o.b. price for triple superphosphate in the United States is. I am afraid I do not know at this stage what the American domestic price is. For that reason it is difficult, I suggest even impossible, to make an informed judgment about the amendment that has been foreshadowed by Senator Chipp. </PARA>
<PARA> For the reasons I stated last night, I believe there is a case for the provision of some insulation for the local industry against cyclical and quite violent price movements, even from the viewpoint of the consumers-that is, the farmers-because the industry has been price competitive over the long term and probably will be in the future. While the Australian industry under present conditions would certainly not be totally destroyed if it were faced with open competition from world suppliers-and I might add that the existing bounties do not, by a long way, close the gap between import prices and domestic prices for some types of fertilisers-equally there is no doubt that some of the industry's existing capacity would be phased out to the possible ultimate detriment of the Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure whether Senator Chipp's proposed amendment has been circulated but I have been given a copy of it. The substance of it is to insert into the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act a clause identical to one in the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Act. If either Senator Chipp's foreshadowed amendment or the one which I circulated last night were carried the legislation would be deferred until August because the House of Representatives is not sitting and I am sure the Government would have no intention of recalling it before the end of June just to deal with amendments which may be made to this Bill by the Senate. Therefore, no further delay would be incurred if the Senate moved at this stage to defer further consideration of the Bill until the Budget sitting. Reluctant though I am to expose myself to 12 weeks of intensive lobbying from the contestants on either side of this debate-and I am a little less reluctant to expose everybody else in the Senate to the same intensive lobbying-I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I thank the Committee for its indulgence. The Government obviously is opposed to the motion to report progress with the objective, as outlined by Senator Walsh, of obtaining the postponement of the consideration of this Bill until August. The reasons for that are not hard to understand. The effect of postponing consideration of the Bill will be to provide a break in the bounty arrangements which have applied to these fertilisers and that is certainly a long way from the wishes of the Government. It will be extremely disruptive to the marketing of fertilisers in Australia. There will be a period of considerable uncertainty. There will be a period of very great difficulty, I suspect, for manufacturers, for distributors and for the farming community generally. In other words, the honourable senators who have produced what I think are marginal arguments about marginal doubts, with their eyes open and anxious as they may be to avoid responsibility for this, are going to produce a series of negative results for sections of the community for which they all profess great concern and interest. I believe that the manufacturers are as unlikely to benefit from this move as any other section of the community, including the farmers. So I say to the Committee with very great earnestness that I think this is a very unfortunate move and one which will produce a whole series of unfortunate results. It is strongly opposed by the Government. It is seen as being against the interests of farmers, against the interests of manufacturers and distributors and against the interests of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS LICENCE FEES BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and the Radio Communications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1982 which I will introduce soon, vary the basis on which Radiocommunication Licence Fees are charged. The intent of these Bills is to allow for radiocommunications licence fees to be determined on a basis other than solely the recovery of the costs of administering the radio spectrum. In future regulations made under the Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill 1982 would set out the fees applicable. A present licence fees are determined by Regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also includes a provision to ensure that all Commonwealth and Territory authorities are required to pay fees. In addition it further provides for transitional arrangements to exempt licencees who have already paid licence fees under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 from payment of fees under the new Bill, in respect of the grant or renewal of licences during the period 1 July 1981 to the date of commencement of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters connected with the implementation of these measures are included in a Radiocommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1982. Honourable Senators will be aware that Section 55 of the Constitution requires no matter other than the imposition of taxation can be validly dealt with in a tax Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The costs of providing radio frequency management services relate, among other factors, to the amount of spectrum space needed to accommodate the service, whether the service is in a valuable part of the spectrum, the service's potential to interfere with other services and the power allocated. Each assignment complicates the task succeeding assignments as there is less spectrum available for allocation. </PARA>
<PARA> All these factors were taken into account when setting radio-communication licence fees for 1981-82. As this financial year was the first year when full cost recovery was implemented, there was an overall increase in most categories of fees of the order of 12 per cent. However some categories of licences increased by much greater percentages as these categories of licences were previously charged at levels well below the costs associated with them. The licencees, in some cases, faced increases in fees of the order of many thousands of dollars. The television industry was particularly affected due to its extensive use of wide-band fixed links. </PARA>
<PARA> These fixed links are essential to the operation of many stations, especially to those stations serving a viewing population spread over a wide area. The links are used to distribute programs to remote transmitters and for studio to transmitter links. These facilities were established at great capital cost at a time when the licence fees for these radiocommunciations links ranged from $40 to around $300. Accordingly, the cost of a radiocommunication licence for these links was very low in comparison to the costs involved in establishing and maintaining them. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981-82, with the implementation of full cost recovery in the radio frequency management area, the cost of licencing these links increased dramatically with the fee liability of two stations now exceeding $30,000. Most other existing licence fee categories were not affected to the same extent as the fees paid by them in previous years were relatively close to the cost recovery related fees introduced in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's attention has been drawn to the problems that these increases have caused some licencees and, following reconsideration of the matter, the Government has decided that some adjustment in fees in necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government remains firmly committed to full cost recovery in the area of radio frequency management but acknowledges that a period of phasing in of these fees is appropriate and that the measures should be retrospective to 1 July 1981 . </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been advised that it would be appropriate for its objectives to be achieved by the introduction of legislation providing for the imposition of licence fees as taxes, with the actual levels of fees being established in Regulations made under the new legislation. Accordingly, licence fees would cease to be prescribed in the Wireless Telegraphy Regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905. </PARA>
<PARA> In introducing these Bills, I wish to make three things clear. First, the Bills do not indicate an intention on the part of the Government to immediately and substantially increase radiocommunications licence fees. The appropriate levels of these fees will be determined by the Government in the light of all relevant factors. Second, the fees to be imposed by these measures do not apply to normal television and broadcasting receivers. Third, commercial television and radio stations are licensed under separate legislation in respect of their broadcasting activities, i.e., transmissions intended for reception by the general public. Fees imposed under this legislation will not apply to those activities. Radiocommunications licence fees apply to the transmission and reception of private and business radiocommunciations conducted via two way radios and microwave links. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned previously, the Radiocommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1982 implements measures that could not be included in the Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill 1982 because of Constitutional requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 by omitting from it the existing provisions relating to the payment of fees for the grant or renewal of licences, as these are now provided for in the Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill 1982. It also authorises fees to be prescribed for other matters relating to the administration of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has also been made for any fees already paid to be refunded or offset against future payments if they are greater than fees payable under the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Bill repeals that part of the Overseas Telecommunications Act 1946 which exempts the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) from the payment of licence fees. Consequently the Commission will be required to pay radiocommunications licence fees for its use of the spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill and the Radiocommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill take the fee charging power out of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 and apply to two-way radio and microwave links. Firstly, the Opposition does not oppose the legislation, but has some qualifications about it. I want to indicate some of those qualifications. The first qualification we had has now been resolved. We wondered why this legislation was necessary. It appears that there has been legal advice to the effect that there has always been some doubt about the power to impose fees under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, although it is interesting that the power to impose those fees has never been challenged. I understand that, for 1981-82, the decision to base fees on the user-pays principle was made for the first time on the basis of full recovery costs-that is, the cost of the Radio Frequency Management Division-and administration was apportioned to licensees. Previously charges had been based on a per link basis without regard to the width or spectrum space taken up by the link. Under the new scale this was taken into account, with the result that the wide links, mainly television stations, incurred a huge increase-for example, a few hundred dollars to many thousands of dollars. The note of the former Minister for Communications, Mr Sinclair, refers to a sum of $30,000 or sums exceeding $30, 000. As a result of this change there was something of an outcry from the industry. I am sure that most honourable senators have received letters from stations, particularly regional stations, relating to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result, the Government decided to phase in the increases. But there was no legal means under the Wireless Telegraphy Act whereby fees could be remitted. As a result, a new Bill giving these powers, retrospective to July 1981, was brought forward. I make the point that it is something of an inconsistency for this Government to be so willing to apply retrospectivity to give tax back to aggrieved licensees. That contrasts with the Government's unwillingness to collect tax retrospectively. I refer, of course, to action which could have been taken to collect tax retrospectively in relation to tax avoidance schemes. I make no criticism of the reasons which have been advanced by the Government, which are straightforward; but there is that inconsistency, which one is not unused to in observing the Government from this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Bills make provision for a tax for spectrum space. Thus the nexus between fees and costs of administration that previously applied-I am not sure whether legally required or required by policy-is now being broken. The second reading speech of the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) confirms this . The point is that any future government could tax users of the spectrum. The capital value of spectrum space has been the subject of lengthy academic and other arguments over many years. It is very difficult to set the value of the radio spectrum. There is no free market in that spectrum and it is hard to estimate. I remember appearing before the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal not so long ago to give evidence to the cable television inquiry. One member of the Tribunal hazarded what I can only regard as an informed guess about the cost of spectrum space in relation to a metropolitan television station. Some of the figures, which are estimates, are very high in value. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be that even if a tax were set at market rates on capital value it could be a very high figure. There would be no necessary reason to set it at such a level. In fact, it could be set at a quite arbitrary level. I think that is something which the industry, particularly the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, is concerned about. It has made representations to various honourable senators about the matter. I think the point is worth drawing attention to. I do not know whether the presence of television interests here in Canberra yesterday was in any way related to that question. But it is a matter which I am sure will always attract the attention of the heavies in the industry, and the Department of Communications, which is sometimes described in the industry as the Department of FACTS and FARB, may well have had some inquiries about this legislation as recently as yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of comments could be made about the open-ended nature of this issue. But I just flag attention to it as something which is of concern in the industry . I just want to commend from our point of view the idea that in principle there should be a proper return in respect of the use of spectrum space but that the tax imposed should bear a proper relationship to ability to pay and to the incidence of other taxes which bear on companies involved in the television industry and, indeed, companies across the board. I suppose it is fair to say that, while being mildly critical, we commend the phasing-in decision. However, at the same time, we point to the inconsistency in the Government's attitude to retrospectivity which is quite apparent in this legislation. The television industry, of course, with that detachment which comes from having no responsibility other than to itself, is sometimes very critical of the Department of Communications. The industry says that the user-pays principle is not applicable because it should not have to bear the costs of the bureaucracy. I guess all honourable senators would have heard this argument. But that is something which I do not think anybody in government or opposition can seriously accede to because if this activity is to be on a proper business footing with the use paying it is important that the Radio Frequency Management Division, which provides the services, be the appropriate beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to raise one general question which relates to the wider aspects of communications policy. Perhaps there should be a general policy on the use of the radio spectrum and perhaps it is time an inquiry was conducted into the economies particularly of the television industry and into the economies of the use in that spectrum. We have had a plethora of inquiries which involve the communications area-the Davidson Committee of Inquiry into Telecommunications Services in Australia, the various inquiries before the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in respect of which all these matters are relevant and the inquiry in which lead the satellite proceeding under a totally separate authority. I believe this is a further example of ad hockery and inconsistency in Government policy. I make what I hope is the constructive suggestion that the value of the spectrum and the economies of the industry could well be closely examined by government, and perhaps the Department is the appropriate authority to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> We began by querying why these Bills were necessary. I think we now understand why the Bills are necessary on legal grounds. But I would also raise a further question as to why they are absolutely necessary at this stage as urgent matters when we are consistently told that a complete revamping of the Wireless Telegraphy Act is under way. I do not know whether that is so. I hope that in any reply that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) makes he confirms whether that is so or not. I think it is high time that such a revamping took place. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there are three major points of objection to the legislation. They do not lead us to opposing the legislation; nonetheless we think they are worth making. They indicate at least a degree of poor consultation on the provisions of this legislation. The real crux of the matter and the matter which hurts the industry most is the scale of the new fees which have been imposed and in respect of which there have been a number of complaints. However, as I understand it under the legislation, there will be no real information about the scale of fees until the regulations are prescribed. In respect of some situations the fees, particularly those for television stations, are to be phased in over three years. </PARA>
<PARA> I have made the point that we do not really know on what basis these fees are assessed in relation to the values of the fixed channels or the capacity of the licencees to pay. That is a very important question. I suppose concessions of the type introduced not so long ago for the bigger television stations can be made. Those sorts of matters are in a sense open-ended and make the legislation a bit open-ended. We tried to assess all the criticisms which were made by the industry. We regard them as important. But in our final judgment we do not think they justify us opposing this legislation. In saying that we do not oppose it. We hope that in the future there will be some much clearer understanding and much more specific information available about what is intended in relation to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, what is intended by way of some legislation on fees and what is intended by way of answering the questions of how fees will be assessed in terms of the capacity to pay. I think there is probably plenty of capacity at the moment but that may not always be so. This is something about which the industry might be concerned for the future. With qualifications, we indicate that we do not oppose the legislation. This is a fairly technical and complex matter. I wanted only to put on record my comments, which really amount to qualifications. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button has quite properly pointed to the reasons for this legislation. I think he referred to the possibility under pre-existing arrangements of High Court challenges being levelled with respect to fees charged for radio communication. I agree with the principle of the Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill. The Bill did not seem to me to be objectionable when I first looked at it except perhaps to the degree that it is unusual for taxation measures to be dealt with by regulation. That would be one of my concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After the Bill had passed through the House of Representatives, I was alerted to the concerns of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations. The Federation is concerned that although there has been general consultation in principle there has been no specific consultation with the industry on the Bill. Its concern focuses on a number of matters-firstly, an apparent lack of consultation between the Department of Communications and FACTS when the Bill was being drafted; secondly, a question about the legalities of altering the way fees are to be collected in the future; and thirdly, a lack of definition and guidelines in the Bill as to how the fees are to be formulated and applied. All honourable senators would have received a telex from FACTS pointing out some of its concerns about this matter. Prior to my receiving this telex I had conversations with Mr Frank Waldron who is the planning engineer of FACTS. I asked him for more specific details than were outlined in the telex that we received. As all honourable senators have received copies of this telex I think it is appropriate that I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> I believe it is important that you be aware that FACTS remains adamantly opposed to the licence fees Bills currently awaiting passage through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill 1982 and the Radiocommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Licence Fees Bill 1982 which were pushed through the lower house at 10.00 p.m. last Thursday. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills were introduced without any prior consultation which we regard as a most serious omission due to the fact that the proposals change a long established licence fee system into a new concept, a form of direct taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Our opposition centres on the lack of positive definition in the Bills, a deficiency that could lead to the most serious consequences for a whole host of radio spectrum users, not only the broadcasters and Telecom, but all the public service organisations, such as mobile rescue groups on sea and land. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that the Bills contain positive guidelines for the achievement of fair and equitable licence fees-That this must not be left to the process of regulation outside the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We urge you to recognise the most serious nature of this proposed legislation in its public affect and that the Bills' passage through the Senate must be delayed to allow for a proper examination of the ramifications of problems to which we have only briefly referred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Mr Waldron informed me that the major worry of FACTS was about clause 8 of the Bill. In the explanatory memorandum clause 8 is described as providing for fees to be payable as ascertained by regulations. It went on to explain:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This means that the scale of fees and other associated matters, including concessions, may be set by regulation, allowing for flexible and adaptive fee practices. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA>RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS LICENCE FEESBILLS 1982</PARA>
<PARA> Further to our telex to all Senators dated 14th May, 1982 and your discussions with Frank Waldron on 18th May, 1982, I would like to confirm the Federation's position. </PARA>
<PARA> FACTS is adamantly opposed to the Licence Fees Bills in the form in which they were introduced into the Senate on 18th May, 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill 1982 Clause 4, Interpretation, provides that 'fee' (when used in the Act) means 'a fee that is by way of or in the nature of a tax' and in Section 6 Licence Fees provides, so far as relevant, that where a licence (i.e. a licence referred to in Section 5 of the W &amp; T Act, 1905 [See Clause 4 of the Bill]) is granted or renewed, 'there is payable to the Commonwealth by the person to whom the licence is granted or the person who holds the licence that is renewed, as the case may be, a fee in respect of the licence'. Clause 8 of the Bill provides that the fees payable under Clause 6 are to be ascertained in accordance with the Regulations. The Bill then deals with other matters incidental to the imposition of the licence fee-time for payment, reduced fees and exemptions and the like. The Bill also contains a regulation making power in Clause 13. </PARA>
<PARA> FACTS is extremely concerned that there is no indication as to the manner in which the Fees are to be ascertained in accordance with regulations made under Clause 8 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We confirm our view that we regard a Taxing Act which provides for the tax which it imposes to be fixed in accordance with regulations to be an unsatisfactory Act and contrary to the general approach taken by Parliament to Taxing Acts. In support of this we refer to the following passage from judgment of Fullagar J. Re Dymond ([1959] 101 C.L.R. 11 at page 18). </PARA>
<PARA> 'By reason of the provisions of Section 55 (of the Constitution) it has been the invariable practice since the establishment of the Commonwealth, when parliament has proposed to levy a tax on any subject of taxation, to pursue that object by means of two separate Acts, the one of which actually imposes the tax and fixes the rate of tax, and the other of which provides for the incidence, assessment, and collection, of the tax and for a variety of incidental matters'. (Our interpolation.)</PARA>
<PARA> FACTS believes that the bills should contain positive guidelines for fair and equitable licence fees and we urge you to recognise the most serious nature of this proposed legislation in its current form. We believe the Bills passage through the Senate should be delayed to allow for a proper examination of the ramifications of problems to which we have briefly referred. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again I must stress that the industry had no consultation concerning this legislation. We were aware that the former Minister for Communications, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair, MP, did intend to provide for some concessional Radiocommunications Licence Fees for 1981/1982, but no detail of the legislation was sighted. (Attached is his letter of 14th April, which refers.) We regard this as a serious omission particularly as the proposals changed a long established licence fee system into a form of direct taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Should you or any of your colleagues wish to seek clarification of any of the issues we have raised in this letter or to any other issues which you consider relevant, the Federation would be pleased to provide such information. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Malone</PARA>
<PARA> You sent me a telex regarding radiocommunications licence fees payable by commercial television stations for broadband links. Several of your member stations also made representations to me on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As you are aware I have given very careful consideration to the points that have been raised both by FACTS, the individual stations and the Members of Parliament who have also written to me on their behalf. I referred the matter to the Government because of the policy implications for the user-pays principle and I am now able to inform you of the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> It was decided that legislation is to be prepared to provide for a concessional radiocommunication licence fee for certain commercial television stations. If this legislation is passed by Parliament it will be effective from 1 July 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The first proposed concession will apply to:</PARA>
<PARA> those commercial television stations whose licence fees payable under the Television Stations Licence Fee (TSLF) Act for the 1981-82 financial year are less than $25,000; and/or</PARA>
<PARA> those stations which were licensed to operate more than 12 radio relay links on 1 July 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The concession consists of a phasing in over three years of radiocommunications licence fees in such a way that these stations are required to pay 25 per cent of the scheduled fee in 1981-82, 50 per cent of the scheduled fee in 1982-83 and 75 per cent of the scheduled fee in 1983-84. After that time the concession will cease and the scheduled fee applies. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Government also decided that in those cases where the licence fees payable under the TSLF Act are less than radiocommunications licence fees, the scheduled Wireless Telegraphy Act fee is to be limited to the TSLF Act fee. This further concession is to be on-going, subject to approval by Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The rise of fees for 1981-82 was, as you are aware, due to application of the user-pays principle to radio frequency management. Full costs are being recovered for the first time in this activity in 1981-82. The Government is committed to this principle but, in the cases where the proposed concessions are applicable, is recognising that there is merit in phasing in fees where the rise in a single year might adversely affect the stations concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the necessity to raise fees for outdoor broadcast units was overlooked in assessment of fees for this year. To implement the user-pays principle, these fees should be substantially more than they are now. Perhaps you would discuss reasonable phasing in arrangements with my Department in order to begin this process in the 1982-83 year. </PARA>
<PARA> In my reply to representations from your member stations I have advised them that I would inform you as soon as the Government's decision on this matter became available and I would therefore appreciate it if you would inform your members accordingly. </PARA>

While the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905, under which radiocommunications licence fees were previously imposed, made like provision, the Committee draws the clauses to the attention of the Senate under principle 1 (a) (iii), in that they might be regarded as inappropriately delegating legislative power. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of my discussions with FACTS, I believed that these matters should have been cleared up before the legislation was debated in this chamber. Therefore, I had discussions with the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) and officers of the Department of Communications and I put that view to them. I must say how much I appreciate the co-operation of Senator Peter Baume who represents the Minister for Communications in this place and the officers who attended that original consultation in Senator Baume's office. Subsequently, Mr Lansdown, the head of the Department of Communications and his deputy, Mr Payne also talked to me about the problem. I was able to arrange for them to have discussions with Mr David Morgan and Mr Waldron of FACTS. I am pleased to say that on Tuesday of this week when Mr Neil Brown, the new Minister for Communications, was in Canberra I was able to talk to him and arrange for these gentlemen to have further discussions with him. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these discussions I believe that the matter has now been resolved as much as possible as far as FACTS is concerned. I believe I am correct in saying that whilst FACTS has a general knowledge of what the Department is doing in this area the industry recognises that as this is a taxation measure it was not appropriate that it should have a detailed knowledge of what was included in the legislation. I further understand that as a result of these discussions with the Minister FACTS is confident that an undertaking has been given by the Minister who also recognises the concern of the industry. He has undertaken that in future full consultation will be carried out with respect to future fee structures. No doubt Senator Peter Baume will elaborate on this in his reply. I agree with Senator Button that this matter deserves far more intensive examination. I suggest that some sort of inquiry ought to be made as to the way in which the Government should go in future to ensure that this particular matter is dealt with more specifically. In my view it is preferable that it should be dealt with under an Act that ought to be far more extensive than the Bill before the Senate at the present time. I support the principle of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will support the Radiocommunication Licence Fees Bill. We have arrived at that position only quite recently. When we first saw the proposed legislation we were very concerned about it. We believe it carries far reaching consequences and breaks new ground which this Senate should be very concerned about. As Senator Jessop has pointed out, the Bill effectively changes the radiocommunications licence fee from a simple charging of a fee to the charging of a tax. What is more, as Senator Jessop pointed out, there is no indication in the Bill of the level of taxation to be charged. Therefore, we have a Bill before us which is allowing taxation by regulation. Our initial suspicion, I believe, can readily be seen to be justifiable. The Australian Democrats were wondering whether in fact the Government was trying to get at the Democrats and at this Senate because as we all know a taxation Bill cannot be amended in this place. It can be accepted or rejected but it cannot be amended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill gives the Government an open cheque to charge taxation at a level it sees fit and by regulation. We conducted considerable investigation into this matter. We discovered that in a High Court case recently a group of pathologists challenged the validity of a fee on the basis that it was in fact a tax. Although that fee at that time was only $10 the High Court agreed in that particular case that the charge was not a fee but a tax. For that reason there has always been, I think, on the Government's part a sneaking suspicion that the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1905 could be unconstitutional. We go along with that view. </PARA>

Presumably, the Government eventually will address itself to all these various fees that have been charged by regulation and we can expect the introduction of a whole series of Bills in the Senate which will do what this Bill does, that is, to change the charging of fees to a tax. We were also concerned-previous speakers alluded to this point- that there had not been any consultation with the industry. I believe this is a very serious matter. We would have opposed the Bill or delayed it on that basis alone if it were not for the information we have received that consultations have been held now between the industry and the Government. The industry is satisfied that it has come to an understanding with the Government about the basis on which these fees or taxes-one can call them what one likes-will be charged to the industry. On the assurance from the industry that a problem no longer exists and that there is accord between the Government and the industry the Australian Democrats are prepared to support the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable senators for the support they have given to this package of legislation, the Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill and the Radiocommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which apply to radiocommunications licences. The legislation, as honourable senators indicated, establishes the fees as taxes to put them beyond any question of legal challenge . It will provide for them to be phased in and, as honourable senators said with some critical comment, for this to be done by regulation. The Bills remove the legal nexus between fees and costs and therefore remove another likelihood of legal challenge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall refer briefly to the question of the charges being made by regulation. I remind honourable senators, as they would know, that regulations would be required to be tabled in the Parliament and would be disallowable in the usual way. In fact it would be wrong to imagine that the oversight or control by the Parliament of the level of fees would not be present. It would, of course, require a majority of honourable senators or honourable members in another place for that to happen, but there has been no intention that this should pass from parliamentary oversight. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulations to be implemented under the Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill will confer benefits; they will assist smaller television stations which have been severely affected by the large rises in radiocommunications licence fees because of their program distribution links. It will enable these stations to adjust to the new fee levels without any impact on the level of services delivered to their viewers. The likely effect on viewers concerned the Government. The majority of these stations, as honourable senators will realise, are located in areas of limited television coverage, and the Government has considered the maintenance of these amenities to be of vital importance. We also believe that the measures also give further effect to the Government's principle of making public authorities accountable for their use of what are scarce public resources. These authorities will bear their full share of the burden of the administration of the radio frequency spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button asked a question relating to a matter to which I think Senator Siddons alluded. I can advise honourable senators that a complete review of the Wireless Telegraphy Act is approaching completion. It has been under way for some time. However, it will not deal with fees. The current Bills may need to be modified later in order to apply to the new Bill should the Wireless Telegraphy Act need some kind of review. This brings me to the question raised by Senator Jessop and mentioned by Senator Siddons; that is the concerns of industry. It is true that once these concerns were made known we sought to establish a series of consultations to see whether there was a chance of understanding and accommodating them. The method of determining radiocommunications licence fees was raised, and the principal factors which are taken into account in this matter are: Firstly, the effective power radiating into the spectrum; secondly, the band width actually occupied by the signal or reserved for the signal if it is not used continuously; thirdly, the space over which the signal is effectively radiated and detectable; fourthly, the time the spectrum is occupied by the signal, and that may be continuous; fifthly, the potential for interference to other users; and, finally, the sensitivity to interference from other users. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to divide spectrum users into a number of classes to minimise administrative costs and to facilitate the prescription of licence fees. This involves grouping together a large number of users with basically similar, but maybe not identical, characteristics. It is not feasible to prescribe a fee for individual cases. In the Government's opinion, it is not practicable to relate the payment of fees to a precise formula which can be reflected in legislation. That is one of the difficulties which the Government faced when preparing this legislation. To attempt to do so would involve administrative procedures and costs out of all proportion to the revenue collected or the benefits to be gained. The net effect might therefore be an overall further increase in fees. The various categories of major users will be consulted with respect to these matters before the final form of the regulations is reached and before any changes to the form of those regulations are made in future. I think that goes a long way to meeting some of the concerns expressed by the industry and the question of consultation raised by several senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of radiocommunications licence fees attributed to each class therefore represents the Government's best estimate of the fees appropriate to each class. It is a generally accepted principle that the burden of taxation should fall as equally as practicable on the community. It would be inconsistent with that principle for a government to seek to disadvantage a certain group by imposing a higher rate of tax on that group. Exemptions and concessions are granted to very limited categories of users when those exemptions and concessions are considered to be in the public interest for the purpose of supporting a desirable public service. I set out some examples earlier. I remind honourable senators that regulations imposing radiocommunications licence fees will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance by either House. Furthermore, public scrutiny of taxing measures is of such importance that the Government will examine the feasibility of having fee scales set out in Acts of Parliament rather than in regulations. Although I have identified the difficulties in doing that by legislative means, the Government has undertaken to give futher consideration to that matter in view of the concerns that have been expressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The licence fees are reviewed on an annual basis, usually taking effect at the beginning of the financial year. The present fees are currently under review. However, I refer honourable senators to my second reading speech in which I said that these Bills do not indicate an intention on the part of the Government to increase immediately and substantially radiocommunications licence fees. Having given those assurances in relation to the matters which have been raised, I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Home Deposit Assistance Bill and the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill relate to the housing package which arose out of a statement made by the Treasurer, Mr Howard, on 18 March this year . I remind the Senate that both Mr Howard and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) are on the public record as saying that they would not take any steps which would change the Homes Savings Grant Scheme throughout the life of this Budget year, 1981-82. The Home Deposit Assistance Bill replaces the existing Homes Savings Grant Scheme with the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme. The Opposition has consistently criticised the Government for the way in which the Homes Savings Grant Scheme operated. Whilst we concede that a great number of people did benefit as a result of that Scheme, it did not help housing in the area in which help was needed most.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation is one of a number of potentially expedient and ad hoc gimmicks announced by the Treasurer on the eve of the Victorian State election to address the housing crisis as it affected the Victorian Government. Of course the question affected not only the Victorian Government. It was an issue about which there was considerable concern in all States. It might be well to recall the flurry of announcements and activity from the former Victorian Minister of Housing, Mr Kennett, who placed large advertisements in newspapers and who made a number of criticisms of the Government's failure to recognise the housing crisis in this country. One should also recall the Federal Government's spokesman on housing at the time, who did not respond to such advertisements until such time as the then Premier of Victoria, Mr Thompson, made a public statement criticising the Fraser Government for its lack of concern about the problems of housing in Victoria. Of course the Government then came forth with this legislation which, on the last day of this session, we are dealing with. Honourable senators will be well aware that the electors saw through the duplicity, the gimmickry and the propaganda of those proposals as they related to the political situation in Victoria at that time. We well recall that the Victorian electors gave the Thompson administration and Mr Kennett the biggest kick in the pants that the Victorian Liberals have ever had and gave the Australian Labor Party in Victoria the greatest majority it has ever been able to win from the electors in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the result showed that the Victorian electors were not fooled in any sense by the approach of the Liberal-National Country Party Government. They responded favourably to the Labor Party's approach which is philosophically different from that of this Government. That difference is based on an attitude that we have of stimulating the building sector, of dampening down interest rates and providing greater support for public housing. That, of course, is the linchpin of the Labor Party's approach to the housing crisis in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's policies contrast very clearly with those of the Liberal Party. Since 1975-since the Fraser Government came to power-one sector of the community that can clearly be shown to be in a state of continual decline is the housing sector . There has been a great decline in the number of houses built and a decline in confidence in the industry. The housing sector has suffered greatly as a result of the economic policies pursued by the Fraser Government. Rising interest rates , the low availability of the rental housing market, greatly reduced building activity and the dropping levels of home ownership all show, very clearly, that the consistent policy followed by the Labor Party, by its spokesman on housing in the other place, Mr Uren, and by me here is borne out in statistics which show that housing has moved into an area similar to that of unemployment and is a major social problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's housing problems have been dominated only by expediency. If the pressure mounts up an ad hoc decision is made and the Government must respond as it did in respect to Mr Thompson's plea. The measures which were brought forward by the Treasurer on 18 March have we believe failed to relieve the problem facing existing and intending home buyers. They barely address the serious problems faced by tenants in the private rental market. One does not have to do more than state that that it is a fact of life to indicate the tremendous problem that faces people who are forced into the rental market in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will do nothing to reduce the growing problem of homelessness which is at an all time high. It is almost as high as it was in the immediate post-war years. It will do nothing to reduce the number of families-now 99,000 people-who are on the lists of State housing commissions or housing authorities lists as requiring public housing assistance. The measures include a further one per cent rise in the housing loan interest rates charged by savings banks. That should be added to the record of this Government, which has presided over the banks and provided them with the need to make loans, and presided over the highest interest rate hikes in Australia's history. That is not something of which any government ought to be proud. We cannot derive any pleasure from that. To some extent it is brought about by the economic policies followed by the Fraser Administration and by the direct budgetary attitudes towards the States responsibility for public housing. If honourable senators look at interest rates they will see that we are not gilding the lily. We are referring precisely to this major problem of interest rates. In March 1980-just a few weeks over two years ago-the interest rate charged by savings banks on housing loans was only 9 .5 per cent. It is now 13.5 per cent, an increase in real terms of 4 per cent but in actual terms it represents a 42 per cent increase in interest rates over those two years. The effect of the interest rate rise is to exclude-this demonstrates the serious effect of the Government's economic policies-a growing number of people from access to home ownership. In 1980, we said that there were signs that the level of home ownership in Australia was declining. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978, the Australian Bureau of Statistics provided us with figures. It estimated that the level of home ownership in Australia was 73.8 per cent of the population. In 1980-two years later-the Bureau revealed that this estimate was down to 71.9 per cent. Therefore over two years there has been a drop of almost 2 per cent in home ownership in this country. As a result, pressures on State housing authorities and the rental market have increased. Each time interest rates rise intending home buyers have to find a larger deposit in order to gain access to home ownership. Or, as happens in so many cases, people have to resort to the burden of a large second mortgage. Everybody in this country knows what that means. People who have a second mortgage today are paying an interest rate of anything between 20 per cent and 24 per cent. That represents an unbelievable increase in the commitment carried by people who are attempting to buy their accommodation. The overtight monetary policy, which has been pursued by the Fraser Government, has led to rising interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has widened the deposit gap required to be met by first home buyers. For example, on 18 March this year the Treasurer announced a rise in savings bank interest rates from 12.5 per cent to 13.5 per cent. I remind the Senate that the Government has not yet indicated that that will be the peak. It has suggested that another one per cent increase is in the pipeline. The maximum permissible borrowings from a savings bank for a person on average weekly earnings fell by $2,341, from $36,249 at 12.5 per cent interest rate to $33,908 at a 13.5 per cent interest rate. Therefore on the one hand this new proposal increases the maximum basic benefit-arising from the legislation that the Senate is asked to approve-by some $500, that is, from $2,000 to $2,500. However it reduces by $2,341 the amount that a person on average weekly earnings gets as a loan from a bank. As we know there is not a great number of people in our country who are on average weekly earnings. In fact in excess of 66 per cent of Australian people earn less than average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> The 42 per cent rise in interest rates under this Government means that the maximum first mortgage loan able to be borrowed by an intending home owner, who receives average weekly earnings, has been reduced by $11,330 for those who borrow from savings banks and $7,896 for those who borrow from building societies. In the same period the Government has raised the maximum amount of a homes savings grant, which is now described as an assistance grant, by $500-that is, from $2,000 to $2,500. That is the record of this Government in recent years . In fact, in the last two years the Government has effectively reduced the borrowing right from a savings bank of a person on average weekly earnings by $ 11,330. All it has given that person in return is $500. That is hardly adequate compensation for the policies that have been followed glibly, quietly and often vocally by the Commonwealth Government in opposition to its counterparts in the State area. The new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme will be, we recognise, of some use to a few people. The Opposition does not quibble with that conclusion. However, we believe that it is inadequate and does not address the major home finance problems that I have stressed today. Therefore, it is the Opposition's intention to seek support for the following amendment. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill should provide a more effective form of assistance which will reduce the deposit requirement of first home buyers by permitting larger first mortgage borrowings from savings banks and building societies'. </PARA>
<PARA>We say that the overriding problem with the scheme is its isolation from an integrated set of measures, which any government worth its salt should take, giving stability to the availability and price of housing finance and to housing industry activity generally. The scheme was announced in the context of a further rise in interest rates. Of course, that must be seen as a panic measure designed to assist a political problem in Victoria. The Government persists in suggesting that this legislation will somehow redress that problem. Of course, we know that interest rates will be driven up still further. We can expect any time after Parliament rises that interest rates will be officially allowed to rise. With further interest rate hikes the scheme projected on 18 March will become even less effective. In fact, as has been said by the Labor Party's spokesman on housing, Mr Uren, it will be shown to be quite meaningless in solving the housing problems in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> We need a scheme to assist first home buyers. We are pledged to that; it is our policy. It must fit into a set of policies to stabilise the flow of funds for housing at an affordable level to those who are in a position to provide their own accommodation. We need a commitment by a Federal Government to no further rises in housing interest rates. Surely that is not beyond the ability of any government that claims to represent the Australian people. But this Government is not prepared to make housing the social priority it deserves to be and which the Australian people demand it to be so that more and more of them will have an opportunity to solve their accommodation problems personally. This Government is not prepared to use its powers to control the assets of financial institutions to a sufficient extent to gain a stable flow of funds into the housing sector which would obviate the need for further interest rate rises to attract deposits . </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather strange that the Government should take the view that the housing industry is not an important sector for the generation of economic activity. It is a sector which takes up the slack in employment and which plays a part in alleviating the social problem of housing. It ought to be the cornerstone of any meaningful economic program. If this happened, it would obviate the need for further interest rate rises in order to attract deposits. From that perspective the Labor Party seeks to amend the Bill in the form I have moved. We see the need for a more effective home ownership scheme to be provided as an option to the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme so that those who are not helped by this scheme will not be left unaided. The Labor Party's proposal in this regard cannot be put forward in an ad hoc or piecemeal fashion. We are not in the game of gimmicks in the area of housing because we recognise that accommodation or shelter is one of the early requirements of any family situation. The problem is too serious and far-reaching for gimmickry or ad hoc decisions. Any decisions should be part of an overall planned approach to solving the housing problems in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to upgrade and expand public sector housing because of the changes in our economic activities and in their geographical location as a result of more emphasis being placed on resource development and perhaps less on manufacturing. Therefore, we require a very strong public housing sector to meet the needs of people who move from one location to another, to provide homes at a reasonable rental. We make no apology for saying that we need a scheme to assist people who have to be mobile in order to take up employment opportunities. We need a scheme which will assist intending first home buyers to become home owners. We need a scheme which protects existing home purchasers from the growing mortgage burden. It has to be acknowledged that a great number of people are suffering grave hardships today as a result of the increase in interest rates. Their disposable income is being reduced to an alarming degree, forcing them into a new era of poverty and distress and affecting the whole level of economic activity in which they would otherwise be involved, and by that I mean consumer demand. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to stabilise the availability and price of housing finance. That is where this Government has failed dismally. Certainly, we need to stabilise the housing industry's capacity and activity. That is the view of the housing industry itself, including the Housing Industry Association and those people involved in the building societies. This is the Labor Party's approach to the housing crisis. It is the sort of approach that we believe gained acceptance in the Victorian elections recently. The Bill before us, therefore, does not come anywhere near these goals. It is inadequate, piecemeal and ad hoc. It is not the way to approach one of the most pressing problems before us today. That is why we have moved our amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I have subsequently been advised that Senator Harradine proposes to move an amendment to our proposition, which seeks, as I understand it, to provide an overhang position between the old, phased out Homes Savings Grant Scheme and the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme. I have sought some advice on this proposed amendment from the appropriate people in my party. We do not necessarily agree with all that Senator Harradine has said about this problem, but there seems to be a grey area where those who have been saving under the old scheme may be placed at a disadvantage with respect to the new scheme. Therefore, Senator Harradine's proposal is acceptable to the Labor Party insofar as it would at least give an option to those who have been attracted previously to the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. The option would be to decide whether to remain with that scheme during the interim period or to go to the new scheme. We believe, and accept, that the new scheme has some advantages over the old Homes Savings Grant Scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two Bills that we are debating today, the Home Deposit Assistance Bill and the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill , form the rest of the Government's new housing package which was announced in March of this year. I recall saying at the time that I thought that the package was a sort of curate's egg package in that it was good in parts and woefully lacking in others. I also said at the time, and repeat, that I believe the Government should be given the benefit of the doubt as far as intentions are concerned. I believe that it recognised the anomalies and inequities operating under the existing system and set out to help the many thousands of families in the community-the sorts of families mentioned already by Senator Gietzelt-who find it increasingly difficult to buy or build a home in Australia, whether for the first time or not. Unfortunately, the end result of the housing package, taken as a whole, does not achieve the laudable objectives that I believe the Government had in mind in instigating it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bills set out to do a number of things: Firstly, to revamp the old Homes Savings Grant Scheme which, as I have said, was clearly inadequate; secondly, to eliminate the nine-month waiting period and abolish the value limit of the home to be purchased; thirdly, to place a means test on eligibility for the grant so that the maximum grant would go to families whose income in the previous 12 months had been less than 130 per cent of average weekly earnings. A sliding scale was there to apply so that the grant cut out when earnings reached 150 per cent of average weekly earnings. Fourthly, it increased the basic value of the grant from $2,000 to $2,500 and added a further child bonus of $500 for a family with one child and $1,000 for a family with two or more children. I point out that this bonus is available to any family which qualifies for the basic homes savings grant to a level of at least $10, so in many ways, for families which qualify for even the smallest part of the basic grant, this child bonus is the most valuable part of the scheme. Fifthly, it sets out to reduce the savings requirement for a maximum grant to a dollar for dollar basis over a two-year period instead of the previous basis of $1 to $3 savings over a three-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated when the package was first brought forward, and as I said again at the beginning of my remarks today, the Australian Democrats support the principle behind the Bills. We are pleased that the Government recognises that so many couples are finding great difficulty in bridging the deposit gap and is also prepared to recognise that the old scheme, despite its being the subject of a number of amendments which increased the value limit on the particular house and so on, failed in effect to solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also happy to accept the need for a means test in order that the money available for the scheme-some $88m in 1982-will be directed to those who need it most. Finally, we are pleased to see that the Government has extended the amount available to families which can qualify for the grant. Nevertheless, I must repeat that we have distinct reservations about the real value of the new package and some specific criticisms, almost all of which arise out of not the contents of these Bills, or even what is left out of them, but the sweetheart agreement between the Government and the banks as an inducement to the banks to face what I believe is their moral responsibility to Australians who are not members of the wealthy investor class-a class which seems in the last few years to have taken over as far as the banks' interest is concerned, if the Senate will pardon the pun. Our specific criticisms are these--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is something for which you are getting a good return. By simultaneously allowing the banks to lift interest rates on home loans by one percentage point, the Government has ensured that the Bills are aimed at, and will benefit most, the very limited group of people who are relatively affluent. In these straitened times of rising prices, tight money and high interest rates, only the relatively affluent-the middle class in regular employment-can afford even to think about buying a house. Whatever the intention of these Bills, the increase of one percentage point in home loan interest rates means effectively that the Bills will not assist those who need to be helped most.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rises in interest rates effectively reduce the maximum amounts that banks and lending institutions will lend. Banks and other financial institutions that lend money for housing calculate lending ceilings by referring to the applicant's gross wage. The amount that they lend varies according to the institution. It usually involves repayments of from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the gross wage or salary. With a hike in interest rates of the order of one percentage point, or any increase for that matter, repayments increase. In fact, a fairly good rule of thumb these days is that for every one percentage point increase in interest rates on an average home loan requirement, monthly repayments rise by 8 per cent. Effectively, the interest rate increase is likely to reduce the amount that the bank will lend in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> According to my calculations-I am open to correction as always, being a fair and reasonable sort of person-a one percentage point increase in interest rates on an average home loan effectively reduces by some $2,000 the amount available for lending. Therefore, those home buyers who are lucky enough to qualify for the grant in the first place will see the effective sum that they need for their home eaten up by increased interest rates. Effectively, they are chasing their tails. Thus the Bills, because of the sweetheart arrangement arrived at between the Government and the banks, give on the one hand but, on the other, take away more or less the same amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA> The family bonus looks good enough on paper-$500 for one dependent child and $1 ,000 for two or more children. However, as anybody who knows young couples trying to buy a home will confirm, very few couples with children-in particular young children-can afford to bridge the deposit gap. We have reached in Australia a situation in which a couple who wish to buy or build a home must do so before they begin their family. It takes two incomes, over at least a two or three year period, to enable a couple to acquire the cash that they need. Therefore, those who are looking for this kind of assistance are not families with children; they are those with no children, so the benefit is largely illusory. </PARA>
<PARA> The package serves predominantly to accentuate existing divisions and inequities in the housing sector. One could say that the rich get richer and the poor get to live in tents. Furthermore, as Senator Gietzelt pointed out, it scoots over the whole question of welfare housing. In the interests of getting through the business of the Senate as quickly as possible I do not intend to canvass the issue again. Also, the package provides limited, if any, assistance to the low income earner. It does nothing to help the predicament of people in the rental market. The one percentage point interest rate rise is certain to flow through to that market and people in that area stand to lose most from the Government's package. As property investors find it increasingly difficult to make a reasonable living from rental housing, vis-a-vis other forms of investment, they are forced to increase rents. Since there are no tax rebates or grants to aid struggling tenants, the problem is compounded. Low vacancy rates reflect the problem of the housing market. The figures of the Real Estate Institute of Australia for March 1981 and March 1982 show that in Adelaide, for instance, the availability level of rental housing fell from 1.3 per cent to 0.6 per cent. That halving is similarly reflected in most other States and Territories, although Perth and Canberra seem to be a little better off than the other capital cities. The Adelaide figures are particularly poor. They are the lowest ever recorded in Adelaide, where a 3 per cent rate is generally considered to indicate a reasonable balance between supply and demand. Inevitably, pressure on the rental accommodation forces up rents. Hence, those trying to save for a house deposit suffer yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the package is aimed at the wrong area, taking into account the one per cent interest rise that was allowed to banks. I believe that it is treating the symptoms of the problem rather than the basic cause. I venture to say that this is becoming something of a habit of the present Government which appears to be rather addicted to ad hockery and status quo conservatism. I suspect that if it continues meekly to patch up the cracks as they appear in the legislation and in the system it will find the whole edifice will come tumbling down around its ears. The whole thing boils down to the fact that there is really only one section of the Australian community which stands to gain from the Treasurer's package and the one per cent interest rate rise; that is, the banking community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to compare figures relating to rises in average weekly earnings, interest rate movements and banking profits for the decade 1971-80. Average weekly earnings in the period jumped by 187 per cent-from $89.80 in June 1971 to $257.90 in June 1980. Home interest rates rose from approximately 6 1/4 per cent-that figure can be only an approximation since different lending organisations lent at marginally different amounts-in June 1971 to approximately 12 1/2 per cent in December 1981. That represented a jump of 100 per cent. As far as banking profits are concerned, the combined net profits of savings and trading banks rose from $64.5m in 1971 to $465.3m in 1980-a staggering 621 per cent increase. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table of banking profit increases. I indicated to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) that I intended to do so and showed him the table. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. On the other hand, because of the rises in interest rates, repayment rates increased by an equally interesting figure. Monthly repayment rates on an average loan in 1971 were approximately $44. By 1980 repayment rates per month on an average loan in that year had risen to $322 -an increase of 632 per cent and a figure which I point out is remarkably close to the percentage rise in bank profits over the same period. As I have said, the Australian Democrats support the intention of the Bills. It is unfortunate that the trade-off to the banks will negate most of the potential good inherent in the legislation. I wish to take a few moments to discuss the amendment which the Australian Labor Party has moved and the amendment which I understand Senator Harradine will move in the Committee stage. The Australian Labor Party has moved to the motion for the second reading the following amendment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the end of motion, add: 'but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill should provide a more effective form of assistance which will reduce the deposit requirement of first home buyers by permitting larger first mortgate borrowings from savings banks and building societies.'</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats have no quarrel with that. It is again a motherhood statement, although I believe that a large number of the problems would be solved if we returned to the days when banks were expected to lend a certain percentage to home loan borrowers and the interest rates on those home loans were kept low. The banks keep bleating that they were artificially low but the system seemed to work for 81 years and I cannot understand why all of a sudden it has ceased to be a workable proposition. I have a funny feeling that it coincides with the incursion of foreign banking interests into this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to discuss Senator Harradine's amendment at the moment. I will consider it during the Committee stage when I have seen in more detail what Senator Harradine intends to move. I understand that he is concerned that some people will be disadvantaged by the change in legislation proposed by the Government and that the inclusion of the average weekly earnings provision in the new legislation may deprive some people of a grant that they would otherwise have got. I for one do not necessarily share that view, but I will not take up any more of the Senate's time at this stage. I will turn my attention to the matter during the Committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by Senator Gietzelt. I am also concerned that this legislation does not do enough to help lessen the burden on Australian householders. Over the last two years we have witnessed an explosion in interest rates, with the interest rate charged by savings banks on housing loans increasing from 9.5 per cent in March 1980 to 13.5 per cent. This represents a 4 per cent increase in interest rates in just two years. To an average family with a first mortgage of around $30,000, this has meant an increase in repayments of something like 28 per cent. To people who have borrowed this amount from a building society, it has meant an increase in monthly repayments from around $290 a month to nearly $370 a month, depending upon the State in which they live. All of this has come about at a time when this Government's economic policies have caused massive increases in indirect taxes, health insurance costs and State and local government charges. There is not a single household in this country that has not been hit recently by rising food bills, hospital charges, electricity and gas bills, water rates and council rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In view of these problems, we on this side of the chamber eagerly awaited the statement by the Treasurer, Mr Howard, on 18 March in the hope that it would provide significant and lasting relief for existing home buyers. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. The Home Deposit Assistance Bill, which arose out of that statement, does not go anywhere near far enough towards easing the tremendous burden which is falling on most working and middle class families in Australia. Although we concede that it contains some good proposals, there are still many people who will not benefit from the new scheme and many others who will be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> For a start, an integral part of the Treasurer's statement on 18 March was the reference to an immediate increase of one per cent in interest rates for savings bank home loans. This has already flowed through to building societies and inflicted even more financial hardship on existing home buyers. Therefore, it is quite obvious that this legislation will only add fuel to the interest rate explosion in this country. Every time interest rates rise by one percentage point 9,000 families are denied access to home ownership because of the widening of the deposit gap. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Gietzelt pointed out, the increase of one percentage point in interest rates on savings bank home loans meant in effect that the maximum amount that could be borrowed by a person on average weekly earnings fell by $2, 300. From this it is easy to see that the $500 increase in the maximum grant is totally ineffective. In effect it means that, as a direct result of these measures, the deposit gap has been widened by something like $1,800, making it even more difficult for young couples to purchase their own home. As a result many of these people will be forced to resort to second mortgages and to pay interest rates in the vicinity of 20 per cent. Quite clearly, the measures contained in these Bills will not relieve the burden for either existing or potential home buyers and they will certainly not relieve the problems being faced by tenants, especially those in the private rental sector. The measures will not help many thousands of families now waiting on public housing commission lists throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as I said before, there are some positive aspects of the new scheme. One of these is that the nine-month waiting period for assistance which applied under the old scheme has been reduced. This means there will be more instant relief for home buyers at a time when they need it most. Another aspect relates to the eligibility criteria, which have been relaxed for de facto married couples and other couples who have jointly purchased a house. However, overall these measures do not go far enough. They were conceived very hastily during the run-up to the Victorian election for cheap political purposes which, as it turned out, did not pay off anyway. They will provide no real lasting relief for most of Australia's home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that this Government has no real concern for home buyers. This can be seen by the way in which it has directed funds away from the housing sector since it came to power. For instance, the proportion of total Budget outlays on housing has fallen from 2.6 per cent in 1975-76 to as low as 0 .9 per cent in 1980-81. In real terms there has been a 59 per cent cut in Budget outlays on housing between 1975-76 and 1981-82. During the same period real expenditure on defence has increased by 28 per cent and expenditure on industry assistance has increased by 58 per cent. All this is happening when queues for public housing in this country are increasing at an unprecedented rate. We regularly hear Ministers of the Government in this chamber boasting about the level of home ownership in Australia. Only last week, during the debate on the Supply Bills, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) claimed very proudly that 72 per cent of home ownership in Australia is in private hands. What he omitted to say was that in the last three years home ownership in Australia has actually fallen from 73 per cent to 71.9 per cent. That is a quite significant reduction and is a direct result of this Government's economic policies, which are preventing many thousands of Australians from owning their own home. </PARA>
<PARA> Every time interest rates rise more and more Australian home buyers are pushed closer to the edge. In fact, many have already been forced to sell their homes and move to rental accommodation. This has happened simply because of the Treasurer's determination to slow down the growth in the money supply. His manic desire to bring down the rate of inflation through tight monetary policies has inflicted a lot of unnecessary hardship upon Australian families. I believe that the Australian people deserve more than just some hastily conceived scheme designed purely to win votes at elections. I believe the Australian people are sick and tired of having the wool pulled over their eyes by this tired old conservative Government. The only way of providing any lasting relief for Australian home buyers is for this Government to change its economic policies. There is no point in this Government providing these sorts of schemes if it does not intend to stop pursuing tight monetary policies. The longer the Government keeps restricting the growth in the money supply the longer the Australian people will have to endure high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that this new scheme was accompanied by an increase of one percentage point in interest rates has made it almost totally ineffective. The only way to relieve the burden on Australian home buyers is to attack the problem on a much broader scale. The pressure on interest rates will be relieved only through a gradual easing of the money supply. Until the Government realises this there certainly will not be any significant and lasting relief for any home buyers. Instead we will see even more home buyers forced into selling their properties and even more potential home buyers unable to raise the money they need because of the widening deposit gap. What we need right now is some positive intervention by this Government to stop interest rate rises. We need some genuine concern by the Ministers of this Government for the needs of home buyers in Australia. I support the amendment moved by Senator Gietzelt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Home Deposit Assistance Bill 1982 and the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill 1982. The Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill brings to an end the Homes Savings Grant Scheme which has been in operation in various forms since the early 1970s. The object is to replace that scheme with a new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme which is a refinement and an improvement upon the scheme which applied previously. I think there is general agreement on that. There seems to be agreement from the Opposition-both from Mr Uren, the Opposition spokesman on these matters, and from Senator Gietzelt, who represents him in this place-and from the Australian Democrats that a number of features of the new system are advantageous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of this Home Deposit Assistance Bill is, of course, to encourage people to save towards home ownership, to supplement their savings by a grant at the time of home purchase and to provide maximum help to single income and low income families. Whilst there does not seem to be any disagreement with those principles in the Bill, the debate has really centred on related matters in the housing field about which honourable senators have concerns. In that context, I simply stress that this Bill is but one part of the Government's approach to housing. It does not encompass the Government's approach to welfare housing and to the very real challenges in that area. Indeed, it does not encompass the totality of our assistance in the promotion of home ownership; it is but one brick in the wall. </PARA>
<PARA> The new housing package which was announced earlier this year on 18 March by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) contained a number of elements. I will touch briefly on them to indicate to those who might be interested in this debate that they should not look to this Bill or to this debate for the totality of policies which affect this very important area. Part of the package was a measure which received some criticism. It received most criticism from Senator Haines who spoke on behalf of the Australian Democrats. It was the arrangement which was made with the banks at the time the package was announced. That arrangement with the banks had an unpopular side to it because contemporaneous with that arrangement was the increase in interest rates of one per cent. I stress that the proposals we are bringing forward and, indeed, the package are not the cause of that one per cent interest rate rise. The cause of that one per cent interest rate rise was simply the greater competition for funds which exists in the Australian community, the higher levels of interest rates which apply and the higher levels of interest rates which savers are able to obtain from a variety of saving sources in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the lament of Senator Haines that in the old days the banks had money to lend for housing which they do not appear to have now. I think that is fairly simply explained by the fact that there has been a change in the patterns of the savings of individual Australians. Fewer individual Australians are now prepared to leave their savings in relatively low interest bearing accounts. The sources of finance for housing funds have, therefore come under considerable pressure. If the banks and other organisations which lend money for home loans are precluded from competing for money in the market-place, quite clearly money will not be available for lending for home loans. It is a difficult matter but I suggest that those honourable senators who have doubts might, when talking to their constituents, canvass with them the changes in those constituents' savings habits. It is now a matter of people shopping around to see where they will get maximum interest. The smallest savers now have access to the same money market as that which has traditionally been the preserve of large savers and this has meant a general overall shift in the levels of interest rates in the community. It is no longer true that the poorer people in the community who are lending do so at a substantial detriment as compared with those who are better off. </PARA>
<PARA> The important, positive element in the package with the banks was that the banks agreed that they would make available an additional $400m for housing loans. In other words, in return for the banks being permitted to get into a more competitive position for funds they agreed to ensure that greater funds be made available for this important area. At the same time the Government announced a tax rebate on home loan interest for recent buyers of first homes. That is an important measure to aid that group of home buyers who are most likely to be feeling the strains of increased interest rates. It is, of course, true that the generality of home buyers who have not yet paid off their houses have seen their interest rates rise and feel that that is a strain. But it is also true that those who have purchased their homes in very recent times at recent price levels are likely to have a substantial element of that purchase price borrowed. They are the ones who are most likely to be affected by the increase in interest rates. The Government's taxation measures are squarely aimed at assisting those who are most likely to need the assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the complaints by Senator Gietzelt and Senator Haines about the fact that nothing has been done about the welfare side of housing. I can point to the further element of the package, the mortgage and rent relief scheme, which involves our entering into negotiations with the States on the form of that scheme. But the Commonwealth has made a commitment that moneys be made available for a mortgage and rent relief scheme on the basis that the States will contribute dollar for dollar. That will require some working out because some forms of mortgage and rent relief schemes already apply in the States. Clearly there will be a need to tie in any Commonwealth activities in this area with existing arrangements to ensure that the total package is one which will best serve those who need assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> We have before us one element of a package of measures meant to assist home buyers in Australia. This is an important measure. It is meant to contribute to the maintenance of the traditionally high proportion of home ownership which we have in this country, a proportion which, at 72 per cent-that is the last figure I have-I do not think can be compared with anywhere else in the world. I commend the legislation to the Senate. I believe it will be beneficial and that it should be passed without delay. </PARA>
<PARA> I should perhaps touch on one other point which was made by Senator Haines. She was concerned about the fact that the family bonus was a positive aspect but that it was unlikely to benefit very many people. My advice is that under the old Homes Savings Grant Scheme 30 per cent of recipients under the scheme received the family bonus. One could anticipate a reasonable proportion of the beneficiaries under this scheme being poeple who have already started their families. I will not go through the detail. The second reading speech sets out well the detail of the measure. I have tried to respond in a broad sense to the concerns expressed by honourable senators in this debate. I do so acknowledging that in the total package of policies for which the Commonwealth is responsible, be it in the taxation field, be it grants for mortgage or rent relief or be it in the very important area of the capital grants and loans for welfare housing which are the subject of quite separate deliberations and legislation, we need to make sure that the totality of that package meets the needs in this important area. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand those honourable senators who expressed concern about what they see as a diversion of resources from home building to resource development or to other forms of private investment. I can say only that, as in all things, it is a matter of balance. It is no use being concerned about the lack of employment and the lack of investment leading to employment and not being concerned about housing. By the same token, there has always been a very high proportion of investment by Australians in housing. It has probably been necessary to see some small shift of emphasis. But I give the commitment that the Government will continue to see a high proportion of private home ownership as a very important part of Australian society. We will be watching these policies carefully to see that the trend of increasing private home ownership which has occurred since the Second World War will continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I deal with the Home Deposit Assistance Bill 1982 and indicate that I wish to place on record my appreciation of the action of the former Minister for Housing and Construction, Mr Tom McVeigh, in including in the legislation a provision which enables the family bonus to be paid in respect of unborn children. Previously, of course, the situation was that unless the child was actually born the payment of the bonus was not available to the applicant-namely, the parent of that child. It is very heartening to see the action of Mr McVeigh in recognising the fact that there is a responsibility and an eligibility in respect of unborn children so far as the bonus is concerned under the Act. I turn now to the amendments that have been circulated and which seek to amend the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill. I seek leave to move all of the amendments at once.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Page 2, clause 4, proposed new sub-section (1D), after 'after', insert 'the day which occurs 90 days after'. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Page 2, clause 8, proposed new section 53A, sub-section (1), after 'is later than', insert 'the day which occurs 90 days after'. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Page 2, clause 8, proposed new section 53A, sub-section (2), paragraph (a), after 'day', insert 'first'. </PARA>
<PARA> As first circulated the amendments read '180 days', but after discussions I have now agreed to change the period to 90 days. The purpose of the amendments is to overcome a situation which was highlighted by Neil O'Reilly in an article in the Sun-Herald on 23 May 1982. Perhaps I can detain the Senate briefly by referring to that article which was headed 'Two-week deadline for homes grant' and which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Couples who want a Federal Government home-savings grant will need to have signed a contract for purchase of a home within two weeks. This is when the current home savings grant scheme ends to make way for the Government's new home deposit assistance scheme. Those eligible for the old home-savings grants will not necessarily qualify for the new scheme-thus the urgency for last-minute applications. The new home deposit assistance scheme legislation will receive Royal Assent in about two weeks. Those eligible for the old home-savings grant will have to sign a contract for the purchase of their dwelling by the day the legislation receives Royal Assent. They will have another month after this to lodge their applications. The Federal Government is anticipating a late rush of applications. </PARA>
<PARA>There is the situation which is giving us concern. I have had representations about this matter. I have particularly in mind constituents who are a single income family with two children. The husband is a trademan and he has been working overtime for the last 12 months in order to get sufficient money to put down on a home. He has been saving over a period of three years in anticipation of an entitlement under the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. He will not be eligible for assistance under the new scheme. In order to become eligible, he would immediately have to seek to purchase a home. He would have to sign the contract before the day on which the legislation implementing this new scheme receives royal assent. This is a disconcerting feature of the legislation which I believe requires sympathetic consideration from members of this chamber and members of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Home Deposit Assistance Scheme is in fact, as has been outlined by the Minister, meant to replace the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. I accept that that is the Government's policy and I accept that there are some meritorious arguments in favour of that policy. There are some improvements. The savings period is now two years compared with three years under the old scheme. The ratio between savings and the amount of the grant is one to one, not three to one. The maximum amount of assistance is $2,500, not $2,000. There is also the family bonus, to which I have already referred, which applies to the birth of a child within 11 months of entering a contract to purchase. They are, of course, improvements. That is why I am not seeking at all to amend the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme. That Bill can go through and receive royal assent and that new scheme can be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> But a radical change does come about as no grant will be payable where combined taxable income exceeds a figure approximately 155 per cent of average weekly earnings. Obviously many people who would have been eligible under the old scheme will be ineligible under the new scheme. Their number must be legion. there must be quite a number of people-I know of two who have contacted me-who will fall between the two schemes. That is a matter of real concern. Under the old scheme, the savings period was three years. So there could be many couples who for some period were saving in reasonable expectation of receiving a grant under the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation provides for a transitional period in which applications can be made, that is to say from 18 March 1982, until the scheme receives royal assent. The royal assent deadline appears in the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill . If we pass that Bill today as it stands, royal assent will be inevitable and it will probably be given next week. In other words, this chamber really cannot fiddle with the reference to royal assent but it can legitimately qualify the link to the royal assent by inserting a stated period in which applications can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> As the House of Representatives is not sitting, the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill, if amended, would not become operative. The practical effect would be to leave the existing homes savings grant legislation as it stands and to allow the Home Deposit Assistance Bill to come into being. The two schemes would co-exist. The leeway period would remain until the amended Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill is considered by the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the existing leeway is concerned, under the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill eligibility ceases where the contract is made after the Home Deposit Assistance Bill receives royal assent. Applications for assistance will be accepted until one month after that time. There is a distinction here. People have to sign the contract before the date of royal assent but they can make an application up to one month after the date of royal assent. The Home Deposit Assistance Bill applies from 18 March 1982. The two schemes, side by side, are to run until royal assent is given for the Home Deposit Assistance Bill. The practical leeway therefore is only until the granting of royal assent which, as I said, is only next week. I really feel that, if honourable senators consider this matter, they will recognise that that leeway is just too short. People who have been saving for almost three years are faced immediately with the prospect of racing out over the next weekend and signing a contract for the purchase of a house. I happen to have a home on the market, so it is good for me if they race out and buy my place. Can I give the address? No, I had better not! People will have to race out over this weekend and sign a contract for the purchase of a house if they are not going to be eligible under the new scheme. To my mind, that is an unreasonable expectation. People just cannot sort it all out in such a short period. </PARA>
<PARA> All I am asking this chamber to do really is to make special provisions in this respect. I did propose a leeway of 180 days but, after discussions with my colleagues in the Australian Democrats, I have reduced that to 90 days, which is only three months. I think that is a reasonable time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.8)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated in my speech in the second reading debate, the Australian Democrats are not opposed in principle to what is contained in these Bills. Our complaints about the housing package that the Government initiated in March of this year are with the arrangements that were made with the banks to allow them an extra one per cent increase in interest rates. I have no objection to the means test. I support it in principle. I support the extension of the amount of assistance. I do not want to turn this speech into another second reading speech. I wish simply to say that we have no objection. It is not my intention to support Senator Harradine's amendments regardless of what he said about conversations with some of his colleagues from my Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that I support the principle of a means test, I do not believe that I can then turn around and support the suggestion that we have this strange overlapping sort of scheme for the benefit of a few people who have not been made aware of the fact that this plan has been in progress since 18 March. By the time the legislation receives royal assent, considerable publicity will have been given to the plan over a period of two and a half months. I can see no particular benefit accruing from Senator Harradine's amendments, whether the time is extended to 180 days or 90 days. It is inevitable when a new scheme is introduced that many people are helped by it and some people are not. I received letters regularly in my office whenever the Government raised the allowable value of a house because people had just signed contracts that were slightly above the limit and therefore did not qualify. They discovered that, as from the next day, they would have qualified. Unfortunately there was no retrospectivity in the scheme. It is unfortunate that some people suffer. I accept the emotion and the rhetoric Senator Harradine put into his speech in support of his amendment but I, for one, will not support that amendment, particularly in view of the money that the Government has spent on advertising the pending scheme, the fact that it is likely to cost somewhere around $25m to $30m extra, and that the imposition of a means test is a reasonable sort of amendment and principle to accept. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might help the debate if I indicate the Government's position before everybody fully commits himself or herself. I thank Senator Haines for supporting the Bills in their present form. Of course, in this situation, as in any other situation, where there is a change of eligibility there will be a cut-off point and there is a potential for someone to miss out. Every change involves that possibility. We have a proposal before us which has been described generally in the Senate as a positive one. The changes have general support. The significant limitation which is imposed is that people with certain levels of income will no longer be eligible. In other words, the new system is geared more squarely to provide a greater level of assistance to people whose incomes are less. The provisions applying for the balance of this financial year will allow for a full grant for people with incomes of $363 or less a week with partial grants allowable for incomes between $363 and $417 a week. The estimated income limits which will apply after 30 June-these are estimates because the figures are not yet finalised but will be over the next few weeks-are between $416 and $477 a week. In other words, people earning incomes up to $416 will receive the full grant and those receiving incomes between $416 and $477 will receive partial grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is aware that in any transition period there are difficulties. We did indulge in quite extensive advertising in this area. In fact, we were subject to some criticism in this place because some State elections were due at the time and it was thought that the Government should not be indulging in election advertising. I mention that merely to remind honourable senators that the fact of the advertising was certainly very well known and understood. The advertising which appeared in all major newspapers and main provincial newspapers pointed out that it was planned to end the old scheme in a few months and that until then an application may be made under either scheme according to eligibility. That point was clearly made. But, most importantly, at that early stage telephone numbers for inquiries were very prominently advertised. So I think people who are in that--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chipp" NAMEID="3V4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator Chipp</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the provincial Press as well, yes. So there has been an opportunity for people to make inquiries. It is not a matter of this Bill suddenly appearing in the Senate and sneaking up on home buyers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not enter the debate on the basis that there are no problems for individuals at the cut-off point. Of course I understand that there can be. But, whenever there are changes, whether it be to the income tax legislation or to a State stamp duty applicable to home transactions-that sort of thing occurs from time to time; we all know that stamp duty has become an important source of revenue-those charges alter the financial position of people who might have been anticipating a transaction of the sort we are dealing with here, namely, a home purchase. Wherever the point is drawn somebody will be able to say: 'Well, if it had just been kept going for another week or another month or whatever I would have had an opportunity to benefit from the old scheme which is now gone'. The fact is that for some months now it has been a matter of public record that the scheme would come to an end and that entitlement under the old scheme would stop . </PARA>
<PARA> The significant point in not extending this scheme further, from the Government 's point of view, is that the period of overlap is costly. I do not want to labour the point. The fact is that the Government, after looking at the home buying situation, allocated additional funds notwithstanding the tight financial position-all honourable senators know this-because of the blow-out. We found additional money to pay out the backlog of claims under the old scheme. So, there has been a very significant acceleration of payments and considerable additional funds have been allocated. We have done that knowing that we had forward commitments for the new scheme. If further changes are introduced then, once again, the legislature is saying to the Executive: 'Look, the parameters of your Budget can be stretched, as far as we are concerned, just that bit further' . </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators to bear in mind the series of points which I have tried to make as quickly as possible: That any cut-off point gives rise to the possibility that some people will be just outside the cut-off point no matter where it is drawn; that this scheme was coming to an end and that this was known and was advertised as long ago as 20 March; and that, notwithstanding the tight financial circumstances, additional funds have already been pushed into this program. I ask the Senate, in the interests of fairness to the Government, which has the difficult job of trying to put these things together, to not further extend this scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has taken on board the views of the Opposition about the weaknesses in the old Homes Saving Grant Scheme. It has provided, as Senator Haines suggested, a means test application in respect of the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme. We are grateful for that because it is an improvement, as I said in my speech in the debate on the motion for the second reading. The second reading speech of the former Minister for Housing and Construction indicated the difficulties to which Senator Harradine has referred. There will be problems of communication. The Government has accepted that some people will be disadvantaged. It is not the Senate's fault that the House of Representatives is not sitting so that if we passed this amendment now the House of Representatives could deal with it tonight. It is not our fault that the Fraser administration has gone on holidays while we are sitting here a fortnight after the House of Representatives has risen, fulfilling our obligations to the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his second reading speech on the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill 1982 the former Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government recognises the difficulty people living in remote areas might experience in obtaining the necessary application documents. Accordingly the Bill provides that a written notification within that month of an intention to apply will be accepted provided a formal application is lodged within one further month. </PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about Australia. Australia is a large continent. It has people scattered all over it. The second reading speech continues:</PARA>
<PARA> People who enter into a contract before the new scheme receives Royal Assent and who, as a result of the operation of the means test, may not be eligible under the new scheme, will have . . . to apply under the Home Savings Grant Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they have an option of remaining within the confines of the old Homes Savings Grant Scheme. The second reading speech continued:</PARA>
<PARA> They should lodge their application as promptly as possible and certainly within one month of the Royal Assent to the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Is it unreasonable, as Senator Harradine pointed out, that we want to extend that one month period to a three month period? If the House of Representatives realises that we have a valid desire to improve the legislation-I think that is part of our obligation as a house of review-then nothing is wrong with finding a formula that meets that point of view. When the Minister commended the Bill to the Senate he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will publicise the cut-off date widely and I strongly urge people who have bought their first home and who have not yet lodged an application to do so promptly. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Government recognises that there are people in that grey area. Surely it is accepted. We have seen the establishment of press relations offices, a Government Information Unit and Lord knows what. The amount of money devoted to public relations has been increased very extensively so that the Government can communicate with the Australian people about its legislation and its services. Obviously it did so because it feels it is not reaching the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government admits it is going to have difficulty in relating the new legislation and the options involved to the people who might be affected. I do not care whether it involves only one person, 50 persons or 500 persons; I do not think that we, as legislators, should take any steps that disenfranchise or in any way disadvantage any persons who honestly seek the grant. The Homes Savings Grant Scheme has been in operation for a number of years. Many people have entered a savings scheme in the belief that they were going to qualify for the grant. I just doubt whether the Government can validly say as is set out in the document I have before me that a certain month is the cut-off point. The Government says that it must change legislation from time to time and that such problems are just too bad. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that Senator Chaney is necessarily taking a hard line view or that he is not sympathetic and compassionate to the view that Senator Harradine has put forward. All I am looking for is a formula that will resolve this difficulty and give us a breathing space so that nobody will be adversely affected by changes that have taken place. I am not concerned about the funding of this measure. There was a waiting time of, I think, some nine months and I was pleased to hear the Minister say that sufficient funds have been set aside to make up that leeway or lag. Surely we are talking about only a small number of people and a small amount of funds. After all, if the purpose is to help people it is our obligation to find the means to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intervene only because I think there is a degree of cross purpose in the debate. I would like to clarify the matter because what I have to say may lead to a higher degree of unanimity. A lot of what Senator Gietzelt has been talking about relates to the problem of the period within which an application can be made. But in fact the reason I have difficulty with Senator Harradine's proposal is that Senator Harradine is not merely concerned with the period within which application can be made; he is concerned with the period of eligibility. So his proposal in fact involves an extension of eligibility. In other words, the period within which one can buy a house and qualify under the old scheme would be extended under Senator Harradine's amendment. I certainly will be doing everything I can to ensure that those who are eligible have their attention drawn to the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The previous Minister for Housing and Construction sent out 20,000 personal letters to lending institutions and so forth. We have advertising planned. As far as the application point is concerned, which was really the main thrust of the remarks made by Senator Gietzelt during the Committee stage of this debate, we will do our best to deal with that by making sure that the matters are drawn to people's attention. Eligibility raises a quite different question and that is whether we extend a non-income tested scheme another 90 days so that it runs contemporaneously with the income tested scheme. For the benefit of the Opposition, I refer to some of Mr Uren's comments in the House of Representatives. He really was critical of the Government's proposal to extend non-means tested and non-income tested assistance to home buyers through tax arrangements. I ask the Opposition to consider a couple of passages from Mr Uren 's speech as a basis of not supporting the amendment which has been put forward. Mr Uren said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The family home tax rebate scheme really means a subsidy of approximately $100m in a full year to that wealthy section of home purchasers--</PARA>
<PARA>I stress these words-</PARA>
<PARA>Who earn in excess of 150 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Uren picked 150 per cent of average weekly earnings as the income level above which to classify people as wealthy and not warranting assistance under that scheme. Mr Uren went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . instead of helping the people who really need help, he--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Treasurer (Mr Howard)-</PARA>
<PARA>again serves it up to the wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat those criticisms that Mr Uren made of the Government because it is a bit inconsistent for the Opposition to be making criticism of us in relation to the tax rebate and then to be saying that we really ought to be running our non- means tested Homes Savings Grant Scheme for another 90 days because it is not fair if people miss out. The fact is that during that 90 days assistance will be available to people who have incomes of up to 135 per cent of average weekly earnings, and partial assistance will be available for those on up to 155 per cent of average weekly earnings. We are not leaving home buyers without assistance; we are saying that that assistance should be focused on those people who are within those income limits. Mr Uren also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The rebate is not targeted to those who need assistance most. On the basis of the 1980 home finance survey . . . 45 per cent of first home buyers had incomes in excess of 150 per cent of AWE. These upper income groups will be assisted by the rebate while deserving families on low incomes will get nothing.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, Mr Uren said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this is nothing new for this Government because it has always taken resources away from the great bulk of the people on low incomes and transferred them either to wealthy individuals or to wealthy companies. </PARA>
<PARA>I have been a public exponent of trying to focus available assistance on need. I think this is one of those occasions when the Government has made a move which is significantly in that direction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like other Australian Democrats, I approve of the new Bill and the principles embodied in it. My cause for concern, as with Senator Harradine and certain other honourable senators who have spoken, is the transitional period. I think there is a difficulty in this regard which may not occur in some of the smaller cities in Australia but certainly does occur in Sydney where the time occupied in getting through the plans of a house and drawing up contracts is quite long. I take the excellent point made by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) that if 90 days were placed in the amendment at this stage that period would effectively be six months because the Bill could not be given royal assent until after it had been returned to the House of Representatives. I have an amendment to Senator Harradine's amendment which I have discussed with him, and I do not think he minds me saying that. I propose to move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where 90 days occurs, substitute seven days. </PARA>
<PARA>This would effectively bring the matter back to the three months which we are seeking. That, I think, would allow a period of 90 days, or something like that, to elapse before the Bill came into operation. </PARA>
<PARA> I must also reasonably declare here some sort of personal interest in this matter since a member of my family is affected by this situation. My knowledge of that situation, and others, convinces me that it is probably not possible in two months in the city of Sydney, and I suspect elsewhere, for persons who have saved conscientiously for the homes savings grant and who have tentative plans to complete their houses, to have the plans passed by a council-which they must do before they can have a contract with a builder-negotiate with builders on contracts and then sign a contract. That is almost impossible. I suspect that many thousands of people will be caught in just this dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Minister that this plan should not be extended to the extent where people think they should benefit from it even if they have made no plans and we should go on indefinitely with extensions. But I think that those people who saved conscientiously over the years, who have plans and who have taken action in respect of the grant should not be deprived of that grant completely. It is for that reason that I support Senator Harradine's amendment, which I propose to amend to cover the point raised reasonably by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it would be nearly impossible for people to go through the stages of getting their house to the stage where they can sign a contract with a builder. It is possible, and I think this is one of the unfortunate aspects of this situation, that on fairly harsh terms they could in fact get it done. But those terms would include rushing through the plans of their house, perhaps not doing what they wanted to do and accepting the first quote from a builder that came along. That would quite likely in the course of nature be a very disadvantageous one. So I suggest that the Government, by not agreeing to or considering this amendment, first, will push people of good faith into that position and, second, will make sure that a large number of plans to build which have been current over the last couple of months will be cancelled. It would not be terribly good for the building industry and it would not be good for Australia generally if that activity did not proceed. That is an element of this situation which must be taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security mentioned that there had been a wide pattern of advertising during the Victorian election and said this advertising was criticised. That election was held early in April. I suggest that it is unreasonable to expect everybody in Australia to read every advertisement which appears in the newspapers every day so that he will become immediately aware of everything that is advertised. It is probably only five or six weeks since people became aware of these advertisements. In many cases people became aware of them even later than that. That makes the situation in which these people are placed even more difficult for them. There is no question of wanting to give unfair advantages to people who are purely opportunistic and who want to get on the bandwagon with the old scheme. The amendment is designed, as I see it, to assist those people who have saved money, who have been prudent, who have persisted with the Homes Savings Grant Scheme in good faith, who have bought land, who have tentative plans ready and who were going to go ahead but who now find themselves, because of the nature of this Bill, in a situation in which it is not possible for them to proceed in time. On that basis, I have foreshadowed that I will move an amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may have misled the Committee. The amendments moved by Senator Harradine are amendments to the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill 1982. As I understand it, the Home Deposit Assistance Bill 1982 is to pass unamended. In fact, the period of 90 days would apply once royal assent is given to the Home Deposit Assistance Bill. So something I said by way of interjection was incorrect. The only complication is that we would then need to get the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill through the Parliament at a later stage. That is something which the Government cannot guarantee because it is in the hands of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to make a couple of brief comments. There is no need to go through the procedures which Senator Mason has outlined to sign a contract for the purchase of a house. One can sign a contract for the purchase of a house without having approvals or anything else. Very often that is something which is done by the builder pursuant to the signing of the contract. Very often the builder makes the arrangements for plans, lodges them and seeks the necessary approval. The signing of a contract is the determinant for a grant under this legislation. I think the difficulties that Senator Mason is concerned about are somewhat exaggerated in his mind. I do not mean that in any offensive sense. I think the difficulties are not as great as he has presented to the Committee. Entering into a firm contract for a house is something which does not necessarily occur at the end of the sort of process which Senator Mason has outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I wish to raise is that more than two months have passed since 18 March. People will have up to two months after the proclamation within which to apply for a grant. Advertisements were published earlier. There has been a great amount of publicity by Mr McVeigh, the former Minister for Housing and Construction, with respect to people such as real estate agents and those in banks who are active in this field. If this legislation is passed a substantial advertising campaign will be conducted. I ask the Committee to pass this legislation in the form it has been put before it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate because I have sympathy with the amendments. It now appears necessary that we should examine whether either House of Parliament should rise before the other has completed its business. I think we ought to take a look at that matter in future. If the Senate finds it necessary to sit, the House of Representatives should be available to consider any decision made by the Senate. If that does not occur, we will be constantly under pressure to pass legislation which needs to be amended and which the Senate might otherwise amend but will not because the House of Representatives is not sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the amendments for which I have sympathy in spite of the points which the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has made concerning eligibility. This involves an area of great need on the part of those who are seeking not to buy a luxury item but to purchase a home. The Government, by its policies, has raised the expectations of a great number of people who will now be disadvantaged in spite of the fact that there has been an advertising campaign and that further advice will be given. I think a great number of people who do not deserve to be disadvantaged will be disadvantaged. I should like to mention why I think they should be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The penalties which are imposed on people seeking homes now and the costs of borrowing money are substantial. I put to the Minister a variation of his comments to the chamber concerning high interest rates. The high interest rates which exist in the community do not exist because of a change in the pattern of savings and a change in the attitude of those people who have some funds in savings organisations. The problems that high interest rates cause the people whom we are trying to assist are problems of the Government's own making. The Government has taken a dangerous course. It endeavoured to soak up liquidity by lifting the bond rate by 1.4 per cent only recently. This led to a further upward thrust of interest rates. That deliberate policy taken by the Government lifted interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> A further problem has been caused by the deregulation of interest rates. This also was a Government decision. Deregulation of interest rates has thrown the market place into disorder. There are many institutions in Australia chasing funds. I refer in particular to building societies and credit unions. They are now up against fairly savage and sophisticated competition from banks and other financial institutions which are offering interest rates as high as 17.5 per cent. That, of course, has forced the building societies-many of them are small institutions-to chase funds in the market place by also lifting their interest rates. I have not included the credit unions in that. In Australia a great number of financial institutions are chasing funds and forcing interest rates up , to the disadvantage of the home purchaser. That is why we need this legislation. The need is so great and the disadvantage is so great that we ought to be accepting the type of amendment which has been proposed, even though it may cost the Government millions of dollars. I put it to the Government that the rise in interest rates is not due to a change in the pattern of savings. Interest rates have been forced up by deliberate Government policy. The Minister for Social Security is attempting to stop me. I point out that if I do not make these comments now I will make them during the third reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to conclude my remarks by saying that we should be very careful about allowing financial institutions to go into the market place to seek the funds which they desperately need. If they do not have the funds they cannot operate. A building society that does not receive funds cannot carry out its functions. A credit union that does not receive funds cannot carry out its functions. These organisations have to compete with the banks which, under deregulation, can now advertise what I think are excessive interest rates. Who are the most disadvantaged? The most disadvantaged are those people whom we are trying to assist by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I warn the Government that, as the economic pressure starts to bite, some of these financial institutions may go to the wall. The responsibility will be on the Government's head. Some institutions may be those whose prime purpose is to provide home loans. They are able to do that now only with the greatest difficulty because the banks are not interested to the same extent, nor is their prime purpose lending for housing as it is with building societies. I put it to the Committee that building societies in this country are facing a great difficulty in carrying out their worthwhile purpose. I ask the Minister to consider all these matters, relax a little and accept the amendment and the further eligibility even though it might cost more. I advise him and the Government to deal with the prime cause of the problem-high interest rates. Interest rates are the responsibility of the Government and no one else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, I acknowledge the correctness of your response to my somewhat inaudible interjection concerning your call, for which I apologise. You were perfectly in the right and I was in the wrong. Beyond that, I shall comment on the remarks made by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). I cannot understand how he can publicly encourage young people to sign a firm contract with a builder without knowing what they would build, without the plans being passed by the local council and without the closest and tightest specifications being provided for the structure . I suggest with all respect to the Minister that that would be a very dangerous thing for young people to do and would force them into an even more invidious situation than I had imagined. If this cut-off point failure will force young people into that position we will cause chaos for many hundreds or thousands of people. I do not know of a single reason why a person should sign a firm contract with a builder to construct a dwelling or any other structure without knowing exactly what it was and without having it covered by fully approved plans and specifications. I reiterate that under normal circumstances in Sydney- even if people started on 18 March, the actual day of this announcement-it would not be possible to get that done by the end of this month.</PARA></TALK.START>

Quite a few would be involved. My concern is that this is not analogous to a change in stamp duty regulations or in taxation laws; this refers to what is normally a once only major decision taken by a couple to buy their home. If a couple slave their guts out over a period and find themselves falling between the two stools only because the leeway is not sufficient, I think we should give those people sympathetic consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have one example very much in mind. There is no profit for me in raising this matter. In fact, from a personal point of view, given my own circumstances of selling a house, I ought to vote for the legislation as it is to force everybody out on to the market this weekend to buy a home. That is what they have to do. The Minister cannot deny that. If this legislation goes through as it is at present there will be no 2 1/2 months leeway-I think there must be some misunderstanding somewhere-and prospective purchasers must go out this weekend and buy a house. </PARA>

If they do not vote for my amendments now they will certainly get a lot of queries in the future about its stand. I have only two or perhaps three cases to cite.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity of the first reading stage of these money Bills to raise a matter which, I think, must be brought before the Parliament at this stage before we commence the recess. It relates to Australia's obligations to its citizens who are abroad and who may have a problem with the laws of other countries. I raise this matter, coincidentally, on the same day that a man named William Sinclair, who was convicted in a Thailand court, is free, for the first time in three and a half years, to return to Australia, having had an appeal upheld. Having been found innocent of a heroin charge William Sinclair is reported in today's Age as saying that he blames the Australian Government for the three and a half years he spent in prison. Regardless of whether that statement is accurate, it is one important example of a question that has been unresolved for some five months, namely: What are the Australian Government's duties in respect of its citizens?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I first became involved with this question, through the Sinclair case, in January this year when the Australian Government refused to intervene with respect to his gaol sentence. At that time the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, wrote to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Peacock, and said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . when an Australian citizen becomes involved with a foreign legal system the Government will not attempt to interfere where the laws and procedures involved are applied without discrimination against Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words provided the same laws-regardless of whether they conform in any way with our ideas of justice-are applied equally to Australian citizens we would not intervene at all. I then commented publicly that I did not believe the Government's attitude was adequate; I do not believe that it has been traditionally the view and policy of the Australian Government for many years; and I said that I intended to raise this matter in Parliament when it resumed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to that matter. Drug peddling is no reason why we should ignore the rules of law in this country. I said that I would raise the matter before the Government members' law and government committee. I did that and after preparing a statement-which I believe is correct-of the policies which have been pursued by governments for many years, that document, containing a minor amendment, was referred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). Some two months after that was done there is still no response from the Foreign Minister as to whether it is a correct statement. That statement sets out the circumstances under which I believe the Government has responsibilities. Because of the shortage of time I desire to incorporate in Hansard the statement headed 'Australia's obligations to its citizens abroad'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIA'S OBLIGATIONS TO ITS CITIZENS ABROAD</PARA>
<PARA> (1) On 6 January 1982, the Attorney-General, Senator Durack was reported as saying that when an Australian citizen becomes involved with a foreign legal system, the Government will not attempt to interfere where the laws and procedures involved are applied without discrimination against Australians. The Attorney-General, on 30 December 1981, had also written to Hon. Andrew Peacock relating to complaints about a particular trial of an Australian citizen in a foreign country in the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'With regard to the conduct of the trial, the Australian Government has consistently taken the view that, when an Australian citizen becomes involved in normal judicial processes of another country, the Government will not attempt to interfere where the laws and procedures involved are applied without discrimination against Australians, notwithstanding that differences exist between the laws and procedures of that country and Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The essence of these statements is that the Australian Government will never attempt to interfere in the case of an Australian citizen charged with offences in a foreign country, when the laws and procedures are applied without discrimination against Australians. In other words, provided the laws-no matter how unjust or offensive to the rule of law-are applied in the same form to Australians as to nationals of that country, the Australian Government will make no protest. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) These statements are not, and have never been, applied as Australian policy , and indeed there are many instances when Australian Governments have registered protests or made representations relating not only to the treatment of Australians abroad but even in the cases of citizens of that foreign country.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The statement is altogether too extreme and unqualified. In normal cases against Australians in countries that respect the rule of law, provide opportunities for defendants to be effectively represented and to present their defences, then one would not expect the Australian Government to interfere, or make representations. But even in these cases the Australian Government would '' interfere'' in the sense that it would, through its Embassy, ensure that the Australian national was aware of his rights, had representation and communications with his relatives and advisers and, if imprisoned, would be given proper treatment including the provision of health needs. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) However, when we consider overseas nations operating under systems of law which do not accord with standards that would ordinarily be observed by civilised communities, or which are subject to manifest defects in administration, then the duty of the Australian Government to intervene on behalf of its nationals may often arise. For example, the fact Iran citizens may be given summary trial without semblance of justice, or may be executed, or stoned to death or have limbs cut off by way of punishment, is no reason why we should accept with equanimity the same treatment for Australians. Likewise, any Australian citizen accused of 'dissident' behaviour in the USSR (where such trials always lead to a conviction) may well lead to protest from the Australian Government, irrespective of the fact that USSR citizens are similarly treated. </PARA>
<PARA> The examples could be multiplied in many places. The Australian Government has protested on many occasions in these type of circumstances, both in relation to Australians and other persons. It has done so following the carriage of resolutions of the Parliament, representations from members of the Parliament, from Amnesty International, the International Commission of Jurists and from ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) It follows that the Attorney-General's statement must at least be subject to a proviso that there are special obligations to Australian citizens abroad which will be dependent on the circumstances of each case and the legal procedures involved. In some cases the Government will have a duty to interfere in the interests of justice, to ensure, so far as is possible, application of the Rule of law, acceptable legal representation, communication with Australian diplomatic representatives and/or family of accused and, if imprisoned, health care. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) It is suggested that the Foreign Minister be asked to make a statement in the Parliament clarifying this matter and confirming the obligations of the Australian Government towards its nationals abroad. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time I said that I did not believe the response which Senator Durack gave was good enough. I stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Government had to look at the material presented to the Thai court--</PARA>
<PARA>This was one example-</PARA>
<PARA>and see whether it was proper for them to supply evidence which would perhaps be inadmissible in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In the extraordinary legal systems that exist in some parts of the world we have a responsibility not only to our own citizens, but particularly to them, to ensure that we don't supply evidence that would not be acceptable under our own system or to our own obligations to international covenants. </PARA>
<PARA>I was concerned with the general question which arose. The Sinclair case is a good example of the difficulties that arise if we have the blunt idea that if in other countries the same laws apply to Australian citizens as to their nationals we will not intervene. </PARA>
<PARA> If I say only a few words about this case I will not do it justice. It has been done justice in a series of articles which Mr Garry Sturgess of the Age has written over a period of months. He has followed the case most diligently and one should read the whole of the series. However, I will summarise what happened in that case. A man, now aged 69 years, was convicted for possession of heroin 3 1/2 years ago and sentenced to 33 years' imprisonment. The evidence upon which he was convicted-it was referred to many times in the judgment of the Thai court of which I have a copy-consisted of statements made by a man named Edwin William Smith who is a prisoner in Australia. It was hearsay evidence. The court relied upon a statement; it did not have that witness before it. On the basis of that statement, which was supplied by Australian officials at our Embassy in Bangkok, Mr Sinclair was convicted. That evidence has since been totally discredited. Subsequently, prosecutions were taken in Australia against other people connected with the Sinclair case, including his son, on the same grounds. These people were charged in New South Wales and were acquitted. Some were acquitted by magistrates and some by Judge Muir in the District Court. According to an article in the Age about Edwin Smith, Judge Muir said:</PARA>
<PARA> He admits before this court and before the jury that he has deliberately given false evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Edwin Smith, under examination in the District court, said that he had given false evidence because the police had promised him a pardon, and at other times a shortening of his sentence. </PARA>
<PARA>Very largely on the basis of that evidence William Sinclair was convicted. Subsequently, efforts were made through Mr Andrew Peacock and others to get the Australian Government to authenticate that evidence because the Thai court was not at first prepared to accept the evidence of the Australian court. Ultimately , the Australian Government did that. It proceeded late last year to authenticate the evidence. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) then said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sinclair requests that the Australian Government ensure that transcripts of certain proceedings before Australian courts are properly attested for use by the Thai court reviewing Mr Sinclair's father's conviction. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs is taking action to assist in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>It did that and ultimately, in May of this year, the Thai court, on consideration of the further evidence, upheld the appeal. Although it fixed very high bail, which has since been obtained, Mr Sinclair was subsequently released and is now free to come back to Australia. The problem is that we meddled by providing evidence to the court in Thailand which turned out to be faulty. We have subsequently taken some action but, meanwhile, this man has spent 3 1/2 years in gaol. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to what was said in a speech on 25 November 1981 by the Australian Ambassador to Thailand, Mr Gordon Jockel, to the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce in which he outlined the constraints on specialist narcotics officers working in the Embassy. He is reported in the Age, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> He said embassy officers could not engage in police work, 'the performance of which is naturally within the sovereign jurisdiction of the appointed Thai agencies'. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Nor would it be compatible with the immunities afforded these officers as members of the embassy for them to engage directly in operational work,' he said . The duties of the officers were carefully defined by directive. 'They work in a liaison capacity with their Thai counterparts. They exchange intelligence. They may consult on the timing and locations of operations. They may assist with interpretation in inquiries and interrogations. They may give evidence in Thai courts when it is appropriate to do so,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>In this case the officers went much further than that. They supplied written evidence from Australia which led to a conviction. I think it is a matter of concern that we have officials who go beyond the duties which the Ambassador to Thailand indicated they should perform. The position is as I have set out in my statement. That statement has had the confirmation of the law and government committee of the Government parties. I hope that today the Acting Foreign Minister (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) will be able to say something about whether the statement is accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> In general, the statement that rules are applied equally to Australians as they are to locals is not good enough. It is too crude a statement altogether. It is not good enough to say that because laws, no matter how unjust or offensive to the rule of law, are applied in the same way to nationals of a country as to Australians, the Australian Government can make no protest. As I understand it, that policy has never been applied in Australia. I have checked these matters with people who ought to know. Even in normal cases with countries which observe the rule of law we expect our officials abroad to assist by making sure that Australian defendants are properly and effectively represented, that they have an opportunity to communicate with their relatives and advisers and that, if imprisoned, at least they are given proper treatment including health needs. But in other countries which do not accord with our standards of law and which accept evidence of a hearsay nature, or where there is no proper system of justice, we expect our protests to be heard. We constantly protest whether cases occur in the Soviet Union, Iran or Uganda. We often protest at the request of organisations in this country, such as Amnesty International, or at the request of our citizens. We expect that protests will be made in relation to not only Australian citizens but also the people of the country concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Because we were dissatisfied with the proceedings in the Sinclair case this statement has been put to the Foreign Minister (Mr Street) for his comment. In Thailand, as I understand it, the law enables the Executive government to have a person accused in a drug case executed without trial. There does not have to be a trial. In the Sinclair case an enormous cost burden was placed on the relatives and friends of William Sinclair to ensure that he had a trial at all. We have to concern ourselves with the differences which occur in countries with that type of government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not talking about Hayward. I am talking about no one but William Sinclair who was found guilty. Other criticisms have also been made, one by the President of the Law Institute of Victoria, Mr Mat Walsh, who, at the time of his criticism in December, called on the Federal Government to consider drawing up guidelines to cover Australian officials asked to give evidence to foreign courts about Australian citizens. He said that the guidelines could limit the giving of evidence which would not be acceptable in Australian courts. He pointed out that in many of our embassies, including the one in Thailand, we have no specialised legal department or people knowledgeable in the laws that apply in those countries. So we have the problem that embassy officials are sometimes used to the detriment of Australian citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a representative of the International Commission of Jurists and one of its officers I could not fail to bring this matter to the notice of the Senate. As a representative and Vice-President of the Amnesty organisation's parliamentary wing-I note that Senator Coleman is in the chamber also-I constantly bring such matters to the attention of the Government of this country. We expect the Government to respond when people are not given proper trials abroad. We would be in dereliction of our duty if we did not draw these things to its attention. Our obligation to Australian citizens is surely just as great. One could say, in response to Senator Mulvihill's interjection, that in the case of heinous offences in other countries, such as drug offences with which we have no sympathy, if people are guilty they should suffer the penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very serious cases we should be even more careful that there is a proper investigation, that the rules of evidence and so forth are applied and that people are dealt with properly. We have to be more vigilant in the serious cases . In our passports is a statement from the Governor-General which requests that the bearer be allowed to pass freely and that he or she be afforded every assistance and protection of which he or she may stand in need. One of those needs is the assistance of our representatives abroad. In recent times, I do not believe this has been brought sufficiently to the attention of the people concerned. I want to know from the Government whether the statement I have made is correct and whether the policies that I have outlined as being the Government 's remain such today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intervene to respond in small measure to what Senator Missen has just said. Recently he referred the matter to me in my capacity as Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. On 19 May, I sent to the Secretary of the Government Members Law and Government Committee an acknowledgment of the reference from that Committee on this subject. It was an interim reply stating that the matter had been taken up with the Attorney-General's Department and that the Department of Foreign Affairs would be writing to the Committee when the matter had been considered and a substantive reply could be given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The letter from the Government Members Law and Government Committee raised some extremely complicated questions of international practice and law. I think one could gather as much from what has been said by Senator Missen today. The interim reply said that necessarily consultations would take place with the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) before a full reply to the letter could be prepared. Those consultations are taking place but, I repeat, the issues raised are extremely difficult and complicated. They involve questions of international law and practice. They cannot be answered simply and demand careful and thorough consideration. I assure Senator Missen and others who might be interested in the same subject that a more complete reply will be made available to the Committee and also to the Senate if thought fit. All efforts will be made to do that within a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Missen has referred to Mr William Sinclair, it is appropriate to say that the assistance given Mr Sinclair was considerable. On 18 January 1982 he acknowledged this by writing to express his appreciation, stating:</PARA>
<PARA> My sincere thanks for the kindly interest you have taken in my well-being. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that that does not address itself to the central point made by Senator Missen today, but the statement by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House of Representatives on 26 May 1978 describes in some detail the services provided by the Government. It must be remembered that Australia provides consular services to its citizens overseas in accordance with established international practice and as provided for under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to which Australia is a party. I believe we can say that the assistance available to Australians is at least equal to that provided by other countries to their citizens. A statement in 1978 by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs makes clear that it is an important consular duty to ensure that Australian citizens arrested overseas are treated with due process in accordance with the laws of the State where the offence may have occurred and that they receive the same benefits of the law which the foreign state affords its own subjects. The consular officers of the Australian Embassy in Bangkok paid considerable attention to the welfare of Mr Sinclair while he was in prison, as they do for other Australians in prison in Thailand and other countries. I understand that from the time of this arrest at least 32 visits were made to Mr Sinclair in prison. As well, there were 14 attendances at court hearings. This assistance was acknowledged by Mr Sinclair in letters that he wrote to the Consul in Bangkok. For example, on 9 December 1981 he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> As for myself, I receive every possible assistance within the framework of the prison regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, he also expressed his appreciation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of assisting Australians in gaol, Australian consular officials assist a broad range of welfare activities. They help with the delivery of mail, the transfer of funds, communication with the outside world, medical problems and other such matters. This work is carried out as part of the very broad- ranging responsibilities of the limited number of consular officers in each post . These include the giving of assistance to the many Australians travelling abroad who find themselves in difficulties for a whole range of reasons, as well as a number of formal functions such as performance of marriage, the registration of births and citizenship activities. </PARA>
<PARA> I make those points recognising that what Senator Missen has asked of the Government falls beyond that range of consular duties and raises the fundamental principles that he has brought forward. The Attorney-General's Department, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs, is looking at these extremely difficult and complex questions, which involve international law. As soon as consideration can be given and some points resolved a complete reply will be given to the Government Members Law and Government Committee. I am sure that it will be made more widely available, if substantive changes take place, as compared with the position stated earlier by the Attorney-General and the Foreign Minister (Mr Street). I undertake that when such consideration has been given by the two departments concerned by the Foreign Minister and, if necessary , by the Attorney-General, further advice will be given the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer quite briefly to the matter raised by Senator Missen and to respond to it from the perspective of one who is a former Secretary of the parliamentary group of Amnesty International and is a current executive member of that group. The majority of its work, as is the case with Amnesty International generally, is to ensure that basic human rights are available to all. Of course, it is of great concern when it would appear, from evidence that has been given, that those human rights have been denied to an Australian in another country because of the judicial system that operates there. I will await with interest any further information that the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) may be able to provide. I hope that she will see fit at some stage to have a statement made in this chamber by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) rather than merely pass it on to the Government Members Law and Government Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter that I wanted to raise today-I am conscious of the limitations on time-is perhaps the most important that could be raised in this decade. I refer to the second special session on disarmament which is being held in the United Nations in June. I believe that it would have been more appropriate for a full debate to take place regarding this matter, but this will be the last opportunity that one will have to discuss it before the Senate rises for the winter recess. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the coming special session on disarmament to be the most important of any so far held. Perhaps it would be considered the last real chance for the world to divert itself from its present path which seems to be taking us daily closer to the possibility of a nuclear war on a global scale. I do not subscribe to the theory, expounded by some who should know better, that it is possible to have a limited nuclear war. The premise that one country can drop a nuclear bomb or a number of nuclear bombs on another without some form of retaliation is ludicrous. But as each day goes by we hear a number of reports that there are in high positions in other governments people who see that as a feasible proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that every reasonably well informed member of the Senate and every reasonably well informed member of the Australian community are aware of the current situation which exists simply because rash and unthinking statements have been made and know that no government really wants to be seen as backing down. The biggest problem is to convince people that we are not entering upon a face saving operation. Also, I make it quite clear that I am not being any more or less critical of the United States than I am of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I am simply making the point that to millions of people throughout the world the tragedy is that those super-powers cannot sit down to discuss the most important issue that may ever arise-the future of the world, or of mankind. We have seen a number of overtures made by both the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics over the last few months. It appears that if one makes an overture the other has to reject it just because it was not its own proposal. I think that is a tragedy, one that we may live to regret. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken in this place before about the transference of funds and I want to touch on that matter again. Given that at the moment almost half of the world 's scientists are working either on the development of bigger and better more sophisticated weapons or directly or indirectly on military projects, given that governments are spending of the order of $1m a minute on the arms race, given that we already have enough nuclear arms to kill every human being 16 times over and given that two-thirds of the world's population lives in want and poverty, there is a great deal to be said about the transference of funds. On a world- wide basis, if the world spent 5 per cent of its military budgets on the means of food production and employed some of those specialists who are currently employed on military expenditures there would be no starving people. If the world spent 5 per cent of its military budgets on health care we could just about wipe out killer diseases. If the world spent 5 per cent of its military budgets on housing everyone could be housed. I am not saying that they would be housed in palatial mansions but at least there would be some form of shelter for everyone. If the world spent 5 per cent of its military budgets on education there would be no under-educated people in this world. That is the type of transference of funds about which I am talking. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also thinking of the spin-offs that governments and various nations would get from that transference of funds. Australia at the moment is suffering the effects of high inflation and high unemployment, as are most other Western countries. If we transfer funds to those productive areas we provide employment. We provide funds by way of taxation for governments to continue. So it is a spin -off that perhaps we should be looking at more seriously. Just as a matter of interest, I am not talking just about defence budgets. I am talking about military budgets. I think the distinction has to be made because one is totally different from the other. The budgets I am talking about-the military budgets- are those that are currently being spent on building up arms. They are totally unnecessary arms because we already have quite enough military equipment. We already have the capacity to destroy the world many times over and will only increase that capacity, although why anybody would want to be able to kill anybody more than once is beyond my comprehension. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a number of ever-growing stockpiles of nuclear weapons capable of that destruction. It is a fact, for instance, that there are now over 3 tonnes of explosive power for every man, woman and child on earth. Those stockpiles are increasing daily, both in number and sophistication. As the numbers grow and technology develops so, too, does the risk of war, either through mistake, miscalculation or even malfunction of control systems, not to mention the human factors such as the ambition, stubbornness, political intransigence or perhaps even mania of various people. I think it is sobering to reflect on Dr James Miller's speech in 1981 when he was secretary to the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. He said that in 1977, an average year, 1,000 military people were removed from access to nuclear weapons because of drug usage. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of all is the growing psychological climate-a world-wide psychological climate, I might add-that suggests that a genuine nuclear war is inevitable in the future but that we can hope that whilst it will be unpleasant it will be, for some, a survivable experience. The best information available is that it will not be a survivable experience. It is simply recognised that some people will take longer to die than others. It is sometimes a little difficult, particularly in this place, not to become disheartened and to give up in the face of what we are increasingly being told that we have to acknowledge is inevitable. It is very easy to become cynical about such organisations as the United Nations. I would be the first to admit that there have been a number of occasions when I have felt disillusioned and discouraged about that organisation but it is all we have. It is the only avenue for a consensus of opinion which could lead-I stress, could lead-to world disarmament and to world peace. It is the only avenue we have whereby people can sit down and talk. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that I have to remind people that the United Nations is a world organisation. It is not a world government. It can operate only if the people who subscribe to it recognise that they have a responsibility not only to agree to the treaties that are put up but also to make them work. It could be said that the United Nations lacks power. I would agree with that. Perhaps we should look at the organisation to see how we can strengthen its membership sot the that is no longer a fundamental weakness, and provide it with some teeth to enable it to do something. I believe that the United Nations can reflect the wishes of a global society. I believe also that world-wide public opinion can be expressed at this very important special session on disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last year we have seen demonstrations in every country in the world by millions of people, all marching for peace. In the week prior to Easter we saw those same demonstrations, those same marches, here in Australia. People marched in every State. The marches were not of the same magnitude as those in Bonn, Amsterdam or the United Kingdom. They were certainly not of the same magnitude as those in the United States. We have a much smaller population. I do believe, because of the size of our country, that we can make a comparison. Those people marched in their hundreds and thousands. They marched for one reason-to demonstrate to the Government that they are not prepared to be dragged along this road to destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Australia could play a quite distinctive role at the special session. I believe that we can put forward positive proposals that can be accepted and, at least, lead to a situation where all sides can sit down, conciliate and talk about the problems tht they have with the arms race-how they can bring it to a halt, what they can do with their stockpiles of weapons, how they can make them safe so that the materials in them can be used for other things-and the transference of funds that I spoke about a little earlier so that we can see a world without any poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> Because it is such a special session I do not believe that Australia should even consider sending anybody less that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I believe that it would be a mistake for someone of lesser importance to lead the Australian delegation. It is interesting that we saw the Prime Minister in Lusaka a few years ago posturing about something which could not be considered to be as important as a special session on disarmament. We have seen the recent display, his visits to overseas countries. One would have to admit that most of the visiting was done for reasons of domestic consumption and had nothing whatsoever to do with the terrible economic situation in which the world finds itself. Surely none of the meetings that he held with the leaders of any of those countries could be considered to be more important than the United Nations special session on disarmament. I believe that the Australian people expect him to be there, the people of the world want him to be there and that the people of this Parliament should insist that he go there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Coleman, I wish to say something about peace. Peace is the ultimate quality of life. I believe war is the great thief of life. We cannot talk about peace unless we refer to our experiences in and fear of war. As I said, war is the great thief. Not only does war thieve people's lives, it is also the thief of the whole world in relation to such things as education and food. A quarter of the world's population goes hungry every night. One billion people are illiterate in this world. Much of this is caused by the amount which is spent on the war machine and wars. If man could live in peace in this world we would not recognise the world. We would have a quality of life which is unrecognisable from what we know now, or as past generations have seen it. It is essential not only for governments but also for people of the world to recognise and understand the dangers in the present situation. Removing the threat of a nuclear world war is the most urgent task at present. Mankind is confronted with a choice; we must either halt the arms race and proceed to disarmament or we face annihilation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is essential to understand just what the cost of war has been. Although I have only a short time in which to speak as this is the end of the parliamentary session before the winter recess, I wish to explain the cost to the world of past wars. World War I took twice as many men as all major wars which had occurred between 1790 and 1930. About 63 of every 100 servicemen who died came from the allied services. The number of civilian deaths which occurred in areas of actual war totalled about 5 million. Starvation, disease and exposure accounted for 80 of every 100 of these civilian deaths. Spanish flu, which some people blamed on the war, caused tens of millions of deaths. </PARA>
<PARA> World War I cost $US337 billion. Of that amount about, about $US186 billion was the direct cost of carrying on the war. The Allies spent about two-thirds of the money used to buy arms, food, ammunition and other war materials. During the first three years of the First World War the fighting nations spent about $US85, 000 every minute. That does not seem much today but in 1913 it was a tremendous amount. The world spends now $1m every minute just on preparation for war. None of the figures I have cited includes the additional loss to the economy of the suffering and the crippling, the billions of dollars needed to pay interest on war debts and the pensions paid to veterans and their families. About $8 of every $10 spent in the war came from borrowed money. We all know that this had to be paid back. We are still paying back war debts from the First World War. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Second World War, 62 million people died. Military action in the front line and civilian losses amounted to 57,542,000 people dead. Between 4.5 million and six million Jews were killed in that war. War is not only the great thief of life and everything around us; it also enables cruel, inhumane people in our society to perpetrate the greatest injustices on other people. It brings out the worst in men and women. People were killed through no fault of their own, simply because they wanted to follow a different religion. The great holocaust the Jewish population in Europe experienced in the Second World War was just unbelievable. Up to six million Jewish people died for no reason. They were tortured and shot. Everything despicable that one could imagine happened to them . But this behaviour does not stop at Germany. In every country there are people who, if they are allowed to be cruel and inhumane to other people, will be like that. </PARA>
<PARA> In latter time we have had the actions of Pol Pot in Kampuchea. He murdered over five million of his own people simply because they disagreed with his political views. They had other views, so he saw fit to butcher them. We also have the inhumanity which exists in South Africa because people have a different colour of skin. Some people there have no rights or very little rights. Without much ado they are gaoled and then thrown out of windows or many other despicable things happen to them. War is not just war. It brings out the worst in people. People should realise just how terrible war is. We must all get together and work out the ways of peace. If we can have peace we will have a better world and a world that will be meaningful and purposeful. Since World War II there have been 130 or so wars. Thirty million people have died. As I have said, many people have been butchered by Pol Pot. I repeat that 30 million people have perished since the Second World War in the 130 wars which have occurred mainly in Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Today there is a conflict between Argentina and Britain. If one says anything against that war in the general community one is branded as a communist, a traitor or something else. This war really need not have happened. I could say that the British have done a magnificent job and that we should resist aggression. A great speech could be made on that. If one were on the Argentinian side one could make a speech saying that the Argentinians have rights, that the Falkland Islands were stolen from them and they have a right to get them back. A person living on the Falkland Islands could also make a great speech for his cause, saying that he has a right to live in freedom. All these things are correct. But eventually this war will have to be resolved around the conference table. In the meantime thousands of people-good, young, men and women-are dying for no reason. I predict that eventually Argentina will take over the Falkland Islands after agreements have been made through the United Nations by Britain and other countries. We will once again forget that many thousands of people's lives have been sacrificed for this cause. There is also the financial cost of the war. All the ships sunk and all the aeroplanes lost will have to be replaced because we simply cannot trust each other any longer. That is a great tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> After the Second World War man was not satisfied. He had to go ahead and build bigger and better weapons. The atomic weapon had come into being. Today we have sufficient atomic weapons to eliminate all mankind ten times over. I do not know why that is necessary because we can only die once. Since the Second World War mankind has spent on the preparation of war, on the war machine, $6,000 billion. A staggering $500 billion was spent in 1980 alone. Today over $1m is spent every minute on defence. Yet the world faces starvation in many areas. One-quarter of the world's population will go to bed hungry tonight. One billion people live in ignorance because they are not educated. Yet 0.5 per cent of the amount spent on arms would pay for all the farm equipment needed to make the food deficient countries self-sufficient by 1990. Doctors also should be aware of what is going on. About $1 billion a day goes down the drain on the military costs when half of the world's population has no clean water, a quarter goes to bed hungry and 300 million people are unemployed. An investment equivalent to five hours of the world's military budget was enough to eradicate smallpox. That was a magnificent thing. We can eliminate all the disease and all the bad things in the world today. </PARA>
<PARA> As my time is limited, I must get back to the necessity of doing something about eliminating war. I believe that politicians will not be the ones who will stop war. Given what has happened in the past, I do not believe that we can really trust the politicians of this world to stop war. There will always be some excuse for them to wave the flag and beat the drum. The United Nations, churches or organisations such as that are not capable of stopping war. Even though they try in good faith, I do not believe it is possible for them to do so . The masses of people throughout this world are the only ones capable of bringing some sense to the politicians and the leaders of this world. It is only when the people take to the streets-not only in this country but also in every other country-and demand peace that a better world will be brought about. </PARA>
<PARA> I was amazed to read what Mr Fraser said when he was away. He launched a scathing attack on the international peace movement. He criticised churches and women's groups supporting recent big anti-nuclear protests. This will be going on. Anyone who really believes in peace will be called a communist, a betrayer of his country, disloyal, and all the other bad terms. In countries which have dictatorships, people will be gaoled, bashed and shot. But I believe that people in all types of countries will take to the streets and demand peace, under whatever type of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Much suffering will be caused. I believe that the Vietnam war was stopped because of people. This mad race to destruction by the world's powers, building bigger and better bombs, can be stopped only by people. I believe that the people of the world will stop this. I encourage people to do that. It is the only way in which we can survive. There is no other way that mankind can continue. We have left it to politicians and organisations for far too long. I believe that the people will have their say, and that we shall have a better world in which to live. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I should like to use the opportunity presented by this first reading debate ro raise a voice of caution and of moderation in the emotional argument that is raging at present over the Falkland Islands with respect to equipment for the Australian defence forces. I certainly caution the Government on making an ad hoc reaction with respect to any major equipment purchases at present, particularly in responding to the intemperate claims by some of the past admirals who have been so vocal in the Press this week, with their calls for two or three carriers and an unbalanced force structure of that nature. It is rather as if we are moving back 20 or 30 years, instead of looking at the next 20 years, when the major equipment that we are buying now will be employed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The argument is not on the level that something might be useful; it is on a matter of priority. We have limited resources in Australia. What we want in the defence forces of Australia, as I have said repeatedly in this chamber, is a deterrent capacity in the first instance and a capacity to provide for a flexible response to a wide variety of situations in which we may become involved and which we cannot foresee in detail at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument at present largely turns about HMS Invincible, or HMAS Australia as it will be in a few months time. I support both the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) when they make their statements regarding the use of this ship in Australian service as an anti- submarine platform. One can make a cogent case for the ship in that role. But it is an entirely different matter to be looking at fixed-wing aircraft and to move down the line of a major equipment involvement in amphibious warfare on the grounds of a wildly stated argument. The case must be developed, and there is a long way to go yet before the case is proven. </PARA>
<PARA> While on the subject of wild arguments, I am curious about the way in which the Australian Labor Party has suddenly discovered defence. After all these years, from the time under the tree of knowledge in Barcaldine, it has now discovered that defence is an issue. During the four years in which I have been in this chamber, I cannot recall one respectable or responsible speech from the Labor Party, in either House, on this subject. The only advice that I would give Mr Hayden for his next Press conference is that it is not a matter of saying to the Australian people what the ALP will do if it ever gets into government. The task for the Labor Party is to take some advice from the professionals in Australia and around the world, not to dream up a few policies in Caucus and then run matters that seem to have some support in the Press at the time. It is quite a serious business, and it is far more complex than the Labor Party realises. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move back to the lessons of the Falkland Islands war. It is impossible for us yet to be able to look in any way at those in any completeness. The point I make this afternoon is that the lessons that we learn from that relate to weapons technology, not to geography. Yet so many people, some of them quite mature and experienced, have fallen into the trap of seeing the Falkland Islands war in relation to geography. They see it as being the next war that Australia will fight, or something similar to that, and from there they move on to seeing that we need exactly the same equipment as is required for the Falklands Islands operation. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is no more true for Australia to draw parallels out of the operations in the Falkland Islands, in one sense, than it is to say that Vietnam presaged the Falkland Islands war or that Korea presaged what happened in the Malaysian Emergency. Let us learn the immediate lessons from the Falkland Islands. There are a few which need to be reinforced now. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that Australia has island responsibilities. One can think of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, and the many islands in the South West Pacific area in which we have essential interests. But the important point is that our involvement there is quite different from Britain's involvement in the Falkland Islands in a whole variety of ways. The distances involved, though considerable, are considerably less than the distance of Port Stanley from London. The climatic conditions are different, and the whole political and military environment is quite different in the Pacific region from what is in the Falkland Islands. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look quickly at the Cocos Islands. To me, there is probably no more important Australian possession than the Cocos Islands. It is very important to us from a defence point of view in relation to the Indian Ocean and to all our trade from Europe. If the Cocos Islands were threatened, would we really round up crews in Sydney, take three or four days to get some ships together, sail around the Australian coast and into the Indian Ocean-probably taking at least 10 days from the time that they slipped in Sydney-and then try an opposed landing? It took the British over seven weeks before they were in a position to do that in the Falklands. I wonder how many more weeks it would take us to mount a similar operation in the Cocos Islands. Of course we shall not do that. </PARA>
<PARA> My hope is that, if faced with a threat to the Cocos Islands, our intelligence services would be good enough to advise us in advance. When something was brewing, we could move in an element of the rapid deployment force from Townsville, maybe at brigade strength, and get the men on the ground in possession in advance of any trouble arising. It is possible by air movement to do the whole thing within 20 hours at the outside. If the runway on Cocos is seized, that just illustrates the importance to Australia of having a parachute brigade, which we do not have at present. This is something that we could have at very low cost, because some infantry battalions could be converted, maintained and equipped as parachute battalions at a cost of $2m a year per unit . Compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars involved in more sophisticated transport or fighting vehicles, for both the air force and the navy, that is a very cheap and very flexible weapons system. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the point that prevention in these cases is very much better than cure, and not only prevention but also a reaction time is essential, because it saves both lives and money. I have no idea what the cost of the Falkland Islands operation is, but it is reported in today's Press that the Royal Navy now has 100 ships on station around the Falkland Islands. Taking a very conservative figure of $100m per ship, that is $10 billion, in ships, around those islands. Add to that the equipment with them and one has probably a figure of about $15 billion. That is a sum that Australia cannot afford. Putting it in perspective, the sort of force with which we might be faced, if the Cocos Islands were taken, could well number 4,000 or 5,000 men, the same force structure numerically as is in the Falkland Islands. Quite obviously, it would be beyond Australia to mount an operation that cost $10 billion or $15 billion on equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> One other great lesson that comes out of the Falkland Islands operation relates to a point that I have made repeatedly over the years in which I have been in this chamber. That is that we have been living for years in a missile age. In the past I have spoken-I shall not go into the subject in detail now-of the inability of the Royal Australian Navy to appreciate fully the potentialities of missile technology. The simple fact is that the initiative lies strongly with the attacker at present. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Falklands Islands, it is premature to judge the missile war there. I must take this public opportunity to say that I have been misled insofar as the appreciations I have made, even though they were made very sanguinely, of the Royal Navy's missile capability. I really did believe it had a higher capability in the surface-to-air missile role than it seems to have; but we do not know the full story yet. One of the things that we do not know is whether those ships were fitted out with the weapons that they were designed to have. I have a suspicion that quite a large number of the ships that were lost were not fitted out in the way the designers intended them to be. If that is true, it is quite inexcusable. I think the proposition that Royal Navy ships and Royal Australian Navy ships be crewed with admirals, public servants and politicians is an excellent one. </PARA>
<PARA> There may also be inherent design limitations in the missile systems that the ships in the Falklands war have. It is one thing to test systems on the range. It is totally different to test them in operational conditions at war. Local conditions such as the environment, temperature and even the disposition of the ships themselves in a constricted waterway such as there is in the Falklands could have operated against the detection of incoming aircraft and the operational mode of the weapons. But they are all matters for a future debate and I do not wish to canvass them now. </PARA>
<PARA> The immediate lesson for us is the vulnerability of high value targets to missiles. It is absolutely irrelevant whether those targets are on land or at sea. In the Falklands dispute they happen to be at sea but they could just as well be on land. The Royal Navy has paid a tragic price in the Falklands, having lost at least five ships. Even if we accept the Royal Navy's figure of 50 or 60 Argentinian aircraft destroyed, it must be remembered that they are all old aircraft with only one pilot in each. I assume that the Royal Navy lost in one ship as many men as the whole of the Argentinian Air Force lost, without getting involved in an argument about the relative capital cost involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The final immediate lesson we draw from the operations in the Falklands in an immediate sense is the unpredictability of it all. We cannot foresee when our defence forces will be required. We must have an instant response capability, and that is particularly relevant to Australia because of our isolated geographic position. The full story has yet to be told. I do not doubt that many complex lessons are to be learned from it. But let us learn those immediate lessons that I have been talking about and for the longer term let us get our priorities right with respect to major equipment purchases bearing in mind the full story which will come out at a later date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to use this first reading debate to speak on the state of the economy because, like many other Australians , I am concerned at the direction in which the Fraser Government's economic policies are taking this country. More importantly, I am concerned at the effect these policies are having on the tax paying wage and salary earners of Australia and the lack of compassion being shown by Ministers of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the last nine months we have witnessed a massive slowing down of the Australian economy; so much so that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) had to revise the Budget's growth rate estimate from 3 1/2 per cent to somewhere between 2 per cent and 2 1/2 per cent. This recession which is gripping Australia is illustrated quite clearly by the latest production figures. Raw steel production is down by 15 1/2 per cent, pig iron production is down by 12 1/2 per cent and clay brick production is down by 9.4 per cent over the levels achieved in 1981. Even the Metal Trades Industry Association has predicted that 1982 and 1983 will be difficult years for the metal and engineering industries, as a direct result of lower levels of investment in those industries. In addition, we have recently seen the gloomy predictions of organisations like the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Bank of New South Wales and the National Bank of Australasia. Surveys conducted by these organisations have not only confirmed the severe downturn which has occurred in the Australian manufacturing sector but also they have revealed a tremendous amount of pessimism about the period ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this Government has chosen to blame everything on the international economic scene and refuses to admit that its policies are in any way to blame. And yet, these are the very same people who said in 1975 that it was not good enough to put all the blame for the economic slowdown at that time on the international oil crisis which occurred in 1974. Another important indicator of the state of the economy is the level of retail sales, which is now increasing at a rate less than the rate of inflation. In other words, the real level of retail sales is declining as a direct result of this Goverment's economic policies. The reason for this is simply that ordinary Australians are just not able to cope with their day to day living expenses, which have snowballed in the last 18 months. Higher interest rates, higher State charges, higher local government rates, higher health insurance costs and higher sales taxes on a whole range of items have taken money out of the pockets and purses of 90 per cent of Australians. All this is a direct result of the restrictive monetary policies of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Now let us look at the logic, or should I say lack of it, behind these policies . As Mr Howard has told us so many times and as Senator Messner reminded us recently, this Government believes that the only way to cure inflation is to restrict the growth of the money supply. In other words, what it is saying is that the only way of curing inflation is to increase the level of unemployment because, let there be no mistake about it, this is what restricting the money supply is all about. That is why Great Britain under its warmonger Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, now has record unemployment and that is why unemployment in the United States of America under the command of its second rate ex-movie star President, Mr Reagan, has reached over 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week, the Australian Bureau of Statisatics revealed that over one million Australians are now out of work. This consists of the 435,000 who are listed as officially unemployed and the other 619,000 people who the Bureau says want a job but have given up all hope of ever finding one. In other words, the true unemployment rate is somewhere around 16 per cent. The fact that official unemployment is now running at a level much higher than for the same period last year is due in no small way to the Fraser Government's economic policies. The way things are shaping up, I would not be surprised if we had an official unemployment rate in excess of 8 per cent or even as high as 9 per cent by February of next year with the actual rate, including the hidden unemployed, around 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all this, the Government has not been able to reduce the rate of inflation very significantly at all. In fact, inflation has already burst back into double figures and it is approaching the 12 per cent mark largely because of the pressure of higher taxation and government induced price increases. So much for sound economic management, but I suppose this is the sort of thing we can expect from a man who says that you do not have to practice economics to be a Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's miserable record of economic management is perhaps best illustrated by measuring its achievements against the promises it made at the last election. In 1980, the Fraser Government promised to provide jobs for all, to reduce interest rates, reduce the tax burden, reduce inflation and maintain wage indexation. The facts are that since 1980, unemployment has increased, interest rates have increased, taxes, both direct and indirect, have increased, the inflation rate has increased and wage indexation has been abandoned. So much for Mr Fraser's election promises. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of all this has been that the ordinary working men and women of Australia are now struggling for survival and many have been forced to sell their homes because of the sky-rocketing cost of house mortgage repayments. Many others have just given up hope of ever owning their own home or even saving up enough money for a deposit on one. What's more, many families have had to stop buying meat and other food items which have now become luxuries for many households. One of the reasons this has happened of course is that personal income taxes have increased by over 22 per cent in the last 12 months. At the same time, the richest 10 per cent of the population, the millionaire friends of Mr Fraser and his Ministry, together with many large multinational corporations, are evading tax to the tune of $7,000m a year. The ordinary law-abiding taxpayers of this country are absolutely sick and tired of having to support these rich criminals. They simply cannot go on carrying this burden and paying out all of their salaries on day to day living costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very clear that the Ministers of this Government have absolutely no idea of what it is like to be forced to struggle for daily existence. They have no compassion at all for the plight of ordinary working and middle class Australians. This came across loud and clear last week when Senator Messner presented the Government's argument on the Supply Bills. This Government has the audacity to criticise trade unions for seeking higher wages for their members, while it never says a thing about the massive increases in the salaries of executives, doctors and lawyers, not to mention politicians! Who can blame workers for wanting more money in the present economic climate? Who can blame the 25 per cent of workers who have not had a pay increase since the end of wage indexation for wanting a pay increase? The fact is that unless something positive is done soon we will face massive social upheaval and unrest in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to stop the likes of Fraser, Howard and Stone from ruining the economy and lowering the living standards of ordinary Australians. All is not all right as Senator Messner tried to tell us last week. It is a fact that the Fraser Government's economic policies have caused a massive increase in unemployment and a huge increase in the incidence of poverty in Australia. They have also caused a massive increase in the tax burden on those Australians lucky enough to have jobs and high interest rates have killed off the housing industry in this country and ruined the dream of many Australian families. This Government's economic policies have increased the gap between the rich and poor and day by day an increasing number of concerned Australians are learning not to trust this tired old Government with its tired old Ministers, saying the same tired old things. It is about time the Ministers of this Government stopped tripping overseas and visited some ordinary suburban homes in Australia and saw at first hand how people are struggling. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of things need to be done if we are to get rid of the excessive levels of unemployment, poverty and financial hardship in the community. Firstly, the Government must immediately provide income tax cuts to ease the strain on wage and salary earners and in so doing give a much needed boost to retail sales. This sort of stimulus could flow through the economy and help revitalise our ailing manufacturing industries. It needs to be a significant and lasting reduction in taxes and not just a carrot to be dangled in front of people as an election gimmick, as we have seen in the past. In addition to this, the Government should provide a boost in public works programs, which could also help to stimulate activity in the private sector, particularly in the building and construction sector which is at such a low ebb in most parts of Australia. At the same time there needs to be an easing of the money supply so that interest rates can be brought back to more reasonable levels. This would not only stimulate the home building industry but ease the financial burden for thousands of Australian home buyers. As a result of this there would be an added boost to retail sales with the resultant stimulus flowing through the economy and providing more employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we urgently need a return to a centralised wage fixing system so that some order can be brought back into the industrial relations scene. It is a fact that since wage indexation was abolished industrial disputation has increased dramatically. Between August and November 1981, 2.02 million working days were lost due to industrial disputes compared to 1.04 million for the same period in 1980. That is an increase of 100 per cent. The absence of a centralised wage fixing system has quite clearly created a more turbulent industrial relations climate. This free-for-all situation that has developed since July 1981 has severely disadvantaged those workers who belong to the less powerful unions and created a lot of unnecessary hardship and ill feeling in the community. These measures that I have just outlined may not solve all our problems but at least they would help get the economy back on the rails. They would certainly go a lot closer to revitalising the Australian economy than the present Government's policies ever will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to urge upon the Government reform of what is commonly called double taxation of dividends. I am not the first to urge reform in this area. Advice was given to the Government by the Asprey Taxation Review Committee in 1975 which, unfortunately, was not accepted. More recently, advice was given by the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System which reported in September last year. That advice recommended reform, which advice has not yet been accepted. In the Budget planning context I think it is time, again, to urge reform in this particularly important area. I was heartened when, on 26 August last year, the Australian reported that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) had hinted to the Australian Institute of Directors that double taxation of dividends would soon be abolished. The report stated that Mr Howard was expected to make the move once the Campbell inquiry had reported. The report continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . it is not known which way the inquiry will jump on the issue, but if a recommendation to abolish is not forthcoming it is thought the Government will act independently. </PARA>
<PARA>It is, of course, now history that the Government does not have to act independently, but has the solace of being able to lean upon the most comprehensive report into the Australian financial system yet carried out. Demands for reform in this area of taxation have been forthcoming for a long time. They have come from the stock exchanges and from such organisations as the Australian Industries Development Association, from business and from academics. Australia has what is referred to in the literature as the classical system of company taxation, that is, the corporation and its shareholders are treated as separate entities for taxation purposes. Corporations are taxed at the flat rate , now 46 per cent, on their income whether distributed or not. That part of the income, so taxed, when distributed to shareholders as, say, dividends, is again taxed in the hands of the recipient at the recipient's marginal rate. Thus, the distributed income is said to have been taxed twice. </PARA>
<PARA> Arguments against the classical system of company taxation are that it is logically indefensible, that it creates both horizontal and vertical inequities, that it is non-neutral or, as Asprey says, it is inefficient in that it distorts the allocation of investment between the corporate sector and the non-corporate sector, that it encourages corporations to rely too heavily on debt financing and to retain too great a share of net corporate income and, finally, that it depresses the nation's rate of capital accumulation and economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary briefly to examine these criticisms. The argument that the classical system is logically indefensible arises from the view that, for taxation purposes at least, a corporation is a form of entity through which income is earned by shareholders in the form of dividends or retained earnings. In the American terminology, the corporation is a conduit through which earnings pass on their way to shareholders-what they refer to as the 'conduit theory'. As was said by Campbell: 'Ultimately all taxes fall on individuals'. Therefore, whilst the corporation may be a separate legal entity for some purposes, there is no sound reason why it should be so for taxation purposes. As was said by the Asprey Committee, it is necessary to go behind the veil of separate legal personality which the company enjoys and translate the tax formerly imposed on company income into a set of individual tax 'burdens'. Certainly when one assesses the impact of so-called double tax it is necessary to determine the total tax on the particular source of income-that is, aggregate corporation tax plus the personal tax on distributions. Why not then integrate for the purpose of assessing the tax?</PARA>
<PARA> The second and most important criticism is that of inequity. The system as we have it does not provide horizontal equity in that two persons with the same income may not necessarily pay the same tax. Persons paying marginal tax of 46 per cent or less will nearly always bear an effective combined company personal income tax rate higher than their marginal income tax rate. So two persons receiving the same income-say, one from a corporate investment and one from a partnership investment-may not pay the same tax from the fruits of their investment. It fails also on the ground of vertical equity in that, as incomes rise, the recipient does not pay directly proportionally more tax. Asprey found that the system 'substantially defeats the general progressivity of the income tax'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Campbell Committee more recently found that the degree of over-taxation- that over the marginal rate-diminishes as the shareholder's income rises. To the extent that progressivity lessens the system becomes regressive. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table from the Campbell report showing excess tax payable by shareholders under the present classical system of corporation tax at various salary levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The third criticism of our current system is that of its non-neutrality and in particular that it distorts the allocation of investment between the corporate sector and the non-corporate sector. An accepted objective of taxation policy is that the form in which a business is operated should not be influenced by taxation consequences. As was stated by Asprey the over-taxation of the profit entitlement of shareholders creates a bias against their doing business in corporate form, although the under-taxation of other shareholders creates the opposite bias. The bias against lower income investors in equity investments, and the declining presence of the individual in the equity market, is not regarded by the stock exchanges and others as a coincidence, it being suggested that taxation factors have influenced the trend. It is said that now only 4 per cent of Australians directly own equity shares. Campbell considers it important that all sectors of the community be given equal encouragement to participate directly as equity holders in companies and accepted that the system has discouraged low income investors from that direct participation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further, under the head of non-neutrality it is said that the classical system encourages corporations to rely too heavily on debt financing in that, in determining the taxation income of the company, interest on monies borrowed may be deducted but not for dividends paid on equity capital. As was recognised by Campbell, it may also give companies an incentive to adopt higher gearing ratios than might otherwise be deemed appropriate, at times exposing such companies to greater financial risk. To some extent, and in balance, is the bias in favour of retaining earnings, as undistributed profits will attract less tax. This in itself is an additional example of the non- neutrality of the classical system. I know it can be said that larger retained profit might normally be associated with greater ability to carry out investment programs; but, on the other hand, economists will argue that it is particularly important to encourage profitable investment rather than any investment. Therefore, finance should be made to flow towards those companies which are most profitable-that is often those which are able to pay highest dividends. This is distorted negatively by a lack of a capital tax and positively by Division 7 tax on underdistribution by private companies. With these various distortions and conflicting economic principles, it is not therefore surprising that Asprey concluded that neutrality is the best practical test. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, and somewhat encompassing the previous mentioned criticisms, it is said that the system depresses the nation's rate of capital accumulation and economic growth. As was stated in a paper 'Reform of the Corporation Tax' by Geoffrey Board: 'Investors in general decide where to invest their capital on the basis of after tax rates of return'. Because the overall burden of taxation is higher on capital income generated in the corporate sector, investors are induced to allocate their capital to non-corporate areas. Also the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges argue that the combined effects of high company tax and high rates of personal income tax with no relief for company tax paid have turned the individual investor away from the equity market to other forms of investment such as property and fixed interest securities which enjoy more favourable tax treatment. They argue that this lack of neutrality in the present tax structure has thus further undermined interest in the share market, the level of share prices, the liquidity and efficiency of the market, and the ability of companies to raise new equity funds. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore not surprising that the call for reform in the area is almost unanimous. The call is for closer integration between the tax liability of companies and their shareholders. No significant change in the taxation system can be implemented without some pain. The inertia against significant change in the system is enormous as was witnessed in the indirect tax debate last year. To talk simply of a value added tax or a retail sales tax let alone a general expenditure tax seems to send shudders up the bureacratic spine which regrettably sometimes are adopted by its political masters. Nevertheless, in this instance, government has the advice of Asprey, the advice of Campbell and the experience of the many countries throughout the world that have now implemented at least partial integration of corporate and individual tax. There would appear to be little justification for Australia to continue to lag behind.</PARA>
<PARA> There are two accepted methods of achieving the objective. The first is the split rate system where an allowance is made at the company level. In other words, distributed profits are taxed at a lower rate than retained profits. Some countries to adopt such a method include Austria, Finland, West Germany, Japan and Norway. The second is the imputation method where allowance is made at the shareholder level for company tax on distributed profits. The shareholder receives credit for part of the corporation tax paid on distributed profits which is levied at the same rate as on retained profits. This system has been adopted in varying forms in France, Ireland, Italy, United Kingdom, Belgium, Canada and Turkey. Asprey recommended a system of partial imputation not dissimilar to that in operation in Canada. At the time of the report, the Canadian system was that an individual shareholder was entitled to a tax credit of one-third-now I believe one-half-of a dividend received. </PARA>
<PARA> Asprey recognised also that, in the longer term, there was a need to go to a more complicated system such as that in existence in the United Kingdom. From 1973, the United Kingdom imputation system provided for a higher rate of corporate tax but that distribution to basic rate taxpayers would not cause extra tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Campbell has been much more ambitious. The Campbell committee has recommended that the Government should work towards the introduction of a system of full integration of company and personal tax. No country has yet proceeded as far as full integration although to recommend it is not new. In 1966 the Carter Commission in Canada recommended full integration, as did the Mead Committee in the United Kingdom in 1978. Campbell suggests that an administratively suitable scheme could involve tax being collected from companies at the corporate tax rate and credited against the personal tax liability of shareholders, whose taxation income would include the share of the pre-tax income of the company, that is, the share of both dividends received, and retained earnings grossed up to include the tax withheld by the company. </PARA>
<PARA> Implementation of such a scheme would impose significant challenges. It must be stressed, however, that the proposal is not novel. The trend clearly is towards integration. When one looks at the partly integrated systems of France, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Canada and others and reads various academic reports that have recommended it, there is much comfort in saying that now is the time for change. Australia's corporate tax system was introduced in 1940 as a war time revenue measure. It is now in need of reform. There is no better time to introduce that reform than in the forthcoming Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A comprehensive debate on housing and housing finance took place earlier today in the Senate but I would like to refer to those who can neither 'borrowers nor lenders be' but who are totally dependent upon the Western Australian State Government for housing. I refer to homeless Aboriginal families in crisis in Western Australia. Some of these families are in dire need. They are priority cases and they are acknowledged to be so by the State housing authorities. Many of these families have waited for months and are still waiting for housing. I have been assured by people who are knowledgeable in the field of emergency housing in Western Australia-this is the the disgraceful and repugnant aspect of the problem-that non-Aboriginal families with similar case histories would have been accommodated long ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to refer to four examples from the many of which I am aware. I refer to the case of Elizabeth Jackamarra on whose behalf I approached the State Minister for Housing last year. Many of my colleagues in the State had already approached the Minister for Housing on her behalf. She has two small children. One is a toddler whom she has with her and the other is a four-year old child who is fostered. This woman has no home for herself and her children and, as is customary in Western Australia, a child has been taken away from her and will not be returned until she has a home. Elizabeth lives with another family which has four children. Rose Shaw, another supporting mother with two children, lives in the same house. Her children periodically are institutionalised and frequently have to attend hospital. Her estranged husband visits and creates disturbances at regular intervals. Many letters from the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children support this woman's plea for housing. Both of those women live in a home at Innaloo. That particular home now is a shelter for three families comprising four adults and seven children. The people who are the nominal renters of the home are frightened of eviction. They will be evicted because of overcrowding. Eviction notices have been served in similar circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example is the case of Mr Quentin Colbung who lives at Mount Barker with his wife and three children. He has been sick and is unemployed. He has fallen into rental arrears and has been evicted from his side of a duplex house. He has moved in next door, to the other side of the duplex, with his aged parents, both of whom are sick. One is an epileptic and one has suffered from tuberculosis. That part of the duplex is now overcrowded and all are being threatened with eviction, despite the fact that the side of the house in which the Colbung juniors originally lived is still vacant. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the case of Mrs Barbara Taylor who lives at Wundowie, a country town approximately 50 miles east of Perth. She has been threatened with eviction because she is housing her cousins, the Garletts and their four children. Mr Garlett has been unemployed and has been listed by the State Housing Commission for emergency accommodation since November 1981. Mrs Taylor has five children of her own. Her children of school age are attending the Wundowie school at present . Wundowie is a country town which recently experienced the failure of a major local industry. This has meant an exodus of many residents who have sought employment elsewhere. This means that there are many houses vacant in the town, one of which could surely be utilised to house the Garletts. If Mrs Taylor is evicted-this is what she fears will happen-she will go to live with her sister who lives in Perth in a two-bedroom State Housing Commission home. Of course, her sister will then be liable to be threatened with eviction because of overcrowding. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of families in Western Australia on the Aboriginal housing list was 700 in October 1981. No building program is in existence and the number of people on that list must have increased since then. There has been no significant increase in the welfare rental housing stock in Western Australia over the last couple of years. The insecurity of these families and the fact that they have to move from one relative to another has very severe implications for their health and for their children's education. The incidence of learning difficulties and of minor and major illnesses is compounded by the housing problem. As they move from one school to another the educational chances of the children are jeopardised. </PARA>
<PARA> Representations have been made repeatedly to the State Minister for Housing by Federal and State politicians on behalf of these people and other people in the same position. The response, in some cases, has been to list people for emergency housing. We have found that six months later they still have not been housed. In October last year, in desperation, the social work department of the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council wrote to the Commissioner for Community Relations and detailed 12 such cases. The matter has been taken up by the Commissioner with the State Minister. The result has been that action has been held up on some eviction notices which had been issued but the people concerned have no idea of the State Government's intentions. A letter from the social work department of the Trades and Labour Council to the Commissioner for Community Relations stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As well, the involvement of the Minister for Housing, the State Ombudsman and the Consultative Committee on Racial Discrimination was often sought. Our Office has been informed that submissions to the State Ombudsman are the only means by which decisions of the Commission can be reviewed-and yet there has been a failure by the Ombudsman to take up the issues such as (i) listing families with the A.H.B. (ii) the 'saturation' policy which prevents the housing of more than 2 Aboriginal families to a block of flats (iii) the policy of approaching Shire Councils before a housing allocation is made to an Aboriginal family to check whether the neighbours on both sides are purchasing homes (iv) the A.H.B. do not control any flat accommodation. It is our understanding that these policies are Cabinet directives, and that while the officers of the State Housing Commission are generally sympathetic to families, they are bound to carry out these racist directives, however reluctantly. The denial of access to the Commonwealth-State funded programmes has been combined with the rundown of the building programs of A.H.B. houses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Housing Board, because of the lack of resources, have stated that they cannot meet emergency requirements, and yet families in the most urgent need,-</PARA>
<PARA>Families such as those to which I have referred-</PARA>
<PARA>often unemployed, with sick and often institutionalized children are referred by the Commission to the Board for accommodation, which at present numbers on the lists means that they must wait years, if they are to be accommodated at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Staff of the Aboriginal Housing Board and officers of the State Housing Commission are generally accessible and sympathetic to the plight of these families. However, the policies laid down by the Cabinet restrict their flexibility in housing families in crisis situations. </PARA>
<PARA>The State Minister has responded on various occasions and has said that all those people to whom I have referred have been housed before. That is not so. Some of them were housed until their families broke up. In the event of two Aboriginal parents in Western Australia separating, their children are removed to institutions or to foster homes. Families are not reunited until the mothers are housed. Mothers are not housed unless they have their children with them. This is a classic Catch-22 situation. Despite its best efforts, the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations has yet to receive any indication from Western Australia that the housing problems of these families are on the way to resolution. A 1981 report from the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations entitled 'Discrimination against Aboriginals in Western Australia' gives examples of the attitude of the Western Australian Government to discrimination on the ground of race. Page 8 of that report states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Western Australian Government has adopted a position of non- cooperation with the Commissioner for Community Relations that has called into question the applicability of Commonwealth law to Western Australia. In a letter dated 23 May 1980 the Hon. W. R. B. Hassel wrote to the Commissioner for Community Relations:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Government of the State of Western Australia is not a matter over which you have, or ought to have, the slightest jurisdiction' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Quite apart from its intransigence and its racially biased housing policies, the Western Australian Government shows itself again to the nation and to the world as harsh, punitive and lacking in compassion. We in Western Australia endlessly hear about Aboriginal family inadequacy and about delinquency and alcoholism. On the other hand we also hear about the need for people to be responsible for their own health and well-being. Such high-sounding sentiments are pious and platitudinous coming from those who have in it their power to provide such a basic essential as adequate housing and who decline to do so on the basis of the colour of the skin of the client. The Western Australian Government should be urged to review immediately its Aboriginal housing policies. It should be provided with sufficient funds from Commonwealth sources, to the point at which there is simply no excuse for denying housing to anybody in need. Another publication of the Commissioner for Community Relations, dated November/January 1982, states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of any positive action by the State government in Western Australia there is an urgent need to develop the educational aspect of complaint handling work. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the development of the educational aspect should start with the State Cabinet. </PARA>

<PARA>OFF-SHORE INSTALLATIONS (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the main part of a package of Bills to extend taxing and control laws to rigs used in exploring or exploiting the non-living natural resources of the seabed of Australia's continental shelf. </PARA>
<PARA> The package includes provisions extending the control and taxing aspects of customs, excise and sales tax Acts and the controls available under immigration and quarantine laws. </PARA>
<PARA> For Constitutional reasons, amendments proposed to be made to the various taxing Acts will be the subject of separate Bills in the package. Certain collection and control provisions associated with those taxing provisions are, however, included in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Senators, it has been the Government's long-standing policy that the treatment to be accorded these off-shore activities should be no different, in principle, from the treatment accorded similar resources ventures being undertaken within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The petroleum exploration and recovery activities taking place in Bass Strait and elsewhere around Australia for upwards of 15 years have been governed by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. In that period, the only extension to off- shore activities of Commonwealth law outside the ambit of that Act was the application in 1968 of relevant income tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures have now become necessary as a result of developments on the north-west shelf of Western Australia. The previous practice was for all overseas sourced rigs, ships, equipment and materials for the off-shore operations to be imported in the normal way through Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA> The massive scale of the north-west shelf developments, however, requires that a number of giant platforms be brought direct to the places on the shelf at which they are to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> During the operation of the rigs there will necessarily be a constant flow of service craft, personnel and goods between the installations and the Australian mainland. There may be occasional movement between places overseas and an installation once attached. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that these important activities should not provide an avenue for the entry into Australia of prohibited imports such as drugs, of exotic diseases or of illegal immigrants. The Government attaches considerable importance to the maintenance of Australia's security in matters of customs, quarantine and immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> The package of Bills provides a proper legislative basis for the exercise of customs, excise, immigration and quarantine powers to remove any degree of danger of illicit activities at these remote sites. The powers are necessary both for the arrival of those installations and for subsequent contacts between the installations and places overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the amendments proposed by the Bill, a person wishing to bring an installation direct from overseas to its operating site will be required to obtain prior permission. </PARA>
<PARA> Where permission is granted it will be subject to the applicant's compliance with specified conditions. The conditions will ensure that the arrival of the installation and its attachment will be supervised by officers until customs, immigration and quarantine clearance is given. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, these Bills provide that installations attached to the Australian seabed will be deemed to be places in Australia. However the amendments to the Quarantine Act provide that an overseas installation shall be deemed to be part of Australia on attachment only if it has previously been given pratique. This will only be given if the Quarantine Officer on his prior inspection is satisfied that it is disease free. </PARA>
<PARA> By the device of treating installations as part of Australia, movement between the Australian mainland and installations which have been attached and cleared may be allowed to proceed without substantial hindrance. However quarantine controls may, if necessary, also be applied to this movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Contact between an attached installation and places overseas will be controlled . This means that anything which comes from overseas for delivery to an installation must first enter Australia through a first port of entry. At first ports of entry there are adequate facilities for the customs, immigration and quarantine examination of vessels and goods which would not generally be available at installations. Goods that are found to be a health risk can be treated or destroyed and prohibited imports can be seized. </PARA>
<PARA> The customs and quarantine amendments provide for goods from overseas to be permitted to be brought directly to an installation. This discretion is considered desirable to permit the operator of an installation to obtain goods quickly from overseas. Such goods might be mechanical parts which may be necessary to repair some equipment and which would not usually present a customs or health risk. The discretion will be used sparingly and as a general rule vessels will be required to first call at normal ports of entry. </PARA>
<PARA> The discretionary arrangements if used may present some risks of avoidance of controls. Accordingly, the Bill proposes provisions to give officers powers and functions that are, in respect of off-shore installations, equivalent to those now given to them by existing legislation in respect of vessels, goods and persons at points of entry into, or exit from, Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Powers under the Immigration (Unauthorised Arrivals) Act 1980 now apply to certain ships when they enter Australian waters and to certain aircraft when they land in Australia. For the purposes of that Act, 'Australian waters' do not extend beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea. The powers under that Act will be extended to those ships when brought to an Australian installation outside Australian waters, as so defined, and to those aircraft that land at any Australian installation. </PARA>
<PARA> The powers I have mentioned include the power to board installations and search or examine them for goods on board for customs, immigration or quarantine purposes. If, for example, there are any goods on board which could carry disease to mainland Australia, these may be ordered into quarantine and treated or destroyed as appropriate. Prohibited imports may also be seized and customs control exercised over dutiable goods on board. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also necessary to ensure that there is proper authority for the application of the taxing provisions of customs, excise and sales tax law. This will be achieved by further Bills in this package. </PARA>
<PARA> A very important result of applying the customs laws to these operations will be the legislative protection of the right of Australian industry to share in the development opportunities to the same extent as now applies in relation to undertakings within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The granting of concessional by-laws in respect of equipment and materials manufactured outside Australia for use with off-shore installations will be dependent on suitable equivalent goods of Australian manufacture not being reasonably available. </PARA>
<PARA> By Parts VIII and IX of this Bill, which will amend Sales Tax Assessment Acts ( Nos. 1 and 5) 1930, together with a group of sales tax Bills that I will introduce shortly, it is also proposed to extend the application of the sales tax law to off-shore installations of the kind that I have earlier described. </PARA>
<PARA> In practice, the sales tax law in respect of the importation of goods is closely associated with the customs law. </PARA>
<PARA> Administrative efficiency in the collection of sales tax on importation of goods is achieved by giving a Collector of Customs power to collect sales tax at the same time as customs duty is collected. </PARA>
<PARA> Parts VIII and IX and the associated sales tax Bills will amend the sales tax law in conformity with the proposed amendments of the customs law, thereby achieving desirable uniformity in the application of these laws to off-shore installations and removing the scope for anomalies which could exist if the two laws operated differently. The amendments to both laws will have a common date of commencement. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (OFF-SHORE INSTALLATIONS) BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1966 as part of the package of Bills proposing extension of the Commonwealth taxing and control powers to off-shore operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes that an overseas installation, and goods on board, shall be deemed to be imported when the installation is attached to the Australian seabed . Where such an installation is first brought to a place in Australia from which it is to be taken for attachment to the seabed, the installation and goods on board are to be taken as imported on arrival of the installation at that place. </PARA>
<PARA> Goods brought direct from overseas on an installation are also to be deemed to be imported on their arrival. Likewise, goods taken from an installation to a place overseas are to be deemed to have been exported. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes amendments to the Principal Act to identify when an installation is imported. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>CUSTOMS TARIFF (ANTI-DUMPING) AMENDMENT (OFF-SHORE INSTALLATIONS) BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is part of the package of Bills proposing extension of the Commonwealth's taxing and control powers to off-shore operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 to ensure that an overseas installation that is attached to the Australian seabed, goods that are brought with an installation and goods subsequently brought direct from overseas to such an installation, receive the same treatment as regard anti-dumping measures as is accorded to equipment or goods imported into Australia in the normal way. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (OFF-SHORE INSTALLATIONS) BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is part of the package of Bills proposing extension of the Commonwealth's taxing and control powers to off-shore operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to extend the application of that Act to the production of excisable products at off-shore installations. </PARA>
<PARA> Under existing legislation petroleum products produced from off-shore wells are regarded as coming within the ambit of the Excise Acts when the product is brought to a shore-based installation at which subsequent processes are performed. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed provisions will not result in variation of any present liability to excise duty. They, taken with a complementary amendment to the Excise Act 1901, will authorize excise officers to have access to installations and to examine processes and recording systems. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX AMENDMENT (OFF-SHORE INSTALLATIONS) BILLS (Nos 1 to 9) 1982</PARA>
<PARA> These Bills are a further part of the package of Bills to extend the application of certain controls and taxation measures to off-shore installations . </PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax Acts do not currently impose tax on transactions or acts involving goods which are outside geographical Australia but within the area of the continental shelf. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures proposed by these Bills, together with the associated measures contained in other Bills in this package, will have the effect that any off- shore installation will be given, from the date of its attachment to the continental shelf, the status of a place in Australia. This will mean that any transaction or act affecting goods on such an installation which would be taxable if the goods were in geographical Australia will, in future, also be taxable. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will apply to installations brought to the continental shelf directly from overseas and to installations taken there from Australia. They will apply to the latter whether or not the installations were themselves originally imported into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In their practical effect, the amendments will not subject to sales tax an installation itself insofar as it is for use in the mining industry in carrying out mining operations or in the treatment of products of those operations because such an installation is, in these circumstances, exempt from tax under other provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> However, certain attachments to or parts of an installation, for example, attachments or parts used for the comfort, entertainment or recreation of persons living on an installation could be subject to sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Attachments or parts of this kind which would be taxable include cinema equipment, inbuilt or fixed sporting equipment, floor coverings and kitchen equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> A memorandum containing more detailed explanations of the technical aspects of these Bills is being made available to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend these Bills to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT (OFF-SHORE INSTALLATIONS) BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill to amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 is the last of the package of Bills designed to implement the proposal to extend the application of the Customs, excise, immigration, quarantine and sales tax laws to off-shore installations. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed by this Bill will have the same effect as, and will complement, the amendments proposed to be made by the Sales Tax Amendment (Off- shore Installations) Bills (Nos 1 to 9). </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.43)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having roamed, as is customary in a first reading debate, all over the compass, we now return, in the second reading debate, to the precise subject matter of this very large package of Bills concerned with off-shore installations. There are in fact 14 Bills in the package which deal with subjects as disparate as sales tax and quarantine. It is rather reminiscent of the Statute Law Revision Bills with their extraordinary miscellany of different subjects, but the important difference here is that a single theme unites all the Bills; that is, they apply to Australia's off-shore installations. Therefore it is appropriate that these Bills be dealt with together. The general purpose of the package, to the extent that one can identify anything so precise, is to ensure that the treatment of off-shore installations-by which I mean drilling platforms and rigs-is, for a variety of legislative purposes, the same as that accorded similar installations associated with resource ventures on Australian soil. A specific legislative impact is made by this package of Bills in the following areas: Customs, excise, sales tax, immigration and quarantine. The general effect of the Bills, if one can summarise it, is to deem that installations attached to the Australian seabed be regarded as places in Australia for these various legislative purposes so that the installations in question and the people associated with their operation attract the burdens and exemptions which attach to Australian soil-based installations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition supports all these Bills for several reasons. Firstly, the principle that resource ventures on the Australian continental shelf should be undifferentiated for taxation, immigration and quarantine purposes from similar ventures on the continent is, of course, scarcely arguable. Equity, legislative effectiveness and the assertion of Australian sovereignty demand that result. In particular, as the incorporated second reading speech of the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) on the Off-shore Installations (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1982 states, this is in fact necessary to give legislative protection to the rights of Australian industry to share in the development opportunities off-shore in the same way as those rights exist on the continent of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, at least one specific development-that is, the huge expansion of exploration and production in the remote North West Shelf-has made these Bills necessary. Again, as the second reading speech on the main Bill in the package indicates, the practice in the past has been for all overseas-sourced rigs, ships, equipment and materials for off-shore operations to be imported through existing Australian ports, by virtue of which they attracted the application of the various Customs, quarantine, immigration and taxation laws. But now, however , in the context of the North West Shelf, the scale and location of those developments are such that rigs and goods associated with them are being brought direct to their operating locations without coming through Australian ports. This applies particularly to the giant production platforms of the Woodside project which it is proposed will be imported directly from Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly-indicating why we support these measures as quite rational and sensible legislation-it is obvious that these more distant off-shore activities would provide rather splendid potential for the avoidance of various obligations and controls imposed by various substantive legislative codes which these Bills amend. I refer to such things as drug laws, laws with respect to exotic diseases and laws about illegal immigration. They are the kind of examples given by the Minister and they highlight the point in issue. There is also the question of avoidance of Customs and excise duties and sales tax which must, in the current climate of raging tax avoidance with which we are all unfortunately familiar, be regarded as something of a certainty unless the off-shore gaps are filled. Again this legislation seeks to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for all the nice things to say about the legislation; now for the qualifications. The first category of qualifications relates to some specific matters dealing with this legislation which were raised by my colleague Mr John Brown, the shadow Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in the House of Representatives and which I need to refer to again only briefly. The first such qualification relates to the need in practice-whatever the legislation might say -for adequate surveillance facilities and personnel to ensure that the various objectives I have referred to relating to the protection against people avoiding various legal obligations are in fact achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation here, as elsewhere, is likely to be quite useless unless adequate enforcement machinery is established on the ground. Here I suppose one must say 'on the sea'. A further specific point relates to the manifest inadequacy of a number of the penalties provided for in this massive legislative provision. We in the Opposition record a protest here, as we did recently in regard to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill dealing with the transfer pricing method of international tax avoidance. The penalties in many instances seem quite inadequate having regard to the financial magnitude of the operations involved, the potential benefits which are involved to participants in those projects, the difficulties of an obvious kind of surveillance and also the seriousness of some of the kinds of avoidance or potential avoidance of obligations which are here involved. Mr Brown, the member for Parramatta, gave some illustrations of that in his speech in the other place, and I do not think there is any need to reiterate them here. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as specific qualifications are concerned, I refer again to the particular problem of Customs control, a problem which was highlighted recently by the notorious Moore-MacKellar affair and by what that affair brought to light about maladministration and staff shortages within the Bureau of Customs. Clearly legislative sanctions, legislative controls, are not going to amount to a row of beans in the context of these off-shore installations, as elsewhere, unless the legislation is matched by detailed attention to practical operational effectiveness. Perhaps more importantly than any of these kinds of qualifications, I want to take the occasion of the appearance of these Bills to emphasise that our support of them is not to be taken as indicating the faintest weakening of our opposition to the so called off-shore settlement-the coastal waters legislation, the off-shore sovereignty legislation-which was passed by this Parliament in 1980 in the purported exercise of legislative authority, to some extent conferred upon the Commonwealth under section 51 (xxxviii) of the Constitution. On the contrary, the Australian Labor Party remains as implacably opposed as ever to that settlement and the abdication of the Commonwealth sovereignty over coastal waters and the seabed which it involved. I shall say a little more about that matter in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that these Bills do not amount to anything more by way of an abdication of Commonwealth sovereignty. If anything, it is the reverse to the extent that it is something of an exercise of Commonwealth authority over various miscellaneous areas and an extension of that Commonwealth authority off- shore that is involved in these Bills. But what is essentially important when we are considering the whole development of Australia's coastal waters and the off- shore seabed is not that Commonwealth legislative power be exercised with respect to these essentially ancillary matters. What is absolutely crucial in our view-very much in my view-is that the Commonwealth retains its authority, on behalf of the national interest as a whole, to deal with not the ancillary matters but the vital matters, matters relating to the exploration and development of mineral and energy resources and all the fiscal and other measures and arrangements, including trade arrangements, that go with that development. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spoke in the Senate on 31 May 1980 on the introduction of the major off- shore constitutional settlement legislation, I described the coastal waters and off-shore legislation as an act of collective constitutional vandalism by the Commonwealth and the States concerned, including, I acknowledge, some Labor States. Nothing which has transpired in the intervening two years has made me think twice about that description. On the contrary, I would strongly reassert the vital importance of national control in the national interest of off-shore resources and the equally firm intention of the Opposition as soon as we win the next Federal election-clearly that is not very far away-to take steps, as I believe it constitutionally and legally can, to unwind the so-called settlement by repealing, to the extent that it can, the packaged legislation of the past and enacting Commonwealth legislation to re-establish national sovereignty and effective national control over the sea and seabed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me restate very briefly-I do not want to merely go over ground that should by now be familiar-the reasons why it is, in our view, so much in the national interest that the Commonwealth should retain sovereignty in this area and why we continue to object so fiercely to the abdication of Commonwealth sovereignty that had been so hard fought for over so many decades, culminating in famous High Court indecision in the off-shore sovereignty case in 1975. The points, put at their briefest, are four in number. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, the re-establishment of Commonwealth sovereignty is essential if we are to seriously pursue and implement anything in the nature of a national energy policy. Secondly, it is only by national sovereignty, national control over off-shore resources, that we can avoid the all too ever apparent dangers of competitive warfare so to speak between the States regarding development projects, the competition for investment capital and all the irrational allocation of resources and infrastructure that are associated with that. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there is the very acute question of environmental management and pollution control. There is need for control on a macro-not simply a micro-scale when talking about projects of this magnitude and this potential for disaster in terms of their environmental impact. There is a need for national uniformity; there is a need for national consistency; there is a need for the application of Commonwealth resources, Commonwealth expertise and Commonwealth motivation to maintain the off-shore environment. That need is not equally lacking in every State around the perimeter of this nation. I readily acknowledge there is a growing degree of sensitivity in a number of areas about the need for effective environmental protection in the off-shore as indeed the on-shore area. But there are, equally, governments around this nation of ours-I need not stop for very long to point out which ones they are-which are manifestly, conspicuously, traditionally and notoriously insensitive to the environmental needs of our national heritage, of the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, in this litany of shortly stated reasons why it is crucial to maintain and re-establish national sovereignty over off-shore resources, I point to the international obligations of Australia in relation to its territorial waters. We are party to a number of treaties in matters as disparate as the protection of migratory birds and other endangered species around the world which have to do with the territorial sea and, to some extent, to what goes on underneath the surface of that water. We do have international obligations and it is clear-it has been clear for many years-that the States, particularly some individual States, cannot be relied upon to legislate in a way that gives effect to those international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's international obligations, Australia's international obligations, must not be jeopardised by the necessary involvement of the States, by an allocation of functions between the Commonwealth and the States in this area, which leaves our capacity to perform international obligations at the mercy of the lowest common denominator of sensitivity in this respect-in other words, at the mercy of the kind of approach to international obligations that has been for so long manifest in the performance of the Queensland and Western Australian governments. There are constitutional uncertainties which I discussed at length when I spoke on this matter two years ago-on 21 May-about the dismantling of the settlement at this stage. But that, of course, would scarcely distinguish this issue from a whole range of other issues which concern our much traversed, much time worn and now gravely inadequate Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it clear that my preoccupations in this respect are not, despite the jibes that I expect will be forthcoming in a few minutes from Senator Chaney or whoever is carrying the can for the Commonwealth, about centralist preoccupations. There are many aspects of the management of the coastal waters and even the seabed that are, quite properly, the preserve of the States and should remain so. There is no policy reason-certainly there is no legal reason- why State laws should not continue to operate in respect of such matters as pleasure boating, wharves, jetties, harbours, beach protection, dredging, dumping and the regulation of certain fisheries, such as abalone and scallop fisheries. There is no reason legally why, in the absence of the kind of legislation that has been implemented in the coastal waters package, the States should not continue to legislate in those areas. To the extent that such legislation is within a State's extraterritorial competence, in that the subject matter of the legislation demonstrates some kind of connection with what is known legally as the peace, order and good government of the State, and to the extent that that legislation is not inconsistent with any explicit Commonwealth legislation that might also be operating in that area, there is no constitutional or any other barrier on State laws operating in that area in the sorts of matters I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question in anything I have said-I do not want it to be misunderstood as a suggestion to that effect-of the Commonwealth wanting to move in, muscle everybody else out of the way and exercise total control over territorial waters, the seabed and all the installations and everything else associated with them simply for the sheer hell of it. We acknowledge that there are all sorts of good, legal and practical administrative and public policy reasons why, to a very significant extent, the management and administration of the coastal waters, the off-shore seabed, the fisheries and everything else associated with them should be divided between the different levels of government. The point which we make and which we keep reiterating is that in the central issue of energy and resource policy as it relates to coastal waters and, more particularly, to the seabed and the wealth of mineral and energy resources lying beneath the seabed there must be Commonwealth sovereignty; in the national interest national sovereignty must be re-established. </PARA>
<PARA> Issues such as foreign affairs, defence and the management of the national economy are quintessentially matters for the national government. They are almost universally acknowledged to be such by most people, with the conspicuous exception of the occasional State politician such as Mr Hassell, whom I spoke to on these matters in Western Australia the other day. The national public interest can, in fact, be served in these areas only by the application of national level rules and standards. There will always be contrary views, I suppose, from some of the more fundamentalist brethren in some of the States, but it is acknowledged, and it has always been acknowledged, that certain areas of public policy responsibility are entirely appropriately matters for the Commonwealth acting on behalf of the nation as a whole. I simply argue and the Labor Party simply argues that matters to do with off-shore mineral and energy resources and with basic questions of off-shore sovereignty should properly be within the domain of the Commonwealth in exactly the same way as are defence, foreign affairs and the control of the national economy. We believe that that approach is consistent with the thinking of most Australians on this subject. This is, I suppose, a refrain which the Senate will have to get used to hearing from the Labor Party whenever this off-shore question is debated, as it periodically is. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that our support of the present legislation, uncontroversial and unexceptionable as it is, does not alter our continuing belief that only when the existing so-called settlement is unwound and sovereignty over off-shore resources and coastal waters reverts to the Commonwealth will we once again have something resembling a rational approach to the division of responsibility in these crucial areas of Australian public policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a package of six Bills designed to extend taxing and control laws to drilling platforms and rigs exploring the seabed of Australia. They are designed essentially to keep out prohibited imports such as drugs and also to prevent the entry of exotic diseases and illegal immigrants. They are designed to operate through a series of Customs and excise laws and migration and quarantine requirements. I am very happy to say that the Australian Democrats support all of these Bills. We see them as being sensible, practical, clear and very necessary if the Australian continental shelf is to be satisfactorily explored. In passing, I mention in contrast to being complimentary, that some of the language in the Bills is a little difficult to understand. For instance, one memorable provision in the Customs Tariff Amendment (Off-shore Installations) Bill 1982 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) For the purposes of the Customs Acts, where an overseas installation becomes attached to the Australian seabed, the installation shall, subject to sub-section (4), be deemed to be part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure how this piece of legislation would operate in the case, for instance, of floating rigs. Perhaps the Minister at the table, the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, could explain that. I understand that many rigs overseas are semi-submersible. One is tempted to ask: When do such rigs become a part of Australia? Is it when they are actually drilling into the seabed or when they are anchored? That is a minor point, but we find some of the language a little hard to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> We have one or two minor misgivings about the Bill. The main one is we believe that the safety zone, as defined, is very small. A collision between an off- shore rig and a large ship could be catastrophic. It would create massive pollution and could well result in damage to the rig and to the ship. The cost could run into tens of millions of dollars. On that basis, the fines imposed for breaches are relatively trivial. I make that point bearing in mind that in Bass Strait there have been instances in which merchant ships have strayed to within a few hundred metres of drilling rigs operating there. There have been some very near misses. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned that Australia has not a sufficiently efficient type of coastal surveillance; that such surveillance as exists is completely inadequate. The Australian Democrats have advocated for many years that Australia should establish what is commonly called in other countries a brown water navy. We should increase quite substantially the number of small ships that are capable of surveillance. They should be armed with modern weapons such as surface-to- surface guided missiles and could carry a variety of armaments. The package of armaments could well include medium calibre guns, point defence weapons, helicopters and anti-submarine weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> The present structure of our defence forces is ill-suited to the task of carrying out extensive maritime surveillance. Even the new Fremantle class ships are too small to perform effectively in heavy weather for extended periods. They are grossly underarmed and not really capable of achieving continual coastal surveillance. The concept of a brown water navy has been applied in the United States for many years and has been performed very satisfactorily in that country . I understand that in the Soviet Union a similar concept is applied. </PARA>
<PARA> Another shortcoming of these Bills is that they do not at any stage involve the encouragement of Australian industry, which can be developed quite significantly if it attempts to meet the needs of off-shore resource exploration. Even a nationally owned enterprise such as the Bendigo Ordnance Factory has already demonstrated a great capability to perform difficult and complex heavy engineering tasks. We feel that the Government should give serious consideration to encouraging this sort of heavy engineering in this country. We believe that it is a national priority. We have a very large sea bed to explore. It is obviously a growth area of the future. I mention to the Government dries that they should be aware that most countries have some sort of incentive for heavy engineering. They consider that this is a national priority and a great national asset. Other countries encourage heavy engineering by a variety of means-some by tariffs, some by bounties, some by subsidies, some by export incentives and some , often, by direct government participation. I suggest that the Government could well give consideration to this aspect of off-shore exploration. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we are also concerned that the Bills take no note of the monitoring of the production from oil rigs. We have already had the experience in Bass Strait of it proving to be beyond the technical capability of the Victorian Government to monitor satisfactorily production from the oil rigs in that State. This has already cost the Victorian Government up to $100m in lost revenue. It has been relying on foreign consulting engineers. Surely both the State Government and the Federal Government must be concerned that it is high time we developed a technology and our own technological engineers capable of carrying out in a satisfactory way the necessary monitoring of the production from our oil rigs. I hope the Minister can answer the comparatively minor queries that I have outlined. We welcome these Bills, commend the Government on their drafting and wish them a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its support of the Bills which was expressed by Senator Evans when he said that the legislation was uncontroversial and unobjectionable, and by Senator Siddons who said that it was sensible, practical and clear. Indeed, I think the legislation is non-controversial in that it simply ensures that activities which are carried on off-shore on our continental shelf are subject to the normal sorts of controls that I think one would expect, bearing in mind that they are activities which are under the control of Australia. Notwithstanding Senator Siddons's description of the Bills as sensible, practical and clear, he raised a number of queries, as did Senator Evans, which I will address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Only one general question of principle was raised. That was by Senator Evans, who again pointed out that he is most unhappy with the general off-shore settlement. I am rather sorry that my colleague the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), who is sitting in the Senate at the moment, does not have the conduct of these Bills because he would be able to address these issues of the off-shore settlement at very great length. On this occasion I think we will have to give that a miss. I just note that even Senator Evans concedes that there are good, practical reasons for a division between the various levels of government. The difference which he brought out towards the close of his spech was that he was of the view that there should be clear Commonwealth control over any resource development and wealth production from these areas. He gave in very brief form some reasons for that. I agree that there is a very fundamental difference between us on that point. I do not wish to vest him with the gift of prophecy-he suggested that I would be on my feet complaining on this issue within a matter of minutes-but I must say that I think the prospect of yet another significant area of economic control being vested solely in the Commonwealth is something which he knows would be starkly resisted in various parts of Australia. It is one of the genuine points of difference which lie between the Government and the Opposition. The Government would see its off-shore settlement as a triumph for the principles of a co-operative approach to federalism. The Australian Labor Party would see it as being a real blow to its own ambitions to see more centralist control in these regions. There is nothing shameful in that difference, but it is a difference between us. In view of the fact that Senator Evans seems to be quite keen to get into government, I have to say to him that it is a difference which I am quite happy to have him make apparent as often as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> To turn quickly to the specific points which were raised-without necessarily picking them up in the precise order in which they were made in the debate-I note that Senator Evans was concerned about a number of matters. He was concerned about the manpower resources which are available to Customs to deal with the additional responsibilities which Customs will receive under this legislation. The position is that apart from the initial installation phase, when considerable direct overseas involvement is anticipated, the manpower requirements are not expected to be very extensive. However, there will be a need for additional attendance and patrol activity at the site of installation and of the traffic between the installation and the mainland. However, the number of installations having direct contact overseas is not expected to be very large. I can assure the Senate that it will be considerably larger than it would have been if we had the sort of centralist control of these resources which Senator Evans wants. That would result in very little activity at all in these areas. There will almost certainly be found to be a need to revise the format of coastal surveillance generally. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as surveillance is concerned, the Government has decided, as a result of its consideration of the review of the need for civil coastal surveillance in 1981, that Customs should not engage in coastal surveillance generally but should depend on the Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre for its needs in that direction. Customs will continue to depend upon that organisation for coastal surveillance and will concentrate on response action according to the nature of the sightings reported. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans also raised the question of the inadequacy of penalties. Like a number of other matters which he raised, this was canvassed in the other place. He was concerned about the penalties but seemed to overlook the fact that substantial additional penalties are contained in the forfeiture provisions. So one is looking not merely at the question of monetary penalties under this legislation but also at the forfeiture powers which are contained within the Bills. The other matters which were raised by Senator Evans do not need to be canvassed since he seems to have lost interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the matters raised by Senator Siddons. He was concerned about the technical question concerning floating rigs. As I am advised, the position concerning such rigs is that they do require to be fixed in order to operate. They do not float at large. They are anchored to the seabed. It is when the rig is affixed that it becomes part of Australia in the terms of this legislation. So, the sorts of rigs which are the concern of Senator Siddons are, I am told, covered by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Siddons was also concerned about the need to encourage Australian industry. He might be consoled by the fact that, as at 31 January 1982, Woodside Petroleum Ltd had let contracts for $784m in connection with the North West Shelf project. Of this figure, $529m, or 67.5 per cent, was let to Australian companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that would be a matter of satisfaction to all honourable senators. It does indicate that there is a direct benefit to Australian industry in the activities which are being undertaken in that very remote part of Australia off the North West Shelf. As far as the processing of products in Australia is concerned, it is the Government's policy to encourage raw materials processing in Australia where this would be economically feasible and consistent with sound industrial development. In relation to the North West Shelf, the first phase of the project involves the supply by pipeline of 10 million cubic metres per day of natural gas to the Western Australian market. At least one group of companies is conducting a preliminary study into the use of part of this gas as petrochemical feedstock for a plant in Western Australia. The export approvals which have been given for the second phase of the project account for some 53 per cent of the estimated reserves and three fields on the North West Shelf, leaving significant opportunities for the establishment of local industries based on processing the remainder of the reserves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter which I think was of concern to Senator Siddons was the matter of the safety zone and the limited distance of 500 metres which was indicated as being the relevant distance. One can understand an objection to that, bearing in mind that it takes a long time for a ship to stop and that there are various other things one might be concerned about. But under international law and convention the powers referred to may only be exercised in respect of foreign vessels within Australia's territorial sea and contiguous zone; that is, up to 12 nautical miles from the coast. The 12-mile limit is not applicable to artificial islands and the powers are not exercisable on the high seas. Under the Convention on the Continental Shelf provision is made whereby contracting parties have some limited rights within a 500-metre safety zone around installations. In other words, the legislation takes advantage of the maximum available to us under that Convention. In this legislation the Government is seeking to go as far as it can in protecting Australia's interests. It is not open to us to move further, as Senator Siddons suggested might be wise. I thank the Senate for its very speedy consideration of this significant legislation and I commend the legislation to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These three related Bills have been prompted by the export meat substitution scandal of last year. They provide for tighter procedures for and control of export establishments and higher penalties for breaches of regulations and for fraud. The first Bill listed, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill, also amends the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act in a number of ways not related directly to the export meat substitution scandal. Among the procedures or controls which have been tightened is the fact that it will now be an offence falsely to describe goods on the documentation accompanying the goods. The unauthorised possession of an official export inspection stamp will be an offence. Automatic right of entry for inspectors to all registered premises is provided for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Taken in total, all of these changes, apparently, must be extraordinarily complex, because the Government decided to engage counsel to represent the Minister at the royal commission which flowed from the export inspection scandal . I quote from a letter that Senator Sir John Carrick sent to me following a question without notice on 10 March as to why counsel was engaged. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> It was decided to engage counsel because it is essential that the substantial changes now being made to Commonwealth meat inspection be brought to the attention of the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>No other reason was stated in Senator Carrick's letter for counsel having been engaged. Apparently, in the Government's judgment, these changes are so complex that it is worth $75,000 to have them adequately explained to a royal commission . </PARA>
<PARA> The procedures as stipulated in the Bill seem to be acceptable, but lingering doubts must remain about the capacity effectively to administer those procedures of a very slack Department of Primary Industry and an even slacker Minister. The events of the last week suggest that despite all that has happened in the last couple of years, including a major Senate inquiry, administration within the Department of Primary Industry is still very slack, and of course tolerated by a slack Minister. We learned this week that on 19 April the Australian Dairy Corporation discovered that Reserve Bank of Australia funds were being misused by a number of dairy companies. On 5 and 6 May a board meeting was held, and I understand that the matter was discussed at that meeting. Yet, if we are to believe the Minister, it was not until 19 May that he found out about it. The Government has a representative on the Board of the Australian Dairy Corporation , which met on 5 and 6 May, and as far as I know Mr Wallace was present at that meeting. But, if we are to believe the Minister, the Minister was not told of something as important as this for another two weeks; indeed not told, presumably, until it was known that the Business Review weekly was about to publish the story. </PARA>
<PARA> If all that is correct, it seems that despite the Senate inquiry, Mr Wallace and the Minister have the same negligent attitude towards their responsibility for the conduct of the Australian Dairy Corporation that was disclosed in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. If the Department of Primary Industry is still suspect in that area, grave doubts must arise as to whether it remains suspect in the inspection service area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was questioning the administrative ability of the Department of Primary Industry, given its continuing condition, as revealed by the Australian Dairy Corporation's latest scandal and in particular the apparent failure of the Government's representative on the Board of the Corporation to report until 19 May-at least that is the Minister's version of when he found out about it-the substance of discussions at a Board meeting on 5 May and 6 May about the misuse of Reserve Bank funds. Those points must cast some doubt upon the capacity or ability of the Department to administer effectively the new, tightened rules concerning export inspection procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macklin has forecast an intention to move a number of amendments in the Committee stage to the Export Control Bill and the Export Control (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill. The Labor Party is willing to support some of them, but it will not support at least two of them. I will not go into the details at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill seeks to amend the principal Act in ways that are not directly related to export inspection procedures or the export meat substitution scandal. The amendments in that Bill seek to provide the Corporation with the potential to become a sole trader with the power to restrict the number of exporters who will be licensed in specific markets and, subject to ministerial approval, gives the Corporation the power to trade in futures. It also provides that, on the proclamation of the Act as amended, all existing export licences will be cancelled and re-issued by the Corporation. I should indicate at this stage that the Opposition will not be opposing any of those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the Corporation's power to restrict licences for single markets, we are not opposing this provision, but it seems to me that the Corporation, given its general power to withhold licences, would have always had the power to do this. Even if that is so, I guess the power will be more explicit following the amendments proposed by the Government. At least in the preferred markets of the United States, Japan and Canada, the Corporation exercised power which restricted the number of exporters who could sell in those markets. Also, it has always had the power to cancel export licences, a power which was exercised, I think for the first time, following the meat export substitution scandals. </PARA>
<PARA> The presumed intention of the amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act is to assist the beef industry. It is unfortunately true that the beef industry is currently in a moderately depressed condition. Agricultural history in Australia generally suggests that a condition of depression fosters the emergence of quacks dispensing hocus-pocus. It seems to be happening again. The latest manifestation of this is Sir William Gunn's panacea for the beef industry which, according to the Press, was a plan to extract $100m from a bankrupt industry to spend in nebulous ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Following those Press reports, I obtained a copy of the Gunn proposal from the Australian Cattle Council. The printed version has no reference to the $100m which had been widely reported in the Press. What actually is in the printed proposal is a lot of motherhood statements-some nebulous, naive and, in some cases, nonsensical statements. One of the more naive statements-I do not appear to have the document with me but I remember what it said-drew an analogy between the sugar and wool industries and the beef industry. It said that sugar and wool had managed to maintain stable prices and asked why beef could not do the same. A fairly obvious reason which should have occurred even to Sir William Gunn is that sugar and wool are non-perishable products. Therefore, it is technically feasible and often economically justifiable to store them for quite long periods until market conditions change. Beef is not such a product. It is perishable. It cannot be stored economically for long periods. Technically, deep refrigeration for long periods adversely affects quality. </PARA>
<PARA> Beneath all that overburden, one particularly dangerous proposal appears, I think, on page 20 of the paper. It is a proposal that there be a pooling system for beef so that returns to producers would be equalised throughout the year. This, so the document said, would induce farmers to market their stock when it was in prime condition instead of in response to prices. The outcome of this, of course, would be that producers would happily slide into bankruptcy, secure in the knowledge that they were producing a prime product. The suggestion that producers should be, as an act of deliberate policy, insulated from price signals from the market and encouraged not to sell when prices were high but to sell when stock was in prime condition is mind-boggling. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years Sir William Gunn has been a fertile source of economic quackery. As Australian Wool Board Chairman in the 1960s, in conjunction with the International Wool Secretariat, which he still reveres in his latest paper, he put forward the original proposition that if wool production increased wool prices would rise. I cannot find anybody in the wool industry today who is willing to support that notion. It is reminiscent of Germany in 1946 when nobody was left but the anti-nazis. Nevertheless, that ludicrous proposition that an increase in supply would push prices up became the conventional wisdom of the 1960s and the early 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just had given to me-I think I should refer to it for the sake of the record-precisely what was written in Sir William Gunn's paper 'Proposal to Stabilize the Beef Cattle Industry'. With respect to the pooling system he said:</PARA>
<PARA> A pooling system could allow producers to bring their cattle to market at their prime, instead of in response to a price change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge Senator Rae's interjection so that it may be recorded. It is appalling that anybody could seriously propose that as an act of deliberate policy one should set up arrangements which could prevent producers responding to price changes. I hope the latest piece of Gunn economic quackery does not gain the popular acceptance of the quack notion of the 1960s that increased wool production would cause wool prices to rise. Sir William Gunn is living testimony to the fact that chronic economic illiteracy plus, I might add, in his case involvement in a string of bankrupt enterprises do not necessarily preclude people from achieving guru status, at least when they are facing an uncritical audience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might express yet again my disappointment that such palpable nonsense has been not only seriously reported in the agricultural Press but also seriously reported by some agricultural writers in the metropolitan daily Press and that nowhere has there been the sort of dismissal or ridicule that the suggestions of the so-called proposal actually deserve. Of course, it does not give anyone any joy that the beef industry along with, I might add, agriculture generally is at present in a moderately depressed condition. The solution to those problems, however, does not lie in the promotion of snake oil remedies of this type. We believe that although the amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act which the Government has proposed will not achieve miracles they may achieve some marginal improvements at least ultimately in the condition of the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this cognate debate I wish to refer mainly to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and make just a couple of comments at the second reading stage on the export control legislation. I will also be speaking to the amendments which I propose to move at the Committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill seeks to strengthen the control of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation of Australia's export meat trade in line with the problems in meat substitution that we have had in the past year or at least that have come to public attention in the last year. I think the interesting part of the Bill in terms of the meat trade is the opportunity the Government has given the Corporation to adopt the role of sole trader and also to limit the number of licences for trade with particular overseas markets. Also there is the possibility, subject to ministerial control, that the Corporation will be able to trade in futures. I think that is a very interesting innovation although, of course, it is already occurring in many of our other rural areas. The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill raises a problem faced by the meat industry as a whole. I should like to refer to what I think is a pertinent comment made by Mr Ian Park, who is the President of the Cattlemen's Union. He said that the recent beef scandal was one of the best things ever to occur to the beef industry. That seems a very odd comment, but Mr Park was making it in the context of saying that at last public and political attention has been focussed upon the meat marketing and export trade. To that extent I think that people in the meat trade are, in some offhanded way, grateful that at last others have taken notice of their problems and are coming to grips with some of the real issues faced by that rural industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned, however, that the Corporation still seems to be taking a fairly hesitant view, particularly in relation to what it sees as its role. I think most people acknowledge that Australia has certain natural advantages in its beef trade. I refer particularly to the quality of its meat. In many ways we must take an aggressive stance to overcome some of the very real problems that have occurred. I should like now to mention a problem faced by my own State concerning the selling methods within the meat trade. There have been some extremely interesting innovations overseas. For example, I refer to video auctions of beef. The Queensland Meat Industry Organisation and Marketing Authority is investigating concepts such as carcass auctions and direct selling by classifications. All of these methods of selling are, of course, directed at solving the problems of saleyards-problems such as bruising, double handling, stress and inability to reduce prices offered on a specified sale day. I think that all those incidences are fairly well known by the industry. I believe the industry is seeking to readjust to cope with them. For example, in Queensland in the last year 21 saleyards have closed down. The nine biggest saleyards now handle more than 60 per cent of sales in Queensland. I think that is an inevitable movement given the state of the beef industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that when we look at the current statistics for the industry- unfortunately this is a picture that we know only too well by looking at most of our rural industries-we find not a moderately depressed situation as Senator Walsh called it but rather a devastating situation. Beef production in Australia has dropped more than 20 per cent from 2.9 million tonnes in 1977-78 to 2.3 million tonnes in 1980-81. Our national herd is down from 33.4 million in 1976 to about 25 million today. I do not think anybody is looking at rebuilding that national herd. Cattle prices-this certainly applies to my State and, I believe, it applies nationally-are down about 40 per cent in real terms. Most honourable senators will be aware of the meatworks situation in their own States. In Queensland more than 20 meatworks have closed down in the last three years. I think these problems are borne out when one looks at the situation faced by major meat companies in Australia. I shall quote some figures in order to give an indication of the real problems faced by meat companies. Last year Tancred Bros Pty Ltd had a 2.9 per cent return on invested funds; Metro Industries Ltd had a 9.5 per cent return; Australian Bacon had a 7.3 per cent return; and J. C. Hutton Pty Ltd, Protean (Holdings) Ltd and F. J. Walker Ltd each had a nil return. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of those companies are reflected in the employment opportunities in that field. We have seen over the past year over 10,000 meat workers lose their jobs. Meat retail outlets have been slashed and, for the first time, every section of the beef industry in Australia is depressed. Unfortunately, if one looks outside Australia for some relief it is hard at the moment to see where it might come from. For example, the United States market does not show any signs of recovery at present. Japan is also in difficulties. Certainly, when one looks at their domestic production, which is growing each year, one could not, except in terms of lean meat, look towards further developing export markets in those countries. There is also the concern that the United States is becoming much more aggressive in this area and is seeking some offsetting exports to balance its enormous trade deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> The European Economic Community, which is rapidly becoming the bane of almost every agricultural and rural producer in this country, is continuing to increase production. I believe that Australia is finding it extremely difficult to cope with the types of methods that the EEC is employing. At this time our markets basically are in the United States, Canada, Japan and Korea. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics is looking, in general rural terms, at a further decline in this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> With that rather bleak picture, we welcome the introduction by the Government of this measure which will enable the Corporation, if it wishes to make use of the added powers which it has been given, particularly as sole trader, to move to a much more aggressive and successful marketing of beef in Australia. I believe that was the intention of the Government. I think all honourable senators will certainly hope that the Corporation will use to the full extent those additional powers that the Government is offering. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether we might raise the question of the difference in terms of government control of the Corporation which, although funded by producers, is still very heavily controlled by the Government and whether we might seek a different relationship between the Government and the Corporation in terms of accountability. I am not quite sure whether that marketing organisation is best operating under the types of controls that it has at the moment. I think that most of the people operating in the beef area believe that there has been a lot to be desired in its performance. They will all be looking quite anxiously at how the Corporation handles its increased powers under this Bill. I also believe they will look at the Government and its intentions in terms of what type of priority it wishes to give to beef production in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall speak briefly, because of the pressure of time, to the Export Control Bill and raise one issue that I believe is still of concern, that is, the issue raised by the Law Reform Commission in its report on criminal investigation, and particularly the item in relation to warrants. I shall quote paragraph 192 of the second report of the Law Reform Commission. I think it sets out the problem that still exists in this area. Having raised the issue of warrants the Law Reform Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is nonetheless perfectly obvious that the powers conferred are all of them quite extraordinarily wide in their scope. There is no requirement in any of them that before the powers are exercised an independent judicial mind should consider the circumstances of the particular case, weighing the public interest as against that of the individual concerned. Nor is there any effective way in which any of these powers once exercised can be the subject of ex post facto judicial review. </PARA>
<PARA>A little later in that chapter, in paragraph 196, the Commission made this point :</PARA>
<PARA> The power to search and seize is undoubtedly a very necessary one for police to have. It has great destructive potential so far as the right to privacy and civil liberties generally are concerned. The power must therefore be capable of justification on every single occasion on which it is used. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission raises that issue not so much about the police in general but particularly about Customs. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> On this view, the continued existence of general search warrants cannot be countenanced. In the Commission's view such provisions should long ago have disappeared from the Commonwealth and Territorial statute books. We recommend that their demise be delayed no longer. </PARA>
<PARA>The recommendation in paragraph 207 relates specifically to customs. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's recommendation here is that the power to detain and search suspected persons, or vehicles, should be restricted in its application to ' customs areas' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This refers to one of the amendments which I will move in the Committee stage, that is, precisely what is the Government's intention about registered premises. However I will refer to that matter at a later stage. I believe that the points raised by the Law Reform Commission still have to be answered by the Government. Those problems still exist. I think everybody is mindful of the extreme difficulties in the Customs area in ensuring that we have effective seizure and search, that Customs officers have such powers as to enable an effective deterrent to be mounted, particularly against the importation of drugs, while at the same time providing the privacy and civil liberties that we consider to be absolutely fundamental and necessary in a democratic community. I believe this matter was addressed quite clearly by the Law Reform Commission when it sought a middle path. The Government is still reluctant to come to grips with that thorny problem. This legislation does not do that. One would hope that at some stage in the near future the Government will have a complete review of problems relating to seizure which have to be faced by Customs officers and that this chamber will have a chance to debate them more fully than is possible when dealing with this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill 1982 as well as the Export Control ( Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1982 and the Export Control Bill 1982. My remarks will be general. They will relate particularly to the Australian Meat and Live- stock Corporation so they can be considered as directed specifically to the amending Bill although I hope the relevance of a couple of things I say will be apparent in relation to the other Bills. In the last 12 months we have had a number of debates in the Senate on meat and I welcome the opportunity to speak on the amendments to the AMLC Bill. I remind the Senate that the Act we are amending was passed by the Senate in 1977. At the time a number of industry groups voiced strong disapproval of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill and the deficiencies they saw in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was one who attempted to put to the Government certain views on the setting up of the AMLC and what I believe its powers and duties ought to be. I welcome the fact that after five years the Government has now faced the fact that in relation to Australian beef a number of countries have single buying authorities . For many years a number of Australian beef producers have been telling governments this and saying that it is all very well to talk about free enterprise and free trade and hold them up as ideals, but the facts are that it becomes a very one-sided exercise in the beef industry when trading with certain nations. That is not so in our trade with the United States of America. Trade with a country such as Japan is a very sore point with Australian beef producers . I speak with particular feeling because half of the beef produced in my State of Queensland is export beef destined for countries such as the United States of America and Japan, our first and second most important markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The system of buying by Japan has long been a subject of considerable grievance to Australian and, in particular, Queensland beef producers. A very large amount of the beef produced in Queensland is not meant to be high quality restaurant beef. It comes from land which has only within the last two decades been utilised for the growing of beef and the quality of beef that it produces is not on the whole suitable for high class restaurant trade. It is meant to be hamburger beef in the case of the United States and beef suitable for such things as curries in the case of Japan. However, because of very protective and restrictive attitudes on the part of certain purchasing countries, notably Japan , the amount of beef that we can land cheaply in such countries is restricted. </PARA>
<PARA> In January 1977 I had the opportunity to visit Japan at a time when there was a four-Minister ministerial delegation there talking trade. I was there with a back bench delegation. The subject of the Australian ministerial delegation earned very much Press in the time we were there and was drawing the attention of the ordinary Japanese citizen. As our delegation moved about and came into contact with average Japanese people, not government spokesmen or members of the Diet, those people expressed to us overwhelmingly a desire to have access to Australian beef. For the type of beef that they wanted, not the kobe beef but the beef that ordinary Japanese consumers could have in their homes, Australian beef was ideally suited. However, because of the particular meat buying and trading practices in Japan, that beef was firstly very expensive and secondly was available only in small amounts. So without a doubt I felt that there was a desire on the part of Japanese consumers, for example, to have access to more Australian beef because that was expressed in clear, simple and direct terms to us as Australian representatives. On the other side of the coin, in Australia we have maintained an attitude that we have been able to leave our beef export trade up to individual marketeers; that those who are registered as exporters of beef have the right to go out into the world to deal with whomever they will however they will. </PARA>
<PARA> The bitterness of the beef crash in Queensland has not gone. When there was an upturn in the beef industry about four years ago I heard many smug comments from within that industry and from within this Parliament about how the militant attitudes that had emerged during the beef crash would disappear. 'Just wait and see', we were all told, 'Once the beef prices go up, they will all forget their complaints. They will forget that they wanted a different marketing system. They will forget that they criticised the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill'. Well, they have not forgotten. The lessons of the beef crash in Queensland and in similar areas such as the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia are not forgotten. Thousands of decent, honest people were forced out of the industry because of the woefully inadequate structure, standards and marketing of Australian beef had obtained at the time of the crash . Those standards and structures could in no way address themselves to the problem. The beef producers have not forgotten their friends and, indeed, in many cases, members of their families who were forced into bankruptcy and who walked off their properties. Militancy remains. Criticism of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill, of the AMLC itself, of its powers and of the way it conducts itself remains. The questions remain. The question of trading and export entitlements remains. </PARA>
<PARA> Five years ago I asked the Government to address itself to the question of a single selling right for the AMLC, as was then strongly requested by a very large number of beef processors. Finally, the Government has addressed itself to that. There are still other areas at which the Government must look very seriously. The question of export entitlements will remain a difficult area until the beef producer-the person who starts the process and without whom the industry cannot exist at all, without whom we would earn no export money-is satisfied that the system of trading and export credits does not just cream off from his price. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we are at a patchy stage in the beef industry. Sometimes it is not bad; sometimes it is very depressing. The industry's structure and marketing procedures must still undergo a lot of review, a lot of firm government action. I hope that this Government and governments of the future will not wait for further disasters before they take some action, will not wait until the situation is beating them over the head for several years before they move in the obvious directions. </PARA>
<PARA> Who benefits from the present situation? A number of very important factors are involved in our beef industry. A large number of people within its different sectors are affected by downturns or periods of prosperity. There is the processor-the entrepreneur who buys and puts the beef through his processing works. There are all of the people employed in the large meat processing works- and they are large. There is the exporter, in whose hands rests the fate of the export industry-a very large section of the beef industry. There is, of course, as I have mentioned, the producer. At all stages, in looking at beef marketing arrangements, governments should be conscious of all those people. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the excuses used by the Government in 1977 for not being more resolute with the opportunity that it had to restructure the Australian beef industry was that sectors of the industry could not agree with one another; that there were even disagreements within those sectors. I suggest that in part that was a lame excuse; in part it was true. But had leadership been shown from outside it could have resolved a number of those problems. That leadership still has not come. I do not think that it has come from the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation . The worker needs to understand that his wages and the factor which they build into the cost of meat, particularly to the domestic consumer, can be critical in the acceptance of meat as a product. The processor has to understand that the producer is not there for his benefit only, not there to be manipulated, to be played off, one against the other. The exporter has to understand that if the Australian beef industry appears to have no long term security, he will have no long term security. The producer must know how he is viewed by those other three sectors of the industry. That is still not clear. The producer clearly wants co- operation with the worker, the processor and the exporter, because without them he is nowhere. They are essential to his livelihood. But he feels powerless. </PARA>
<PARA> In August of last year shortly after the meat substitution scandal broke I called on the Government to appoint a royal commission into the scandal. One week later, and quite coincidentally, I left to be a guest of the United States Government in that country. Because this scandal had broken before I left, naturally I spent the greater part of my time in the United States, particularly in Washington, which is where I spent most of my time, talking to members of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the subject of the Australian meat trade. I talked to Congressman Gibbon, Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, which then had the Farm Bill before it. That member of Congress had a very firm view on the Farm Bill. He did not believe that the demands being made by the American cattle producers to put unreasonable controls on imports of beef into the United States should be agreed to. When I say 'unreasonable' I am being kind . If those controls had been imposed they would be an effective virtual ban on the import of meat into the United States. I think that under those circumstances I am not being unkind to my American colleagues when I say that their demands were unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> I encountered many vigorous, dedicated opponents of the importation of Australian meat into the United States. During my time there I welcomed with great enthusiasm and relief the news of the announcement by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) that there would be a royal commission into the meat substitution scandal. I welcomed the terms of that inquiry because I believed them to be complete and to the point. They gave me, an Australian legislator at the coal face in the United States talking to American legislators, a very good basis for discussion and reassurance. I look forward as do many others, to the outcome of that royal commission report. </PARA>
<PARA> I was astonished when I returned to Australia to read a report in our newspapers, published in the week after my return, which credited to an executive member of the National Cattlemen's Association-the United States organisation which represents beef producers in that country-the view that Australians had nothing to fear from the meat substitution scandal, that, in fact, the Australian Press had overplayed the thing altogether and that it was not a big issue in the United States. It was a major issue. Americans I met who had nothing to do with industry, trade or legislation all knew that kangaroo and horse meat was arriving in their country from Australia. But any Australians who had read those reports and taken them at face value would therefore have been astonished when the Farm Bill was passed by Congress. That decision was subsequently overturned and at the moment our position appears reasonably secure , but only on a short term basis. Let nobody underestimate the strength of the Opposition within Congress in the United States to importing Australian meat. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things I therefore welcome about these Bills is a move towards the setting of uniform standards in the marking and marketing of beef, towards giving to somebody the responsibility for making sure that when a carton of meat is presented as a certain product it does contain that product. We should ensure not only that it contains beef instead of kangaroo meat, but also that if it is claimed to contain fillet steak it contains fillet steak and not chuck steak. Accusations of substitution of the latter kind have been made all too often against our meat processing industry by various consumers, not the least of which are international airlines, which take meat on when they are in Australia. Some of the people who have had responsibility for the marketing of our meat have done us a grave disservice over and over again for years now. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred early in my speech to a monopoly situation in relation to certain purchasing countries. I am a member of a party and a government which support the free enterprise principles as the most effective way of assuring certain social objectives. However, let us never confuse free market conditions with the rule of the jungle. I note that the second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA> The current system of meat trading, based on free market principles and involving some 260 private operators licensed to export meat and livestock, operates reasonably well in normal trading circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently the Minister does not now include as a normal trading circumstance trading with a country where there is a single buyer. Five years ago the Government did. I am pleased that it has been persuaded that that is no longer a normal trading circumstance if one is measuring it by free enterprise trading principles. In that context I think it is valuable to look at the words of Andrew Robb, the Executive Director of the Cattle Council of Australia, to a recent convention of the Livestock and Grain Producers Association. Mr Robb looked at this argument that has been used against orderly marketing by producers, government and all sorts of people on the grounds that we must not upset the free enterprise system. Mr Robb said:</PARA>
<PARA> Much of our marketing system-whether responsible for marketing either livestock or meat products-reflects a trading climate long gone, a system very outdated. </PARA>
<PARA> Significant sections of this sector have been bound by deep conservatism, extreme reluctance to change and a blind faith in the status quo which, for the sake of confusion, is invariably termed free enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> I'm afraid I see little to resemble the elements of competition and excellence of true free enterprise:</PARA>
<PARA> In the arrival at saleyard auction of the one carload of buyers;</PARA>
<PARA> in the existence of one meatworks within hundreds of miles and no reliable basis for comparing prices elsewhere;</PARA>
<PARA> in the use of a single buying position by overseas countries to force a scramble of price cutting by our exporters;</PARA>
<PARA> in the consistent failure of some operators to provide the quality ordered by our customers, and</PARA>
<PARA> in the failure of our marketing system as a whole to achieve anywhere near the sophistication of merchandising in many other fields. </PARA>
<PARA> Our ability to compete is further hamstrung by a union movement which still fails to see any connection between the loss of 10,000 meatworker jobs over recent years and an internationally unique industrial award. An award which effectively limits the utilisation of our multi-million dollar meatworks to around one-third capacity, so adding literally millions to slaughter costs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind about our inability to master the trading climate confronting us unless major changes continue to be effected in relation to meat and livestock marketing and industrial co-operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those are the words of Andrew Robb, the Executive Director of the Cattle Council of Australia. I recommend the speech, which was made on 13 May 1982, to Senator Siddons. I suspect that he received a copy of it in his mail at Parliament House this week. I think that Mr Robb put the position particularly succinctly. There was nothing new in that. He put the position well but it is not new. That is what sections of the beef industry have been saying for years about the system of marketing in Australia both for the domestic consumer and for export. The Cattlemen's Union, an organisation that people confidently predicted, firstly, would not last two years when it started and, secondly, would wither and die once the price of beef went up at all, was saying those things and was desperately trying to attract public and political attention five years ago and before when the beef recession first started. I hope those words do not have to be repeated for very much longer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation well in its venture as a single trader on the export market. I hope very much that it will take its role and its responsibility extremely seriously and put every professional resource that it can muster into that exercise. We have been used and abused as a meat trading nation by many of our buyers for several years now. It is catastrophic for many producers, past and present, that this has been allowed to continue for so long. What of the future? Who can say? I hope that Mr Jones, the present Chairman of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, will bend his undoubted talents to the tasks set for him by the Government. He has not been a supporter of the single trading authority of the AMLC, in the past. I hope he has genuinely changed his mind. Whether he has or not, it is now the charter of the Corporation and it must meet the challenge put to it. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot allow this industry which presently earns us hundreds of millions of dollars a year and export credit-it earns that not at its peak; it could earn us much more indeed-to flounder along for want of professional support in marketing . We cannot allow it to wonder about the method of trading in the export area. We certainly cannot allow it to doubt the resolve of government to keep it in its proper place as a major export earning industry for Australia. We cannot allow the people in it to doubt that governments, present and future, will do anything other than keep faith with the producers, meatworkers, processors and exporters and the whole network of the beef trade industry to make sure that this remains the critically important industry it is in so many of our lowly populated, underdeveloped areas of Australia. I commend the Bills to the Senate. I see them as a worthwhile step. I hope they are the first of a series of steps to give our beef industry the strength and support that it deserves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In discussing the matters related to the meat industry and the export of its products I think we should have some regard to some of the plans which are at present being mooted for new proposals to overcome some of the very real problems which have existed in that industry. One of the people who have received considerable publicity recently for certain proposals, as Senator Walsh indicated when speaking earlier tonight, is Sir William Gunn. I believe it is important for us to have some regard to the track record of Sir William Gunn when we consider the proposals he is putting forward. I would describe the track record as being one of a man who has behaved in a way which indicates that he has put forward positive statements which have been ill- considered, ill-advised and inadequately researched.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I use as one example an experience I have had and that is that on, I understand , 6 December last year Sir William Gunn chose to hold a Press conference in Melbourne and to tell the media representatives who attended, amongst other things, what unforgivable behaviour a Senate committee had been involved in. In fact, I would like to read very briefly a report of that Press conference which has not been denied by Sir William, although he has had the opportunity to do so and has had it drawn to his attention. The heading in the Advertiser newspaper of 8 December 1981 was: 'Treatment was ''unforgivable'' '. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Rae Committee's treatment of the former chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation, Mr Tony Webster, was unforgivable, according to Sir William Gunn.</PARA>
<PARA> Sir William, long-time wool industry leader and IWS chairman, said last week he did not think Mr Webster had done anything wrong, nor anything that would not have been approved of in a private enterprise atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA> 'If this is the kind of thing the Rae committee is going to do, blacken people who have done an outstanding job for an industry, all because of a few thousand dollars on an expense account, then we will soon have no-one who will lead or even want to sit on the boards (of statutory authorities)', Sir William said. </PARA>
<PARA> Already, some of the non-producer members of such boards were 'getting a bit jack of it' and wondered what they were doing sitting on boards likely to be exposed to the Rae committee. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The committee (the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, headed by Senator Peter Rae) is making the organisations nervous and they are becoming too cautious,' Sir William said. </PARA>
<PARA>Having had that drawn to my attention, I wrote to Sir William Gunn. My letter was dated 23 December 1981, and it reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir William,</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that at a press conference which you held in Melbourne on or about 6th December, you made statements which were reported inter alia in the Adelaide 'Advertiser', a copy of which report I enclose. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not choose to debate with you the question of moral and ethical standards in relation to business behaviour, but do believe that if you are going to make the statements which you were reported as having made, you should at least get your facts straight. </PARA>
<PARA> You are quoted as stating that my Committee's behaviour was unforgivable in relation to the treatment given to Mr Tony Webster. </PARA>
<PARA> You state that the Committee's actions were, in this case, to 'blacken people who have done an outstanding job for an industry, all because of a few thousand dollars on an expense account'. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Auditor-General raised the expense account issue. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Minister ordered the investigation by the Auditor-General under Section 63P of the Audit Act and later the police inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Committee stated to the Senate at the commencement of its inquiry, through the hearings, and in its Report, Chapter 1.9 that:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Committee has studiously avoided seeking evidence which may have impinged upon the matters which were the subject of police investigation. The Committee was conscious that the Minister for Primary Industry had stated his intention to make a full report to the Parliament after the completion of the police investigations.'</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Mr Webster, when giving evidence to the Committee was not asked--</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that 'was not asked'-</PARA>
<PARA> and did not give evidence in relation to the expense account issues being investigated by the Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The Committee did not refer to those matters in its Report. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. It was the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, who made a statement to the House of Representatives relating to Mr Webster and the results of the Auditor-General's and Police inquiry which the successive Ministers had caused to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. It was the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, and the Minister for Communications, Mr Sinclair, who made references to Mr Webster during the parliamentary debate. Those statements caused me, as Chairman of the Senate Committee, to state in the Senate my concern that Mr Webster was not being fairly treated by those Country Party Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this information would have been available to you had you chosen, before making your outburst, to check the Committee's Report and the Hansards of the Committee's inquiry, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Your statements were totally without foundation, they were untrue, and they are defamatory of me and my Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> To have criticised the Committee for what they did would be one thing, and I do not object to healthy debate. For you to use the language which you did, claiming to justify it upon the basis of what, in fact, the Committee very carefully refrained from doing, and which should and must have been known to you , can only lead me to believe that you have deliberately attempted to mislead the press conference, and for some reason unknown to me, have set out to defame the Committee. It is a possible conclusion that this is part of the concerted plan, as it is not the only instance on which this totally untrue allegation has been made. Whether you are party to, or merely a victim of that planned exercise , is a matter in relation to which I leave you to comment. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is some other explanation, then I will be prepared to consider it. However, at the very least, I require a full and public apology from you to both the Committee and to me. That apology should be given the same publication as was the original statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to hearing from you as to the steps which you propose to take and any exculpatory factors which should be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA>I have had no response to that letter. I have nothing but contempt for a man who is so without intestinal fortitude that when he has been demonstrably shown to be wrong he does not even have the decency to respond by saying: 'I am sorry; I did not check my facts'. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that I defended Mr Webster in this chamber against absolutely unfounded attacks which were made upon him in the House of Representatives. It is ironical in the extreme that I personally and the Committee which I chaired should be attacked by the likes of Sir William Gunn for doing the very thing which the Committee very carefully refrained from doing and which it went out of its way to ensure that it did not do. This man is parading around Australia at the moment pretending to be the leader of a new scheme to get Australia out of its problems but demonstrably, from his whole track record and, in particular, the things to which I have just referred, he has made the following cardinal errors: Firstly, of attacking without checking his facts; secondly, of accepting self-serving scuttle-butt as objective and reliable when it should not be accepted; thirdly, of not being prepared to admit that he was wrong, that he had made a demonstrable error; and fourthly, of proceeding in a pigheaded way notwithstanding the facts. Such a man has an intrinsic credibility problem. Before his latest plan is given credibility people should have regard to his track record, not only what I have just mentioned but also the fact that I did not sue him for defamation because I did not believe money would be well spent in obtaining a judgment. I will put it that way and take it no further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a group of Bills-the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill, the Export Control Bill and the Export Control (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill. I use language a little loosely because I think the debate has been a little wider than the subject matter of the Bills. However, I note from the rather wide debate which has occurred that there is substantial support from all parties on these measures. I think the Opposition, the Australian Democrats and Government supporters have all spoken in favour of these measures. That being the case, I do no more than remind the chamber that the purpose of the Export Control Bill is merely to establish a new and comprehensive legislative base for export inspection and control responsibilities within the portfolio of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). The Export Control (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill introduces amendments which are consequential to the introduction of the Export Control Bill. The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill strengthens the Corporation's control over Australia' s export trade and in particular enables the Corporation, in very specific circumstances, to adopt the role of a sole trader or to limit the number of licensees that may trade with a particular overseas market.

<PARA>I believe that Senator Tate wishes to speak, so I will be brief. Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 7 refer to registered premises. Whereas in the actual definition registered premises are indeed premises to be registered, nowhere else in the Bill can one manage to discover any interesting facts about them, which I believe leads one to wonder just what is in fact going on with them. For example , why are the premises to be registered, what are they to be registered for, how are they to be registered, what advantages accrue as a result of that registration and why should they be able to be entered without a warrant?</PARA>
<PARA> A reference in paragraph 207 of the Law Reform Commission's criminal investigation report No. 2 suggests that the power to detain and search suspected persons or vehicles should be restricted in its application to customs areas, which would be defined to include ports, wharves, dock-side warehouses, customs halls, airport aprons and their environs. I seek from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) an answer as to what precisely is the intention of the Government to register premises and whether that relates to the Law Reform Commission's reference to customs areas. The important questions are as to why they are to be entered without warrant and what is the intention of the Government in putting such an item in this Bill. I must admit that I have really raised these questions because I am puzzled about precisely what is going on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is not supporting amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 7 which Senator Macklin has moved. Essentially the requirement is for a search warrant for the entry of registered premises. There are two reasons for our decision not to support the amendments. Firstly, if a premise is registered and therefore has conferred upon it some sort of privilege , it seems to be logical that it ought to be subject to inspection to make sure it is abiding by the conditions under which that privilege is granted. Secondly, given the recent proven malpractice which has occurred in some meat export establishments, it seems to be an unacceptable interference with the efficiency of the inspection service to require a search warrant for entry to premises.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I want to point out to honourable senators that the Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills considered these provisions of the Export Control Bill 1982 and the Australian Meat and Live- stock Corporation Amendment Bill 1982. Indeed, it alerted honourable senators, by means of Alert Digest No. 6, to the fact that under clause 10 an authorised officer could enter registered premises in the way that has been outlined by Senator Macklin. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee was particularly concerned that forcible entry may be effected by an authorised officer. Therefore, it wrote to Senator Chaney as the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in this place. The Committee received a reply from Senator Chaney which indicated to the Committee-I will not go into the reply in detail because honourable senators can read the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's report No. 7-that to achieve forcible entry a further separate provision would be required and that that was not a danger under the present legislative provisions. Therefore, the Committee took the view that it would not press the matter any further. At that stage, I was Acting Chairman of the Committee. I replied to Senator Chaney-I want to put this on the record of this place-at that time. I think it was the first occasion on which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee had received such a response from a Minister to an Alert Digest entry. Having received his explanation, at the conclusion of my letter I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> May I say that I very much appreciate the obvious trouble to which you have gone in responding to the Alert Digest, and I believe it is the realisation of the hope of those who supported the establishment of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Tate for his comments. Senator Tate may or may not have seen the personal note that I appended to my original letter. I wrote it in some trepidation. The Standing Committee on Scrutiny of Bills is a new committee and I was not sure how it would receive views from the Executive Government in the course of its deliberations. I wrote a personal note to the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Alan Missen, who was then absent, in words to the effect that if it was out of order he might like to return it to me. I am pleased that the Committee thought that this was a benign act and not an intimidatory one. The letter I wrote set out the reasoning behind the Government's belief that, as a matter of policy, there ought to be a power to enter registered premises. The actual registration of premises is a matter which is to be governed by regulation. Clearly, when one looks at the objects of the legislation, to provide for the control and export of certain goods and for related purposes-one is looking at premises which are registered for purposes related to the export of goods. If people are to seek permission to enter into the export trade and we are to have a system of inspectors who will ensure that conditions are met-one has to bear in mind, as Senator Walsh has said, the recent history of this matter-it seems to be a matter of logic that inspectors should have right of entry to premises which have been brought forward specifically as premises which are to be registered for this purpose. Inspectors who are to make sure that the premises comply with requirements should have a right of entry. Paragraph (b) of clause 10 (3) states that an authorised officer may enter any other premises with the consent of the occupier or in pursuance of a warrant. But the Government suggests that it is reasonable and is not an undue trespass on liberty to have permission to enter registered premises-not to make forcible entry but to enter registered premises without a warrant.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the explanation that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has given goes part way towards meeting what is set out in my amendments. I wonder whether it would have been possible to give more detail in the Bill itself. I believe that, elucidatory information being given elsewhere in the Bill, the provision giving the right of entry to registered premises is not necessarily a good provision. I do not believe that the provision allowing regulations to be made in this respect is terribly appropriate either. However, I accept fully that what the Minister has put forward is appropriate. I presume that a person seeking the registration of premises implicitly gives permission for the premises to be entered. Therefore, what is proposed in the Bill seems to be a perfectly reasonable proposition. For that reason, and in light of the Minister's reply, it is probably best if I do not press my amendments.

<PARA>Amendments Nos. 3 to 6 are of a technical nature. They refer to clause 10 (3), about which previous discussion took place. That sub-clause states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of performing the function of an authorized officer under this section or exercising a power of an authorized officer under section 11, an authorized officer may, with such assistance as he thinks necessary-</PARA>
<PARA>Then there is a list-paragraphs (a) to (k)-of what he may do. For example, paragraph (a) refers to entering registered premises. A problem arises in relation to the possibility, presumably, under paragraph (g) whereby an officer may inspect and examine any premises and, under paragraph (e), search any premises. It would be assumed-I seek reassurance on this point; this is the reason these amendments have been put forward-that the powers in relation to the searching, inspection, examination and securing of such premises could be done only pursuant to the powers of entry set out elsewhere in this section. It is not clear that this is necessarily the case. I seek the advice of the Minister in relation to that matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will oppose these amendments, not on the grounds that it has any objection in principle to the point asserted by Senator Macklin, but simply because it is not necessary to insert those words to achieve the objective. The reference to premises in clause 10 (3) (e) relates to a search which does not give rise to any independent right of entry, in the view of the Government. In other words, one is not looking at a situation in which one could illegally enter and then claim the protection of clause 10 (3) (e). The entry provisions are in paragraph (a), which we previously dealt with. An officer may enter registered premises or other premises with the consent of the occupier or in pursuance of a warrant. No one has any objection to that. The later provisions relate to what an officer may do after entry and do not amount to a separate authority for entry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is on that basis that I oppose the amendment and request Senator Macklin again to take the course that he recently followed. Were we in a position in which the Export Control Bill was going back to the House of Representatives anyway, I might take the view that it does not really matter because the amendment, at worst, is redundant; it makes explicit what is presently implicit. On previous occasions when dealing with amendments of this sort I have agreed, when they simply make the meaning doubly clear, that the objective be attained. I ask the Committee not to follow that course in this case because of the delay which would be occasioned and which I do not believe is warranted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make an explanation. I stated during the debate at the second reading stage that the Opposition would support some of the amendments which Senator Macklin moved. The reasons for that stated intention of support were those which Senator Chaney has given; that is, as we saw them, the proposed amendments made explicit what in my layman's opinion was implicit in the original Bill. Evidently that layman's opinion is confirmed by professional opinion. However, I have since taken note of the fact that if these amendments, acceptable in principle though they are, were to be carried tonight the enactment of the Export Control Bill would be delayed until the Budget session of the Parliament. For those reasons we have decided not to support the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (8) Page 8, clause 11, after sub-section (3), add the following sub-clauses:</PARA>
<PARA> '(4) An application may be made to the Secretary by the owner of any goods, matters or things seized under sub-section (1) for the release to the owner of those goods, matters or things. </PARA>
<PARA> '(5) An application may be made to the Administrative Appeal Tribunal for a review of a refusal by the Secretary of an application made under sub-section (4 ). </PARA>
<PARA> '(6) For the purpose of sub-section (5), where the Secretary has not acceded to an application under sub-section (4) within 10 days after that application has been made, he shall be deemed to have refused that application.'. </PARA>
<PARA>The last of the amendments is Amendment No. 8, which relates to the seizure of goods and the right of appeal in relation to the seizure of goods. I have sought to provide a right of appeal where the Secretary refuses to give up, within the 60 days set out in the Bill, goods which have been seized. The problem that I see here does not relate so much to larger organisations-that amount of time may not unduly concern them-but rather to smaller businesses from which the seizure of certain goods could very well be the end of that business or, if not the end, seriously damage a person's livelihood. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases there may be only a one-off importation of particular goods for a business and that delay could be sufficient to take that business to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA> At that point one could well ask: Why has a person not been given the ability to make an appeal? One possible reply is that an appeal may take 60 days before it is heard. I do not think that that is necessarily so. At least there is not a necessary connection between that time and the time to make an appeal against the seizure of the goods. I seek the Minister's explanation as to why the Government has considered that 60 days is perfectly adequate and how it proposes to meet the problem faced by a small business when possibly the majority of the goods needed for its operation are seized. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the courteous exchange of correspondence between the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills there was eventually no meeting of minds. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee is of the same view as Senator Macklin, namely, that we have a situation here in which the seizure of goods for up to 60 days without an appeal against the refusal of the Secretary to return those goods could create a situation in which the business could be very severely impaired or even completely put to the wall, to use Senator Macklin's colloquial expression. The Committee alerted honourable senators and indeed the Executive, as it turned out, to this possibility in the Alert Digest. After receiving a reply from the Minister the Committee undertook a further investigation and found that its point of view was the same as that which had been adopted by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances in its thirtieth report to the Parliament relating to a Norfolk Island ordinance. In that case a health inspector could remove any item from a hairdressing establishment-this is some way apart from the problem with which we are confronted in this legislation but the analogy holds-and hold it for up to 14 days, once again without any right of appeal to the owner of the hairdressing establishment to recover that item, an item which the Regulations and Ordinances Committee thought could be essential to carrying on the business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Regulations and Ordinances Committee recognised, as we recognise, that this power would probably not be exercised in an arbitrary manner, but nevertheless the danger is there. The Secretary may-indeed he is not required to give any reason why he is refusing to return the seized item from, for example, a meatworks or prescribed premises-for reasons which are completely inaccessible, refuse to return those items that have been seized and thus bring about the severe impairing of a commercial undertaking and maybe its destruction. Therefore the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, in its report No. 7, alerts honourable senators to the fact that this provision might well be regarded as unduly trespassing on or interfering with rights and liberties. I would like to press the matter further but, given the fact that we are in an untenable position, to amend this provision would be to defer the passage of this most important legislation because the House of Representatives cannot receive it from us for its consideration. Therefore we are forced to make our comments and resume our seats. However, we hope that in a more leisurely moment, when both Houses are sitting in the next session, this matter can be addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that we will deal with this amendment not because of any undue pressure but because the logic of the position, I believe, supports its defeat and the maintenance of the status quo. I will take just a couple of minutes to explain why I think that is so. I first draw from Senator Tate's remarks the confirmation that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is looking at areas where there is a possibility that provisions may unduly trespass on individual rights and liberties. That involves in each case an exercise of judgment and I have been grateful for the way in which the Committee has exercised its responsibilities so far in simply drawing to the attention of the Senate possibilities which require consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is well known that in many cases we do things which certainly affect the rights and liberties of the subject. Frequently, for example, in legislation we reverse the onus of proof. On hundreds of occasions, I suppose, I have taken prosecutions under section 220 of the Health Act in Western Australia, which puts the onus on the defendant to show, once certain things have been established, that food is of the nature, substance and quality demanded by the purchaser. There was a reversal of onus because in the enforcement of the rules of hygeine, pure food laws and so on it was seen that the defendant was in the best position to provide the evidence. The onus of proof was reversed. I do not believe that that unduly trespassed on individual rights and liberties. Commonwealth legislation in the same way is full of such provisions. We are asked to look at them and ask whether they are justified in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> Here we are dealing with legislation which concerns a major Australian industry , an industry which we are painfully and recently aware can be besmirched by the actions of a tiny minority. It is a serious business for Australia and we are looking at the situation in which there can be great public risk. The Senate Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills has, I think, very properly drawn our attention to this and said: 'Well, look. Is it possible to reduce the disadvantages which can be suffered?' It draws some comfort from the views of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances on an ordinance affecting Norfolk Island but there is a distinction, I think, between those two ordinances which is evident in the report of the Committee. That distinction is that the Norfolk Island ordinance involves the inspector directly enforcing the provisions. In other words, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee was concerned about the lack of any control over a man who was directly exercising the power to enforce what was contained in the ordinance. In this case we are looking at a situation in which authorised officers are trying to ascertain whether there have been breaches of the law. They are engaged in an exercise which, if it seems that the law has been breached, will take us into the courts to establish that a breach has in fact occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree that there can be difficulties here for defendants or for persons whose goods are seized. I am not denying that for a moment. I am asking whether the difficulty is beyond that which should reasonably be imposed in these circumstances. We have examined the position and taken advice from our professional advisers to see whether they think that the provision could be reduced in some way. For example, could the time of the seizure or the time in which some action must be taken be reduced? I refer to the advice that was given . We looked, for example, at the proposition of perhaps a 30-day provision with the power for it to be extended by a court. Our advice is that any period less than 60 days could well be inadequate for proper investigation to be carried out to enable a determination whether a prosecution should be instituted. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the structure of the clause itself, which is not a direct enforcement section but a prelude to court proceedings or the discovery of a breach which is different from the Norfolk Island situation, and when we look at the significance of this trade and at the now, unfortunately, established fact that the actions of a small number of people can do such major harm to the reputation of the industry and potentially great economic harm to Australia, I think that the disadvantages in the section appear to be warranted. I would suggest that in all these things it is a matter of judgment. To my mind the judgment in this case is one that the Senate can make without feeling it is unduly trespassing on the rights and liberties of the subject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 is not opposed by the Opposition, although we will move an amendment which, while drawing to the attention of this chamber shortcomings in the legislation, will not prevent its passage. Since 1976 I have been the Opposition spokesman on health in this chamber. In that time I have witnessed five attempts by the Government to introduce a health insurance scheme and health program which works . All these schemes have failed, as the Opposition had said they would. They have all needed amendments to cope with inequities and ambiguities, as this schemes does, and as this legislation attempts to do. Even so, the scheme, like its predecessors, is headed for failure. The basic problem has always been that the Government has, in designing health programs and health insurance schemes, tried to perform the impossible. It has tried to placate the health insurance funds which supported it at election time with money and manpower-a greedy approach, I suggest, of 'If you will scratch my back I will scratch yours'-which resulted in the insertion in the legislation of sections which led to notorious rip-offs and anti-social behaviour on the part of people running some of these funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the Government has tried to cope with and listen to the extremists on the right of the medical profession, those who particularly abound in such organisations as the General Practitioners Society in Australia and the Australian Association of Surgeons, groups which I must add by no means represent a majority of the medical profession. These people are members of the same groups which in the past have started such organisations as the Workers Party and the Progress Party. They are vigorous supporters of all the right-wing and extremist causes, such as support for South Africa and apartheid, but above all they believe that the free market system is the best means of providing medical services in Australia. Indeed, why should they not do so? It is this market in which they and only they, the providers of services, know what is going on and over which they therefore are in a position to have full control. They have a monopoly of supply and information in the delivery of medical services, which causes so many of our problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us on this side of the chamber who have pointed out the fallacy and the danger of such a situation in health are pleased that at least it seems that at last the Government agrees with us. The problems facing the profession in the practice of medicine and in the control of the delivery of health services were put by Senator Sir John Carrick in introducing this Bill in words which could well have been used by Opposition senators in the past five years. On page 1847 of the Senate Hansard of 5 May it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In commercial terms, medical practitioners are in a virtually unique position. The financial structure of their practices is largely underwritten by the medical benefits scheme which is publicly financed through both taxation and medical benefits fund contributions. Furthermore, most patients are generally not in a position to question the correctness of medical accounts. </PARA>
<PARA>Or the correctness of medical procedures. The speech continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The operation of the medical benefits scheme is therefore very heavily dependent upon the trustworthiness of medical practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA>We cannot have a free market situation in health. The seller-in this case, the doctor-has all the knowledge and the buyer is not in a position to know, nor in most cases to have any idea of the justification or the costs of the procedures per- formed. Yet we have had repeatedly brought out in this chamber the old canard that by controlling the patient we will control the services delivered and therefore we will control the cost. This legislation at least recognises that this is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has differing and unrelated purposes, as have all omnibus Bills of this type. It provides for the inclusion of the mumps vaccine in the nation's vaccination program, a procedure which the Opposition certainly will agree to. Apart from being a dangerous and very inconvenient disease in some circumstances the success of such a vaccination scheme would make life much easier for all post-pubertal boys who seem to have great anxiety about the incidence of this disease in the community. Therefore, of course the Opposition does not oppose this. The Bill also provides for the tightening up of provisions dealing with medical fraud and makes the operation of committees which look at the medical overservicing in this community more effective. The Opposition does not oppose these provisions but believes that they could be improved and that in the future they will have to be improved. The legislation introduces a series of amendments to the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act to cover certain technical anomalies in the present system. </PARA>
<PARA> Most interest in this legislation is directed to those sections which deal with fraud and overservicing. There was a time in this place when any mention of fraudulent behaviour, or even of overservicing, by members of the medical profession was greeted with screams of 'doctor bashing' by my Tasmanian colleague Senator Walters who I notice is on the list of speakers tonight. I hope that tonight she will at least recognise that there is some overservicing, that there is some fraudulent behaviour by doctors, that we have to do something about that and that the Government is attempting to do something about it. The Government and the Australian Medical Association recognise that this occurs. It has been claimed that some 2,500 doctors, or 10 per cent of the doctors in this country, were in some way defrauding the Government or overservicing and that 900, or 4 per cent, were involved in major fraud. This may seem a small number. It recognises the fact that most of my medical colleagues do not indulge in such practices. Such practices did not start with the introduction of Medibank, as some people are wont to claim. Medibank, in tightening up the procedures, certainly made detection of such fraud easier and drew attention to its occurrence in a way that had not been done before. </PARA>
<PARA> The only certain way, I suggest, of reducing the level of this anti-social and criminal behaviour is, firstly, by increasing to as near as possible to 100 per cent the possibility of detection of fraud and, secondly, by making the penalties for the same sufficient to be a deterrent. Insofar as this legislation is a move in the right direction, we welcome it. We believe it could have gone further, hence our amendment. But within the present system it is certainly an improvement on what has gone before. To overcome fraud there has been an administrative tightening up of the procedures for recording accounts and item numbers. The profile procedures of the Department of Health will be more effective than they have been in the past. The penalty of ineligibility for medical benefits for three years after two offences of fraud are committed is a potent one if it can be applied without too much difficulty because of technicalities in the courts or too many delays in the courts' procedures. It is worth pointing out that the Department's discussion paper, which we acquired through various means earlier this year and which has received considerable publicity, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In comparing the extent of fraud perpetrated by members of the medical profession, and the extent perpetrated by the public, the latter pales to insignificance. An independent observer could not fail to be concerned about both the success rate of medical profession vis a vis public prosecutions and the relative weight of penalties imposed on members of the medical profession vis a vis members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have a problem. The problem is, first of all, detecting the fraud; secondly, securing conviction; and thirdly, applying reasonable penalties. A colleague in another place, Dr Neal Blewett, and other members of this Parliament have pointed out the difference in attitude of people in this Parliament and the community toward that very small number of people who defraud the social security system, sometimes unintentionally, of very small amounts and to the greater percentage who defraud the medical health insurance system for very much larger amounts. Those who continuously cry from the roof-tops and from the tree-tops about problems created by the supporting parents benefit or unemployment benefit frequently remain mute in regard to the much greater fraud perpetrated by the otherwise socially respectable people who indulge in it in these cases. They get away with it not only because of community attitudes but also because of the complexity of the cases, the number of items involved, the inadequacy of the investigating procedures and the extraordinary rulings by some of the courts. I refer to the Queensland case, which is known to some of us, whereby the court ruled that a doctor did not have to attend a patient to perform a service in a clinical situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that many of these difficulties will remain because we are dealing with a complex area of white collar crime where the normal processes of the law are sometimes inefficient and sometimes inappropriate. The individual cases can be proceeded with difficulty but they can be proceeded with successfully. But they must be proceeded with on an individual basis. The total enormity of someone's malpractices, in fact, may not be obvious to those who have to sit in judgment in this situation. It is for that reason that we favour the production of generalised and technological evidence from the computer files to allow some measure of the magnitude of the crime to be presented to the courts. We believe this should be done after the conviction but before the sentence. We believe, of course, that the person charged should be allowed to refute or rebut the evidence in that situation. It is an unusual procedure; it is not a unique procedure, but it is a procedure which we believe is worth considering in this situation, hence its addition in our amendment. Such a proposal may be a change but, as I have said, it is not new. It has been suggested by the Government's advisers and we believe the Government should have given it more thought. </PARA>
<PARA> Another possibility which apparently has not been considered by the Government is to use the method of involving small but varying numbers of consumers-that is patients-in spot checks to verify the procedures for which they, the health funds and the taxpayers have to be billed. This method is used in Canada. It is used in some countries in Western Europe and not only acts as a means of detecting fraud but also, we believe, acts as a means of deterring fraud, hence our inclusion of it in the amendment. The amendment does not prevent the passage of the Bill but we believe it draws the attention of this chamber and of the public to ways which will have to be, to say the least, considered and which will have to be looked at in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased powers over the activities of health funds, which are also part of this legislation, are needed but I believe they also do not go far enough. We still remain with the system whereby those who contribute to these funds, which are licensed and allegedly regulated by the Government, in the belief that they are protecting themselves from the costs of health care and who do so because, under the present system, they are in fact more or less compelled to, have no guarantee that the funds will continue in service. They have no guarantee that they will have any protection if the funds collapse. Despite the changes in this legislation we still have the situation in which we could have a repeat of the collapse of the Druids scheme which occurred in Tasmania and affected people largely from the region of Tasmania from which I came. In that area there have been very severe economic effects on patients, hospitals and doctors. Yet those who were responsible for the management of that fund and who abused the trust with which the contributors had put their money in the fund, in fact, have got off scot-free. I dare say that unless the reports on that organisation are released publicly they will continue to get off scot-free. </PARA>
<PARA> Although we do not oppose the passage of this legislation because of the improvements it makes in this difficult area, we believe it is only one step along the road to overcoming the very real problems which face patients, taxpayers and contributors to health funds in this community. It is only one step towards overcoming the problems faced by that small group of people who will continue to defraud the system. Until recently there was a great reluctance to recognise that small group of people. Also we believe that further legislation will be necessary to ensure that the health funds under this system are working efficiently and that the people who contribute to them are protected . </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in the long run whatever changes are made to this health insurance scheme and the system of health care delivery will not be effective in providing equity and justice to the people who deserve it. They will not be effective in providing a health insurance scheme which is available to all at a reasonable cost. They will not be effective in providing a health scheme in which people will be completely free from the fear of the costs of health care, as people are in some other countries. They will not be successful because the basic premise on which Government and the present Minister operate, even though the Government has modified it, is one in which the Minister and his colleagues believe that the most appropriate way to deliver health care is in some sort of free market situation, as though it were a bazaar in which people could barter for their services. As long as that attitude persists-it is an attitude which has long been dropped in most Western civilisations-we shall have a health scheme that is ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA> For the small benefits and improvements that this legislation provides, we are grateful, and I am sure that the community will be grateful. But in the long run we shall need a sixth scheme, a scheme which is much better than the present one . As I say, we do not oppose the legislation. I move the amendment in the hope that it will draw the Government's attention to the difficulties that it still faces. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the following additional measures are necessary to combat medical fraud:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) elimination of technical ambiguities hampering the courts;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) provisions for admitting generalised evidence to the courts after conviction on specific charges but prior to sentencing, with full opportunity for the convicted practitioner to counter the evidence, and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) adoption of verification procedures through medical consumers'. </PARA>
<PARA>I have no reason to delay the Senate further tonight, or to delay the legislation further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the nice things about belonging to a party, the Australian Democrats, which forms neither the Government nor the official Opposition is that one does not get oneself locked into a position of having either to oppose viciously some legislation for the sake of opposing it, or, if one intends to support it, to do so in the rather churlish double negative of not opposing it and then spending three-quarters of one's speech complaining on matters of philosophy surrounding the legislation. In the interests of getting the Senate up as quickly as possible tonight, and in the rather cowardly self-interest of not wishing to get caught in the crossfire which is inevitable between Senators Walters and Grimes, it is my intention not to canvass various matters of philosophy with regard to health policy. I shall not canvass the question of the 'user pays' principle versus the idea that the community ought to pay for the health of the inhabitants of this country. I shall not decide whether it is a large or a small minority of doctors who are abusing the system. I shall not canvass the question whether Medibank, Marks I to VII, or Medicare, son of Medibank, or any other sort of private system is really the best way of running health care in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I should like to do tonight, instead, is to adopt the rather novel approach of directing my attention and that of the Senate to the legislation before us. It is, in fact, not the same piece of legislation which was first introduced on 25 March of this year to the House of Representatives by the present Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt), who made the second reading on that day. The Bill as it is before us intends to establish the same principles as the Bill that appeared on 25 March. It is just that it does it in a slightly more streamlined way and in a way which does not contravene individual liberties to the extent that the original Bill-inadvertently, I am sure-seemed to do. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Grimes has already pointed out, at some length, there are basically four elements to the Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 as already amended by the Government in the lower House. Three of the amendments are relatively minor. There is provision for the availability of free vaccine for immunisation against the disease of mumps. This aim is proposed to be achieved by combining the measles-mumps vaccine in those cases in which the single measles vaccine is provided. Since men are the ones who run around getting themselves so terribly upset about the possibility of catching mumps I am astounded, since the Parliament and the bureaucracy are largely made up of men, that we have not had this piece of legislation introduced before now. I suggest it is highly likely, since the majority of doctors in the community are men, that there will be more occasions on which the doctor will suggest to the mother of a boy that he be immunised against measles-mumps than that same doctor will suggest that the daughters in the same family be immunised against rubella. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly hope I am. I understand that governments, both State and Federal, are taking a great deal of interest in advertising rubella injections, and for that I commend them. I am not casting any aspersions at all on the aims of the Government or the Department of Health. I am simply making what is, I think, a perfectly accurate statement and that is that human nature being what it is many male doctors do forget the problems that many women and girls suffer from. Perhaps it is a little cynical but I do not think it is any the less true for that. The second minor amendment in this Bill refers to administrative streamlining concerning the issue of health care cards to people in the low income category which makes simpler the process by which there is continued eligibility for a disadvantaged person. The third provision provides for time limits to be imposed on the lodgement of claims for Commonwealth medical benefits, and there is a variety of good reasons for doing this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fourth provision is the most important. It is the one that Senator Grimes spent most of his time discussing and the one that I will spend the majority of these comments canvassing. This part of the legislation turns its attention to the community concern that has been engendered recently through the media across the country about what is commonly described as medical fraud, particularly by medical practitioners, through the benefits system. The Bill before us contains measures which, it is hoped, will provide a very strong deterrent for such abuse . In fact the Bill as it now stands probably provides a better means of deterrent than the original Bill did. I am not a member of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and I have not taken as great an interest in it as my colleague Senator Macklin. I note that Mr Fife, the Minister who presented the amendments in another place, made the comment in his speech in the Committee stage on this amendment that the Government has been receptive to representations received on this matter. It pleases me to note that not only did the criticisms on the original clause come from groups such as the Australian Medical Association, which again is to be commended for its interest in the question of the medical practitioner fraud, but also from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I take this opportunity to commend that Committee for the wok that it has done. Mr Fife said:</PARA>
<PARA> It has now been decided that in view of problems that could be caused by the operation of the provisions as presently constructed--</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the original piece of legislation-</PARA>
<PARA>different procedures whereby patients of the disqualified practitioner could be advised of the particulars and effects of the disqualifications, should be adopted. It is felt that the provisions as presently drafted could infringe a person's rights to have his or her previous dealings with the medical practitioner remain confidential. Under the amendment now proposed the Minister for Health will be given the power to direct a convicted practitioner not to render any professional services to which a disqualification applies unless he has first taken steps to advise the person concerned of the particulars and effects of the practitioner's disqualification. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of Senator Grimes's somewhat unnecessary comments earlier tonight, I will quote from the comments made by Dr Blewett in another place following Mr Fife's comments about the amendment. Dr Blewett said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition strongly supports the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>It is nice to see the official Opposition strongly supporting something instead of just not opposing it. Dr Blewett said:</PARA>
<PARA> It raises an extremely difficult issue which occurs in all such cases as the one with which we are now dealing. We are all committed to a firm sanction against doctors who commit fraud. At the same time, we have the problem of guarding the rights and interests of the patients. It is very difficult to secure this kind of balance. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed it is. It is something that the Australian Medical Association recognised . That organisation has been conferring on the matter of doctors' fraud for, to the best of my knowledge, the last five years. As recently as 3 February, the current President of the AMA, Dr Lionel Wilson, made a public statement which appeared in most newspapers in this country calling upon the Commonwealth Government to overhaul the system of dealing with suspected offenders because the current methods for dealing with fraud and overservicing by doctors have proved, in his words, totally inadequate. In making that statement, Dr Wilson offered the Association's full support in such an overhaul. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed in today's newspapers bold headlines again accusing private hospitals and some of the doctors associated with them of fraud. The headlines are not likely to engender any increased confidence in some sections of the medical profession in the community. That, if for no other reason, is sufficient justification for this Government, or any other government for that matter, taking steps to do something about it. Everybody who speaks on this subject points out that only a minority of doctors are tarring the whole profession with a very unpleasant brush. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is also a topic which has come up before the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes. We are all concerned that people in positions of trust such as doctors and lawyers can, as a group and as a profession, be called into disrepute simply because of the self-aggrandisement and self-interest of a few who have not only lost touch with reality in their all-consuming race for increased wealth and status, but also lost touch with people. It is bad for the profession and it is bad for the community. The Australian Democrats are, therefore, prepared openly and with some pleasure to support the Government, not only for its original piece of legislation and for the intentions shown in that legislation but also for having the commonsense and the good grace to amend its own legislation when it was found wanting by community groups and by the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendment to the second reading motion is another one of those pious sorts of platitudes. We certainly agree with it. The amendment implies that the legislation is all right but it does not go far enough. Certainly we would like to see the elimination of the technical ambiguities which are at present hampering the courts. We would like to see provisions for admitting generalised evidence to the courts, allowing, of course, full opportunity for the practitioner to counter the evidence. We would like to see the adoption of verification procedures through medical consumers. All of those things are devoutly to be wished. I wonder how high they are on the priority list of the Opposition should it eventually come into government. Therefore, in essence the Democrats support this legislation. We support its intention. We support the contents of the Bill and we wish it a speedy passage through the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are considering amendments to both the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act. The major emphasis of the legislation, as both previous speakers have indicated, is the strong deterrent to that group of medical practitioners who would indulge in medical benefit fraud. The President of the Australian Medical Assocation, Mr Lionel Wilson, has joined with the Government in its concern that a small minority of AMA members tarnish the image of the vast majority of their colleagues. Therefore the AMA supports the aim of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite what Senator Haines said, I found Senator Grimes's speech most refreshing. It was the first time I have heard Senator Grimes refer to the fact that only a small number of doctors are engaging in medical benefits frauds. I am sorry that the Commonwealth does not have the power to deregister this group of doctors. As the majority of people would know, the States have this power. The AMA has no teeth in the matter. As a matter of fact, only 65 per cent of doctors belong to the AMA. The AMA has absolutely no power to deregister doctors or to take any punitive action whatsover. It only has the right to say to a doctor that he can no longer be a member of the Association. That does not stop a doctor practising. That has no detrimental effect on a doctor's practice at all. The AMA has no power and it is for this reason that the AMA has joined with the Commonwealth and supports the aim of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I am extremely sorry that the powers of the Commonwealth do not extend to deregistration. Consequently, we have taken the only action that I believe is open to us. The complicated court system demands that every occurrence where a doctor defrauds a patient or a medical benefits scheme must be ticked off and a Federal court can penalise a doctor for only that item. The legislation before us tonight provides that a doctor has to be proven guilty of medical benefit fraud on only two occasions. Once a doctor is found guilty on two occasions his services will not be able to attract medical benefit payments for up to three years. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Haines has indicated, to protect a patient from being disadvantaged the doctor is required, prior to giving professional service, to hand to a patient a notice saying that has been convicted of fraud and that no medical benefit payment will be made for his service. If that patient is under the care of another person that person must be informed. If a patient is unable to read then the doctor must take action to inform that patient. As I understand it, there will certainly be no need for the Government to police this. I am sure that if a doctor has not handed a patient such a notice, as soon as that patient tries to obtain his medical benefit payment and finds out that no medical benefit is payable for the service the patient will scream and certainly let us know that the doctor has not done what he should have done. A penalty will be imposed on the doctor in that situation. There are rights of appeal in the normal way to the High Court of Australia. There is also a method of appeal to the Minister for Health for a review of a disqualification if a doctor believes he has grounds for such a review. The Minister has the power to reduce the penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the publishing and laying before each House of the Parliament of details of a doctor's disqualification. This will enable the public in general to have knowledge of such disqualification. These penalties, of course, are over and above that which the courts may impose. As has been said tonight, other amendments to the National Health Act provide free vaccine for immunisation against mumps and measles. A measles-mumps vaccine will replace the measles vaccine at a cost of $1.5m to the Commonwealth Government. This Bill contains technical amendments concerning continuity for those who receive a health benefit card. It was found necessary to do that. There is a need for the individual name of a doctor to be shown on accounts and receipts before medical benefits can be paid. This will prevent an attempt to use company names. It will also ensure the individual responsibility of the doctor to the patient and identify the doctor performing a service for a patient. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes provision for time limits on lodgment of claims for medical benefits, so doing away with unnecessarily large costs such as have been incurred by funds in tracing claims. Again, this Bill gives the Minister for Health powers to direct registered funds concerning management practice. I should like to refer to some provisions which cover this aspect. In the case of a registered organisation the Minister is given power to direct that organisation, if it is carrying on business other than the business of that organisation, to cease that practice. The Minister also may give a registered organisation a direction with respect to the management of its business. These provisions are extremely wide. Senator Grimes said tonight that they do not go as far as he would like them to go. Yet we find that the Minister has the power to give any registered fund a direction in respect of the management of its business. How much further can the legislation go? I do not think that the Minister's power can be widened. The Minister also has the power to direct that funds cease to carry out any business that is not associated directly with health care. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that these powers of direction give to the Minister do not fall into the same area as other direction of power given to the Minister in the primary Bill. In section 73BE the Minister is given power to direct funds in many respects. The Minister has had to exercise that power given to him in the primary Bill in the open. He has had to present the matter to both Houses of the Parliament. He has had to lay it on the table for 15 sitting days, giving the Parliament the power to scrutinise what the Minister had been doing. That is not so in clause 43 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I drew this matter to the attention of Senator Peter Baume when he was the responsible Minister, the new Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) and, indeed, the Government. I have been given assurances by the Government that in August when we return to this place, rather than reassemble members of the House of Representatives now to amend the Bill, an amendment will be put forward enabling any direction that the Minister may give to the funds to be brought before both chambers and laid on the table for 15 sitting days and providing the power of disallowance, so that the Parliament can scrutinise what the Minister is doing. </PARA>

These new directions are not able to be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Should a fund feel that the Minister has made a wrong decision it has no power to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I am told that it is debatable whether that fund would have a right to appeal to the Federal Court of Australia. I would prefer the funds to be able to approach the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and I will approach the Government on that issue also in August when I come back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Grimes assured the Senate that I had always said that doctors were exemplary-far from it. As I said earlier, Senator Grimes has always said that doctors are crooks, that their profession ought to be nationalised and that there is no room for free enterprise in this field. He indicated that he believed that the fraud that doctors indulge in at the moment has been going on for a long time and that it was not commenced under Medibank. When Labor brought in Medibank the AMA warned that it was too open ended and that there was very little control over it. Honourable senators will remember that at that time the AMA was violently opposed to that great open ended bulk billing system. It certainly opened up the area of fraud. If Senator Grimes is correct in saying that this practice has been going on for a long while, why on earth did Senator Grimes's Government not prosecute the doctors for fraud in 1974 or 1975? I wonder why it did not because at this stage the Labor Party is saying that it is about time this Government took some action. I am surprised that the Opposition did not take some action in 1975. Senator Grimes's speech was against private enterprise; it was for nationalising medicine. This policy is in line with the Australian Labor Party's philosophy and should not surprise anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the main purpose of the Bill. As I said earlier, I am sorry the Commonwealth power is not broad enough to include deregistration provisions. I only hope the various States take up their responsibility in this area. In the meantime, I believe the Commonwealth has done what it can and I wish this Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In debating the Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 I intend to speak principally on a matter about which I have some concern and apparently, from the line of debate that has been pursued already, a great number of honourable senators have concern. This matter is medical fraud. Certainly the size of medical fraud in Australia at the moment seems to be extreme. I will quote from the second reading speech of the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), which gives some indication of the size of the fraud. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is now possible to estimate, from statistics compiled by my Department, that the extent of fraud and overservicing by some members of the medical profession is of the order of at least $100 million a year in medical benefits, of which about half is attributable to fraud and half to overservicing. My references to fraud relate to such matters as making claims for services that were not provided, whereas my references to overservicing relate to the provision of services which were not reasonably necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>That quotation from the Minister's second reading speech gives an indication of the extent of the fraud. If it is of this size it is essential that it be tackled. I do not believe that there is any question that it is of that size. Some of my colleagues believe it is even higher. I hold that whilst we have a fee for service system we will not eliminate fraud or overservicing. It is my contention that only when we have a total salary service-I cannot see that happening for many years-will fraud and overservicing be a minor problem. However if it amounts to $100m a year it is a great problem that we have to tackle. Earlier Senator Grimes mentioned a discussion paper which was circulated in the Department of Health. I would like to go through part of that discussion paper because initially it mentions the $100m that was referred to by the Minister in his second reading speech. Perhaps it is from that discussion paper or some other paper which was circulated within the Department of Health that the figure in the second reading speech was taken. The discussion paper which was circulated and which was mentioned earlier is titled 'Legal problems and possible solutions associated with prosecutions related to the Health Insurance Act'. I will refer to some earlier comments in that paper which indicate the extent of medical fraud in Australia. The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA> Fraud against the Health Insurance Act typically involves amounts ranging from the low thousands to several hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps millions. Almost invariably, these amounts are comprised exclusively of multiple similar instances of $10-$50 frauds over several years. </PARA>
<PARA>It further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Although it has not been possible to arrive at a definitive estimate of the total amount of fraud of this type, the Department of Health has estimated through its Fraud and Overservicing Detection System (FODS), that at least $100m a year is involved in fraud and overservicing and that fraud may be responsible for up to half of that amount. </PARA>
<PARA>I reiterate that if the fraud is of that size-there is no reason to suggest that it is not of that size or higher-it is a significant problem and the fee for service system that we have must be tightened up. The discussion paper indicates the number of medical practitioners involved. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The detection system provides an accurate basis upon which to initiate further investigations . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The paper states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The detection system provides an accurate basis upon which to initiate further investigations of particular practitioners. Currently the system indicates that there are of the order of 2,500 doctors who require further investigation of whom around 900 would be high priority.</PARA>
<PARA>If 2,500 medical practitioners require further investigation and about 900 of them are high priority, those figures in themselves might seem reasonably high, but I imagine that as a proportion of the medical practitioners who are in private practice in Australia it is fairly low. Even though it may be low, it is significant that so many doctors require further investigation.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume-It doesn't mean they are all guilty, does it? It means they require investigation.</PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator COLSTON" NAMEID="PF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly it does not mean that they are guilty. In fact, the majority of them would probably be cleared when the investigations were concluded, but there would probably be a very good reason why it was thought that investigation was required. We are looking at a fairly small proportion of medical practitioners out of the total medical practitioners who are in private practice and of that small proportion there is probably an even smaller proportion who are guilty of fraud. But even so, it indicates that the problem is a significant one if we reconsider that $100m a year that I mentioned earlier .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The discussion paper to which I am referring has five separate sections. There is an introductory section; the second section discusses certain technical, legal and policy difficulties; the third section canvasses the difficulties of impressing courts of the magnitude of some frauds. One can quite readily understand that if some medical practitioner is taken to court for fraudulent behaviour it is more likely that a greater part of the fraudulent behaviour that he has been engaging in is not brought before the court. The fourth section discusses legislation to ensure that an offending medical practitioner does not continue with fraudulent behaviour and the fifth is a conclusion and summary of recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA> This evening I will refer only to the fourth section. It deals with possible legislation to punish further those medical practitioners who are convicted of fraud. Some of the assumptions in this section are questionable, but others are plausible. I will quote from the section which introduces this area of possible legislation to ensure that offending medical practitioners do not continue with similar behaviour. I mention too that throughout this paper the word 'doctor' is used. I will quote that although I would prefer to use the term 'medical practitioner' because most are not doctors in the true sense of the word and probably have just two bachelor's degrees.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume-Declare your interest, Senator.</PARA>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator COLSTON" NAMEID="PF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not declaring my interest because my doctorate would probably not help anybody to get over a sore toe but the Minister's doctorate would do a lot more than that. The introductory part of section 4 of the paper states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that the penalty imposed rarely, if ever, reflects the extent of the suspected fraud, the doctor is not discouraged from abuse of the system.</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, his experience in court will only have acquainted him with the deficiencies of the enforcement procedures; with the probable consequence that he will only become more devious and clever in his future abuse of the system. Such doctors are literally in the position of 'laughing all the way to the bank' , for they know that even if they are caught again, the gains far exceed any penalties.</PARA>
<PARA>After that introductory section, which mentions the difficulty of knowing what to do with medical practitioners who are convicted of fraud, the discussion paper goes on to propose a number of options, one of which is deregulation. That is quite difficult to achieve because it is a State matter. It was also mentioned by Senator Walters earlier. However, because it is such a difficult matter, the paper does not pursue it further.</PARA>
<PARA> Five other options are mentioned-and this is the nub of what I raise this evening-in providing legislation to ensure that offending medical practitioners do not continue similar activities after having been convicted of fraud. Option (i) is to legislate to provide, on conviction, disqualification of a doctor's services in regard to eligiblity for medical benefits. This would apply for a set period and would include the provision of legal protection for the Department in advertising this fact. The second option would also give the Minister for Health power to reduce the period and extend on specific grounds, for example, there being only one doctor in the region. In exercising such a power the Minister would be required to publish a statement of reasons. Basically the Government's position is identical with this second option. Option (iii) provided:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . legislate to provide that for a specific period (as specified in the legislation, or as imposed by the court, or determined by the Minister) the Department to be enabled to adjust a doctor's claims to conform to an acceptable pattern.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus, if a medical practitioner were convicted of fraud and option (iii) were used, the Department of Health, for a certain period, would be able to adjust the claims of a medical practitioner so that an acceptable pattern emerged. Option (iv) was option (iii) except that in addition the doctor would be required to bill directly for all services. Therefore all claims would be directed to the Department rather than through the funds and then to the Department. This would allow immediate monitoring and control. The discussion paper quite pertinently points out that if this option were considered it would be necessary to devise a mechanism in order to adjust payments with a registered organisation when insured patients were involved. Therefore, under option (iv), which included option (iii), the Department of Health would be able to adjust a medical practitioner's claims to an acceptable pattern. In addition, the medical practitioner would be required to bill directly for all services. This means that the Department would be able to keep a very strict control on what that medical practitioner was doing.</PARA>
<PARA> Option (v), which apparently was not accepted, and probably would not be by most honourable senators, entailed a mandatory gaol sentence for a second conviction in respect of services rendered after a first conviction. The paper concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> The solution favoured here is option . . . (ii)</PARA>
<PARA>As I mentioned earlier, option (ii) is basically the stance which was taken by the Government and embodied in the legislation that we have before us. I expect that the Minister obtained similar advice when the legislation came before him.</PARA>
<PARA> I ask why option (ii) was favoured. In the paper to which I refer there is no summary of points for and against the various options. There is no summing up to determine the best course of action. In military parlance, I suppose there was no real appreciation of the various options. If the Minister, and thus the Cabinet, received bald advice that the solution favoured is option (ii) it seems to me that the advice was defective unless points for and against those various options were given.</PARA>
<PARA> I would have favoured option (iv). Option (iv) was that for a specific period the Department of Health would be able to adjust the claims of medical practitioners to conform to an acceptable pattern and, in addition, that the medical practitioner would be required to direct bill for all services so that the Department would be able to keep a strict control over the services that the medical practitioner was providing. Had option (iv), which embodied option (iii) as well, been put into effect, it would have meant that the medical practitioner 's work would really be under a microscope. There would have been an effective curb on his or her ability to defraud again. It would have meant that a court conviction would not have been followed by a further penalty which effectively took away the livelihood of the medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA> I probably run the risk of appearing to wear my heart on my sleeve but I stress that the vast majority of medical practitioners are like any other people in society. They have families to care for and houses to build. One wonders what would happen to their families if their income were suddenly withdrawn. All we have to do to find out what members of the public think of medical practitioners is to ask them: 'What is your opinion of your own GP?'. Their own GPs are invariably described as very good people who help them and who would never defraud the government and it is all those other GPs who are said to be the fraudulent ones. In other words, if people know a general practitioner they have a high regard for him or her. It is only because of the publicity that some fraudulent medical practitioners gain that we have an opinion in society that all medical practitioners are like them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like members of parliament, yes. As I have said, I would have favoured option (iv), perhaps followed by option (ii). If further fraud took place after the imposition of the lesser penalty of option (iv), perhaps option (ii), which is a very strict option indeed, could be imposed. The Minister in summing up may be able to outline why consideration was not given to option (iv) . I say, in conclusion, that the financial extent of medical fraud in Australia seems to be great and therefore it is necessary, whilst we have a fee-for- service system operating in this country, to have some effective form of fraud control. For this reason, despite the fact that I have some misgivings, the Opposition does not oppose the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for the support they have given to the Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1982. I am grateful for the comments that have been made during the debate. The Bill has four main groups of features and honourable senators have discussed them. I will refer briefly to some of the matters which were raised during the debate. I refer to the question of the measles- mumps vaccine raised by Senator Haines only to make the point that both these illnesses, because they are common, are regarded as minor illnesses. In fact, both of them are very severe and serious illnesses of childhood. For example, the sequelae of measles are serious. In up to one per cent of children there is permanent central nervous system damage following an attack of measles. There is every reason to use vaccination methods which are available to try to control these illnesses. It has nothing to do with the sex of the potential patient. I am glad that honourable senators have given their support to that provision in the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of the discussion has centred around the provisions to control and combat overservicing and fraud by medical practitioners. A number of points have been made and I wish to comment on a couple of them. Senator Colston has asked, quite reasonably, in view of the options before the Government, why we came out in favour of one option and not another. In fact, the Government had before it a more detailed appreciation. The discussion that occurred within the Government examined the appreciation of each of the options. Every option, including option four, was considered. I believe Senator Colston was correct when he said that option two, the option that was picked up and embodied in this legislation, is a more severe option for the offending doctor than option four would be. It is a conscious decision of the Government that it should respond in this matter with the utmost severity. Because of the points that have been made by honourable senators during this debate, because of the seriousness with which these offences are viewed, it was considered that option two, the severe option, is the one which is most appropriate in this circumstance. I say again to Senator Colston that the other options were considered. The points of view which he has set out were carefully gone over. On a balance of judgment the Government adopted a slightly different position but did so, I think, following many of the same thought processes and with much the same appreciation that Senator Colston had. </PARA>
<PARA> A comment was made during the debate to the effect that the courts are sometimes deficient because they treat offenders leniently. Doctors who have been brought before the courts on charges related to health insurance matters are seen to get away with the proverbial slap on the wrist. Honourable senators will realise that the Bill now before the Senate has a particular quality which should be noted closely; that is, that it does not matter any more how lenient the courts might be in terms of the penalty they impose in relation to offences. It does not matter whether the courts impose a fine of $5 for two offences or whether they impose a sentence of 12 months' gaol. Convictions on two matters will be enough to bring a doctor within the ambit of the operations of this Bill . The Bill sets out administrative penalties which are a reflection of the Government's concern. These will be quite independent of anything imposed by the courts in pursuance of their own duties. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, honourable senators are also correct when they draw attention to the desirability of the States taking action within their own areas of competence by way of examining the registration or registerability of doctors who have been found to be cheating against the public interest. There is no other way of looking at it. I speak as a medical practitioner; I declare my interest. Anyone who cheats against the health insurance system is cheating not only his profession and his patients, but also a wider public. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of matters were raised by Senator Walters to which I think quite specific response is required. Senator Walters drew attention to clause 43 of the Bill and I would like to take this opportunity to inform honourable senators of the Government's intention in relation to clause 43. This clause will insert proposed new section 73BEA into the National Health Act to give to the Minister for Health the power to give directions to registered organisations with respect to their management practices. It is being enacted in an effort principally to deter registered organisations from engaging in undesirable management practices . The Minister will be able, where he has reasonable grounds for believing that an organisation is carrying on or proposes to carry on business other than the business of a registered health insurance organisation, to direct the organisation to refrain from doing so. He will be given-this is Senator Walters' s point of concern-a general power to give an organisation a direction with respect to the management of its business as a registered organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters's concern was about the capacity a Minister has in giving such directions. The Bill does not provide specifically for these powers to be subject to review. However, the Government has given further consideration to the matter and it now intends to introduce legislation during the Budget sittings of Parliament that will amend the National Health Act to require the tabling in both Houses of Parliament of directions made under these powers and to provide for the disallowance of those directions by either House of Parliament. That is to say, any directions will be subject to the scrutiny of the Parliament; they will remain within the purview of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters also had a concern about the extent to which directions which are not disallowed can be contested. Directions issued under the proposed new section are not appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as are directions issued under another section-73BE. However, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 provides for application to be made to the Federal Court for review of administrative decisions. I think Senator Walters expressed some doubt about whether the directions made under this proposed new section-I think it is clause 43 of this Bill-would be able to be taken to the Federal Court. It is thought that a registered organisation that is aggrieved by a decision made under the proposed new section 73BEA may make such an application to the Federal Court. No provision has been made for the directions under the proposed new section to be appealable to the AAT because they would not relate to health insurance matters but to undesirable inducements to attract new contributors, to the inefficient conduct of health insurance or to unrelated business activities. It is our understanding that the Federal Court would probably make the decision on whether it would hear any such appeal. However, in relation to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal I will undertake to bring the matter raised by Senator Walters to the attention of the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) for his further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> That leaves me to discuss only the matter of the amendment which has been moved by Senator Grimes on behalf of the Opposition. The amendment has three parts. The first part refers to the 'elimination of technical ambiguities hampering the courts'. Essentially, the matters the amendment tries to cover relate to the administration of justice. The Opposition surely would not be suggesting that some form of judicial discrimination should be applied to medical benefits fraud that is not applied to other matters which come before the courts. Paragraph (b) of the amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . provisions for admitting generalised evidence to the courts after conviction on specific charges but prior to sentencing, with full opportunity for the convicted practitioner to counter the evidence . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again we think that this is an inappropriate amendment to be moving at this stage. We think it is an inappropriate proposition. Fundamentally, it seeks to have the courts give consideration to matters when coming to sentence a person which have not been established by evidence before the court during the trial. In fact the proposition seems to us to be inconsistent with what many of us would consider to be the best course of justice. </PARA>
<PARA> The third limb of the amendment asks for the adoption of verification procedures through medical consumers. We are all medical consumers, and that, of course, means patients. The Government supports the concept of this part of the amendment. The Government has already positively encouraged the day to day operation of the medical benefits scheme in a way which makes the patient-the consumer in terms of the amendment-aware of the cost of services that he recieves. All this is not to say that the Government is satisfied with all the legal aspects of the prosecution of doctors for medi-fraud. It is exactly for that reason that the Government has introduced these novel and extremely strong administrative measures against what has been called medi-fraud in the Press. These measures virtually exercise to the limit the Commonwealth's constitutional powers in this area. Furthermore, the Government is already committed to undertaking negotiations with the States for them to pay close attention to the matters for which the States have sole responsibility-notably the deregistration of doctors. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank honourable senators for the support that they have given to this legislation and its aims, which are to improve the operation of both the Health Insurance Act and the national health arrangements. The Government will oppose the amendment for the reasons I have indicated. I commend the Bill to the Senate . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a further payment of $8,965,000 to the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The Opposition supports this Bill. It was due to the initiative of a former colleague, Ken Wriedt, as the then Minister for Primary Industry, who led the Australian delegation to the 1974 World Food Conference and others, that an organisation such as this was founded in order to respond to the needs of the least developed countries. IFAD is a United Nations-related fund and is based in Rome. It is unique in its system of voting. The developed countries, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the developing countries have an equal voice in management. IFAD does not represent a duplication of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, which does not get involved with major project work, but in some senses it cuts across World Bank operations. IFAD is particularly sensitive to the needs of the least developed countries and provides funds in the form of grant-aid to such countries as Chad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia, the policy aspects of the Fund, such as its place in regard to North-South issues, are handled by the Economic Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The mechanics of the Fund are handled by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau. The Treasury has not always looked favourably on the Fund because of what it considers to be its poor management. However, the Fund has taken some time to get started and, in general terms, its management seems reasonable. The Opposition believes that it is in Australia's interests as a member of the international community to continue to support the International Fund for Agricultural Development by contributing the amount proposed by the Bill. The Opposition wishes it a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats also support the International Fund for Agricultural Development Bill and wish it a speedy passage, but we are concerned about some aspects of the Government's aid program which I wish to mention specifically at this stage. The agreed aim of the International Fund for Agricultural Development-known as IFAD-is to mobilise financial resources from donor countries to be made available as loans on concessional terms for agricultural development in developing member states. Funds are directed primarily to projects specifically designed to introduce, expand or improve food production systems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly the need for the activities supported by the Fund has not diminished in recent years. In the 1978 annual report, the most recent available, the governing council of the Fund estimated that 20 per cent of the population in Africa, Asia and Latin America were at risk of starvation, which is a strong word. Yet the rate of growth of food production was recorded as being grossly inadequate. Of course there was also an accelerating loss of fertile land through overuse and erosion, which has amomious portents for the future. According to that report only a few developing countries reach an annual growth target of 4 per cent. In most countries it had been 2 per cent or less and in some it had been negative. The report stated that, if such trends were not reversed, by 1985 the gap between food needs and food availibilities in the developing countries would be larger than the 85 million tonnes predicted at the 1974 World Food Conference, at which, as Senator Sibraa has said, this Fund was founded, and the number of people suffering from malnutrition would grow even larger than the current alarming figures. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second reading speech the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) said that the Fund's activities are focused on the poorest nations and the poorest sections of rural populations. The Australian Democrats are concerned whether this ideal is being achieved and can be maintained, whether the poorest sections of the poorest nations where the need is greatest are receiving the benefit that they should have. Funds are channelled to projects which are, in most cases, government controlled or administered, and the social, cultural and political structures in most countries are such that in the first instance benefits would flow to those which are equipped with enough basic expertise to utilise the type of assistance provided. In many cases this turns out to be those with the larger landholdings. It is the vast mass of the very poor that concerns us, and believe me, a definite control of direction is necessary to help the poor. In multilateral programs such as this one as well as in its bilateral programs Australia should contribute not only money but also professional support in policy and technological areas if we are to achieve the Minister's laudable objective to direct aid to the people who need it most and most importantly to assist them in developing the expertise to help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> For a long time our capacity to provide such assistance has been minimal. In recent years Australia has begun to make a worthwhile contribution through the Australian Universities International Development Program and to some extent through the Australian Development Assistance Bureau. The recent establishment of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research was long overdue, but it is welcome as it will enable Australia, it is hoped, to make a more significant contribution of technological expertise than we have been able to do in the past. Here again this will happen only if its sense of the greatest need is accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be a matter of great regret that the efforts to improve the Australian Development Assistance Bureau's performance have suffered a set-back with the appointment of its Director last April to the position of Executive Director of the World Food Program. Mr Ingram's departure for Rome was of course in one sense laudable because it was a welcome recognition of Australia's growing efforts in this field. However, the final point I wish to make is that the Government's gross neglect of ADAB as an organisation is inexcusable in the circumstances of our support through this kind of measure. It is not enough merely to throw money at things. According to our information, the top ten executive positions at ADAB are vacant and the Government seems to be in no hurry to fill them. I intend no reflection on the people who occupy those positions in an acting capacity when I say that an organisation of any kind, and especially one in this position with long term objectives, must be severely handicapped in its planning and decision-making capacity if this situation continues. The Democrats, as I said, support the Government in this bill, but question the Government's real commitment to meaningful assistance to developing countries unless it remedies quickly that situation I have mentioned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for the speedy passage of the International Fund for Agricultural Development Bill. As has been said, under this Bill, Australia will contribute to the replenishment in the same proportion as our share of category I contributions in the initial mobilisation of resources, that is 1.74 per cent. As is Australia's normal practice with international financial institutions, payment will be made on the basis of lodging non-negotiable, non-interest bearing promissory notes. When lodged, the promissory notes will allow the IFAD to commit funds to new developmental projects with actual draw-downs occurring over an extended period of years. It is essential that this Bill be passed at this stage. We thank the Senate for the speedy passage of it. I think I can assure the Senate that the objectives of the fund are to help to increase agricultural production in developing countries.

<PARA> Is there, as claimed by Alastair Fischer 'Aspects of the Voting System for the Senate', Politics (dated May 1981) a weakness in the random sampling method employed in Senate vote counting in that where the winning margin for the last elected candidate is small (say less than 500 votes) there is an approximately 1 in 10,000 chance that the wrong candidate has been elected; if so, what is the Government's attitude to his suggestion that the Commonwealth Electoral Act be amended to provide for sampling to be dispensed with where the winning margin proves to be narrow.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Electoral Office has advised me that the precise probability of electing the 'wrong' candidate because of sampling error at a specific Senate election depends, among other things, on the particular preference orderings expressed in the votes at that election. For that reason such a probability cannot be accurately specified in advance.</PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of the election of a 'wrong' candidate has been recognised ever since the system of proportional representation was introduced in 1948. However, the Labor Government at that time argued (House of Representatives Hansard, 16 April 1948, pp. 966-7) that 'the Tasmanian system, while suitable where the number of votes is comparatively small and all such votes are concentrated at one centre, is not readily capable of being efficiently worked by too remote a control. In order to employ that system at a Senate election, it would first be necessary to assemble the whole of the ballot-papers for the State at one centre . . .[that would] delay completion, involve risks of loss in transit, and increase costs heavily . . .'.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised also that, put in more concrete terms, Mr Fischer's calculations suggest that in the long run a 'wrong' candidate will be elected in some State about once every 1,250 years and that as Mr Fischer himself has pointed out, to date there is no possibility that this has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> Examined in this way I do not believe that Mr Fischer's calculations gave rise to any real concern about the way in which the Senate count is conducted or that they justify an amendment of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) and (4) It has always been the practice to contract 'overflow work' to contractors. However, during January and February the staffing level within the Branch workshop was temporarily low because of personnel availing themselves of recreation leave.

<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following additional information to the reply I gave to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The bilateral trade agreement between Poland and Australia contains a most favoured nation clause in standard terms in accordance with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This remains in force. Since the question was asked, however, the Australian Trade Commissioner and his staff have been withdrawn from Warsaw. I should emphasise that this withdrawal was undertaken as a result of a pragmatic assessment of declining trade prospects in Poland, and does not represent a downgrading of trade relations. The Australian Trade Commissioner based in Vienna makes regular visits to Warsaw in the course of his duties.</PARA>
<PARA> The imposition of martial law in Poland on 13 December 1981 has altered the way in which the Government views bilateral relations with Poland. There is at present little prospect for the early lifting of martial law and this is a matter for profound regret. During my visit to Poland in November 1981, the Polish Government made a request for additional economic assistance which I undertook to have considered on my return to Australia. After the imposition of martial law, the Government, however, decided to take a number of practical measures to demonstrate to the Polish martial law authorities that we are not prepared to conduct normal relations with them in present circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> As set out in my Press statement issued after Cabinet on 19 January 1982, the Government deferred consideration of Poland's request for further economic assistance, and made it clear that the roll-over provisions of the existing credit facility were open to Government discretion. At the same time, the Government set three basic preconditions for the re-establishment of normal relations with Poland; the complete lifting of martial law, the release of all detainees, and an early return to circumstances in which the people of Poland can find their own solution to their internal economic and political difficulties on the basis of consensus and reconciliation.</PARA>

<PARA> It should be made clear that fisheries is one of the matters coming within the executive authority of Northern Territory Ministers as provided in Section 35 of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978.</PARA>
<PARA> It is understood that Mr Justice Gallop of the Northern Territory Supreme Court did not in fact invalidate the Fisheries Act. It was a particular declaration made under Section 13 of that Act which was declared invalid.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 13 of the Fisheries Act allows the Administrator, by notice in the Northern Territory Gazette, to declare any waters specified in the notice to be closed . . . against the taking of fish of a specified species.

<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following additional information to the reply I gave to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the claim that a Hutt River 'diplomatic passport' was used by a television producer to get through Customs and Immigration in Beirut. I am unaware how many of these documents have been issued by Mr Casley or to whom they have been issued. They are not of course genuine passports. A genuine passport is a document issued by a sovereign state to a person who is a subject of that state. It is the accepted international means of identification and evidence of nationality and of the holder's right as a subject to the protection of the state which issued it as well as the preparedness of that state to extend protection. Since the self-styled Hutt River Province is not a state (in international law) clearly the documents printed and distributed by Mr Casley do not meet these criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> The use of Hutt River Province 'passports' would facilitate the movements of terrorists and drug runners only as long as other countries are prepared to accept them as valid travel documents. I do not believe the abuse of these ' passports' should have any impact on Australia's relations with the Middle East region.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1976, my Department advised all overseas posts that any inquiries from governments regarding the activities of Mr Casley should be advised that the Australian Government does not recognise the Hutt River Province and any assertions to the contrary are false.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The Government is not providing any direct funding for the in vitro fertilisation programs being conducted by the Queen Victoria Medical Centre, the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne and King Edward Memorial Hospital, Perth. It is recognised, however, that some of the costs of these programs are derived from hospital and university budgets. Medical benefits are also attracted by various clinical procedures forming part of the in vitro fertilisation technique . Government funding is involved to some extent, but the precise level cannot be determined.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as research involving in vitro fertilisation is concerned, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH and MRC) is providing support for three research projects. These projects are being undertaken at the Queen Victoria Medical Centre (2) and the Royal Women's Hospital (1) at a cost of $200,000 over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA> The NH and MRC has supported in vitro fertilisation research in a modest way since 1979, with funding of $33,000, $34,000 and $55,000 being provided for 1979 , 1980 and 1981 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> To secure NH and MRC funding, research projects must achieve a high standard of scientific merit and obtain approval from the ethics committee of the institution at which the research is conducted.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The NH and MRC has not, at present, specific guidelines concerning the ethical aspects of research involving fertilisation of human ova, human fetuses or human embryos. It does, however, have a statement on human experimentation which is the basic guideline used by ethics committees in institutions in determining approval of research protocols.</PARA>
<PARA> The NH and MRC has recently established a working party on ethics in medical research whose terms of reference include a revision of the statement on human experimentation in the light of developments with in vitro fertilisation research.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No members of the NH and MRC or its consultative committees have been involved in such research.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In the United Kingdom, the Medical Research Council (MRC) has requested researchers supported by it to abide by the recommendations of the advisory group appointed by the Secretary of State for Social Services, entitled: 'The Use of Fetuses and Fetal Material for Research'-the Peel report.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Administrative Appeals Tribunal maintains statistics on a quarterly basis. The last quarter for which statistics are available is the quarter ended on 31 March 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) As at 31 March 1982, 1199 applications for review made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal were undetermined.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Of these, 591 were applications for the review of decisions made under the Social Services Act 1947.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Of the 591 social security applications, 423 concerned cancellation of, or refusal to grant, an invalid pension.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) It is not practicable to give a figure for the current delay between the lodging of an application for review of a decision relating to an invalid pension and the publication of the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on that application. Cases are heard by the Tribunal when the parties are ready to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the longest standing invalid pension application before the Tribunal on 31 March 1982 was lodged on 19 March 1981. This application has been before the Tribunal on two occasions, and each time has been deferred at the request of the parties to enable further medical evidence to be brought before the Tribunal. After a hearing before the President of the Tribunal on 10 March 1982 the hearing of the application was adjourned with liberty to either party to apply to bring the hearing on at 48 hours notice to the other party.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) It is assumed that the reference to 'reasons' is a reference to the statement which the Department is required to lodge with the Tribunal, under section 37 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, when it receives notice of an application to the Tribunal for review of a decision. The obligation imposed by section 37 is to lodge such a statement within 28 days after receiving notice of the application.</PARA>
<PARA> The Administrative Appeals Tribunal does not have available to it records of the dates on which the Department receives notices of applications to the Tribunal for review of social security decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Registrar of the Tribunal has provided me with figures which show that, on the basis of section 37 statements lodged with the Tribunal by the Department of Social Security in the month ending 31 March 1982, the average period between the date on which notice of an application was sent by the Tribunal to the Department and the date on which the section 37 statement was lodged with the Tribunal was 129 days.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed there have been delays in particular cases in the Melbourne and Sydney Registries of the Tribunal in forwarding notices of applications to the Department of Social Security. The Registrar of the Tribunal has taken action to overcome delays in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security has outlined in the Senate on three occasions considerations bearing upon the time being taken to furnish documents to the Tribunal pursuant to section 37 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act (16 September 1981, Hansard, page 750; 27 April 1982, Hansard, page 1505; 28 April 1982, Hansard, pages 1583-4).</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2618" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a), (b), (c) and (d) Administrative arrangements applicable to the Program of Aids for Disabled People (PADP) are such that the Commonwealth's role relates to the provision of funds, broad policy development, and overall program administration from the national standpoint. Day-to-day administration of the program and the development of detailed administrative procedures are the responsibility of the State and Territory health authorities and the lodgment centres which operate under their supervision. Within these arrangements the State and Territory authorities are required to provide the Commonwealth with statistics regarding the numbers and costs of aids issued under each of the ten approved categories. There is no formal requirement for the States and Territories to provide the type of information listed in the honourable senator' s question. However, in accordance with its overall administrative role, my Department is in regular contact with the State and Territory administering authorities concerning operational matters and expenditure trends.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The principal aim of PADP is to enable people with disabilities to live more independently in a domestic (i.e. non-institutional) setting in the community. PADP assistance is available to residents of nursing homes and other institutions in cases where the aid is provided in connexion with the recipient' s discharge from the nursing home, etc., into the community. There are no plans to extend PADP to cover residents of institutions beyond this provision.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) My Department recognises that, in addition to medical practitioners, other categories of health professionals have an important role in the operation of PADP. Although the Commonwealth has not formally documented explicit requirements regarding the involvement of allied health professionals, it is expected that the State and Territory health authorities will make arrangements for such involvement where appropriate and practicable. However, it is not intended that the list of authorised prescribers for PADP be extended to include other than medical practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Some 27,000 registered medical practitioners throughout Australia have been circularised with details of the program. Furthermore, there has been considerable liaison with both professional and non-government organisations in the health/welfare field concerning PADP. Nevertheless, the question of additional publicity, brochures, etc., will be considered in the context of ongoing review of the program as it develops.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) For the 1982-84 triennium, there are 53 committees and subcommittees ( including Council itself) and a total of 400 people who serve on these standing bodies. To those standing bodies must also be added expert ad hoc working parties, the number of which will vary constantly as tasks are completed and other ad hoc groups are formed to provide expert advice on specific topics.

<PARA> (3) No definitive advice can be provided on the actual cost of servicing the NH and MRC and its committees. The Secretariat of the Council and its committees is provided by officers of my Department who also carry out extensive national health responsiblities associated with public health, clinical treatment and medical and dental research.</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of costs of salaries for all officers of the National Health and Medical Research Council Division and 41 officers of the Public Health Division of the Department whose duties relate in some way to the NH and MRC, together with costs of committee and officer travel, overtime, etcetera, the maximum cost would be $2.08m. This amount significantly overstates the cost of servicing the NH and MRC by the extent of the national health role of the officers involved, which cannot be quantified.</PARA>
<PARA> To direct costs of the NH and MRC must be added indirect costs for support services provided by my Department. Precise details of the amount of these costs are not known.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The uses of chlordane and heptachlor for agricultural and domestic purposes in the United States of America are being phased out by the Environmental Protection Agency because of their persistence in the environment, rather than for any carcinogenic or other health hazard. The use of chlordane and heptachlor for termite control by subterranean injection has not been phased out be the Agency. Chlordane and heptachlor are used in Australia mainly by pest control operators on ants, termites etc. around building sites. Some States have a limited range of registered agricultural uses. Chlordane and heptachlor are included in Schedule 6 of the Uniform Poisons Standard of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH &amp; MRC). This Schedule includes substances or preparations of a poisonous nature which must be readily available to the public for domestic, agricultural, pastoral, horticultural, veterinary, photographic or industrial purposes or for the destruction of pests. As such, these substances would be available at appropriate commercial outlets.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The honourable senator will appreciate that it is next to impossible to record all cases of injury by any agent. Chlordane and heptachlor have not been implicated as agents causing foetal abnormalities. There may have been cases of death or injury due to accidental or deliberate poisoning as can, and does, occur with any toxic substance but my Department does not have specific records of these.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The NH and MRC maintains a constant review of both substances and presently considers existing restrictions adequate. If the honourable senator has evidence to warrant further investigation I would be pleased to present this to the NH and MRC expert committees for evaluation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government supports medical research through the National Health and Medical Research Council. Should the Queensland Institute of Medical Research wish to receive funding for research to develop a dengue fever vaccine, it could approach the Council with details of the work proposed and request funding. Such an application would then be considered in conjunction with other applications for grant support.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to a dengue fever vaccine, the honourable senator may have in mind recent advances in recombinant DNA technology and molecular biology which have opened up new possibilities for vaccine production. Notwithstanding this, there remain major difficulties in the development of an effective dengue vaccine, and further basic research is necessary. It must be noted that there is no virulent South-east Asian strain, and I assume the honourable senator is referring to the severe forms of infection-dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.</PARA>
<PARA> I would stress the need meanwhile for the continuation of vector control measures which are the present basis for the control of dengue. I am aware that dengue fever has recently appeared in Queensland after an absence of 17 years, and since the only available method of stopping the spread of the disease is through these vector control programs, the Commonwealth is providing financial support in this area.</PARA>

<PARA> The Department of Social Security provides supporting parent's benefit to sole parents of either sex who have the care of dependent children. A recipient of supporting parent's benefit is eligible for benefits under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS), as are other applicants, provided that he or she is a full-time student undertaking an approved course, meets the scheme's conditions relating to previous study and progress in present course, and satisfies the means test. In the case of a sole parent, the maximum allowance of $2583pa ($49.67 a week) is payable where the income of the parent from all other sources, including social security benefits, does not exceed $5100pa or $98.00 per week. Where income from other sources exceeds $5100, the TEAS allowance is reduced on a pro-rata basis to the point where no TEAS is payable if other income exceeds $9667 in the year of study. If eligible for TEAS an additional allowance of $10 a week for each dependent child would be payable under TEAS.</PARA>
<PARA> The maximum rate of supporting parent's benefit for a person with one child is $87.70 per week; a sole parent in receipt of maximum TEAS and with no other income would receive supporting parent's benefit of $72.85 per week, that is, the TEAS benefits would cause a reduction in the supporting parent's benefit of $14.85 a week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 September 1981 (Hansard, page 890) Senator Sibraa asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, refers to two questions asked last week by Senators Bjelke- Petersen and Townley concerning Zimbabwe and the presence there of North Korean military instructors. As the Australian High Commissioner to Zimbabwe was recently in Canberra reporting to the Minister and he also recently briefed the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on this matter as well as on the biased anti-Zimbabwe Press reports which were being reprined in the Australian media, will the Minister bring down a statement on current events in Zimbabwe and Southern Africa for the information of honourable senators? Will the Minister not agree that Zimbabwe, a non-aligned country, whose armed forces are currently being predominantly trained by British instructors, is entitled to invite instructors from other countries, including Australia, to train its armed forces?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> You referred to the military assistance being proved by North Korea to help train the Zimbabwe Army. Senator Guilfoyle confirmed that the Government of Zimbabwe had accepted an offer of assistance from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and that this was intended to train and equip a brigade of the defence forces of Zimbabwe.</PARA>
<PARA> As you quite correctly pointed out, the Zimbabwe armed forces are being predominantly trained by a British militay training team, under an arrangement which has operated since Zimbabwe attained independence in April 1980. I agree that it is a decision for Zimbabwe itself whether to invite instructors from other countries to train its armed forces. In announcing its decision to accept the North Korean offer, the Government of Zimbabwe said this was consistent with Zimbabwe's policy of non-alignment. I would repeat Senator Guilfoyle's observation that we hope the North Koreans are approaching their task in the same light. The question of providing Australian military training assistance to Zimbabwe is not under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> The task of restructuring and integrating into one force the three armies which operated in Zimbabwe prior to independence-Mr Mugabe's ZANLA, Mr Nkomo's ZIPRA and the former Rhodesian security forces-is obviously crucial for the future stability of Zimbabwe, and from the outset Mr Mugabe has accorded it high priority. This task is clearly not an easy one, and it will take some time to achieve complete confidence among three such previously antagonistic groups. However considerable progress has been made to date, and this is a cause for encouragement.</PARA>
<PARA> You also asked if I would bring down a statement on current events in Zimbabwe and southern Africa. I believe the Government's policies towards southern Africa, and the conduct of its relations with Zimbabwe, are widely known and understood. I do not think it necessary at this particular time to table a statement specifically on current developments in the region. I will, however, keep this under review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 February 1982 Hansard, page 7 Senator Archer asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning the testing of road accident casualties for the presence of alcohol or cannabis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the study to which the honourable senator refers. This was conducted on a series of motor vehicle drivers admitted to Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital as casualties in the latter half of 1981. Of 94 persons tested 23 per cent showed evidence of cannabis products in their urine, and 8 per cent also showed alcohol. This, of course, appears to be an alarming finding. However, the real significance of the finding is not known. The number of drivers who have used cannabis throughout New South Wales and Australia may be much higher or much lower. The significance for the causation of motor traffic accidents of presence of cannabis metabolites in the urine is quite unknown as cannabis metabolites continue to be excreted for weeks after the last use of cannabis. What this study does is reinforce the need for further studies to allow confident assertions to be made concerning whether cannabis use is an important factor in traffic accidents in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Given the present difficulties in interpreting the data, I could not recommend the introduction of routine tests on all accident victims. Neither could I recommend comparable penalties for alcohol and cannabis when there are no data linking cannabis levels to levels of risk on the road (such as there are for alcohol). Rather, I support the development of a well-designed research program , as recommended by the House of Representatives Road Safety Committee report on Alcohol Drugs and Road Safety.</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding that the major recommendations of the report are currently under consideration by the Government, I can inform the honourable senator that the Commonwealth Minister for Transport, at the meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council held on 26 February 1982, submitted proposals for a national media campaign which is being considered by the States, supported a national program of random breath testing, and indicated Government support for increased research into the effects of alcohol and drugs on road safety.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the importation and use in Australia of this substance. The United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found no tumours or other changes in rats exposed to 27 ppm or rabbits exposed to 207 ppm of 2-nitropropane for six months. Liver tumors were observed in all ten rats killed after six months of exposure to 207 ppm of 2-nitropropane. In a later bioassay metastatic liver cancers were observed in rats exposed for six months at 200 ppm and held unexposed for six months. According to preliminary data of the same study, male rats exposed to 100 ppm also developed liver tumours. At the end of 22 months no malignancies or significant changes were observed in the livers of the male or female rats exposed at 25 ppm. 2- nitropropane is widely used in solvent systems for coating, printing inks and adhesives, and is used in food processing for fractionation of a partially saturated vegetable oil. While it has not been demonstrated to be a severe threat, it is being treated as a potential health threat to exposed workers and its use in water tanks in Western Australia is currently under investigation by the health authorities in that State.</PARA>
<PARA> Guidance on the measures to be taken with carcinogens is provided in the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH and MRC) publications 'Model Carcinogenic Substances Regulations and Recommendations' for Laboratory Workers Handling Carcinogenic Chemicals. Concerning 2-nitropropane, this is the subject of an International Hazard Alert. A scientific group of the NH and MRC, the body designated to receive notification of Alerts, has taken action to ensure that information on 2-nitropropane is widely disseminated to government agencies and industrial groups to take appropriate action.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 March 1982 (Hansard, page 700) Senator MacGibbon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In view of the decision by National Semiconductor Corporation not to proceed for the time being with the facility in Canberra to produce silicon chips, will the Government, as a matter of great urgency, encourage those companies at present operating in Australia to set up a facility on a free enterprise basis to produce custom designed chips? Such components are now the fundamental building blocks of our national defence capability and the ability to produce them in Australia cannot be delayed any longer.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to invite the National Semiconductor Corporation ( Natsemi) to examine the feasibility of establishing a silicon wafer fabrication plant in the Australian Capital Territory and its willingness to provide land and buildings in return for certain undertakings from Natsemi reflected the Government's continuing commitment to promoting private sector investment and employment opportunities in the Territory. Recognising the importance of microelectronics technology to the future of Australian industry, the Government sought undertakings from Natsemi concerning technology transfer, training and preferential supply of components to Australian users. The objective in seeking those undertakings was to assist the development of downstream industries using semi-conductors whether they are supplied by Natsemi or other semi-conductor manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA> Assistance for the microelectronics industry is provided through a variety of measures, most of which are available to manufacturing industry generally. These include tariffs on competing imports, industrial research and development incentives, government purchasing preference afforded to goods of Australian origin that meet certain high technology guidelines or are judged to be of strategic defence significance, offset requirement for government purchases and export incentives. Direct assistance has also been provided in the form of loans by the Department of Defence to firms for purchase of specialised plant and equipment. Some of these measures are under review at present in the context of the Government's consideration of the reports by the Industries Assistance Commission on Certain Budgetary Assistance to Industry and Export Incentives. The Government is also considering a report by Australian Science and Technology Council which discusses assistance to the microelectronics industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Custom microelectronic devices are being produced in Australia, mostly by two firms, for specialised uses such as medical equipment, alarm systems, and communication. These firms have benefitted from the Government assistance measures as well as gaining a significant level of on going orders from the Department of Defence for specialised microelectronic devices. Despite these orders the firms have spare capacity available to meet higher levels of demand.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also supports the development of microelectronic technology research in Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and tertiary institutions. The joint Commonwealth Special Research Centre in microelectronics at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and the University of New South Wales was established recently under the Commonwealth Program for Promotion of Research Excellence.</PARA>
<PARA> Further, it is proposed to send a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission shortly on assistance to the local industry producing automatic data processing equipment and parts. The scope and timing of the reference are currently under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> In considering the need for further support it should be noted that at the present time there exists adequate capacity to meet the current Australian demand for custom microelectronic components.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Defence Support has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The aircraft industry rationalisation policy which the Government announced in 1976 remains in force. There have however been three cases of significant deviation from that policy.</PARA>
<PARA> In two cases, cost and efficiency considerations have led to ongoing work on aircraft or components being undertaken by the same company which originally produced those same items for the Royal Australian Air Force.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 March 1982 (Hansard page 858) Senator Bjelke-Peterson asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Her question concerned the extent of the damage to Cavendish bananas from Panama disease in South Africa and Taiwan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minster for Primary Industry has now supplied me with the following additional information:</PARA>
<PARA> Panama disease is caused by a soil-borne fungus which enters banana plants through their roots. There is no evidence of any other mode of entry. Some species of bananas, such as Lady Finger, are very susceptible to the disease, but in recent years, the Dwarf Cavendish species which has previously been immune, has been affected by the disease in South Africa and Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA> The disease has been present in small localized areas in South Africa for over 20 years, but since 1977, it has been spreading slowly and has attacked the Dwarf Cavendish species. This breakdown in resistance has been ascribed to an as yet unknown complex of soil factors. A great deal of work has been done in South Africa to contain or eliminate the disease, including soil treatments and quarantine measures, but it is now generally accepted in that country that it is not controllable by agronomic treatments, phytosanitary measure or the application of soil fungicides. However, a research programme has been mounted in South Africa to define the extent of the disease and to identify possible ways of combatting the fungus, although scientists in that country are not optimistic that a viable control method will be found.</PARA>
<PARA> Information obtained from Taiwan, indicates that Cavendish bananas in that Country are not susceptible to Panama disease, but a new strain of the pathogen was discovered in 1967-68, and I am informed that some 400 acres of Cavendish bananas have been affected by this new strain.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the Australian infection is concerned, I can confirm that their has been a minor outbreak of Panama disease in the Wamuran Basin in southern Queensland which is affecting Cavendish bananas, but I understand the Queensland Department of Primary Industries has the situation under control. I am informed that it is not unusual for Cavendish bananas to succumb to the disease in extreme stress conditions, and this may account for the present outbreak. The Queensland authorities have not yet been able to determine whether the present outbreak has been caused by a new strain of the disease, but I understand that they are maintaining contact with the agricultural authorities in South Africa and Taiwan on the effectiveness of their control measures.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following additional information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> At the outest, let me say quite categorically that there has been no change in the Government's support for the live sheep export trade. We are well aware of the benefits to sheep producers and to associated industries which have resulted from this trade.</PARA>
<PARA> The letter in question requested the exporter to be discriminating in the type of livestock he exported. I am aware of no evidence that the exercise of such discrimination would have required a reduction in the number of sheep exported from Australia in a given period.</PARA>
<PARA> When the letter was written in January I was concerned at the evidence that increasing numbers of light-weight lambs were being included in shipments of sheep for overseas. I am not convinced that this trend was in the overall interests of the live sheep export trade and accordingly I suggested to live sheep exporters and the Sheepmeat Council of Australia that the export of light -weight lambs should be avoided as much as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned to preserve the continuity of Australia's overseas trade by enhancing this country's reputation as an efficient and reliable exporter. I am sure that there would be widespread acceptance of the need for the live sheep trade to be conducted to the highest standards of animal husbandry and in conformity with the specifications of export contracts.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister has supplied me with the following details:</PARA>
<PARA> In seeking a closer economic relationship (CER), the Governments of Australia and New Zealand are committed to ensuring equitable treatment for industries in both countries. In this regard the question of how to deal with New Zealand export incentives has been very much to the forefront in the negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> In the particular case of horticultural products the aim has been to negotiate a package of measures which would achieve a freeing-up of the trade on a basis which was fair to both sides. In addition to reductions in tariffs and progressive liberalisation of New Zealand import restrictions, we have sought the speedy phasing out of New Zealand export incentives. We will also institute a fast track anti-dumping arrangement which would facilitate the handling of legitimate complaints under our anti-dumping legislation. Details of these arrangements are still being finalised.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of dairy products, discussions have been held between the dairy industries of the two countries with the aim of arriving at mutually acceptable arrangements for incorporating dairy products in a closer economic relationship .

Is the Minister aware that the Australian yacht Pacific Peacemaker, which was protesting at the French nuclear testing at Moruroa Atoll, was impounded by the French authorities at Papeete in Tahiti. Is the Minister aware that the captain and crew of the Pacific Peacemaker claim that their yacht was deliberately rammed by a French vessel and that film of this incident is now being processed in Australia? I ask the Minister: If the ramming of the vessel is substantiated by a court of marine enquiry, will the Government be prepared to seek an apology from the French about the whole incident and also support a claim to be lodged by the owners of the vessel for proper compensation for damage caused to the yacht?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2213) Senator Archer asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In view of the continuing weakness in the world tin market and the importance of tin to a number of Australian communities, particularly in Tasmania, what is the Government doing to improve the situation at present?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There is little that the Government can do directly to counter the effect on the Australian tin mining industry of the weakness in the world tin market. The weakness is a result of the general downturn in world economic activity, some excess of production over demand, a build up of stocks of tin metal and the disposal of tin by the United States Government from surplus strategic stocks.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the adverse effects on the Australian industry have been moderated by the operation of the International Tin Agreement of which Australia is a member along with other tin producing countries and a number of consuming countries. Following a sharp fall in world prices last February prices have been prevented from falling further by the purchase of substantial quantities of tin under the buffer stock arrangements in the Tin Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia and other member countries have provided finance, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement to cover the purchase of some 27,000 tonnes of tin and the International Tin Council has also arranged bank loans to provide further funds for buffer stock operations. In addition, the International Tin Council decided last month that producer members of the Agreement should introduce export controls to limit the amount of current tin production being placed on the world market. There can be little doubt that tin prices would have virtually collapsed without the action under the International Tin Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> As regards sales of tin from United States strategic stocks, these sales have a price depressing effect particularly in times of weak demand and have the potential to destabilise the world market. I made representations to the United States Special Trade Representative (Mr Brock) on 16 April 1982 suggesting that , in the current difficult situation the United States should temporarily cease sales of the surplus stockpile tin. Whilst this suggestion was not accepted the level of sales has been greatly reduced compared with that in the latter part of 1981.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I assume the honourable senator is referring to a severe form of the disease, viz. dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, when he refers to the 'killer' variety of the disease in which there is mortality especially among children. From South East Asia, 20,632 deaths were notified in the 25 years from 1956 to 1980. These figures almost certainly grossly understate the actual occurrence of the disease in these countries due to difficulties in the reporting systems.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Commonwealth and State officers maintain a close contact concerning the spread of arbo virus disease throughout Australia. This contact has also been maintained with Queensland health authorities during the recent dengue outbreak in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> The $5m mentioned in the honourable senator's question and said to be required for mosquito eradication in Queensland appears to represent comments quoted in the newspaper report and does not represent the views of the Queensland State Health Department.</PARA>
<PARA> Eradication of Aedes aegypti which is the particular mosquito vector of dengue fever could be achieved by a more modest expenditure on public health and public awareness programs conducted in local areas. The removal of discarded cans and drums, old tyres, and plastic food containers, particularly ice cream containers , and similar household items in which mosquitoes breed would quickly eliminate the problem.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Funds are not provided by the Commonwealth to match State government funding on a dollar for dollar basis specifically to eradicate dengue fever. However, under the Australian Encephalitis Control Program, funding along these lines has been provided since 1974-75. The basis of the Australian Encephalitis Control Program is the control of mosquito vectors and consequently benefit is derived not only in relation to Australian Encephalitis but also in relation to a wider range of arbo virus diseases. In 1981-82 Queensland applied for, and received funding for the first time, under the program, for a mosquito control program based in the Townsville area. Queensland's proposal for Commonwealth funding for 1982-83 under the program is being considered in the budgetary context.</PARA>
