<PARA> 1. Uphold the principal that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes.

<PARA> 3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving ' property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.</PARA>

<PARA> (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) subordination and/or curtailments of public breeding programmes,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. By some strange coincidence it has a familiarity with the notice of motion given by my colleague, Senator Robert Ray. I refer the Minister to the Government's decision to spend $300,000-$100,000 in Victoria-on an advertising campaign designed to explain the new housing policy and also to rescue the Liberal Government before the State election on 3 April. Has not the Prime Minister continually complained in recent speeches about the lack of understanding of the Government's policies in the electorate? Is the Minister aware that the task force on departmental information released earlier this year -a Fraser Government task force-reported that a significant number of people were being disadvantaged because they did not know about Government welfare programs? Is it a fact that the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty found that in 1973 some 17,000 households were entitled to some kind of pension or benefit but were not receiving one, largely through ignorance? Did the task force of the Fraser Government advert to this fact? Will the Minister see that at least part, if not all, of the $100,000 allocated for the Victorian advertising campaign is directed at people who are living in poverty and are not being told by the Government that they are entitled to benefits?</PARA></TALK.START>

It also aims to provide tax rebates and a new home savings grants system. I would have thought that everybody would have agreed that in order to help these people the specific nature of these programs should be brought to their attention regardless of whether an election is to be held in a particular State. For example, I notice that no one is suggesting that we should not advertise in Tasmania. However, the question relates to the dimension and principle of this matter.

The answer to that question is yes. It is a good thing.

I have no doubt in the world that we are observing the recommendations of the task force. I repeat the very simple fact that this is a particularly good housing policy. It will help tens of thousands of people. I cannot believe that the Australian Labor Party would want to deny people the right to know about it.

Is the Minister aware that the two conventions which were adopted at the General Conference of UNESCO at its tenth session in 1958 and which came into force in 1961 are considered essential to developments in the exchange of publications for the free exchange of ideas and knowledge among peoples of the world? Is it the intention of the Australian Government to ratify these conventions?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question was raised last year, I think, when the Commonwealth Government was reviewing the States' personal income tax sharing arrangements that had been instituted in 1976. It was decided then that the local government tax sharing arrangements should continue to be based on net personal income tax collections. The value of the Commonwealth's tax sharing grants to local government increased by 60 per cent in real terms based on net personal income tax between the 1976 year and the 1981-82 year. As I understand it, some local government associations are of the view that it is in local government's best interests for personal income tax to continue as the base for tax sharing assistance rather than total taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose views could differ as to whether local government would have an advantage using total taxes as against personal income tax after looking at figures for one year or another. As I said, the arrangements were reviewed in 1981 and it was decided to continue them. With the growth we have seen, I think many local governments consider the arrangements satisfactory. I know of no prospect of changing them in the near future but of course that, in common with many other matters, will always be subject to study and decision at the appropriate time.</PARA>

It is true, as Senator Chipp says, that the AMA is not known to be a rampant socialist body. It is also true that the Australian Medical Association, as part, I think, of an emerging policy of responsible social intervention, made a submission recently which was reported in the newspapers. It had to do with the costs of smoking and the extent of subsidy of the tobacco industry. Any policy matters concerning that subsidy are obviously matters for the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge some of the points made by Senator Chipp. He talked about the cost of smoking being estimated at between $650m and $950m a year. Firstly, the costs are enormous. Secondly, it is very hard to identify them with precision. The honourable senator will acknowledge that the figures given are very broad. The subsidy to the industry is quite considerable but I ask the Senate to note that the Government, in responding to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, made two points: The Government is committed as a matter of policy to diminishing the extent of smoking in Australia and it accepts the enormous health costs associated with cigarette smoking generally. I think those two acknowledgments by the Government set the framework for the development of Government policy. The co-ordination of different kinds of policy in different areas is a problem which may take some time to work through.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not see the statement by the Western Australian Premier but I had some very close associations with the implementation of the tax sharing arrangement and its subsequent modifications. When it was first implemented it was based upon a share of personal income tax at the rate of, I think, 39.87 per cent. At that time the various State leaders suggested that that should not be immutable; that we should consider the whole basis of taxes so that as the fortunes of the Federal government, in terms of its revenue, rose or fell, the States would share fairly. This made sense because the Federal government had indicated that from time to time when the opportunity presented itself it intended to cut personal income tax. Therefore, if we were wedded purely to personal income tax the States would suffer. More recently the link to full taxation has been made. It appeared that that would be a more logical basis , for the reason, as I have said, that the States would benefit in exactly the proportion that the Commonwealth does.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Education. By way of information I refer the Minister to Senator Chaney's excellent answer yesterday to Senator Siddons' question on industrial relations. In his reply, Senator Chaney said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the basic proposals which the Government has indicated it is putting forward relate to the question of whether a man can be forced to join a trade union if he is to have a job . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Those are sentiments with which I fully concur. I ask: Since the Government is prepared to support the concept that a person cannot be forced to join a union to get a job, will the Government similarly legislate so that a person does not have to join a union to get an education or a degree? Would the Minister not agree that unless compulsory student union fees are abolished the Government is guilty of having double standards?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, with Senator MacGibbon, commend the principle of voluntary unionism, the right of choice of a person to join or not to join an association. The Government agrees that no student in the pursuit of education should be forced to join a students union. Indeed, the Government has made strenuous endeavours, particularly in the areas in which it has authority-that is, in the Australian Capital Territory-to ensure that this is so. The Government has also, through its Ministry of Education, invited the States to ensure that this should be so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Was the recent bank interest rate rise for home loans the first step in the Government's plan to deregulate interest rates, as suggested in the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System ? As thousands of home buyers are now finding difficulties in meeting rising interest rate repayments, can the Government give any assurances to home buyers that they will not be further disadvantaged in the future? Has the Government, while formulating its housing policy, given any consideration to, or made any assessment of, the costs incurred to the social welfare system when families break up as a direct result of their inability to meet financial commitments of home buying?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The features that were announced last week with regard to housing assistance were the response of the Government to a number of factors and not only to recommendations in the Campbell report. Many recommendations in that report are under study by the Government. In fact, the whole report is under study by the Government. I do not think it would be argued that what was done last week was a direct response to that report. Rather it was a response by the Government to the difficulties that many people are finding in raising the funds to establish their first homes and in the general context of housing. These matters were able to be covered by the policy that we announced last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where there is breakdown of family through an inability to continue in its own home, there is considerable cost to the social welfare system, as there is for breakdown in family relationships generally. A very large number of people become social welfare beneficiaries with dissolution of marriage in the Family Court. There would be those who, as a result of breakdown of marriage, would use many of the services of a welfare nature that are provided in the community. I do not know that any particular figure can be placed on social welfare usage as a direct result of an inability to continue with the home ownership which a family may have embarked upon some time before. There is no information that I could undertake to provide on the last part of the honourable senator's question . However, I will ask whether there is anything that could be directly related to the question and, if so, I will see that the information is provided.</PARA>

Will the Government reaffirm the objectives of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme by giving, at this time of receiving Budget submissions, careful and sympathetic consideration to increases in the value and accessibility of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme so as to benefit Australia's students and to make up for losses through inflation?

TEAS is aimed at helping needy students to gain a tertiary education, and it has worked well. Indeed, over the years the Fraser Government has made significant increases in TEAS. As Minister for Education I was able, in the second year of my ministry, to rectify some of the grave faults that the previous Labor Government had brought about.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for National Development and Energy whether he is aware of a recent statement by the president of a major aluminium producer, Mitsui Alumina Co. Ltd of Tokyo, that the company has developed a technology to smelt aluminium by a method other than electrolysis and that a pilot plant will be built next year. Is he aware that the new process would dramatically reduce the need for electric power in aluminium production and substantially reduce the cost of the metal; further, that not only bauxite ore, but also other materials containing alumina, such as clay and shale, could be used? Will the Minister ask his Department to investigate claims that the new process will be at the major production stage within a decade, the same time span as the proposed new hydro- electric development in South West Tasmania? Is it not a fact that if this new technology fulfils the promise its promoters believe it has, this must profoundly affect all areas of industry, since aluminium might well then compete with steel as a raw material? In particular, what implications does the Minister see for proposed new electricity power generation plants in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales designed mainly to meet the requirements of making aluminium by the Bayer electrolysis process? Is it not a fact that if the Mitsui process develops successfully, all these proposals, if carried into reality, will amount to enormously expensive white elephants?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1093" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that alumina smelting is very hungry in its appetite for electricity. It has been suggested that in this decade we hope to increase electric power generation throughout Australia by some 90 or perhaps 100 per cent and that, of that increment, up to 30 per cent could be used for smelting alumina. That would be on the basis that whereas today we produce approximately 280,000 tonnes of the metal annually, by the end of the decade we would be producing two million tonnes annually. Perhaps those figures will be a little lower over the decade as a result of the world recession. As to the latter part of the question, it is true that alumina smelting is energy hungry. I am aware of reports on the Mitsui development. This is still in the experimental demonstration phase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will describe the process. Aluminium bearing materials are crushed and mixed with coal to form a briquette which is then burned in a blast furnace at about 2 ,000 degrees centigrade. Lead sprayed on the resultant compound of alumina, iron and silicon changes the mix to an aluminium-lead alloy. Lead is drawn off under vacuum, leaving aluminium. The importance of the process is that it uses little, if any, electricity, relying on a blast furnace rather than on an electrolytic process; it has low labour costs, mainly as a result of its dispensing with the intermediate process of alumina production; and it can utilise low grade bauxite deposits available in Japan, Korea and China. Therefore this process would have profound effects.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the process is in an experimental and demonstration phase. It has not been proved on a commercial scale. Mitsui has cautioned against alarm amongst owners of new and prospective smelters using existing technology, stating that commercial use of the new process is 10 years off. The Mitsui process is a logical development of higher energy costs and the energy intensiveness of the Bayer and Hall-Heroult processes which are the current technologies used to tranform bauxite to alumina and alumina to the metal. The Mitsui process is one of a number of new processes being investigated throughout the world. The recent expansion in the aluminium industry in Australia has been based on the latest commercially available technology. Those smelters will take advantage of recently developed technology relating to pot design, anode manufacture, control of airborne emissions from the pot-line and reduced electricity consumption in the smelting process. Of course, we will keep the whole of the development under close scrutiny. It would be of major benefit to the world should there be such a breakthrough. Any excess electric power generation which Australia may then have could be put to very good use indeed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In general terms my Department and its Bureau of Mineral Resources has had a very keen and detailed interest in the search for coal, whether brown or black, in South Australia. The discovery of coal in exploitable quantities and quality would, of course, alter very considerably the industrial potential of South Australia. For one thing it would ease the use of natural gas in electricity generation. A number of explorations have yielded evidence of brown and black coal deposits. In order to give a precise answer I will seek the actual details from my Department. I am not aware of specific discussions between the Electricity Trust of South Australia, CSR and my Department on the exploitation of coal. There are continuous researches on the use of coal in South Australia, but I will take that aspect on board.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have no knowledge of any approach by the South Australian Government for loan funds to develop such a coal-fired power station. I cannot recollect any such approach. I believe that none was made. If it was made it would have been under infrastructure financing. My instinct is that the maiden request was for the northern power station which is the primary one at this moment. Just in case there has been any approach that I do not know of I will ask the Department to put that matter on inquiry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Chipp has such evidence I would be very willing to have it and to put it under scrutiny. The fact is that retail petrol and petroleum products price fixing is a State matter; it is not a Commonwealth matter. It comes entirely under State law. The various States impose various charges. They have price fixing systems and various charges. Petrol prices vary amongst the States for a variety of reasons, the most significant being a result of differing State government attitudes to petrol price regulation and franchise fees on transport fuels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present the South Australian Government has set wholesale prices for petrol sold in that State at 3c a litre less than the maximum wholesale price found justified by the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority. This may largely explain the difference between wholesale prices in South Australia and Tasmania. The New South Wales Government sets both wholesale and retail prices through the New South Wales Prices Commission, the maximum wholesale price for petrol being approximately 2c a litre lower than that recommended by the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority. We must bear in mind that the Commonwealth authority fixes the maximum price. Maximum retail prices in New South Wales have been set at levels varying from 38c to 39.2c a litre for the major metropolitan areas and up to 39.62c a litre in other areas. Price fixation is a detailed matter on which I have some lengthy information. Perhaps after Question Time I will supplement this answer.</PARA>

Another reason for price differentials among States is the varying levels of franchise fees imposed by them. At present Victoria imposes a fee of 2.05c per litre on premium petrol; South Australia imposes 1.50c per litre; Western Australia imposes 1.60c per litre; Tasmania imposes 1.57c per litre; and two States do not impose a fee. In addition, some States, but not South Australia, impose low lead controls and this cost adds to the price of petrol. In Tasmania it means a further 0.07c per litre. Prices in Tasmania also include an outport differential of 0.11c per litre which does not apply to mainland capitals. If there is further information which I can give the honourable senator, I will be happy to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Yesterday Senator Watson asked me a question concerning industrial research and development funding. I undertook to provide further information in response to it. I now have a response from the Minister concerned. It is a page and a half in length and contains many figures. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> It is not true that the Federal Government has slashed finance for industrial research and development. There has, however, been a revision of the estimated amounts required to discharge funding obligations this financial year in respect of commencement grants, project grants and public interest projects.</PARA>
<PARA> Of the 1981-82 Budget appropriation for commencement grants of $10.5m, it is now estimated that some $9.5m only will be expended this financial year. I emphasise that this revision to the estimates entails no change in Government policy. Companies which are eligible to receive commencement grants under the Industrial Research and Development Grants Act will receive their entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of project grants, an amount of $32.68m was appropriated in the 1981-82 Budget. The bulk of this amount was appropriated to meet financial obligations under existing agreements with firms that were expected at that time to fall due for payment in 1981-82. It is currently estimated that an amount of $11.18m will not now be required this financial year to meet such project grant funding obligations as a result of lower-than-expected claims from firms for advance payments and unexpected delays by firms in progressing projects. Again I emphasise that any firm which is entitled to receive funds under an existing project grant agreement with the Australian Industrial Research and Development Board will receive its entitlements. Obligations which were previously expected to be discharged this financial year will now require funding in 1982-83 or later financial years.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of public interest projects, some genuine savings will be achieved this financial year against the Budget appropriation as part of the Government' s vigorous efforts to contain expenditures. Of the $6.0m appropriated for public interest projects in the 1981-82 Budget an amount of $3.55m is not now expected to be expended this financial year, although some of this funding will be required in future years. Again, any firm entitled to receive funding for a public interest project under an existing agreement will receive its entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA> As regards the 120 companies referred to by the honourable senator, no company has or will be denied funds for research projects that it is entitled to receive this financial year. The Minister for Science and Technology has advised me that the current limit on the financial obligations which the IR&amp;D Board may incur would not permit the Board to enter new project grant agreements this financial year in respect of some 120 applications which might otherwise have been approved. However, there is no requirement that the IR&amp;D Board approve all project grant applications received and the Board has already approved new project grant agreements this year entailing the expenditure of some $5.1m in 1981-82 and some $11.2m in future financial years. The Board is charged with the task of assessing project grant applications and entering new agreements within the limits of the funds and obligation levels available to it in accordance with the IR&amp;D Act. Funding levels for new IR&amp;D projects will be determined in the 1982-83 Budget context in the light of the Government's decisions on the Industries Assistance Commission's report on certain budgetary assistance to industry and the Government's obligations to provide funding under existing agreements.</PARA>

<TITLE>NEW SOUTH WALES ELECTRICITY SUPPLY SYSTEM</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="1098" SPEAKER="Reid Sen M.E." NAMEID="VI4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="ACT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Australian Capital Territory)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.39)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate yesterday passed a Bill to amend the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Act 1962 to enable emergency powers to be given to the Minister for the Capital Territory ( Mr Hodgman) so that in the event of a threatened disruption to supply of electricity to the Australian Capital Territory he can take steps to regulate it . I think it is reasonable that this matter should be discussed so that the people of the Australian Capital Territory and others affected by the situation in New South Wales can know why the supply of electricity is at risk and why they are in the situation in which they are now placed. They are also entitled to ask how long they can expect it to continue. Some suggestions have been that the problem will last for about five years. Mr Wran has said it will last for about one year. This warrants looking a little closer at Mr Wran's statement which was reported in the Daily Telegraph of 2 February this year. The Daily Telegraph stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Wran admitted the electricity system was so crippled at present that power supplies would be on a knife-edge for several months. </PARA>
<PARA> And he said he could give no guarantee that there would be no blackouts this winter. </PARA>
<PARA>The Daily Telegraph continued:</PARA>
<PARA> 'But we will beat it-there's no doubt about that,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I sincerely believe that, given co-operation from the unions and public, we will see the problem through this winter. </PARA>
<PARA>I think, given what has happened in the last couple of weeks, one can question how seriously we can take his pious hope that there will be co-operation from the unions. In the Australian Capital Territory, of course, we have seen that there has been co-operation from the public. We are entitled also to look at the actual capacity of New South Wales to meet its commitments to its own citizens and to the Australian Capital Territory. There is a capacity of production inside New South Wales of 8,236 megawatt hours and the Snowy Mountains Hydro- Electric Authority has a capacity of 2,200 megawatt hours-a total of 10,436 megawatt hours. The summer peak demand is usually about 5,000 megawatt hours; in the winter of 1981 it was about 8,000 megawatt hours and in 1982 it is expected that it will be about 8,500 megawatt hours. From those figures it can be seen that the capacity to produce is approximately 30 per cent more than the demand. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the people of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory are entitled to expect that supply will meet demand. Why is it then that they are faced with power cuts? Why is it that the system which exists in New South Wales cannot cope with the demand? Of course, we are not told much about that. There is a fair amount of secrecy about what is the cause of the breakdowns in the New South Wales system. I am sure that somebody must know the answer. The situation now is that there are so many plants out of service that other plants cannot be stopped for the regular maintenance that they will need. One can, perhaps, predict that as this year passes the situation will get worse instead of better. The Sydney Morning Herald this morning produced some figures which set this out quite clearly. The article indicated:</PARA>
<PARA> Ten out of 28 generating units were out of action with faults, and the stations could produce only 33 per cent of their combined capacity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Liddell station which has four major 500 megawatt units with an output of 2, 000 megawatts produced none yesterday-the four units are all down. The Vales Point power station with six units had three not working and produced only 806 megawatts out of 2,195 megawatts. So, it goes on. A total of only 3,100 megawatts was produced from a total capacity of 8,100 megawatts. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, steps are being taken to overcome this. Emergency equipment is being activated and 12 gas turbine generator units are being installed at four centres -Port Kembla, Bunnerong, just north of the Eraring power station and Koolthan in the north of New South Wales, where four units are being installed. In addition, of course, efforts are being made to bring the 660 megawatt Eraring power station on line. That, of course, also has been plagued by industrial strife and is running late. The four Liddell power units are also running late as a result of industrial strife and will not be coming into service again as soon as had been predicted. However, even if units of 660 megawatts were commissioned every six months that would only keep up with the expanding demand in New South Wales. The other intersting factor, of course, is that it seems to be the newest plants that are breaking down, not the oldest ones. The oldest ones are now being rushed into service. No doubt their maintenance has been of about the same standard as the maintenance of the newer units. So I think we can anticipate that they will prove to be unreliable and cause further problems. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth having a brief look at the capital costs. I think it is reasonable to compare New South Wales and Queensland given that they are the major black coal producers. In 1975-76 there was an increase of 8.8 per cent in New South Wales and 13.9 per cent in Queensland. The following year showed an increase of 9.7 per cent in New South Wales and 12.4 per cent in Queensland. The next year showed an increase of 9.5 per cent in New South Wales and 12 per cent in Queensland. In 1978-79 the increase was 10.5 per cent in New South Wales and 10. 1 per cent in Queensland. The increase in Queensland was a little lower that year. In 1979-80 the figure was 11.8 per cent in New South Wales and 19.4 per cent in Queensland. New South Wales has had the full infrastructure borrowing requirements met by the Federal Government. In 1981-82 the amount was slightly lower but it was still sufficient to allow the full allocation by the New South Wales Government for its electricity program. </PARA>
<PARA> We come then to the question of maintenance of this expensive and valuable equipment. It is in this area that gross mismanagement has really occurred. The Sydney Morning Herald of 30 January 1982 had an interesting article which said:</PARA>
<PARA> Power black-outs for householders and industry in N.S.W. this winter are now virtually inevitable, Electricity Commission engineers said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, when one refers to New South Wales in this regard one includes the Australian Capital Territory as well. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The situation is so critical that it will require only a large generating unit to fail in the winter peak, and load-shedding will have to occur. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the newspaper the engineer said that for three years the Commission had been banking up massive problems by allowing the program of annual plant maintenance to fall progressively further behind. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> For 2 1/2 to three years the commission has refused to allow the annual four- weekly overhaul of the four 500-megawatt units at Liddell power station, which have the capacity to produce 25 per cent of the State's power. </PARA>
<PARA>At that time three of those units were out and the fourth one is out now also. That is the situation with respect to the maintenance of these units. The difference between the Liddell units and those elsewhere is that in the United Kingdom the same units are subjected to regular preventive maintenance. The four Liddell units were commissioned in 1972-73. They were made and installed by the British General Electric organisation. There are 12 similar units operating in the United Kingdom which are aged from eight to 15 years. But those units have not had the same problems. Design faults are now blamed for the troubles at Liddell. But given that they have been in operation for 60,000 hours I certainly would take a bit of convincing that the problems now could be because of a design fault. </PARA>
<PARA> With the 30 per cent capacity available in excess of demand there can be no excuse for not having had regular maintenance of the power plants in New South Wales. It should have been quite simple to have organised a program for maintenance that enabled regular checks to be made so that the present situation could not occur. The only other conclusion one can come to is that for some reason the funds have not been made available. Of course, the fact is that the New South Wales Government has run down the financial reserves of its statutory authorities, affecting this one and probably others. The Premier of New South Wales is recorded in the New South Wales parliamentary Hansard on 9 March 1982 as making a statement that I find quite quaint. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has pursued a deliberate policy of running down its cash reserves in accordance with proper accounting procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what Mr Wran understands as proper accounting procedures but for myself a rundown of cash balances indicates that I do not have enough resources to do what I might like to do. I suspect that the same situation applies in New South Wales. He has run down his resources and has run down the ability to maintain the Liddell and other power generators. The New South Wales Government seeks to blame and mislead on this issue. For a while it had us believe that the problem was caused by drought in the Monaro and that the Snowy Mountains scheme was at fault. The Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority has operated within its design parameters, supplying peak load to New South Wales. It is not designed as a base load unit. We would not want it changed for that purpose either because presumably the same sort of thing could happen in the Snowy as has happened in New South Wales if the equipment is overloaded, misused or is not properly maintained. The real issue is the Wran Government's inability to handle industrial relations with respect to the power industry. This has caused delayed construction and disruption to what maintenance has been done. Despite the impossibility of meeting the maintenance requirements-not to mention the backlog-there is now the introduction of a 35-hour working week. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to quote from a comment of the Premier of New South Wales with respect to the bringing in of the 37 1/2-hour week for power workers in New South Wales. At the time he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This will mean increased productivity and no blackouts. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the problems that we have had since June of last year it can be small comfort to workers and industry in New South Wales that there is now a 35-hour week. Of course, there are demands for more pay as well. We are faced with a small group of workers who are quite happy to hold the rest of the work force to ransom-a group of workers who, in fact, receive considerably more pay than most of those who were stood down this week. Notwithstanding that, they are prepared to proceed. An article appeared in today's Australian newspaper which I will not read in full but which is worth noting. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales power crisis threatens the jugular of the multi-million dollar coal export industry at the port of Newcastle designed to handle a constant stream of valuable shipments to Japan and other countries. The whole of this country is suffering as a result of these problems in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA>Looking back a little, there have been a lot of interesting statements made which one would like to quote but cannot do so in the time available. The New South Wales Hansard of 6 March 1981 tells us that the Premier assured the people of his State:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no truth in the assertion that it will be necessary to ration electricity. There is no reason for blackouts to occur. </PARA>
<PARA>But, as we know, there were problems in June and December of that year. Recently the Premier changed tack a little and said that it is the people using too much power who are really to blame. At the same time, of course, he has been busily trying to attract to New South Wales the power-hungry aluminium industry and has promised it cheap and reliable power. It may be cheap but it certainly is not now reliable. As a result of this many Australians face a very bleak winter indeed. It is clear that the Labor Government cannot run an essential government service. The proof of this is the fact it has now embarked on a $1m public relations 'campaign', if that is what one could call it. One of the newspapers indicated that it was more like a mealy-mouthed word for being brain washed. Perhaps 'reprogrammed' is a better word. An amount of $1m is being spent on an advertising program in order to try to make the consumer believe that he is at fault and should feel guilty. But that is not so. It is the Government of New South Wales which should be feeling very guilty indeed about the cuts that have been imposed. During the 1981 State election-some of Mr Wran's comments bear looking at in that light-in his policy speech with respect to power he said:</PARA>
<PARA> To grasp the opportunities and to meet the challenges of such massive new development, we have embarked upon the biggest power generation program in the history of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We are determined that the needs of industry shall be met. </PARA>
<PARA> We are equally determined to protect the householders, the ordinary domestic consumers of electricity. </PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales has the cheapest electricity to householders in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to keep it that way. </PARA>
<PARA> We intend that the Government itself shall have both control over and responsibility for the price of electricity to domestic consumers in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say again that he would ensure that New South Wales domestic consumers continue to enjoy the cheapest electricity in Australia. It may be the cheapest electricity in Australia but it is not exactly available. It is a bit like having one item on sale as a special and attempting to attract customers into a store on that basis. The real cost is to industry, to commerce and to the workers who have been stood down and can be expected to be stood down again. The Australian today states:</PARA>
<PARA> Power zoning in New South Wales will end at midnight tonight if vital generating plant at Vales Point in the Hunter Valley is repaired and operating on schedule today. </PARA>
<PARA> But the New South Minister for Energy, Mr Landa, could give no guarantee that zoning would not be reintroduced next week and that unscheduled blackouts would not occur. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he cannot give any guarantee of that because he knows that he cannot have any influence with the power unions in New South Wales, which will go on strike when it suits them, no matter what the cost to the State, to Australia and to the workers who are losing income as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth having a look at the actual costs. Without doubt New South Wales is the most industrialised State and the impact is great indeed. Shutting down one day a week indicates a loss of working hours ten times as great as the number lost in New South Wales through industrial disputes; and there have been plenty of them. The actual loss of wages to a worker is $44 net per week of his disposable income. That is a considerable amount to any man in that situation. There is loss of income from pay-as-you-earn tax system to the Federal Government. The whole economy is affected by loss of sales, loss of profits and loss of employment opportunities. But workers in this small group of workers do not care about that. The New South Wales Government has provided them with an environment in which they can hold the community to ransom. The Hobart Mercury of 23 March states:</PARA>
<PARA> The power crisis is compounded by the Government, which prides itself on having enlightened industrial relations policy, losing control of key unions in the power industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The same editorial states further:</PARA>
<PARA> The power crisis is not, however, the sole fault of recalcitrant unions either. It seems to be more a combination of planning and policy mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA>There can be no doubt what the problems in New South Wales are. The pity of it is that so many families in New South Wales will suffer loss of income as a result. The community of the Australian Capital Territory will suffer as a result and, New South Wales being, as I said, the largest industrialised State, the whole of Australia will suffer as a result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Science fiction, it may seem to the honourable senator, but I ask him to come and talk to me in about a month's time and see how much science fiction is involved in it. The Senate should understand clearly that this matter of public importance is devoted to that fourth purpose and not to the three purposes suggested in Senator Reid's three drafts. Let us look at some of the facts, first of all, in relation to the power situation in New South Wales and as it relates to the electric power situation throughout Australia. Only three weeks ago the Australian Financial Review, which ran a series of articles on the power situation in Australia, had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The power crisis is not just a matter of maladministration in a single State. The whole Australian eastern seaboard is in real trouble. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me give honourable senators some facts in relation to that comment in the Australian Financial Review. New South Wales has had blackouts for one 24-hour period since the Wran Government, the subject of Senator Reid's vituperation, came to power six years ago. Let us look at what has happened in other States in that same six years. In Queensland in July 1981 blackouts and rationing occurred over the whole State for three days. On 4 August 1981 there were State-wide blackouts in Queensland. On 25 August 1981 there were blackouts in north Queensland. In October 1981 extensive blackouts occurred, again in north Queensland. We did not hear from Senator Reid on that occasion about the consequences of those blackouts for Australian industry nor did we hear about the poor workers of Queensland who were being put out of jobs by those blackouts . Senator Reid was strangely silent on that occasion. On 8 January 1982 again there was a total loss of electricity supply in southern Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria, between 19 May and 22 May 1981 there were major power failures. On 24 June and 25 June 1981 there were more power failures on a large scale. On 23 July 1981 there were severe restrictions and blackouts. That compares with one day in New South Wales in the last six years. When those blackouts occurred in Victoria, we did not hear from Senator Lewis about the disastrous situation that was being inflicted on the Australian people by the Victorian Government. In South Australia on 24 January 1982 there was a 20 per cent reduction in supply. There have been widespread power failures in Western Australia on four occasions between January and March 1981. On 3 June 1981 there were widespread blackouts. On 3 February 1982 there were blackouts and power restrictions. These occurred on many days on which the Senate was sitting. But we did not hear Senator Lewis chastising Sir Charles Court about that matter in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I have given those examples simply to illustrate a point. It is no coincidence that today has been chosen as the day on which to attack the Wran Government out of the five State governments that I have mentioned. It is not that the breasts of the honourable senators sitting opposite are weeping tears of blood for the workers of New South Wales. If they did they would do so on a totally indiscriminate basis because this problem of power and energy supply is a national problem which has affected all States in Australia at one time or another in the last two years and particularly Victoria in the last year. </PARA>
<PARA> So much has been made in the course of this debate that has been going on in the last few days and in answers to questions about the use of Victorian electricity by New South Wales. The fact is that under a 20-year agreement between Victoria and New South Wales power is exchanged on a half-hourly basis. Whenever one State needs more power it gets it from the other. On 28 May last year, Mr Clem Joyce, the Assistant Manager of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria wrote to the Australian newspaper. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Excellent co-operation in power sharing exists between the two Commissions ( Elcom of New South Wales and SEC of Victoria). On this, as on other occasions, Elcom has provided support for Victoria without prejudicing the consumers of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> We in Victoria have not and do not ask for more. </PARA>
<PARA> When the roles are reversed, and they are from time to time, the SEC provides assistance to Elcom, short of prejudicing supply to consumers in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>The Assistant Manager of the SEC went on to say that the New South Wales electricity authority should be publicly thanked for helping the State Electricity Commission of Victoria during Victoria's power crisis last year. I think he is a man, obviously, of great generosity of spirit compared with some of the senators on the Government side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in New South Wales, which Senator Reid adverted to, derives from two things. Let me say that it is no comfort to us on this side of the chamber and it should be no comfort to any responsible Minister of the Federal Parliament to see people put out of work by the action of a minority and selfish group of trade unionists. It should be of no satisfaction to honourable senators on either side of this Parliament so see people put out of work as a result of breakdowns in electricity plants. That should be of no satisfaction whatsoever. Senator Reid thinks that selfish trade union activity has been involved. If that is a fact I would condemn it as much as she does. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the situation which has derived in New South Wales. First of all , there has been an unprecedented and massive breakdown in the Liddell power station in the Hunter Valley. Senator Reid referred to that. The fact is that that station provides 30 per cent of the energy needs of New South Wales. Three of its four generating units have broken down with identical failures. Those failures are now subject to an inquiry by Mr George Masterman, Q.C., on behalf of the New South Wales Government. I think it is perhaps less than proper for the Senate to canvass the reasons as to why those breakdowns have occurred. Senator Reid took it upon herself to reject the view that these breakdowns may have been caused by design faults. That is a specific matter of quasi-judicial inquiry in New South Wales. Be that as it may, that is one of the options which is advanced by way of explanation of the failure at Liddell. It there had not been the failure at the Liddell power station New South Wales would have had no difficulty in meeting its power requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The second problem in New South Wales to which Senator Reid adverted is industrial trouble which has delayed the repair of failed units. Of course, one can blame the unions involved for that industrial trouble. That is very easy to do. It is part of the scapegoat syndrome of Australian politics to blame everybody but yourself. If Senator Reid is accusing the Wran Government of that, I regard it as a legitimate allegation. I do not know whether it is true or not. But if Mr Wran is doing that, it is something that clearly he has learnt from the Fraser Government, because this Government does that in respect of all its failings. It seeks scapegoats in society for matters which it has promised in its electoral programs to do something about. I think one thing that cannot be avoided is that the Government senators cannot have it both ways. They cannot belong to a government which, according to the report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which Senator Sir John Carrick quotes selectively, has no wages policy. Inevitably, there will be industrial unrest at a high level, as has occurred in Australia if one embarks on a period of government by making promises to the work force in this country about wage indexation, for example, and then promptly breaking them as did the Fraser Government. We will arrive at a situation where we will get rid of the wage indexation system and in six months the entire work force in this country will catch up with what it has lost in six years because of the failure of the Government's promise to maintain wage indexation. Thas is what has happened in Australia. That is the basic cause of all the industrial relations in this country at the moment. Those problems can be laid right at the door of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator, with blackouts. Do not get excited about cheap political points. I make the point that New South Wales is undertaking a big power generation program. One of the difficulties that that program has run into is the stubborn opposition of the Fraser Government which has imposed the most severe centralist control in the history of Australia under the so-called new federalism in relation to the States' capacity to borrow money for those sorts of developments. I make the point that the New South Wales Government has that problem to overcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to conclude this somewhat ecumenical survey of the electricity power situation by referring to the situation in my own State of Victoria to illustrate that this is a problem, as the Australian Financial Review points out , not of maladministration by one government but by six governments. At that stage they were not concerned with the Federal Government; they would have said so had they devoted their energies to that topic. It is a case of maladministration by six State governments and massive maladministration by seven, because the Federal Government has failed to provide any leadership in the co-ordination of power generation in Australia. The Prime Minister, Mr Lindsay Thompson, the current Premier of Victoria, and the Victorian Minister for Minerals and Energy have all claimed that since last year a considerable additional generating capacity has been produced in Victoria. That assertion is false. On 4 March this year the Australian Financial Review had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Somebody is lying about the power situation in Victoria and it is not the academic analysts. </PARA>
<PARA>I cannot say that in this chamber because of the Standing Orders. I will put it in these terms: Malcolm Fraser, Lindsay Thompson, and Mr Crozier are not telling the truth about the additional generating capacity in Victoria. The only new generating capacity in Victoria since the severe restrictions last June is being produced at the Yallourn W4 station. All other units were on stream prior to those restrictions and the new generating capacity amounts to 375 megawatts only . The increase in demand in Victoria exceeds the 375 megawatts now being produced at Yallourn W4. Important parts of the Newport unit in Victoria have had to be replaced. This unit is currently out of service, and it will be for six weeks. Major refurbishing at Hazelwood power station is taking place. There have been breakdowns there as well. The situation involves a national problem of great importance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Up to about three or four minutes ago I thought I was going to rise and speak in support of what my colleague from Victoria, the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button), had been saying. Notwithstanding his allegations, it is not my intention to commence an attack on Mr Wran. I made a note of what Senator Button said, namely, that there was no satisfaction on that side of the Parliament in seeing people put out of work by selfish trade union activity in New South Wales. I thoroughly agree with that. Let there be not the slightest doubt that fundamentally, whatever other reasons there may be, one of the major causes of the problem in New South Wales at present is the action of extremist militant union leaders who are bent on destroying this nation in order to get rid of this form of government which we hold dear. There is not the slightest doubt that their long term fundamental aim is the destruction of this nation's systems of government and administration that we hold dear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, I thought that up to about two or three minutes before the end of Senator Button's speech I would find myself in the surprising position of agreeing with much of what the honourable senator had to say. Right at the death knock he started to make statements which were just patently not true. For example, he said that under the Government's federalist policy it had deprived the States of funds. Everyone knows that during this Government's term of office since 1975-76 the States, in fact, have had available to them far more funds for all sorts of purposes than has the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Loan Council programs of the State governments for 1979-80 and 1980-81. I have the figures with me in the chamber. We see that in 1979-80 New South Wales had available to it a total of $402m in borrowings and capital grants. For 1980-81 it had available to it $422m. That represented 32.33 per cent of total borrowings available to the six States. Senator Button said that in some way or other the Federal Government has deprived the States of funds. Those figures must surely put the lie to that statement. </PARA>
<PARA> He then had the audacity to make some allegation that Victoria has not really increased its output of electrical power. The State Electricity Commission increased its generating capacity last year by 1,400 megawatts, which represented an increase of 35 per cent in its electrical output. Senator Button was talking about an increase in generating capacity of 375 megawatts at Yallourn. This increase has, in fact, been produced within the last five months. This again puts a lie to what Senator Button was saying. It is clear that one of the reasons why Victoria has been able to produce this extra power is because of the relative industrial peace in that State. That must surely be placed firmly as the responsibility of the current Premier of Victoria, Mr Thompson. He has demonstrated repeatedly to the people of Victoria that he is one person who knows how to keep control over the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The subject before the Senate is the effect on Australia of the crisis in the New South Wales electricity supply system, its causes, its nature and its consequence. I did not intend to make this a speech of criticism of Mr Wran as I have some sympathy with him at present. He is trying to govern a State in which the Electricity Commission is producing only 55 per cent of its normal output- not 55 per cent of its capacity, but 55 per cent of its normal output. That State is taking from the State of Victoria, which I proudly represent, up to 17 per cent of production. That may not be all Mr Wran's fault, as Senator Button has said. One has to agree with what the editorial in the Mercury of 23 March- that is today-had to say. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, any thoughts of using the successful record of the Wran Government as an inducement to the voters of Victoria have been dealt a body blow. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the people of Victoria are aware of what the real situation is in New South Wales as a result of six years of Wran Government. Let us look at the power situation in New South Wales. In both hours and pay rates the Electricity Commission of New South Wales has been leading all workers in both the public and private sector. The people working in the power industry of New South Wales, thanks to the Wran Government, now have fewer hours to work than other people in the community and are receiving substantially higher salaries than other people in the community. What has been the result? It has been nothing but further greedy demands, as is mentioned in the Bulletin of 23 March, where it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is those pockets of the workforce which have gained most since the demise of indexation which are clamouring the loudest. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wran is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Don't tell me the Electricity Commission is an ogre as far as employers go. I know they're the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Yet again, it is pay relativity which is causing industrial flare-ups. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the consequence to Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) indicated this week that if 500,000 employees in New South Wales each lose one day a week in work they and their families will suffer a loss of $22m in income each week. The loss in final output by firms in New South Wales will be some $60m each week. Reduced pay-as-you-earn income tax receipts will mean a loss of some $10m each week. Clearly, there will be further repercussions as these losses pass through the community. For example, sales will be reduced because people will have less money to spend. Profits will be reduced throughout the nation, not only in New South Wales. Because New South Wales companies will make less profit, they will be able to buy less from people in other States and the results of these reduced profits will eventually pass through the whole of the Australian community. Prices will be increased as a result of this and inevitably there will be reduced employment in the community. Unemployment in the community will rise as a result of what is happening in New South Wales at present. Let us look at the situation in my State of Victoria. The Age editorial of 23 March stated in reference to the power crisis in New South Wales:</PARA>
<PARA> This time, however, it would be unwise to laugh: We may be next. </PARA>
<PARA>I thoroughly agree with that sentence in the Age editorial. It is unwise for Victorians to laugh because they may be next, especially if Victorians elect Mr Cain as their leader at the next election. My reason for saying that is that Mr Cain has made perfectly clear that he intends to repeal the Essential Services Act, which may be quite necessary for ensuring any future power supplies in Victoria. Mr Thompson has made it clear that the legislation which he and his Government introduced has assisted him to resolve such strikes. The Essential Services Act enabled him last year to move milk and food supplies during a transport strike. The vital State Projects Act enabled the building of the Newport Power Station and thus avoided the darkness which has threatened New South Wales and the Wrongs (Public Contract) Act forced the Builders Labourers Federation to lift the bans on the Loy Yang power station which had been costing Victoria, and the nation, $4m a week. It is just these pieces of legislation which Mr Cain, the leader of the Australian Labor Party in Victoria, has indicated that if he is elected to office he will revoke. I again draw attention to the editorial opinion of the Age of 23 March 1982, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is foolhardy for Labor to promise to repeal legislation like the Essential Services Act which could be necessary to ensure future power supplies. It claims that industrial peace in the Latrobe Valley could be guaranteed by winning the goodwill of the unions; but this has not worked in New South Wales under a Labor Government, and one must be sceptical of it working in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA>That must surely be one of the most truthful of statements published in the Age editorial columns. I have just demonstrated that workers in New South Wales have been granted shorter working hours and higher pay and that they have a statutory authority which has, certainly under Mr Wran, done its level best for the workers of New South Wales. The result is disastrous for New South Wales and disastrous for the nation. I draw further attention to the editorial of the Australian of 24 March. It stated that whenever gross domestic product has begun to grow in this nation:</PARA>
<PARA> The more powerful unions have traditionally jumped in with unsustainable wage grabs. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly that is what has happened in New South Wales. The Mercury editorial stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The power crisis is not, however, the sole fault of recalcitrant unions either. It seems to be more a combination of planning and policy mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the people of Australia realise the need to ensure that future governments in their States do not involve themselves in these planning and policy mistakes and that some sanity is restored to industrial relations in this nation instead of this greedy grab which goes on by the trade unionists described by Senator Button as selfish trade union leaders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the following matter of public importance proposed by Senator Reid:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effect on Australia of the crisis in the New South Wales electricity supply system; its causes, its nature and its consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, we have heard very little to this point from Government speakers about the causes, nature and consequences of what is indeed a very serious situation in New South Wales. We have heard the predictable serving up of stale ideas, the attacking of trade unionism, references to greedy trade unionists and , of course, a good serve for the Wran Government. The causes of the power crisis in New South Wales go well beyond the stereotyped offerings by the Government speakers. I think the consequences have been grossly overstated by Senator Reid who has attempted to develop this matter-because it affects the Australian Capital Territory-into a sort of quasi-national crisis.</PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the matter of public importance debate instigated by Senator Reid is really just another attempt-a rather pathetic attempt-on the part of the Government to indulge in some political grandstanding. The Federal Government seems to think that, by indulging in such grandstanding at the expense of the citizens of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory who are suffering under power shortages, it can somehow salvage the sinking fortunes of the Thompson Government in Victoria. This week the Federal Government has already used parliamentary debates on the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Amendment Bill to engage in a mud slinging exercise directed at the New South Wales Government in a last ditch attempt to damage by association the credibility of the Australian Labor Party in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is attempting to blow the New South Wales power issue out of all proportion. I ask honourable senators to look at the way the subject of this matter of public importance developed this morning. First of all it was to be a debate about the Australian Capital Territory; then it was changed to be a debate about the New South Wales situation and the Australian Capital Territory; and now it has been changed again to include the effects of the New South Wales power shortages on the whole of Australia. The proposition that power shortages in New South Wales will directly affect the Northern Territory, Tasmania or Western Australia or any other States and Territories apart from New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and to some extent Victoria, is a tenuous assertion. It is an overstatement that reflects the desire of Senator Reid and the Government to overdramatise the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the power situation in New South Wales-which I do not deny, and which none of my colleagues deny, is a very serious situation-we see that current shortages have come about because of a number of factors. This is not simply as a result of the factor of wage demands by unions but as a result of many factors which have formed a disastrous combination. There have been mechanical breakdowns, industrial disputes and a reduction in the amount of power available from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric scheme caused by a shortage of water. The problem of breakdown in the New South Wales power grid is one that the Wran Government faced from the time it took office. That is a point which may be unpalatable to the Federal Government. However, it is relevant that the run-down of New South Wales generating equipment began during the period of the Askin Liberal-Country Party Government in New South Wales and was continued during the succession of short-lived Liberal administrations which followed it. The Wran Government inherited a power supply which for some time had been inadequately maintained. Despite this, the Wran Government's record of maintaining power supplies to New South Wales consumers has been better than the records of either Victoria or Queensland in recent years. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume arrived in this chamber when the debate was at an advanced stage. Had he heard the contribution of my leader, Senator Button, he would have heard him give an account of the various power difficulties that various Liberal State Governments have faced over recent years and state that by comparison the Wran Government has not had a worse record. Despite the shocking legacy that the Wran Government inherited from a series of Liberal administrations its record of maintaining power supply to New South Wales consumers has been better, as I said, than that of either Victoria or Queensland in recent years. Prior to the planned restrictions that have taken effect this week, load shedding, under the Wran Government, amounted to one day last winter. By comparison Victoria lost about three days and Queensland has had numerous losses. Perhaps taking into account this week's losses in New South Wales, the problems in New South Wales may be almost equal to those in Victoria. Its record is certainly no worse. Anyone who read the article in the Australian Financial Review of 2 March entitled 'Why Victoria Faces Winter Power Failures' will realise that that State's power supplies are by no means assured during the coming winter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the Victorian situation since Senator Baume seems so determined to suggest that the Wran Government is somehow in a worse situation. In Victoria the situation is as precarious as it it was last winter when restrictions occurred on two occasions. There will be no new generating capacity in Victoria until the first set comes on stream at Loy Yang in May 1984. This means that the position in winter in 1983 will be extremely serious. There can be no relief of any kind until the Loy Yang unit comes on stream. The problem in Victoria is due to mismanagement by the Victorian Liberal Government and the tight borrowing policies of the Fraser Government. The State Electricity Commission has the authority to borrow only $305m for capital works this financial year yet its capital works program to 30 June is $820m, which leaves a shortfall of $515m. That shortfall will have to be found from the SEC's internal funds. Of course this will inevitably lead to higher electricity charges. </PARA>
<PARA> In August last year the SEC tariff increased by 19.7 per cent, including a service charge of $18 a quarter on each Victorian household. That followed a 14. 6 per cent increase in November 1980. If it were not for the State election in Victoria on 3 April another increase of 15 per cent to 20 per cent would have occurred by now. Lindsay Thompson has been deferring that increase to prevent the complete collapse of his Government's credibility before the election. On Monday Mr Ian Cochrane of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Melbourne University released a report that predicts widespread power shortages in Victoria by the mid-1980s. Mr Cochrane says that major problems in the mid-1980s will be even worse if plant breakdowns occur. Difficulties in the natural gas delivery system would force the SEC into burning huge quantities of expensive liquid fuels to make up the deficiency. This is the legacy which the Victorian Liberal Government is going to leave to the Cain Labor Government. Yet the Minister has the hide to suggest that all is well in States other than Labor States. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the prospects in New South Wales. The prospects for the future of power supplies in Victoria will appear brighter following a change of policy under the Cain Government. While Premier Wran has stated that power supply problems may continue in New South Wales this winter, interruptions in supply are not expected to continue past that time. New South Wales currently is in the process of a huge energy expansion program. I believe one new power station, Eraring, is coming on stream this week. After 1982 New South Wales will progressively move into a situation of excess power generation. I believe my colleague Senator McClelland will speak at some length about the future situation in New South Wales. Senator Reid chose to change the topic of this debate to the national situation and from a national perspective we should ask: What has the Federal Government's response been to all this? The only response of the Federal Government to the power crisis in New South Wales has been an attempt to make short term political capital out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the situation of my own constituents, the consumers of power in the Australian Capital Territory. Despite the melodramatic wording of Senator Reid's matter of public importance, after New South Wales the Australian Capital Territory is the only territory to be significantly affected by power shortages in New South Wales. The Australian Capital Territory gets 60 per cent of its electricity from New South Wales, the remaining 40 per cent comes from the Snowy Mountains scheme. Both sources currently have a reduced output and citizens in my electorate are suffering power rationing. The Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Amendment Bill 1982, which gave legislative effect to power rationing, passed through the Senate only last night. While it is regrettable that due to problems in New South Wales and the Snowy Mountains scheme Australian Capital Territory citizens are suffering power rationing, I think it must be pointed out that the response to this situation by the Federal Government, and in particular by the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, has been unimpressive to say the least. The response has involved just the sort of provocative non-co-operative attitude which should have been avoided . </PARA>
<PARA> A number of the comments that have been made in the course of this debate were to the effect that there ought to be a community concern, a national concern, on the question of power supplies. Yet the response of the Federal Government in the Australian Capital Territory has not been to work co-operatively with the New South Wales Government to achieve the best possible effects for Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales power consumers. Rather it has been one of political grandstanding. I think there has been a serious disregard of the citizens who are most directly affected and about whom I am most concerned, that is, people who live in Canberra. The extent of the Government's lack of concern about the Australian Capital Territory is demonstrated by its response to the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory on energy use, distribution and conservation in the Australian Capital Territory which was brought out in July 1981. That Committee, of which Senator Reid is chairperson, made several recommendations for power conservation in the Australian Capital Territory. It recommended:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . That the ACTEA conduct a survey of the generating equipment within the ACT with a view to establishing whether or not there are adequate emergency facilities within the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>What has been the response of the Federal Government to these recommendations? Absolutely nothing! Even without the current New South Wales power problems the power situation in the Australian Capital Territory needs to be examined and improved. Because the Australian Capital Territory entitlement from the Snowy Mountains scheme is a fixed 607 gigawatt hours and includes no growth factor it is inevitable that the Australian Capital Territory will have to look at increasing its acquisition of power from other sources. Accordingly, the Joint Committee recommended the examination of localised emergency generation or, as a desirable alternative, measures for energy conservation. These conservation measures included incentives for energy conscious design in private buildings, attention to energy conservation and efficiency in school design and in the design and running of all Government buildings. As Senator Chipp pointed out in the Senate last night, it is nothing short of a scandal that, at a time of severe power shortages, government buildings in the Australian Capital Territory are fully lit at night. The Government has ignored all the power conservation measures suggested by the parliamentary Committee and is flouting its disregard of the situation by continuing to be extremely wasteful in an area directly under its administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise to honourable senators that if the Federal Government wants to have anything to say about how power supplies ought to be administered, how conservation ought to be achieved and how problems for the consumer ought to be avoided, it should say those things in relation to what it does in the Australian Capital Territory. The Federal Government and no other body is directly responsible for the administration of power supplies in the Australian Capital Territory yet here we have a situation which is far from satisfactory. The truth is that the Federal Government has made no real effort at energy conservation in the Australian Capital Territory. It has not bothered to do anything about the Joint Committee's recommendations on emergency generating capacity within the Australian Capital Territory. The Federal Government, which likes to be so critical of the Wran Government in New South Wales, has done nothing in its own area of direct responsibility, the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> As the proportion of Australian Capital Territory power provided by the Snowy Mountains scheme dwindles the Federal Government is relying on the New South Wales Government to come good with the extra power that the Australian Capital Territory requires as its energy needs expand. Far from slinging insults at the New South Wales Government, the Minister for the Capital Territory, if he is really concerned with the best interests of Australian Capital Territory power consumers, should be approaching the New South Wales Government to seek the best deal for the Australian Capital Territory. It is Mr Hodgman's responsibility as Minister for the Capital Territory to do this. He has not done it yet. I do not know why he has not done it. I hope that Senator Reid, who represents the Government in the Australian Capital Territory, will attempt to persuade him to undertake some constructive negotiations with New South Wales so that the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory no longer have to tolerate this intolerable situation. </PARA>

What really surprises me is that the Australian Labor Party should set out in some way in this sort of discussion to defend a situation which, for very many reasons and for a number of causes, is practically indefensible. I thought Senator Button, as a Victorian, would have wanted to distance himself from such a mess by as great a margin as he possibly could. Instead, he really based his defence-if one could call it that-on a reference to power problems that have occurred in other States over other periods. Of course, none of them have been continuing problems. The New South Wales situation has been significantly bad for some 12 months or more. His reference to blackouts and power problems that had occurred in other Australian States seemed to be the measure of his defence. His logic is strange. I do not believe that he would argue that it does not really matter about Afghanistan because there are tremendous problems, great savagery and situations of considerable urgency in Vietnam, El Salvador, Poland, Angola and Uganda, Iran, Iraq and so on. Yet he said that the power situation in New South Wales is not all that serious because power problems have occurred in other places. I suppose an extension of that logic would suggest that the circumstances in Afghanistan are not terribly serious because there are circumstances just as bad in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted in a speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) some mention of the power position in New South Wales. He suggested-I believe quite rightly- that this was a major blow to the Australian nation. He followed that assertion by referring to a number of statistics which suggested that if half a million members of the New South Wales working community were out of work for a day it would mean a loss to each of them after tax of $44 a week. If the situation were to continue for three months it would mean a loss to them of something like $ 416m and a loss to revenue of some $239m over that period. That would reduce our hopes for lower taxation and so forth and put those measures a little further away. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, on statistical and economic grounds a great deal of damage has been done and is being done to the New South Wales economy in particular and to the far wider total Australian scene. I recall for the benefit of honourable senators the sorts of problems that concern the whole of Australia as a result of the disastrous power situation in New South Wales. Australia has been and I trust will always be a proud country. Australia has an enormous resource capacity to develop and to trade with many places around the world. Over the years, Australia has developed a pride which is relevant to the capacity of Australians to meet continuing and changing challenges. That sort of pride must surely be hurt and knocked around on the world scene when our country, with its massive resources for power generation, with its enormous resources in a whole range of other areas-it is probably the most productive agricultural country in the world on a per capita basis-and when so much capacity and potential is seen to be almost immobilised by, for example, union activity, more specifically actions by a small group of unionists, and by the failure perhaps of a government to take notice of reports and insistent warnings that the maintenance of its generating equipment was at such a desperately low level that the chances of maintaining a viable power system were being stretched beyond the limit. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that when it is all boiled down what we have seen in New South Wales stems from industrial unrest by, on the latest figures, some 87 unionists. That figure of 87 is a bad one in the history of Australian test cricket. Indeed, I hope that Australian trade unionists also will recognise that it is a bad figure . It is a great shame that a massive number of trade unionists throughout New South Wales and elsewhere should have their livelihoods in any way threatened by the persistent activities of a mere 87 people acting in spite of the dictates of their seniors in the union field, the New South Wales Labour Council and, ultimately, the Government in New South Wales. But this is the position. In the Australian scene their action is little more than a terrorist operation. </PARA>

We could solve these problems by an application of that law by those who are distinctly responsible both in the Government and in the union movement. To go beyond that is to go into a situation which, for want of a another word, I would say is at least un- Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall that as recently as March 1980 it was suggested, in a report called for by the Government and produced by a Mr Newton, that tariff restructuring was an essential part of the problem relating to power in New South Wales. That report, for I know not what reason, has not been acted on. It was a report which allegedly would save a very great amount of power in New South Wales and may well have contributed significantly to solving the problems with us today, yet there has been no attempt that I can find to act upon the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting in this debate that the crisis is about not only the circumstances surrounding those 87 people or the circumstances of the immediate past but also a continuing situation in which there has not been any real effort to maintain the generating equipment in that State. Clearly, maintenance has been neglected, and neglected savagely and completely irresponsibly. The New South Wales Government allowed its reserves to be run down dramatically. In 1976 -78 no less than $350m of its reserves disappeared, and in 1981 alone a further $340m disappeared. Indeed, of the first amount $100m was for the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, yet that significant amount of money was diverted to other fields. There are enormous repercussions from the power situation in New South Wales today. They are repercussions which are relevant to prices, inflation and employment and all the problems responsible government must grapple with constantly if we are again to achieve the sort of potential that indeed we have achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem in New South Wales has proved to be quite clearly poor maintenance over a significant number of years and, indeed, bad industrial relations. What a fascinating exercise it is to consider that in 1977 Mr Wran introduced the 37 1/ 2-hour week in the power industry on the grounds-indeed had they been proper grounds it would have been a reasonable and responsible move-of increased productivity. Two years later that was reduced to 35 hours a week. Since that time we have seen disaster fall around the power industry in New South Wales because of the 35-hour week and increased wages. Indeed, the wages in the power industry, as I recall, average in excess of $400 a week and range up to $42,000 a year. That level of wages is not insignificant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Reid, who led this debate on behalf of the Government-this is the third draft of a matter of public importance submitted by her on the subject today-said that the only conclusion one can come to is that funds have not been made available for the effective electricity generation or maintenance in New South Wales. I might have something to say on that aspect a little later. She then took on the unions and said that Australia is faced with a small group of workers who receive much more than the average wage and salary earner. I remind her that, probably, that remark in her speech was taken from a recent statement by the Premier of New South Wales. It is all right for Senator Reid and Senator Scott to castigate and criticise the trade union movement and the Government of New South Wales for the introduction of a 35-hour-week but it is not the blue collar workers who are causing industrial trouble on this occasion; it is a handful of foremen or supervisors. The blue collar workers cannot work on the maintenance of the boilers because they do so without adequate supervision. It is all huffle and puffle for Government senators to criticise industrial relations on the part of the New South Wales Government or the trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While Senator Reid has a side swipe at the trade union movement and at the work force generally I suggest to the honourable senator from the Australian Capital Territory that she go to Sydney, speak to the responsible trade union movement, speak to the organised and disciplined trade union movement in New South Wales, speak to the trade union leaders, whether they be left wing or right wing, using the political terms that the Government is so fond of using on so many occasions . The honourable senator should find out what they are doing. They are working day and night in order to get workers back into the industry and to get the power houses on line. If the honourable senator from Canberra made a trip to Sydney and did those things I am sure she would not make such irresponsible statements. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid then charged, tried and found the Premier of New South Wales guilty of attracting heavy industries such as the aluminium industry to New South Wales. I think she mentioned, during the course of her speech, the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. I remind Government senators that in 1979 their then Minister for National Development, Mr Newman, made a statement to Parliament on a national energy policy that had been considered and brought down by the Government. Mr Newman, on 5 April 1979, in the House of Representatives enunciated the Government's national energy policy. Among other things, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has abundant sources of solid fuels in the eastern States suitable for power generation. Soundly planned and timely installation of new power generating capacity is essential to facilitate the transfer of demand for energy from liquid fuels to electricity derived from solid fuels or hydro-electric resources. A ready availability of electricity generating capacity will also facilitate the establishment of new industrial development projects of a nature consistent with the Government's objectives towards mineral processing and industry policy generally. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Newman then went on, but time does not permit me to read what he said in detail except to mention how, as a result of the Governments policy, it wanted to encourage the development of the aluminium industry throughout Australia. Now , because the New South Wales Government has put into effect those policies enunciated by this Government as long ago as 1979, we hear Government senators now criticising the New South Wales Government. One of the great problems has been the failure of the Government not only to lay down a policy in regard to fuels, energy and wages but also to police its policies or come up with relevant funds to implement them. As I said, three draft matters of public importance on this subject have been submitted by the Government today. I noticed that, in typically confused fashion, Government senators confined, or attempted to confine, the discussion to cause, nature and consequences. Senator Chipp, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, was quite right when he said by way of interjection to Senator Scott 'what is the solution that you offer?' Not one of the Government statements or speeches that have been proffered today in this House has come up with a solution to the problem. The Australian Labor Party is quite happy to discuss all the matters enunciated in the terms of the matter of public importance. But I would have thought that the most important matter to consider and discuss would be the solution. Although the Government apparently does not want to broach the subject, I certainly intend doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, no one can deny-the labour movement does not intend to deny-that there have been and are grave problems in New South Wales with electricity development . By way of aside, I say that Government members cannot say that the New South Wales Premier has attempted in any manner, shape or form to pass the buck. The Electricity Commission of New South Wales is an independent statutory authority. Frankly, a certain amount of blame must attach to that authority. But in the last four or five years, as a result of the policies pursued by the Wran Labor Government in order to bring about reasonable employment in my State, which I have the honour to represent in this Parliament, there has been amazing industrial development. We have previously discussed matters of public importance in this chamber, for instance on the industrial development of the Hunter Valley and the effect of that development on the wine industry. I remember our erstwhile colleague the Liberal senator from New South Wales, Senator Puplick, debating the matter in this chamber just prior to his departure . There have been enormous industrial strides forward in New South Wales. One of the great problems that the Electricity Commission of New South Wales has had has been to keep pace with and ahead of those developments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Victorian Liberal Government is in power. In Queensland, which has a National Party Government, I think some agreement has been reached between the electricity workers and the Government that a 35-hour week will be phased in. Government speakers conveniently choose to ignore the industrial relations arrangements that have been brought into effect in Victoria and Queensland and they criticise New South Wales because it has led the way. Had New South Wales not acted in the way in which it did in 1977 and again in 1979, the crisis that is now being caused by a few foremen or supervisors would probably have been much worse. Government speakers should appreciate that the responsible and organised trade union movement is working closely with the New South Wales Government to overcome the problems that are being caused to the community at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst honourable senators opposite blame the State Government, the New South Wales Electricity Commission, the trade union movement, the purchase of poorly functioning generators-I understand their purchase was, in the first instance, approved by the Askin Liberal Government-the poor quality of coal that has been supplied for burning and the 35-hour week, they must also face up to their own responsibilities. I have a document headed 'Major Public and Private Infrastructure Projects'. It was published by the Commonwealth Department of Industry and Commerce in March 1981. It sets out the major infrastructure projects in New South Wales and it categorises those committed and those under investigation. It defines 'committed' as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Committed'-indicates that construction is proceeding or that Government/ Company Board has decided to proceed (either authorisation of expenditure or 'in principle') and construction is expected to commence shortly. A decision to proceed, however does not guarantee that the project will be constructed on the scale or in the time frame indicated. Substantial rescheduling of projects due to changing priorities and availability of funds may occur. </PARA>
<PARA>This document was put out in March 1981 by the Federal Department of Industry of Commerce. That document sets out the 'committed' power stations in New South Wales. I assume they were committed and approved by the Federal Government. They include the Bayswater power station, which is about 15 miles out of Singleton, Mount Piper, which is near Lithgow, Eraring which, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) who is at the table will know, is on Lake Macquarie, and Liddell at Singleton. So, according to the Federal Government's record, those power stations were in the course of coming on stream in March 1981. But what happened? About 18 months earlier, in November 1979, Mr Fraser wrote to all Premiers asking them to reassess their demands for electricity because of the oil crisis then occurring. He asked the Premiers to submit new proposals to the Federal Government for infrastructure funding. The letter that the Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers referred to the world energy situation and the opportunities for Australia, because of the rising overseas costs of oil-based power genertion as opposed to our coal-based alternative. He also, incidentally, wanted electrification of the Sydney- Melbourne rail link. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government got to work and drew up plans for the boosting of its electricity generation programs. I think from recollection an additional $2,000m in Loan Council funding was requested by New South Wales. It submitted proposals for infrastructure borrowings for three power stations: Eraring near Newcastle, which is named in the document to which I have referred; Bayswater stage and stage 2 which is named in the document; and Mount Piper near Lithgow which is also named. Eraring was approved at the end of 1978 with stage 1 of the Bayswater plant. But the 1980 Loan Council meeting deferred approval for the rest of the New South Wales program, involving stage 2 of Bayswater and Mount Piper. That was a win for the Federal Treasury, but meanwhile the New South Wales Premier had entered into power commitments for the rest of the decade. The 1980 election came. What did the Prime Minister of Australia say on the subject in the Liberal Party policy speech of October 1980? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me give you another measure of what is happening in Australia. The increase in electricity generation through the 1980's will be almost equal to that which occurred over the last thirty years. We are going to do in ten years what previous generation took thirty years to accomplish. </PARA>
<PARA>At the first Loan Council meeting that was held after the general election of 1980 the Federal Government refused to make the funds available to the New South Wales Government for additional electricity generation purposes. So today, as a result, the Electricity Commission of New South Wales is starved of adequate funds for the proper development of electricity generation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a matter of public importance, placed on the agenda by the Liberal Party in the person of Senator Margaret Reid, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effect on Australia of the crisis in the New South Wales electricity supply system; its causes, its nature and its consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>Sometimes I shudder at the fearful price that we pay for democracy and for free speech in this country. I think Senator Reid-I am not saying this purely for the purposes of gallantry-made a very good speech on the matter. I do not think anybody would deny that this matter is on the agenda not because there is a power shortage in New South Wales, not because of something the Wran Government has done or has not done, but simply because of an event that will occur in 10 days from now in Victoria, namely, the Victorian election. That is fair enough, I suppose. The master plan was to show that an Australian Labor Party Government in New South Wales had failed miserably in an essential exercise, that one of the erstwhile glamour boys of the Labor Party, Mr Neville Wran, its Federal President, had really fouled things up there so, therefore, people should not vote for John Cain in Victoria on Saturday week. One wonders as one sits on the sidelines as an Australian Democrat, not having any delusions that the Democrats will gain Government in Victoria on Saturday week, whether the debate this afternoon-fine though some of the speeches have been-has influenced one individual in Victoria to change his vote. I prefer-I intend this afternoon without in any way adopting a holier than thou attitude-to look at some of the real problems that can be discerned from this situation in New South Wales at the moment. This situation is not unique in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales is the most populous State in the Commonwealth. It contains nearly 40 per cent of all the country's manufacturing industry. It employs 430, 000 people and produces nearly $9,000m in revenue each year. The annual demand for electricity is greater than 8,000 megawatt hours. The State now faces a crisis, as we know, in its power generating capacity. This is just not a localised problem but one which will have massive repercussions for all Australia. We can stand up here today while the proceedings are being broadcast, and try to make political points off one another, but let us not forget the fearful lessons that are to be learned-not just because this happens to involve a State in which a Labor government is presently entrenched. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid made a fine speech in the sense that she showed up some weaknesses in the New South Wales system. Then, x equals 0, Senator Button followed up with an equally fine political speech to show that the shortage of electricity in New South Wales now is nothing new, that States such as Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia-all governed by non-Labor governments-had far worse electricity shortages and blackouts in the same sort of period. Where does that argument get us? I think it was shown by Senator Button that the facts of the matter are that Victoria and New South Wales both have shortages from time to time. By an excellent reciprocal sharing agreement, when New South Wales is in trouble Victoria has sold it some of the Victorian electricity and vice versa. This has worked both ways very satisfactorily. We happen to be at a point of time--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So it should, indeed. We happen to be at a point 10 days before a certain election with certain problems in a certain State. I do not want to go into the causes of the current crisis in New South Wales-to say that they are complex is oversimplifying them. There have been mechanical breakdowns and lapses in the maintenance procedures. Those have been exacerbated recently by the dismal state of industrial relations in New South Wales-a few bandid bandits , a few greedy, well paid unionists have held the State to ransom. Before we knock all trade unionists let us remember that in the mass meetings that have been held an overwhelming number of trade unionists in New South Wales have voted to return to work in a most responsible fashion. Whilst we might say that trade unionists have caused this trouble we should not say that every trade unionist is being irresponsible and therefore plunging the State into darkness. There are certain militants in the trade union movement. Senator Scott from the National Country Party also made a fine speech. He was gracious enough, when I interjected to ask what was his party's solution to industrial disputation, to admit that he had no solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not claiming that this is an easy problem easily fixed but at least we, the Democrats, have tried hard to put something forward. We say that every worker has an inalienable right to strike. We believe, though, that those workers in essential industries should have fewer opportunities to go into a capricious strike or to strike facetiously than people in non-essential industries. So the Democrats have put a point of view forward which we have canvassed with several trade unions. We have found them to be very receptive to the idea. Why not start with workers in the essential industries entering into a contract between the employer, whether it be private enterprise or a statutory corporation, and the employee, a contract enforceable at law? In that contract the employee in the essential industry-electricity provision is a classic case- would sign away his or her right to strike except under narrow, prescribed circumstances for a certain period; two years, three years or whatever. The State, the employer and the people could then say: 'At least in that industry the workers have signed away their right to strike. We have stability in that industry for two or three years'. One might well ask: 'Why would workers sign away their right to strike?' Because they would be offered a premium on top of their wages for so doing. That very system does work in the United States of America, in West Germany, in Switzerland and in many other countries. But here, because we have this constant confrontation between organised labour and organised management exacerbated by political intervention, we do not even get around the table to talk about it. </PARA>

Why can we not, by consultation with essential trade unions, extend this principle of agreement into the essential industries? To me that is the only way in which problems like this can be avoided. The New South Wales Government's response when it believed major blackouts were imminent was to launch into a million dollar advertising campaign to try to reduce domestic electricity consumption by 6 per cent. That was a marvellous thing to do. But the New South Wales Government did it at the wrong time for the wrong reasons. All governments ought to be spending money on conservation of energy, not just when a strike is imminent. One wonders too, as an Australian Democrat, why governments of all complexions can never find any money for any worthwhile purpose unless there is some threat to their own integrity. One wonders why this impoverished Federal Government can suddenly produce $300,000 to advertise the benefits of its new housing policy just 10 days before a Victorian election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One does not blame anybody for becoming cynical. Why do we have to wait until a crisis before we make any move to become active in conservation?

Energy conservation has the ability to be our single greatest resource of energy. We have a lot of work ahead before we can claim in Australia that we are wise and efficient users of energy. While most industrialised nations have reduced significantly the amount of energy consumed since the crisis in 1973 of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Australia has actually shown an increase. Let me be critical again of this government in New South Wales. I am not being party political. The same criticism can be levelled at every government in Australia. The chief economist of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, Mr John Brunner, says that there is one obvious reason why our energy consumption has risen. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We don't have a single-minded policy to reduce energy consumption. </PARA>
<PARA>He is right, we do not. This is because of the ridiculous and absurd proposition of precious State sovereign rights. For those who have been a Minister, or will be a Minister, one of the most pathetic and disgusting exhibitions one can experience is to chair as a Federal Minister a meeting of one's State counterparts. It is disgraceful to see the way in which these petty little people will hang on to their precious State rights at any cost, even though one may present an unanswerable case to them that in the national interest they should work as Australians, think as Australians and act as Australians. But no, we have six different energy policies, not only in relation to energy conservation but also energy itself. We have six different policies, plus one from the Federal Government, which means that Australia now is labouring under seven different energy and resource policies. The number would be eight if one wanted to add those impacted upon us by the multinationals. I would have thought that one of the things we desperately need in this country is a referendum in which the people can be asked to pass on those policies and responsibilities to a Federal government. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania, the State which consumes as much electricity per head as anywhere else in the world, has already embarked on a conservation program under Premier Holgate-I do not think he is one of the world's greatest conservationists-which he believes will be able to save 20 per cent of all domestic consumption in Tasmania. The Department of National Development and Energy, in its submission to the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania, pointed to a massive problem in relation to electricity commissions and energy conservation. Let us face it; the job of electricity commissions is to increase the quantity of electricity produced and sold and to decrease the amount that people have to pay for it. This is going in exactly the wrong direction in an energy hungry world in which these precious resources are being allowed to run out. Why do we not have politicians, who do become Ministers, who are able to control their departments instead of their departments or statutory corporations controlling them?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the Senate an example. The situation is no different in New South Wales. In March 1980 a radical conservation plan was prepared by Mr J. S. Newton which recommended that conservation could save 2,500 megawatts of electricity. That is the equivalent of 42 per cent of the generating capacity of New South Wales in 1979. That report has been shelved, cleverly by the bureaucracy, because Ministers, politicians and parliaments are either too ignorant or too gutless to buck the bureaucracy concerned. The Australian Democrats believe there is a serious problem. It has nothing to do with the present crisis but all to do with the Victorian State election. </PARA>

<PARA>OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979 to introduce charges for overseas students who will attend accredited advanced education level courses which are funded by the Commonwealth and offered at educational institutions other than universities and colleges of advanced education, for example, at colleges of technical and further education. At present, charges are imposed only on overseas students attending prescribed courses at universities and colleges of advanced education in Australia. It is intended that the extension of the charges will be applicable at the beginning of 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> The basis for the imposition of charges on overseas students is to recover part of the costs involved in their education in this country. These costs are being met by the Australian taxpayers. Honourable senators will recall that when the Government first introduced overseas student charges in 1979, it was emphasised that the effect of the policy would be closely monitored and reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> Following a review of the overseas students policy by an inter-departmental committee last year, the Government decided to extend the overseas students charges. At the same time, the Government also decided, as part of Australia's special assistance, to meet the costs of overseas students charges from 1982 for nationals of Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific countries from its aid program for the region. The aim is to encourage more students from the area to come and study in Australia. The extension of this special aid program is consistent with our special relationship with and obligations towards Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific island countries by virtue of Australia's geographic location, historic ties and relative economic strength in the region.</PARA>
<PARA> The special assistance in favour of nationals of the South Pacific countries will also cover the new charges when they come into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The main clauses of the Bill are: Clause 2 inserts the definition of 'declared course' into sub-section 4 (1) of the Principal Act and amends the definition of 'prescribed course' for the purposes of the Act. Its effect is that an enrolment in a 'declared course' will be subject to a charge under section 5 of the Act. Clause 3 enables regulations to be made to declare for the purposes of imposing charges, courses offered by special educational institutions other than universities and colleges of advanced education. Clause 4 inserts a new section into the Act to provide for charges to be imposed in relation to 'declared courses' in the year that follows the year during which the declaration with respect to these courses was made. It also contains transitional provisions to exempt continuing overseas students from the new charges. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Overseas Students Charge Collection Act 1979 to provide that, where the responsibility for the payment of a charge has been accepted by the Commonwealth in favour of an overseas student, the specified time limits for the payment of that charge would not apply, and a visa and temporary entry permit may be granted to that student. These two minor technical amendments to the Principal Act are designed to allow more flexibility for a Commonwealth authority to pay charges on behalf of overseas students from the South Pacific region under Australia's aid programs for this region. The Bill does not affect existing provisions in the Act with respect to special arrangements with a government of an overseas country for the discharge of liability for overseas students charges. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Senate is debating an amendment proposed by the Government to the Social Services Act. The amendment seeks to deny the single rate unemployment benefit to spouses of trade unionists involved in strike action, to spouses of unemployed persons denied benefits because of the work test, and to spouses of those allegedly voluntarily unemployed or dismissed for alleged misconduct. In addition, this denial is extended to the special benefit provisions of the Act so that spouses of those who would have received special benefit, had they failed any of these conditions, also would not get it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, in support of its proposition, suggests that the taxpayers of Australia should not be responsible for the funding of strikes. In that I totally concur. I do not think anyone in this chamber or any member of the Australian public would object to that proposition. But that is not what the amendment is all about. The amendment, as I will point out shortly, is discriminatory in its application and is inconsistent with just and equitable principles of industrial relations. It will not have the desired effect but will , in fact, impose heavy burdens on the already stretched resources of voluntary agencies working in the social welfare arena. </PARA>
<PARA> If we analyse precisely the effect of the Government's proposed amendment to the Social Services Act we will see that the word 'involved' is a key word in any consideration of these proposals. As I mentioned at the outset, the objective of the Bill is to deny the single rate unemployment benefit to spouses of trade unionists involved in strike action. First of all, it is not the spouses who are involved and it is not necessarily their husbands or wives who are involved in the strike action. Members of a union could be involved in a dispute many miles away from the factory in which other members of the same union are working and those other members could be drastically affected. </PARA>
<PARA> When last I addressed myself to this particular proposal I gave the illustration-it is a practical illustration-of Geelong and Broadmeadows in Victoria. As honourable senators will no doubt be aware, large vehicle component parts and manufacturing complexes are located in those areas. I invite honourable senators to recollect that some years ago considerable hardship was experienced in the city of Geelong as a result of strike action taken in Broadmeadows by a group of trade unionists at that site. On that occasion, once the strike had occurred in Broadmeadows it created a bottleneck which enabled the company at Geelong to stand down its workers. Those workers were not involved in that strike action. They had no real say over whether the strike took place in Broadmeadows. Indeed, they attempted to have a say about that particular issue but their views were completely ignored. With this legislation the Government proposes to deny sustenance to the spouses and children of those workers who would have been stood down by the employer in Geelong, through no fault of their own. That is an extraordinary situation for the Government, which says that it is interested in the one-income family to maintain. I believe that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), who is at the table, could not maintain that as a just and equitable proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the current power dispute in New South Wales. If, of course, the stand-downs or strikes continued for a considerable period-in excess of a week because of the unemployment benefit requirements-this measure would deny benefits under the Social Services Act to spouses of members of a number of unions, when in fact their unions had directed them to go back to work and to do the maintenance. Their own unions have done that; a unanimous decision of the Labour Council of New South Wales was to that effect. Yet the application of this legislation would mean that the wives and children of members of the union which was directing the people back to work would be penalised. What an extraordinarily unjust situation! To my mind it shows a complete lack of understanding by the Government as to what industrial relations are all about.</PARA>
<PARA> On the last occasion I addressed the Senate on this particular matter I also mentioned that one could have a situation where a job was totally unsafe and the workers directly involved went out on strike and refused to go back to work until the unsafe practice or the unsafe conditions were rectified. Let us not forget that 19.2 per cent of all disputes last year were caused by what the Australian Bureau of Statistics stated were working conditions and that a large proportion of those disputes were over safety conditions. In that circumstance, where the employees had taken action to preserve life and limb, the Government would deny sustenance to their spouses and to their children because those workers had chosen to protect life and limb rather than to work in unsafe conditions. I put it to the Government that it does not understand at all the workings of the trade union movement or indeed the working conditions of employers in this area. Let the Government give to the Senate an indication of any employer or any trade union who supports this measure. I invite the Minister for Social Security to name any employer or any trade union--</PARA>

I am quite convinced that the taxpayers of Australia, once the Government is exposed on this measure, for its failure to understand the equity, will, of course, reject the Government's proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have mentioned the New South Wales electricity dispute. That dispute was, of course, generated by what could be roughly called a shop committee, a combined salaried officers' committee. That committee, of course, did not have a direct link with the unions directly involved. Of course, the dispute was made up of unionists from a number of unions. Those unionists-about 57 or 60 of them-took the action. It could have had the effect that I have described. If this Bill were passed it would have the effect, if the strike went on long enough, of wives and children being denied sustenance. It escapes me completely as to how that is reasonable and equitable. As I mentioned, it shows also that the Government does not understand that orderly industrial relations depend on representative trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last year the Government amended the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and took away from an individual union its right to enforce decisions concerning industrial disputes made by the properly elected bodies of those trade unions. I believe that that fosters the type of anarchy that exists in some unions throughout Australia. Rather than attempting to govern industrial relations by attacking the spouses and children of trade unionists, the Government should create an atmosphere in which the conduct and control procedures for the settlement of industrial disputes are observed. This measure flies in the face of that desirable objective. It undercuts that desirable objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the Government will consider exempting a number of disputes in which workers become involved. If the Government were genuine about industrial relations, why would it not propose an inquiry into the types of disputes which would come within the ambit of the Bill which is now under consideration? For example, if the Government desires to see orderly industrial progress, why does it not exempt the disputes which are conducted in accordance with the procedures for the conduct and control of industrial disputes? I hope that the Minister will address himself to that question when he replies. Why are those particular disputes not exempted? Why are disputes about working conditions and safety conditions not exempted? According to the ABS 19.2 per cent of all disputes are caused by managerial problems. Why are those disputes not exempted from the provisions of this legislation? I feel that the only reason that the Government has introduced this legislation is to provide it with a further trigger for a double dissolution. It is the only reason that I can see behind this legislation . I cannot see any other rhyme nor reason for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981 [No. 2] (1982). The objectives of the Bill are primarily to deny the single rate of unemployment benefit to spouses of trade unionists involved in strike action, to spouses of unemployed persons denied benefit under the work test and to spouses of those allegedly voluntarily unemployed or dismissed for alleged misconduct. This Bill is significant in that a social welfare Bill is being used to reduce the power of striking workers and to increase the power of employers. The Bill concentrates on the rank and file trade unionists, their spouses and their children. It concentrates on people who are already poorly off, on people who are living in isolated areas, in mining and company towns and on people with no alternative employment, particularly the wives of trade unionists. Senator Chaney, during Senator Harradine's speech, interjected and referred to the taxpayers. Are strikers not taxpayers? The way Senator Chaney interjected and the way that Senator Walters has carried on, one would think that as soon as a person is involved in an industrial dispute he or she ceases to have the rights of a taxpayer. This Government is seeking to take away the rights of people who have paid taxes all their lives and who expect to be protected and expect their wives and children to have protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nobody on the Government side of this chamber has contested Senator Grimes's figure that the total amount of money involved in this legislation is $5m. I want to talk about the taxpayers of this country. I refer the Government to some of the people whom it does not like to talk about, the tax avoiders. The tax avoidance industry is responsible for $7,000m. That is not my figure. That is a figure mentioned by the secretary of the Australian Taxpayers Association, Mr Risstrom. He said that the taxes uncollected by this Government amount to $7, 000m. That is a large amount when compared with the $5m involved in this Bill. That $7 billion represents $30 a week to each household. That is the amount that this Government forgoes at present. Tax avoidance in the last financial year was up by 30 per cent. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) knows that that is the one growth industry under this Government. Since 1975 tax avoidance has increased 26 fold. It is rivalled only by the increases in inflation and unemployment that are characteristics of this Government. The report of the Commissioner of Taxation shows that the official figure for uncollected taxes amounts to $973m. That is only the tip of the iceberg. Yet the Government has not challenged Senator Grimes's total figure of 20,000 spouses out of work in a work force of 6.6 million people. These people represent 0.3 per cent of the work force. The Government is setting out to attack this minuscule number of people by means of this proposal. The figure of $993 million is acknowledged by the Commissioner of Taxation to be the official figure. On average this works out to be $43,500 for each tax bludger. These are the people the Government cannot do anything about. If one contrasts the 22,366 people who are officially in that category with the 20,000 spouses, one can see that for each tax avoider 740 wives or children could be given sustenance, as Senator Harradine has suggested, so that they would not be impoverished as a result of an industrial dispute. The figure is very small. Senator Chaney gave this away himself. In answer to a question from you, Mr Acting Deputy President, in which you were drawing attention to the small number of people involved, Senator Chaney said: ' What is all the fuss about?' Of course, we want to know what all the fuss is about. It could well be that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is about polarising Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been talk about triggering a double dissolution. I suggest that the Fraser Government is making a double-barrelled attack on wage and salary earners . The first barrel, which perhaps has been loaded by the Prime Minister, is the Viner company unions proposals to extend stand-downs and, by legislation, to attempt to eliminate preference to unionists. This is one barrel of the shotgun. Another example could be that the Prime Minister, from his bunker, has made Mr Viner his kamikaze Minister. He is trying to get a target. If he collapses, that is the problem in being a kamikaze or a volunteer of that type. We must look at both of these proposals at the same time because they are related. What we have before us is industrial legislation under the guise of social welfare. The Viner proposals have been rejected by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Why has an employer counsel such as George Polites said that the employers could be worse off under this legislation than when they started? Every other employers organisation knows that the Viner proposals have the stamp of fanaticism and extremism about them. Of course, the proposals themselves will change daily. With a little luck there will be enough common sense people in the employers organisation to make sure that finally they do not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a second barrel. I am afraid that Senator Chaney has his finger on the trigger of the second barrel which is pointing at the spouses of trade unionists . This social welfare legislation will advantage the largest and most prosperous companies in Australia and perhaps in the world-companies whose attitudes to tax avoidance do not bear examination. I certainly will be looking at the position of some of these companies and drawing the attention of honourable senators to the fact that the Government is protecting some of the worst companies and attacking some of the poorest people or the people who are making this country great. The people in these isolated mining areas have, through their sweat, created the wealth that this country is so proud of. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative view is that the Government is desperately trying to protect the mortally wounded Thompson Government in Victoria. This legislation is part of the subterfuge and part of the attempt to cover up the fact that that Government is haemorrhaging and will be defeated at the forthcoming election. It might be an attempt by this Government to direct attention away from the fact that the Victorian Government has failed in its pledge to the people and will soon be replaced by the Cain Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was critical of Industrial Relations Minister Viner for proposing a Bill to introduce company unions and to allow for automatic stand-downs in industrial disputes. I linked that with the Bill before us tonight in which it is proposed that wives of unionists will be denied welfare payments and denied sustenance for themselves and their children. I described Minister Viner as conducting industrial relations as though firing a shotgun from the hip.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security must also accept that description. On 25 November he mentioned six industrial disputes. Those six disputes and the details of wives and children being given sustenance have been used by Senator Chaney and parroted by other members of the Government, particularly Senator Walters, in their criticism of spouses receiving social welfare payments. Senator Chaney mentioned the giant Utah company. Of course, that company is a subsidiary of the General Electric company. Senator Chaney referred to the 600 people involved in an industrial dispute with Utah. Of course, the provocative matter in that industrial dispute was the use of apprentices. As anybody with any industrial understanding would know, that was a provocation that obviously extended the dispute. Senator Chaney referred to the 471 wives and their children who received $445,000 in sustenance. The use by large companies such as Utah of apprentices as a reserve of strike breakers to sour industrial relations and of course to extend industrial disputes is a cynical use of the gigantic power companies such as that have in isolated areas in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> It is very significant that most of the examples used by Senator Chaney involve giant companies with tremendous economic power. That is what we are talking about. Unfortunately, Senator Martin could not understand Labor senators drawing attention to the fact that in the very year this dispute took place the Utah company made a profit of $160m. We must contrast the $445,000 paid to the spouses of the strikers involved with that profit of $160m. Of course, in previous years Utah has shipped hundreds of millions of dollars out of this country. I suggest that that profit is a result of the sweat of Australian miners. I have already said that Senator Chaney made a very significant interjection during the speech of my colleague, Senator Colston, when he asked: 'What is all the fuss about?' That was when Senator Colston was referring to the smallness of the amount of money that was involved-$5m. The $5m represents 0.5 per cent of total welfare and social security outlays of this Government. That is the size of the issue we are involved in. But it means a great deal for the women and children who in every case are battling against a giant company.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to that matter because we are talking in reference to this legislation only about the longest and most bitter industrial disputes, disputes that have continued for more than seven days. The Government is proposing to take the work test entitlement away from women, which at the moment they are entitled to. The Government wants to deny women the dignity of being entitled to their own social welfare payments. Indeed, the Government is treating them as chattels of their husbands. That is something that Australian women in this day and age will not tolerate.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney named only one company in his speech of 25 November. That is significant because I think Senator Chaney was a bit ashamed to see the list of companies and some of the industrial relations records of the six companies involved. The Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd was involved. Senator Chaney certainly mentioned the number of wives concerned who received assistance but he did not mention the industrial record of BHP. It is well known that BHP often engineered disputes at its Whyalla shipyard if it looked like being late with the delivery of a ship. The company then blamed the unions for the delay, thus avoiding late delivery costs that would otherwise have run into hundreds of thousands of dollars. BHP has been provocative and reactionary as an employer; after 10 years of resistance it finally conceded that its workers were entitled to a tea break provided they did not sit down or talk to each other during the break. This is the company that only last week talked about closing down plant and putting off at least 3,000 Australian workers in the steel industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Another company was involved the name of which I do not think Senator Chaney was game to mention. He referred to wives receiving sustenance from social security payments but he did not mention the dispute or the name of the Gove alumina company. Although 550 employees were on strike, only six wives were being paid unemployment benefit. Of course, Gove alumina is the company that is suspected by the Icelandic Government of transfer pricing its products to avoid tax. The Icelandic Government is looking at the inflated price it is paying for materials produced in Australia. That is not surprising when it is recalled that one of the companies involved in that operation is Alcoa of Australia Ltd. which , of course, is before the High Court on a similiar matter. This attitude is typical of Senator Chaney and Government members. It entails mindless opposition to the trade union movement and the complete support of big business.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the 10-week Blackwater dispute over a housing subsidy to miners. Senator Chaney was very upset because 4,500 people were on strike and 411 wives were granted unemployment relief. It is well to remember the statistic that in the year 1980, 39.7 per cent of disputes were caused by management. Senator Harradine used another figure of 21 per cent relating to disputes over issues of safety and working conditions. Thus we can see who causes the vast majority of disputes in this country. The dispute at Blackwater was a particular type of dispute because it was caused, sustained and nutured by, in this case, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Howard). I remind Senator Chaney of the inglorious end to that dispute. Senator Martin, one of the other speakers on the Government side in this debate, berated the people involved in this dispute. She said that an almost carnival atmosphere surrounding women registering for unemployment was portrayed through the media. I will refer to some of the Press clippings of that time in Queensland. There is no better source than the Courier -Mail, which on 3 September 1980 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The key to the possible resolution of the central Queensland miners' strike is a 1973 letter which the State Treasurer, Dr Edwards, admitted he came across ' through luck.'</PARA>
<PARA> He was told about it during a visit to Blackwater, but exhaustive inquires revealed nothing until last week.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter was written in 1973 by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Hogan. I think a significant paragraph in this article tells us exactly who causes industrial disputes. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, was involved and had a heated telephone discussion with Dr Edwards, but he eventually accepted the letter.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another example of how this Government even outdoes the efforts of the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) regarding Telecom Australia in provoking industrial disputes. If this Bill is carried women and children are going to suffer because of the incompetence of these people. Senator Martin not only abused, in words that I have described, the wives of strikers but also she said that the public saw and understood what the issues were. I again remind the Senate and Senator Martin of what the Bulletin said on 9 September. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Striking Queensland miners are far ahead of the Federal Government in terms of public support, according to the Morgan Gallup Poll. And support for the strikers is at its strongest in their home State.</PARA>
<PARA>. . .</PARA>
<PARA> Eighty per cent of people had heard of it, and of this figure 38 per cent thought the miners were right, compared with 22 per cent for the government . . .</PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland,-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Martin's State-</PARA>
<PARA>56 percent thought the miners were right, compared with 17 percent for the government.</PARA>
<PARA>To show a cross-sectional view of the polls recorded at the time I quote from the Australian of 5 September under the heading 'Coal strikers find they have lots of friends'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Almost 60 per cent of Australians support the striking central Queensland coal miners, while a quarter believe trade unions are uncontrollable, according to surveys commissioned by the Australian.</PARA>
<PARA> The miners' dispute survey shows that almost half-46.4 per cent-of those disagreeing with the Government's intentions to make the miners pay tax on subsidised housing are otherwise Liberal-NCP supporters.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the answer to Senator Martin and that is the answer to the situation that will exist if this Government has the temerity to go to the people of Australia. The Australian people will reject it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh reminds me that Premier Bjelke-Petersen supported that strike. I wonder whether the problems of Queensland's Liberal Party exist because people such as Senator Martin are so out of touch with people in the provincial and outback areas of this country. For a moment I will look at the broad perspective of the cost to the community of strikes and other significant areas of cost. The cost of strikes is relatively insignificant when compared with lost production due to absenteeism, industrial accidents, injuries and unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently the Government estimated that each year there were at least 300 fatalities and 300,000 disabling injuries. These resulted in the loss of one million working weeks. If one million working weeks were lost in 1980-the year that I am using-as a result of fatalities and injuries the value of production lost amounted to $448m. In 1980 the number of officially unemployed people averaged at 401,850. If all these people had been employed the gross domestic product would have increased by $7,912m. Absenteeism is more difficult to estimate accurately but one estimate is that on any one day about 4 per cent of the work-force is taking sickies. If this figure were applied to 1980 the direct cost to the economy of absenteeism would have been $4,917m. I mention figures relating to strikes, unemployment, absenteeism, injuries and fatalities in 1980 because if we look at them and work out the percentages we find that industrial disputes represent only 2.1 per cent of the estimated value of loss of production; injuries and fatalities represent 3.3 per cent, unemployment 58.2 per cent and absenteeism 36.2 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Messner interjected 'would you prescribe something?' The Labor Party would do something to alleviate these problems. We would encourage safety. We would prevent health hazards and we would do something about unemployment-something that this Government has not been able to do. We would certainly make sure that the $13.5 billion lost in the four categories that I have mentioned was arrested. We would not seek to knock over $5m which is all this Bill could reasonably be thought to save Government coffers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we break down the figures relating to industrial disputes we find that 65 per cent of all industrial disputes lasted two days or less. Only 21 per cent of workers were involved in disputes which lasted longer than two days and only 8.9 per cent of all strikers were involved in strikes of 10 days or more. In this context I do not support the Australian Democrats' amendment because I estimate that it probably applies to only 5 per cent of the industrial disputes that occur. Senator Chaney said that the Bill is not an anti-strike Bill but one aimed at restricting the community's subsidisation of strikes. If honourable senators look at the figures they can see that the amount of money involved is pitiful. The Government has done nothing to tackle big areas of cost to the community. It has an abysmal record in solving major problems where people are being wasted, particularly the major area-unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> Although this legislation applies to both sexes it is an insult to Australian women that they are not entitled to the welfare benefit. It would be absolutely insulting to offer them the special benefit that the Government is offering them . The six examples of disputes that were mentioned by Senator Chaney show the Government's fetish for big business and its blind acceptance of whatever big business does. So far as the Government is concerned it does not matter who causes industrial disputes. No matter how much a dispute may have been provoked the Government will back any employer, under any circumstance. Conversely every trade unionist is wrong and every spouse is to be victimised.</PARA>
<PARA> I did mention the other possibility of why we have this legislation before us. If the two pieces of legislation are taken together, as I said earlier, some people will say that it is a mad attempt to save the Victorian Government. It may be an attempt to prevent the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) from making his expected bid for leadership. I do not know what the Prime Minister has in his mind. Of course, one could not really anticipate what he would ever have in his mind. I want to be evenhanded in my criticism but he has certainly said that the Victorian Premier stands on his own. The Prime Minister has prepared the way for dumping Mr Thompson. Like a snake shedding his skin, he has covered his tracks on that matter. If the Government wishes to fight this issue and have a double dissolution on it we will be very happy to take it through the length and breadth of this country. We have people all over Australia who-as the polls that were taken during that Queensland dispute indicate-are not as foolish as this Government thinks they are. They are intelligent and capable of working out who are the people ripping off the country or who are the people causing the problems that this community faces. We will be very happy to fight that issue. We would like that to be a trigger mechanism and we would like the election that would flow from it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3 ) 1981 [No. 2] (1982) which we are debating in the guise of a Social Services Bill really amounts to what we might call a lack of industrial relations Bill. The purpose of the legislation brought forward by the Government is, in the minds of the Australian Democrats, to use the social services legislation to create mischief, dispute and dissention within the community to no good end. At this stage I have pleasure in seconding the amendment moved last week by my colleague Senator Janine Haines to the motion for the second reading of the Bill . The purpose of the amendment is to create a situation which the Australian Democrats believe is a reasonable compromise in this matter which repeatedly has been brought before the Senate. As things stand in the legislation at present the wives of strikers are able to get dole payments after one week. Our amendment would make that period two weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted that in the figures quoted by Senator Childs, only 8.9 per cent of strikes extend beyond 10 days. Senator Childs said that he doubted whether 5 per cent of people would be eligible for this payment if the two-week period were to lapse. That is more or less what the Australian Democrats have in mind. If we had a situation such as this there would be a number of effects. It would mean a considerable reduction in the cost to the taxpayer of providing this benefit. In these days, when admittedly this sum of money is not great and everything which is in millions of dollars is of importance, I think it will continue to be increasingly difficult for the Government to get revenue. Revenue can be derived only from taxation and has to be spread over a variety of requirements which have priorities. I think there are some things which should have priority over whether or not the wife of a striker should have this money after one week or two weeks. That is not to say-as Senator Haines has said before on behalf of the Democrats and as I will say again-that we believe that this benefit should be withdrawn completely. We are opposed to that for reasons which I will come to shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> If this amendment were carried it would mean a considerable reduction in the cost to the taxpayer providing this benefit when the average duration of strikes is taken into account. It would also meet the objections which I and other Democrat senators have heard from many members of the community. If the benefit is given after only one week it might encourage strikes which might not otherwise have happened-frivolous strikes. That may or may not be the case. I will not debate that here. But it is certainly true that many members of the community think that that is the case. It is important that they understand or think they understand that their tax money is being spent in a way reasonable to themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the amendment would still meet the human rights and purely humane requirements, which we think are so essential, that financial assistance should be available to the wives and families of strikers after not too long a period. In other words, although I am aware-the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), I think, has made this clear and perhaps will do so again-that there are failsafe measures whereby people who are virtually destitute or are close to being destitute can apply for a special benefit. We do not believe that that is adequate, we do not believe that people who may not wish to contribute to the strike or who may not approve of it at all should be forced into that kind of situation. We believe it is reasonable that the community should protect these people who, after all, are not strikers and are not involved in industrial situations, but are merely married to a striker and, in many cases, have children who are dependent on some form of income. We think it is inhuman and inhumane that it should be suggested that this be removed from them. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised the idea of this amendment in November when this legislation was previously before us. It was my fault then that I did not raise it sufficiently early for its merits as a compromise to become obvious before the vote on the second reading stages was taken. That is not the case now. The Australian Democrats formally moved the amendment last week. Debate on the Bill was then adjourned. I think there has been time for what the Australian Democrats believe to be a reasonable and sane compromise in this matter to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> Unhappily, we are in an unfortunate phase for any kind of middle ground to be considered. I know that the Senate, the other place and the public generally have been regaled with a non-stop campaign of politicking that might well lead us to believe that there will be a State election in Victoria next week. Almost everything that has been said here has been coloured by that, as always happens when there is an election. But if honourable senators can divert their attention from that immediate vote-catching objective for a little while, I ask for some serious and thoughtful consideration of the Australian Democrats amendment-the Haines amendment. My words are addressed in particular to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government-I stress this-has only two clear alternatives. Its first alternative is to accept the fact that its Bill will fail and that the benefit will go on being paid to strikers' wives, as at present, after one week. Its second alternative is to accept the Australian Democrats amendment, which would allow the payment to be made after two weeks. The Government should have been trying to work its way towards achieving the best possible position that it can achieve. I reiterate that the only way in which this can be achieved is by voting for our amendment, which is a perfectly respectable proposition which I think anybody in this chamber would concede is a compromise. I might add that-I will deal with this matter later-it is not a compromise that came off the top of my head but one that has come to me from a wide cross-section of the public whom we have consulted. That point was raised more often by the people whom we consulted than anything else that I can consider in the light of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Government has a responsibility to work towards the best possible position it can achieve. It will be a matter of great interest to the public to see what happens-whether the Government accepts what we see and it must see as the better situation, or whether it will throw this away wilfully, by voting against our proposal. If it chooses to vote against our proposal I would regard that as a most serious matter. In the minds of all Australian Democrats and, I think, in the minds of the public it would reiterate that none of the lessons of the last few years have been learnt; that the method being used here is confrontation politics at all costs; and that there is no wish or will or effort by the Government to use this place and its debating processes in any way to try to arrive at a compromise situation which might be a better one for the public and for the community. No; that is not to happen. Both sides-the Australian Labor Party and the Government-have told us that they are not willing to accept our amendment. This is being done, of course, for precisely opposite reasons. Where is the rationality? Where is the sense in that? Is it not possible, as the years pass in this place, for there to be, at least in a matter like this, a reasonable attempt to get some sort of compromise that would allow this business to go ahead without it becoming the chronically divisive issue-the gage thrown down-that it has become?</PARA>
<PARA> I am sick and tired of industrial issues being turned into political matters by both sides. People have suffered in this country again and again because every strike and every piece of industrial legislation becomes a political matter. More intelligent and sane societies do not do that any more. They do not put their people to the cost of that sort of political point scoring on either or both sides. I wish that that would happen here. I see this matter of the fate of our amendment, not just because it is our amendment but because of its nature, as a useful test of good intentions and as an indication of whether the Government and indeed the Opposition-the Labor Party-really have the interest of the community at heart or whether the Government has simply raised this matter through a spirit of mischief in order to provide itself with what its own members have been calling for some time a trigger for a double dissolution. Again we have the political motivation. There was no attempt to see this issue in human terms. There was no attempt to see this issue in terms of the benefit to the people of Australia. It was seen in terms of a political issue and, in this case, a double dissolution issue. On that point what I have to say is highly relevant to this debate because the Government has indeed made it quite plain that this Bill is back before us again because it wants the trigger for a possible double dissolution. (Quorum formed). Before that quorum was formed I was making the point that I see this matter as a test of good intentions and an indication of whether the Government and the Opposition-the Labor Party-really have the interests of the community at heart or whether indeed this has been raised purely through a spirit of mischief. If indeed the Government accepts our amendment I will happily eat my words; I will be delighted to find that a spirit of compromise is abroad in this place. I look forward to the Minister's statements on that matter a little later in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the double dissolution, as I was saying, is highly relevant to this debate because the Government has brought forward this Bill repeatedly saying that that is its real intention and that if we do not pass it this will be the trigger for a double dissolution. Let me make the Australian Democrat's position abundantly clear. We would like to see the Government run its full term . We have no wish to see a general election this year or at any time before the end of next year when one is properly due. If there is a double dissolution election this year it will not be because the Australian Democrats want it but because the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wants it. Why would he want it? A number of reasons have been advanced. One is that he feels he might do better electorally with an election this year than next year or that he might do better with a double dissolution election than a half senate election. I should have thought that an examination of the latest gallup poll figures issued today would give the Government serious cause for concern in that regard. Another reason might be the Prime Minister's feeling that the economy will be worse next year than this year and that it will be a good idea to have an election this year. All these theories have been canvassed, and all these statements are repeatedly made in the Press and other media. They are relevant to the discussion of this Bill and the way in which it has been so widely touted by the Government as a double dissolution trigger. </PARA>
<PARA> My point is that we, the Australian Democrats, criticise the Government and indeed the Labor Party for loose political talk of an election this year which, frankly, is something the Australian people want and need about as much as they want and need a hole in the head. What we need now is stability in government, and the Government getting on with the job sensibly in a style that will allow the maintenance of community and business confidence, not the destruction of that confidence so that people never know whether an election will be held this year, next year or at any time. That is certainly what we intend to try to maintain in the society in every way that is humanely possible. Senator Haines made the point last week that if the Government will not accept our amendment we will vote against the Government amendment Bill which is designed to abolish this benefit completely. We dislike having to contribute towards one or other of the extremes represented here by the Government and the Labor Party, but unfortunately that is something we have to live with. In the not too distant future when there is an Australian Democrat Government in this country, that will no longer be the case. I look forward with my colleagues to that time. </PARA>
<PARA> We will vote against the Bill first because we believe it is wrong, and that this is basically a matter of human rights, and especially women's rights. A married woman's right not to be penalised explicity for what her husband does seems to me to be a right which is or should be beyond doubt. </PARA>

We have a strike and we have to fight for our rights. I do not want to go to school, have shoes or anything like that. We really have to push this'. That is rubbish. There is no reason whatsoever to suppose that any type of thing like that is happening in Australia. That is our first consideration, and we are all agreed on it. What the Government is proposing to do is wrong; it is discriminatory, unfair and it is againt human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our next reason is that considerable research in the community on the part of the Australian Democrats has lead us to believe that the bulk of the community would find the withdrawal of this benefit repugnant because it would be seen as an unfair strike-breaking weapon. I should think, for very much the same reasons as I have outlined that people do not believe it is fair enough to take a social services amendment of this sort and use it basically for strike breaking. I have not yet heard, but I hope to hear, reasons from the Minister as to why this interpretation cannot reasonably be applied to this Bill. I cannot see any other reason for it. If there are other reasons I would very much like to hear the Minister elucidate them in due course. Senator Haines very reasonably raised last week the Government's erroneous perception that wives somehow have the universal ability to influence their husbands' decisions as to whether they will accept a call to strike. Of course she was right when she said that they do not have any such influence. I shall quote Senator Haines's comments in the Hansard of 17 March when she said something I could not put better or indeed as well. Senator Haines, speaking last week about this legislation, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There can be no question that the motivation behind this legislation had nothing to do with ending or limiting industrial disputes. There seem to be no reasons behind the Government's reintroduction of this legislation other than to try to intimidate some unionists, to cause family disharmony, to punish innocent women and children or-this I believe to be the most likely reason-to take advantage of the average person's ignorance about industrial or legislative matters in order to induce hysteria in the community and then, what is worse, to prey upon this for political advantage. It appears to us to be nothing more nor less than a cynical exercise in scare tactics. </PARA>
<PARA>I say 'Amen' to that. I would like to feel that in the intervening week the Government has taken these words to heart and has thought again. I urge it to do so even at this late stage. It would be a remarkable thing that we would all applaud if that happened. The Government has a clear opportunity to give the lie to all those things that have been said about confrontative politics in Australia and to show that it is able to govern this country while taking into account the reasonable views put forward by a dissenting group. The Australian Democrat senators put this forward as a new idea. After all, we represent the views of close on one million Australian voters. It is a view we have a responsibility to put forward. I suggest that the Government has a responsibility to listen to it and consider it carefully. Is it good enough that the Government should, on its minority of the total vote-it is a fact that it governs on a minority vote-want its way at all times and on all things? If it does not get its way, should it get a fit of the huffs and take its bat and ball , not home, but off to the Governor-General to ask for a double dissolution? I suggest to the Government yet again, so it is quite clear on this point, that it can come much nearer what it actually wants by supporting the Australian Democrats amendment than by any other means. I would like an assurance from the Minister. If what I say is not correct I would like him to explain why. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment would alter the present situation, in which the wives of strikers are paid the dole after one week, so that they got that payment only after two weeks. The community and industrial relations generally, we believe, would be the healthier for that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will spend two or three minutes discussing the divisiveness in the community over industrial relations issues. It is a matter of deep concern to the Australian Democrats. It was one of the things which led to the formation of the party. We feel that it is one of the great issues that has never really been tackled. The Government's tendency to exploit this divisiveness in the community is a very mischievous and evil thing to do. It is, in fact, playing with fire. Industrial relations in this country is a complete shambles. We need something done about basic issues such as fewer unions, more rationally based. This is something the Government is starting to look at. We hope it will come forward with more rational comments than we have heard so far. If there is to be a reasonable government initiative on this matter let us see it. Let it be agreed to, preferably by industry, employers and the unions themselves. I suggest there is no harm in consulting these people rather than someone in the Government coming forward with something off the top of his head. </PARA>
<PARA> There needs to be much less political interference and play in the process of conciliation. There are examples of this in other countries. Canada has a system of industrial task forces. There is an attempt first to take any kind of dispute right away from publicity and from the political and legal fields. A group of arbitrators, chosen from industry, come together. They are selected by all parties to the dispute from a large panel of available people who know their subject. Those people go away and discuss the dispute away from politics, legalities and publicity. I gather that a very large number of disputes are settled at that stage. It is understandable that they should be settled at that stage because they are not made political footballs and brought into the area of provocation which is often so tragic and disastrous for people in this country. I would have thought that we would have learned that lesson by now. Are we doomed to go on learning it over and over again, year after year, causing more and more trouble and strife for our own people?</PARA>
<PARA> We need a sensible system of industrial democracy in this country along the lines of the Bill proposed by my colleague, Senator John Siddons, which recently passed the Senate. It was of great distress to me to see the relative unawareness of the media in this country to that Bill. After all, it was one of the most intelligent and basic initiatives in this area which has been taken in this country in many a long year. Because it did not represent trouble, discord or strife it appears to have been virtually ignored so I mention it again now. The Bill provided for an industrial democracy mechanism. An economic reward of an 8 per cent reduction in company tax would be given to those organisations prepared to meet the requirements of the industrial democracy organisation set up under the Bill. That would mean a proper profit sharing basis, work groups and worker representation on their boards. It is an industrial formula which is not new. It has had remarkable success in other countries and in the companies controlled by Senator Siddons himself. The lessons are there. Why cannot some notice be taken of them? The reason is that there is no interest in good government by honourable senators on the other side of the House. The Government is interested in confrontation and obstruction. It does not desire to see the old hatreds between the worker and the boss disappear. Apparently it suits the Government to exploit those hatreds, see that they are there forever and use them for its own base ends. The legislation we are considering now is another example of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent mess the Government has created is the chaotic lack of a reasonable wage fixing policy in this country. The Government has literally let the whole wage fixing system run loose. If it pretends to be any sort of government at all it should not be meddling with piddling legislation like this in order to cause trouble. It should come to grips with the problem of how to get a decent wage fixing system and understand that until we get it we will have trouble month after month and year after year. The situation will get worse. The blame can be laid directly at the door of the Government because of its miserable failure to cope with the problem. I suggest to the Government that it work towards solutions such as these to the problems. Even if it made a small effort I think it would regain some of the respect from the community which it has so dismally lost in recent months. </PARA>
<PARA> I am convinced that the Government consists largely of good men who want to do things but who now appear to be without direction. I cannot believe that all the people sitting opposite me in this chamber and those in the other place do not worry about the things I have mentioned. All we ask is that they do something about them and induce the Government to do something about them. We should have an end to things like this ridiculous little Bill which is brought back to us. Any attempt at compromise or conciliation is not listened to. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about that even now. I feel we might get somewhere. There are solutions to the problems I have mentioned. There should be consultation within the community and co-operation in a reasonable decent way, not the sort of miserable, piddling confrontation that we see in this Bill. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

It is true that the Bill is one which is not particularly large in size but I think some people would regard the principle which it contains as being of some importance. The principle which it raises is whether the Australian taxpayer, through the Commonwealth Government, should automatically extend income support to the families of strikers during a strike. That is a matter on which I am prepared to say there is room for some honest differences of opinion. But I think most Australians would say that it is a question of some seriousness and one which certainly warrants the attention of the national Parliament, and not the sort of disparaging wipe-off that it was given in the closing minutes of the debate.

<PARA> This Bill proposes that, for so long as a person's spouse is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit because of involvement in industrial action; or unwilliness to undertake suitable work; or failure to take reasonable steps to obtain such work, that person will also be ineligble for unemployment benefit. Additionally, a person will be ineligble for unemployment benefit for so long as payment of that benefit to the person's spouse is postponed because of their misconduct as a worker; because they have become voluntarily unemployed; or because they have failed to accept an offer of suitable employment. </PARA>
<PARA>That measure is proposed in the context of an income maintenance system in Australia which is extremely broad. The Australian taxpayer supports, through the Commonwealth Government and through the Department of Social Security, approximately two million Australians with regular payments. That figure of two million is made up principally of age pensioners of whom there are about 1.4 million. It is made up of in excess of 200,000 invalid pensioners. It is made up of over 300,000 people on unemployment benefit. It comprises the major part of the Commonwealth' expenditure on social security and welfare. It comprises a bill which is met by the Australian taxpayer to the tune of approximately $40 a week per taxpayer. This is a significant matter. It is a matter of great interest to all Australians because all of them may at some stage be dependent upon that system of income support and all of those who work, earn and pay taxes contribute to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The question which is raised in this debate and which falls to be determined in a vote of the Senate is whether automatic assistance is to be provided to the families of strikers and to others who for various reasons are not entitled to unemployment benefit. That, as I said before, is an important question. It has been debated in part during the debate on the basis that to refuse unemployment benefit in these circumstances is to bring hardship on to innocent people. I, of course, can understand that that is a matter which would be of concern to all honourable senators in this place and, indeed, to all Australians. I can do no more than remind the Senate that the provision does not deny income support to people who are without money of their own. </PARA>
<PARA> As was indicated in the Bill, as was expanded upon in the speeches in this place the last time the matter was before the Senate and as was outlined by Senator Scott when he spoke in the debate on this occasion, the proposal that special benefit should be available in cases of extreme hardship has been defined to ensure that those people who are without cash resources will be entitled to receive special benefit at the same rate as unemployment benefit would be payable at present. One is looking at a situation in which the Government is not saying that the families of strikers or people who are out of employment for one of the reasons that I have already outlined should not receive support, rather the Government is saying that the first call for support should be on that family's own resources. As I indicated some months ago, the position would be that where there were adequate cash resources to meet current commitments and where there were additional cash resources equal to the amount of unemployment benefit which would be payable, special benefit would not be payable. In other circumstances special benefit would, indeed, be payable. I refer those honourable senators who want a more detailed description of the operation of that to Senator Scott's recent speech, to my original laying down of the conditions which I had outlined to the Australian Democrats before this matter came into Parliament last time, to page 2539 and page 2540 of the Senate Hansard of 25 November. </PARA>
<PARA> A good deal of the debate in this place has been conducted on the basis that there are no real difficulties about strikes in Australia, that there are strikes for good reason and that really we should all be much more understanding about strikes. I think that a very significant part of the Australian population believes that it is time that we were considerably less understanding about strikes and more keen to see an end to the strike activity in this country. More recently, in debate in the Senate, I have had occasion to refer to things which have been said by the Premier of New South Wales about some of the trade union activity in New South Wales of recent time which he has described in terms which I have no doubt honourable senators opposite would call union bashing. I refer to those statements. I do not want to go into them at length again unless honourable senators opposite would like me to repeat Mr Wran's words. </PARA>

<PARA>That is what Mr Wran has recently had to say about some of the trade union activity in his State. Something else which has been said recently is that Mr Wran has said of the psychiatric nurses that they have desecrated their profession. We are looking at a position where there is, in fact, often trade union activity which is of a totally anti-social kind. I would have thought that debate in this place ought be conducted also with a recognition that that is so.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Leader of the Australian Democrats now says that nobody is arguing about that. It is admitted, apparently, from different parts of the chamber that much of the strike activity might be described as quite anti-social in character. If the Bill before the chamber is not passed it will remain true that no matter how anti-social the behaviour of the trade unions there will be an automatic entitlement to support under the social security system for many of the families of strikers engaged in that behaviour. A balance has to be established. This Government believes that the proper balance is to be established by not ensuring automatic entitlement to social security benefits in these circumstances but by providing access to social security benefits only in circumstances where the family does not have assets or money of its own. I believe that any family which has its own cash resources ought to be thrown on to those cash resources before being thrown on to the resources of the taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are quite clear choices in this matter before the chamber. There has been an attempt, in my view, to confuse and muddy the issue by the moving of an amendment by the Democrats, who have suggested that they would prefer to see the law changed so that assistance is denied for two weeks of a strike. That is the rather extraordinary proposition: The Government would refuse a subsidy for short strikes but would grant a subsidy for long strikes. If we look at the information on strikes which was put before the Senate when this matter was last debated it becomes pretty clear that the sort of situation which is surely most objectionable to the taxpayer is when there are long, extended strikes which are very costly to the country, extremely inconvenient to the community and which still give rise to an automatic entitlement to social security benefits. I defy anybody to describe to me the logic of saying that we will refuse to give a subsidy for a two-week strike but will give a subsidy for a three-week strike. That seems to me to be quite absurd. The Government has no difficulty in saying that it will not accept the amendment which has been put forward by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> To turn the matter into one of women's rights shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the operation of the social security system. It is true that throughout the whole of the operation of that system income testing has been applied not to individuals but to families. Whether one looks at a male employee or a female employee, their entitlement to various benefits, including the unemployment benefit, is restricted by an income test which applies not merely to the income of the person seeking the benefit but also to the income which is being received by the spouse of the person seeking the benefit. So as a matter of principle the whole of the social security system is based not on women's rights or men's rights but on trying to ensure that families receive basic support in circumstances where they need it. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing here with a situation where, by wilful act or an act which is not the responsibility of the Government, an individual has deprived himself of the ability to earn his living for a period. In that circumstance it seems absolutely artificial to have the spouse of that person exempted from the equivalent to the income test and being regarded as a person who can seek the assistance of the social security system. I believe there are no grounds in logic for support being extended in those circumstances. I believe the legislation should be welcomed by this place. The fact of the matter is that we are seeking to go from a situation at present where there is an automatic entitlement to benefit in certain circumstances to a situation where there will be an entitlement to benefit only where the family does not have cash resources of its own. I believe that is a fair situation to arrive at. It is a situation which this Government ought to maintain. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters raised throughout the debate concerns the question of whether the Government is using the social security system as an industrial weapon. It seems to me to be quite clear that what is being sought, in fact, by those who would oppose this change is the use of the social security system to ensure that the strike weapon can be more effectively wielded. That is a principle which was deserted by this country many years ago. It was deserted by politicians from the other side of politics to me. In the last debate I referred to the description of the history of this matter which is contained in Mr Kewley 's Australian Social Security Today. I referred to pages 132 and 133 of that book. The book quotes from a letter to the Director of Social Services dated May 1948 in which Senator McKenna, the Minister for Social Services in the Chifley Government, said:</PARA>
<PARA> All unions represented at the Conference with me in Sydney on 23rd April accepted the principle that the Commonwealth could not permit unemployment benefit to be used for financing strikes. </PARA>
<PARA>That was accepted as long ago as 1948 by the Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the noisy members of the Opposition to listen with their ears instead of with their mouths. I am quoting from a statement made by Mr Chifley, a Labor Prime Minister. Honourable senators opposite may find it enjoyable. Mr Chifley went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to other persons involved in or affected by an industrial dispute, the Minister for Social Services has issued instructions which are being observed by the Department of Social Services in Queensland at present and throughout the Commonwealth. These instructions are the outcome of a full consideration of the relevant parts of the Act of a Cabinet sub-committee early in 1947. </PARA>
<PARA> In brief, the instructions embody the following principles: In respect of unions on strike and unions sponsoring a strike of its members in key positions, members of these unions . . . whether directly participating in the strike, or unemployed as a direct or indirect consequence of the strike, are not to be regarded as eligible to receive unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of unions not on strike, or apparently having no members on strike, members of these unions are to be regarded as eligible to receive unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that a nice new technique has emerged in Australia. The technique is that if one goes out on strike and stays out on strike in one of these towns for a long time, one's wife goes down and tries to collect the unemployment benefit. I believe that that automatic entitlement to use the social security system in a strike situation is something which is not acceptable to the Australian people and it is not something which is acceptable to this Government. I commend the legislation to the Senate. As I indicated before, the Government will oppose the amendment which was moved by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I firmly support the principles and philosophy of the present Family Law Act. I made that clear when I began this speech what seems an interminable time ago on 16 March, and I state it again tonight. I accept and support the philosophy of the Family Law Act to the extent that it removes the concept of matrimonial fault, thereby ending the humiliation, the bitterness and the hypocrisy which are associated with attempts to show who was the guilty party. I support the establishment of single-ground no-fault divorce as an advance which must on no account be jeopardised. I support, and I believe the Senate and this Parliament should support, the operation of a Family Court system whereby the Court, freed from the burden of attributing fault, can now concentrate on being satisfied as to the fact of marriage breakdown and on deciding thereafter the most equitable distribution of property, the proper level of maintenance and, above all, the best possible arrangements for the welfare of any children of the marriage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also expressed in my opening remarks my support for the general content of this legislation-the way in which it streamlines and will improve the operation of the family law system in various ways and the way in which it does that in the light of the accumulated experience in the operation of the family law system in the Family Court since 1975. The particular matter to which I was addressing myself and referring in the debate when it was adjourned a few weeks ago was the jurisdictional role of the Family Court and, in particular, the jurisdictional problems which can arise in relation to a number of areas of the Family Court's operation. The particular jurisdictional problem I mentioned, because it can be the most harrowing experience for the people involved. was in the custody jurisdiction of the Court when the claimants for custody involve more than the natural married parents of the child in question. </PARA>
<PARA> At the conclusion of my remarks on the last occasion I was drawing attention in particular to one case now before the High Court of Australia, the case of Fountain v. Alexander, which involved a custody battle over a 14-year-old boy being fought out simultaneously in three different courts-the High Court, the Family Court and the Supreme Court of New South Wales. That is manifestly an intolerable situation which ought not on any account to be repeated. I go on from here to say that unfortunately the present Bill does not mark in itself the achievement of a unified family law jurisdiction so as to make impossible in the future the repetition of experiences of this kind. There are in it amendments which endeavour to expand the jurisdiction of the Family Court within the limits of the Commonwealth's constitutional competence, but there is a doubt-there is no certainty-that these changes will in fact survive a High Court challenge. The case of Russell v. Russell and, more recently and to a lesser extent perhaps, the case of Gazzo do not give any cause for optimism at all about the High Court 's attitude to the reach of the Commonwealth's power in this area. Furthermore, it has been publicly reported that the Queensland Government, on the advice of that constitutional giant Sam Doumany, the State Attorney-General, will be mounting a High Court challenge to these amendments if they are passed. So, there is a very real question of their being at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, even if those amendments do survive such a High Court challenge, there are still a number of other matters not within the scope of the present Bill which I believe, and I hope other senators and members will believe, should be included in a unified family law jurisdiction but which are or which appear to be, in the present state of the law, beyond the reach of existing Commonwealth power. I am referring to matters which arise in the context of de facto marriages, particularly in respect of children and property. I am referring to questions which arise in relation to illegitimate children and also questions of adoption and wardship. Another set of questions which are obvious candidates for the jurisdiction of the family law and which may be within the reach of the Family Court under the Commonwealth's constitutional power as it stands at the moment concern problematical maintenance other than in the context of divorce proceedings. But these matters again are outside the range of attention of the present Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Assuming that we in this Parliament can agree on the need for such unified jurisdiction for the Family Court, which I suppose is-no doubt we will hear later on from Senator Martyr how problematic it is-there are only two real options open, namely, references of powers by the States under the present provisions in section 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution or, on the other hand, amendment of the Constitution. One might say that this is something of a Hobson' s choice kind of situation. On the one hand, we have the attitudes to constitutional reform generally which have been expressed in recent days by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in Sydney in his Edmund Barton lecture last Friday, when he put on record the view that any systematic or serious attempt at constitutional reform would be regarded by him, so long as he and his Government stayed in office, as divisive and out of the question. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a certain breath-taking quality about the effrontery demonstrated by someone like Malcolm Fraser who can claim that anyone's attempts to achieve constitutional reform are, in fact, divisive, given the track record of this man , a man who as I said a few days ago, is to the Australian Constitution what Attila the Hun was to the Roman empire. There are problems of course, in that political environment faced with that unreasoning hostility from unreasoning office bearers of this kind, in achieving sensible, systematic, rational constitutional amendment in areas which are even as crying out for it as the area of family law. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative option is, of course, to secure a reference from the States under section 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution but that is currently bogged down. That option is practically made unrealistic by a mixture of States' intransigence and a lack of political will on the part of the present Attorney- General. I suggested to the Attorney-General in this chamber on 21 November last that he should take his constitutional courage in both hands, stop running on the spot and accept referrals from those States which are, in fact, prepared to give them. If that means New South Wales alone, to begin with, so be it. Victoria will soon, undoubtedly, be following, particularly after the change of government on 3 April. I predict that South Australia and Tasmania will follow soon after. It is only by adventurous action of this kind and active performance on the part of our present governing leadership that we will get a rationalisation in this respect. The present Bill goes a reasonable distance along this particular path, but it does not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, can I seek clarification at this stage as to just how much time I have got? The clock started at a quarter to the hour suggesting that I had only 15 minutes. But I think that is a mistake. I do, in fact, have another 20 minutes to go, not that I anticipate using that full amount. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you would, Mr President. I want to refer now to a number of aspects relating to the operation of the Family Court which are, of course, very much in issue as a result of the content of this Bill. I visited the Family Court in Melbourne for half a day three or four weeks ago with a specific object , which unfortunately is denied to most people by virtue of the closed nature of the Family Court proceedings at this stage. I was very much impressed by the evident efficiency, care and the compassion in the running of that court and the administration also of its counselling service. It seemed to me to be an environment very much conducive to the resolution of the difficult and very unhappy problems that often, in fact, confront it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is against that background that I wish to make some remarks on the following matters: The procedures relating to undefended divorces; the problems relating to court determinations affecting the welfare of children; the question of counselling; and the question of enforcement. In relation to undefended divorce applications, which is something which all honourable senators know has become a very controversial matter in the course of the consideration of this Bill, I found no indication whatsoever that the non-attendance of the parties or their legal representatives would make the slightest difference whatsoever to the way in which, in practice, undefended dissolutions are dealt with by the Family Court. At present, of course, it is only necessary for the applicant's legal representative to be present as distinct from the applicant being there in person. It is my impression and understanding that it is only in a minority of cases that both of the parties to the marriage, the applicant and the defendant are, in fact, there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Senator, excuse me for interrupting you, but you did have a query about how much time you had. On further clarification the record shows that you do have the full 30 minutes. There was a misunderstanding of one figure .</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to you, Mr President. I will try not to try the patience of the Senate or anyone else beyond endurance. But I am indebted to you , Mr President, for that clarification. In relation to such dissolutions, it is evident that the kind of technical defects that can often, of course, occur in the applications for such a dissolution can be easily remedied otherwise than by the presence of the parties. This can be done by a requisition through the post and by the appropriate affidavits being sworn or the appropriate material being supplied. If there are matters of substance about which the judge remains unsatisfied on the material before him, then, of course, it will remain, under this proposed legislation, perfectly open to him to require the attendance of the parties. Indeed, it will remain the case that if either of the parties to a divorce should not only want to be there personally but also require the attendance of the other party or his or her representative, then that can be done too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The way in which the procedure, at present, operates is, to put it shortly, brisk, informal and extremely brief. I have seen undefended divorces being dealt with by Family Court judges in a period as short as 30 seconds. The judge will simply say: 'I grant a decree nisi in the usual terms'. The papers will be shuffled across his desk and that will be it. The average length of the judicial determination of the formal decree nisi proceedings, in the period that I observed the Family Court, was perhaps between one minute and three minutes. Certainly, on no occasion did it take more than five minutes and then only because there was some uncertainty as to whether the affidavit in question had been served on the other party. There is no evidence whatsoever, both in my direct experience or in the experience reported to me by others who practise and work in this jurisdiction, to suggest that those who appear at these hearings either want a degree of ceremony in their divorce or, to the extent that they do appear at the moment, notice in any way the conspicuous lack of ceremony which operates at the moment. Obviously, there are many more things that can be said about the divorce by post controversy. I will save them up to the Committee stage. At this stage I simply want to put on record my strong belief that most of the argument that we are getting on this subject has no regard to the reality as it operates at the moment and is based on a wholly romantic perception of the formality and the solemnity of the dissolution proceedings as they are conducted at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> In so far as the welfare of children is concerned, which is another crucial aspect of the way the Court presently operates and a topic which is addressed to a limited extent by the present Bill, it has to be noted that this is overwhelmingly, perhaps, the most important aspect of the Family Court's procedure in terms of the impact that decisions can have on the lives of people. I believe that there is a need for the greater use in this part of the Court's jurisdiction for separate representation for children so as to ensure that their interests are maintained and promoted as a separate and distinct point of reference for the Court. I believe also very much in the need for early intervention by counselling, through the Court's agencies, to avoid protracted and unsatisfactory custody battles. The statistics that have emerged from the Family Court jurisdiction show clearly that cases where courts have to make custody and access orders where agreement cannot be reached between the parties through the assistance of counselling or otherwise are those cases which undoubtedly cause the most trouble subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect I welcome also the present amendment to clause 21, as it has been further proposed to be amended by the Attorney's latest offering, which will abolish the arbitrary rule presently applying prohibiting the court from making an order against the wishes of a child 14 or over and which will oblige the Court, rather, to consider any wishes which are expressed by a child of any age. Even with this proposed amendment I am still personally concerned about the possibility of pressure being brought to bear on a child by one or other parent in a custody proceeding in order to extract from the child a favourable expression of wishes. I think that this possibility, which I suspect is a very real one, not only underlies the importance of separate representation for the child but also calls for some kind of guarantee that evidence as to a child's wishes, if that is to be led in a Family Court proceeding, should be attested to by a person truly independent of the child's parents. At the appropriate time I propose to move an amendment to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as counselling is concerned, I start, as I suspect many honourable senators do, from the premise that contested family law cases, particularly over custody matters which are the most gruelling of them all, must be avoided at all costs. The complexity of the problems involved, the intensity of the feeling of the parties and the virtual impossibility of achieving a result which will be suitable and acceptable to all parties without any demur make adversary proceedings and the judicial arbitration of that contest singularly inappropriate to the resolution of this class of family law problem. Those involved with the court do a very conscientious job in this respect but if we can possibly avoid the matter coming to arbitation in that way, that is a wholly salutary objective to be pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome very much the trend towards the early intervention in disputed family law cases, by counselling services to analyse the problems and to explore possible solutions in an atmosphere of negotiation rather than confrontation. Pre-court counselling, as it is described, has a success rate of 80 per cent to 90 per cent; that is, the parties settle their disputes and reach agreement over custody and access in that proportion of cases. I think it is so obvious as to not need further repetition that the earlier the intervention the better in this respect. If that is to occur, if there is to be earlier intervention, if there is to be more systematic intervention in this helping, negotiating counselling way, there is an obvious need for more counsellors to do that pre-court work. On current figures, if such counsellors were made available, this would undoubtedly further reduce the number of contested matters and would reduce delays that are presently operating within the counselling services. </PARA>
<PARA> The other pre-court intervention that is particularly crucial-I am not talking about the custody area this time but rather about contested property matters or financial matters-is the intervention which is made by deputy registrars. To the extent that they participate in the pre-trial resolution of contested property matters, they have been achieving a settlement rate of about 70 per cent. Once again, I believe that all the evidence suggests that were more resources to be made available in this respect an even higher proportion of settled as distinct from contested, matters could, in fact, be achieved. This, indeed, was recommended quite explicitly by the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act both in respect of financial intervention and custody counselling. It is obvious , I suggest to the chamber, that mediation and counselling, both within the court system and, of course, supplemented by such services outside it, is an infinitely better route to the successful resolution of the whole series of complex situations that arise in respect of divorce proceedings than costly and drawn out legal battles. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining specific matter that I mention as crying out for attention within the system as it operates at the moment concerns the enforcement of orders of the Family Court. This is undoubtedly one of the biggest areas of complaint that I see in practice; that is, non-compliance with court orders, notably those relating to access and maintenance. We are talking about continuing or recurrent obligations which may be met by the recipient of the order for a significant period but then allowed to lapse or in other cases are never complied with at all. At one level, there will never be an ultimate solution to this problem of enforcement, no one can compel compliance if the party bound to comply is absolutely intransigent. The final sanction has to be punishment simply for contempt of court either by fine or imprisonment, but that still does not ensure money in the hands of the party to whom that money is supposed to be going. The deterrent quality of such punishment is important. I certainly support its retention as a last resort, but it will not solve the hard cases which number perhaps one in 20 on the figures that have been suggested to me. In any case, both financial and custodial penalties can place even further burdens on innocent parties, particularly the children. </PARA>
<PARA> Short of those really hard cases, there are some things which I believe can be done. I will mention a couple of them. One is to clarify the role of State police so that they are required and know that they are required to give assistance in enforcing Family Court orders. At present the reality of the matter is that State police refuse to assist except in the execution of a Family Court warrant when they are expressly requested by the Federal Police to do so. I believe it is unfair that people who have court orders should be prevented by these time honoured demarcation questions and by the absence of a significant Federal Police presence in many areas of Australia from enforcing their rights. The parliamentary Committee recommended that section 112 of the Act be utilised for the purpose of making the necessary arrangements with State police to formalise their role in the enforcement of custody and access. According to the Attorney-General's initial statement, this was to be dealt with in the Bill, but it certainly does not appear to have been. I would have thought it was clearly an Executive matter rather than a legislative one under section 112. I would welcome some explanation from the Attorney-General in that respect if he is mindful to offer it in his reply to the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The other solution which ought to be seriously considered is the creation of some special maintenance enforcement agency and appropriate procedures to go with it. That was another recommendation of the parliamentary Committee; that is , the creation of a national agency to administer the collection and enforcement of maintenance. Recommendation 31 of that Committee's report set out a list of 12 steps, all of which I believe should be taken seriously, to improve procedures for the enforcement of maintenance. Those recommendations have, however, with just one exception, not been taken up, although we are told that some of them are still under consideration. All I would say at this stage is that a maintenance order which is unenforceable is obviously worse than having no order at all. It is essential that this whole matter be given far more urgent attention than it seems to be receiving from the Attorney-General. So much for some of the specific matters which were given rise to by the terms of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to say something about the role of the legal system in the administration of family law. This seems to be me to of quite fairly fundamental importance. For large numbers of Australians, family law is the most important part of the legal system with which they ever have contact in their entire lives . Yet family law remains the cinderella of legal practice. I should say right at the outset that I personally have very considerable admiration for the hardy band of family law practitioners who are, by and large, dedicated, patient and understanding. In my present position as a member of parliament-I know this goes for many honourable senators and members-I and my staff see a very large number of constituents on family law matters. I know just how difficult these cases are to solve. They do not admit of easy legal solutions because the legal rights and duties laid down by the Act are really only the beginning of the answer. We are dealing, in addition, with very srong emotions, with people's personal lives and , most importantly, with broad discretions which the Family Court is called upon to exercise and which are simply not susceptible to objective legal analysis after the event in the way that is perhaps more common in other jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps the very difficulty of the jurisdiction, the lack of legal certaintly, and the demand it places upon qualities of patience and compassion which results, perhaps perversely, in family law practice being disparaged by the vast majority of legal practitioners. That is probably, however, being rather over-charitable. To my knowledge, family law practice is widely perceived as being lowly in status, tainted by legal aid funding and is ultimately unremunerative, at least by comparison with the golden eggs laid by the untiring commercial law goose. It is not entirely unremunerative, of course. Under regulation 183 I notice that the basic return for the undefended divorce under the scale rate is something like $275 where children are involved and $210 where they are not. Some people have been unkind enough to suggest that this is money for jam. Nevertheless, generally speaking, family law is unremunerative and in the hard cases there is certainly no question of the harrowing strain this places on legal practitioners being compensated for in any of the ways that are normally thought usual in this profession. </PARA>
<PARA> These attitudes-they are attitudes about the practice of family law which I deplore-go much of the way, I think, to explaining the decision of most large solicitors' firms and many quite able barristers to refuse family law work entirely, or at least, to treat it as suitable for the female articled clerk and no one else. The end result tends to be that family law becomes the poor relation. Most of those who count themselves among the leading lawyers in the land would not be seen dead within the portals of the Family Court. I think that is a lamentable situation, a perversion of priorities. Family law, dealing as it does with the most initimate affairs of real people, is just too important to too many people to be relegated to the bottom of the legal pecking order. On this occasion I invite the legal community, the legal profession, to take a long , hard look at itself in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the legal profession is the role of family law judges. All the qualities demanded of family law practitioners are demanded a dozen times over of family court judges. They are called on to display superhuman skills; to be psychologist, social worker, counsellor and arbitrator all rolled into one- combining the wisdom of Solomon with the patience of Job. It is perhaps not surprising, given those demands, that not all of them in practice measure up to that standard. But theirs is an unenviable task. The death recently of one Family Court judge in tragic circumstances is a shocking reminder of the passion which their decisions do in fact generate among those whom they affect and the risks they run in exercising a role in this jurisdiction. I repeat the call I made previously, during a debate last year on the Judges Pensions Amendment Bill , that the salaries of family law court judges need to be upgraded to ensure a remuneration in keeping with the very heavy responsibility they bear and to ensure that persons of the highest calibre can be attracted. </PARA>
<PARA> It is evident that the job of improving the Family Law Act and the whole family law system to make it more workable and more equitable is by no means going to be completed by the passage of this amendment Bill, even in its original form and without the emasculation I know that has been contemplated by a number of honourable senators and members-including Senator Martyr, who is to follow me in this debate. The passage of this Bill, particularly if it is further amended in some of the ways I have recommended tonight, will certainly go a long way in making the system work a lot better than it does at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Family law is a real challenge for any legal system-for the legislators who are out to make the law and for the lawyers who have to apply it and to administer it. I do not underestimate the task of getting that system right. But I believe great strides have been made both in the passage of the original Act and now in the presentation of this amending Bill. The task of maintaining a degree of momentum in the development of the law and the amendment of the law so it can match changing social realities is difficult and sensitive. However, it is a task that must continue. It will continue only if all honourable senators and members in debating this Bill adopt-as I hope most of us will, but I fear some of us may not-a constructive and forward-looking approach. </PARA>

I have circulated to all honourable senators the proposed amendment attached to my dissenting report. I have had responses from many honourable senators. Because most of us were not in the chamber at the time the Family Law Act was passed I will review briefly the sequence of events which led to the situation today. Certainly, there were problems with the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1959 which preceded the Family Law Act. But at least that Act was based on our traditions of law which are fundamentally to maintain justice and good order, to determine degree of guilt or innocence. Of all these things surely justice is the most important, the most basic aim of law. Yet this is precisely what the Family Law Act set out to eliminate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Prior to the Family Law Act most people stayed married more or less satisfactorily. Even those with less satisfactory arrangements tended to avoid the scandals and costs of the divorce courts and maintained their relationships, sometimes under extraordinarily difficult circumstances, because they firmly believed that the interests of the children of the marriage were best served by some form of stability. How right events have proved them. The statistics I incorporated show that between 1975 and 1980 there were more than a quarter of a million divorces in this country. In fact, there were 250,357 divorces and 311,080 children were involved with divorce. If honourable senators have already forgotten I will remind them that staying together for the sake of the children was a form of voluntary and often heroic self-sacrifice and self-denial to help the children. Today this sounds strangely antiquated in an era when everyone does his own thing regardless of whose interests are hurt. Unfortunately, this has become the tragic basic philosophy of what passes for law in the Family Law Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The so-called progressives-always a very powerful influence with their allies the media-to get their form of divorce legislation, offered a most attractive bait. They said: 'You will be able to do as you like in marriage and not have to face the full responsibility of your conduct; being divorced as a guilty party'. A group of professionals with legal training and an apparent vested interest in easy divorce lobbied parliamentarians prior to 1975, day and night. I have heard them disrespectfully referred to as 'a gang of touts and urgers' but they are not my words; I quote somebody else. Some of these people have since benefited substantially in the law from their dedication. Some of them are judges and advocates in this most lucrative jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Murphy and his force of libertarians, undoubtedly supported by Senator Evans then outside the Parliament, and so-called progressives from both sides of this Parliament-who in my opinion did not know the difference between liberty and licence and who still do not and who again in my opinion did not much care-erred solidly on the side of licence and were finally supported by only a narrow majority in this Parliament. But that was enough and their writ runs today in the tragedy of the Family Law Act. In 1979, after only four years of this infamous Act, it was necessary because of public outcry to have a joint parliamentary select committee of both Houses of Parliament, which sat for a whole year, inquiring into the operation of the Act. This monumental effort with its mountain of evidence produced a majority report and several minority reports . Not for one moment do I question the genuineness of those who agreed to the majority report; I question only their judgment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They had a damn sight less bias than Senator Evans did. The majority report decided to by-pass the ample evidence of the deep discontent caused by the working of the Act. This, I suppose, was almost inevitable. Obviously, the professionals convinced the Committee that Parliament cannot reform society through the law and that the law should therefore reflect only what they think are current mores. How easy it is to wipe off the cries of anguish of the outraged innocents punished harshly by the operation of the Act by saying that it is never possible to satisfy an unsuccessful litigant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We were told in our inquiry by the professionals that no one is innocent. I must say that this is a refreshing change when the same people say in an argumentative contest of a theological kind that there is no such thing as original sin and therefore everyone is innocent. I am emphatic that the law does influence behaviour, otherwise why do we keep making laws? If anybody wants a clear and demonstrable argument about how the law does influence behaviour and attitudes there are many such demonstrations. There is the classic example of seatbelt laws where law certainly has influenced behaviour. There is another instance that some honourable senators may not like to hear but it is intensely relevant. While laws were upheld against abortion the numbers performed legally and illegally were held to fairly well-defined limits. Since the breaking down of the laws by judicial interpretations-it should be noted they were brought about by pleas about the hard cases that make bad laws-the numbers have risen to staggering heights. Here the change in the interpretation and application of the law changed something that was regarded as a disgusting crime just a few years ago into something socially acceptable and therefore right and proper behaviour widely practised, even encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the majority report of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act. Those who are responsible for the Family Law Act forgot one very important thing and I think Senator Evans has forgotten it too. If one repeals a rule one must beware of the evil which the rule was intended to combat. Thus the Joint Select Committee's fundamental mistake was that it ignored the destruction of innocence and denial of justice perpetrated by the Family Law Act. Yet those were the very things which precipitated calls for the Joint Select Committee to investigate the operation of the Act. In spite of my emotions I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard my findings after the inquiry of the Joint Select Committee into the Family Law Act which sum up far better than what I have said so far what I think about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Summary of Findings</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Family Law Act is a divorce Act only, and has contributed substantially to the breakdown of marriage and family as a permanent commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Family Law Act purports to uphold marriage, but in effect makes marriage an unforceable contract, with 12 months' separation as the only ground for legal 'no fault' unilateral breaking of the contract. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Family Law Act has no priority for annulment applications. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Family Law Act has abolished innocence and therefore its judgments cannot be based on complete justice. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The Family Law Act, in abolishing innocence, has caused confusion by allowing sociology, through court counsellors, into what are and should always be essentially matters of law. Sociology is inherently inexact; the law tries to be exact about innocence and guilt-thus the confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The Family Law Act allows divorcees to start a new domestic life before ALL matters are settled. This causes more confusion and difficulty, particularly for children. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. The Family Law Act allows trial and judgment in secret. The law must always be open to the public and its proceedings and findings open for publication, with proper protection for the under age only. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Family Law Act, paricularly through ''no fault'' divorce, has separated Family Law from the mainstream of Australian jurisprudence. There is also a special condition in the Family Law Act for appointment as a Judge of the Family Court, and there are different premises, procedures, rules and customs, which are unnecessary and undesirable. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. The Family Law Act is enormously expensive to the taxpayer. It has created a heavy structure of judges and extra bureaucracy, with more to come with the Institute of Family Studies. Only rarely has cost of proceedings been excessive. Excessive fee appeals before Registrars, if successful, do not have costs of appeal awarded as in other courts. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. The Family Law Council is performing work which should be the sole province of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. The Institute of Family Studies will add nothing to marriage stability and permanence. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. The Family Court has no machinery for reconciliation counselling. Its '' court counsellors'' are essentially expediters of court procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. The Family Law Act's ''no fault'' divorce has confused marriage counselling organisations to the point where they are vague about their purpose. They feel no real support from the Family Court. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. We now have the long-awaited response from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to the Joint Select Committee's report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans may laugh but they represent people. The Salvation Army, the Baptist Union, the Churches of Christ, the Anglican Church, and Catholic Church agencies in Western Australia and Sydney have all expressed disappointment at the Attorney-General's response. These submissions do not come in a vacuum. They represent the well-considered views of people-voters in the electorate, people who are actively working among those who are suffering from the working of the Family Law Act. Senator Evans may laugh but I listen to these people, not him. I say with regret that the Attorney-General's amendments are mainly cosmetic and follow almost completely what the Family Law Council had to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now give an example of where the Attorney has ignored some very good advice given by the Joint Select Committee on the matter of objective tests. Let me explain here that the Act, for all its evident faults, requires that any fact or circumstance relevant be considered by judges in determinations of property and maintenance, that is, section 75 (2) (0) of the Act. However in practice judges do not use this section. They do not use the section about reconciliation counselling either-section 14 (6) (a)-which also uses the mandatory word 'shall' , as does section 75 (2) (0) which I previously mentioned. Referring to section 75 (2) (0), the judges maintain that fact and circumstance constitute what they call conduct. Therefore that is against the philosophy of the Act so they do not use it. Yet judges are supposed to administer the law as it stands, not make it. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard some extracts from the foreword to my dissenting report which are relevant to the essential separation which there must always be between the judiciary and the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Procedure followed by the Committee in regard to taking testimony from, and being involved on the Committee with, the judiciary of the Family Court and the Family Law Council. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to point (d) above, I objected to taking testimony from, and being involved on the Joint Select Committee with, the Judiciary of Family Court and the Family Law Council. My objections were raised at, and rejected by, a deliberative meeting of the Joint Select Committee. However, I hold those objections still, and note that the Committee finally apparently agreed in part: on 7th November, the Chairman rejected an offer from the Family Law Council to again meet with us and his rejection was supported by a deliberative meeting of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> My basic objections are, I believe, well founded in the concept of liberty well expressed by Montesquieu. He says, ''In every government there are three sorts of power: the legislative; the executive in respect of things dependent on the law of nations; and the executive in regard to matters that depend on the civil law (the latter we shall call the judiciary power) . . . There is no liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for the judge would then be the legislator. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Select Committee Chairman himself had much the same thing to say in a speech reported in House of Representatives Hansard p. 2917, 13th November, 1979 , in the debate on the High Court of Australia Bill. He said, ''Liberty has long been dependent on the independence of the functions that each of the areas of government have in our system and their effective separation.''</PARA>
<PARA> Also on Thursday 10th April 1980, at a deliberative meeting of the Joint Select Committee, Mr Holding M.P. and Senator Missen and others upheld this principle when they disagreed with the suggestion that the Joint Select Committee should recommend a pool of judges from which appelate judges can be drawn to constitute Full Benches, on the ground that this prerogative must remain with the Chief Judge as head of the Family Law judiciary, and the Parliament must not interfere . </PARA>
<PARA> I believe in the validity of this principle of separation, and regretfully express the view that this Joint Committee should not have heard the Family Law Council and the Family Law Court judges (I exclude from this Judge Nygh, appointed to the Bench after his submission to our inquiry and who appeared as an individual.) I mention here an instance where Mr Justice Barblett, Chief Judge of the W.A. Division of the Family Court, at one hearing in Perth at which I was present actually directed a member of his staff giving evidence NOT TO ANSWER a question I asked, and the question was not answered. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view the appearances of the judges constituted a breakdown of the proper traditional separation of judiciary and Parliament, and may have damaged the over-riding integrity of the Parliamentary role, which must never be seen even remotely as being pressured by the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee may have been able to learn from the wisdom and experience the Judges may have built up since the Act began operating, but it would, I believe, have been wiser to have obtained it in other ways than by their direct appearances before the Select Committee (for instance from Court staffs). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Committee wanted to amend section 75 (2) (0) to make it stronger as a result of its intensive inquiry into the operation of the Act. As honourable senators will see from the Attorney-General's response , which is in his attachment B, section 27, of the matter that he circulated to us, he refused to amend it. In fact his response, in my opinion, panders to the judges who I feel are there to apply that law, not ignore it to suit themselves. I say with regret that the Attorney-General's amendments are mainly cosmetic. I have been slating the Attorney-General fairly strongly but I say with genuine sincerity that I have found him to be good, kind and very tolerant. He has tolerated me, not just on this matter but on several other matters. However, in this case I must strongly disagree with him. I know that the Attorney-General is greatly concerned about the divorce rate. On 4 March last he issued a Press release in which he urged couples who are experiencing marital problems to consider alternatives to divorce. But why should they? The Family Law Act encourages people to divorce and the Attorney-General's amendments will make it even easier. At this stage I feel impelled to move my amendment to the motion for the second reading moved by the Attorney-General. It has been circulated but I will read it because it is germane to everything else that I will say. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Dairy Products (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1982 and the Dairy Products (Export Inspection Charge) Collection Bill 1982 extend a policy originally announced by the Government in the May 1979 mini-Budget-a general policy to recover 50 per cent of the cost of providing export inspection services for commodities by levying the commodities. The Opposition has not opposed similar Bills which have been introduced and passed previously to implement that same policy with respect to other products. Although not opposing the Bills or similar Bills that will follow dealing with edible oils and eggs, I think it ought to be placed on the record again that the imposition of these charges by a coalition government draws attention again to the hyprocrisy particularly of the National Country Party component of that coalition government, bearing in mind the inflammatory rhetoric which poured forth from the Country Party in 1973 when the then Labor Government imposed an export charge on meat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is another aspect of these Bills on which I comment briefly. The provision of a free inspection service is a de facto export subsidy and is generally regarded as being a breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Recently there has been some controversy with the United States of America on this very point. Whether an export inspection charge which recovers half of the actual cost would still be regarded as a breach of GATT might be a moot point, but I guess we can say with some confidence that if at least a substantial proportion of the actual costs of providing export inspection services is provided it is less likely to be regarded as a breach of GATT than if nothing were recovered. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another Bill which imposes an export charge on honey. Although I will speak to that Bill when the time comes I would like to explain now that I understand that when the Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1982 and the Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Collection Bill 1982 come before us a government senator is to move that they be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for a quick study of the procedures followed by the Department of Primary Industry in inspecting that commodity. I understand that it has been regarded by the Government and certainly by the Opposition as being in the nature of a test case. This one commodity is being selected to see whether the Senate Committee can detect any areas in which improvements can be made for upgrading the efficiency of the service. </PARA>
<PARA> Various amendments have been foreshadowed to these Bills and those dealing with edible oils and the eggs. The first amendment has been circulated in the name of Senator Macklin. It seeks effectively to remove the penalty for late payment of returns imposed in clause 7 of each Bill. The Opposition does not support that amendment. If there is no penalty for late payment of returns obviously there is a de facto incentive for people not to pay their bills on time. The other Democrat amendment provides for a time limit to be applied to search warrants to be issued pursuant to the enforcement of the provisions of these Bills. I understand that the Government will adopt that, and the Opposition will support it. I understand that the Government has also agreed, as a result of a suggestion arising from the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills, to allow for an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against various actions which may have been taken by the Minister under the Act and to a couple of other minor amendments. In summary, the Opposition will be supporting one of the Democrat amendments which has also been adopted by the Government and the other amendments which the Government has signified its intention to move; but we cannot agree with those amendments which propose to remove the penalties for late payment of levies which are due. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my assessment of the industry situation I have not detected any great disquiet about the propositions that have been put forward in the Dairy Products (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1982 and the Dairy Products (Export Inspection Charge) Collection Bill 1982. I have had some discussion on the relative rates of payment for the various commodities, which vary from as little as 50c a tonne to $2.50 a tonne at this stage. When the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) representing the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) replies to this debate I would like him to comment on whether these charges are as determined by the industry or by the Department of Primary Industry or are relative to the amount of work or anything else. The industry generally supports this form of government certification. It certainly assists export sales especially in countries that have controlled economies where a government certificate is of considerable value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In taking this action now and stipulating that the industry is to pay half of the charges that are involved, the Government accepts a responsibility to keep the charges at the lowest possible level and to keep the services at the highest standard that is required. By the same token, it puts a responsibility on the industry to monitor the operations far better than has been done in the past, to contribute to ensuring that no money is wasted and to see that the system is operated in the most efficient manner possible. There will be a need on the part of industry to keep pressure on to ensure the efficiency of this inspection task . I am not satisfied that the existing scheme-the scheme that has been taken over and incorporated in this legislation-is the best that it could be. It is now up to industry to recommend how this scheme can be improved and how it can obtain maximum efficiency. I firmly believe that everybody who pays for any service should have a say in the operation of that service. The provisions that are in the Bills have been in operation for 20 years and there have not been any problems with them. I support Senator Walsh in that I find it impossible to go along with the proposition that the Australian Democrats have put forward. I support the Bills. </PARA>

I wish to make comments covering the dairy products, edible oils and egg legislation. I will speak later on the honey legislation, again to spell out in some detail the points about the problems involved in inspection and the charges for inspections which may be imposed upon producers by the Government. I wish now, however, simply to raise the issue of the amendments which have been circulated in my name. These amendments, as indicated previously , arose from the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills which has put forward identical problems in regard to all the legislation that I have just mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In further discussions the Government agreed to the third amendment circulated in my name concerned with a warrant required under sub-section 3. The sub- section states that this warrant shall specify a date. I believe that was probably an oversight in the drafting, and I am pleased to see that all those Bills will now be rectified. Our other amendments were an attempt to press the point in relation to a person having a charge imposed upon him which he did not pay. No appeal mechanism was provided within the Act. Our mechanism to do that was simply to remove that item entirely. The Government has chosen to put a straightforward amendment to the effect that applications may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We are quite happy with that procedure because it is in line with other Acts which allow persons, if they feel aggrieved, to go to the appeals tribunal. That seems to us adequate to cover the problem we saw in the Bills. Therefore it will not be my intention to move those amendments circulated in my name in relation to the edible oils, eggs or honey legislation. </PARA>

<PARA> The only matter for response was the query raised by Senator Archer about the calculation of the fees. I have some information on that matter. It is in fact a departmentally determined distribution of 50 per cent of costs incurred in these various inspection processes. Looking at the various Bills before us today I note that there is a total cost of $1m which is in part made up of the salaries of 27 people who are engaged in this sort of work. About 58 per cent of the time of those people is spent on dairy products, 2 per cent on vegetable oils, 30 per cent on eggs and about 10 per cent on honey. A series of calculations done within the Department is the basis for the charges which are to be imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Later in the evening we will debate the honey legislation. As foreshadowed in Senator Walsh's speech, it is anticipated that Senator Peter Rae will move the reference of those Bills to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations with the express purpose of conducting an examination of the computation. The Government is quite agreeable to that course being followed and indeed looks forward to seeing the result of the Senate Committee's inquiries. In any event, the Senate is likely to receive a good deal of information within the next week or so from its own organ, the Senate Standing Committee, on the point raised by Senator Archer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too support these Bills. The amount involved may be only very small at this stage. About 7,000 tonnes of edible oils are exported at present. The industry is well suited by having a government inspection service to certify the product, particularly in its sales to areas such as the Middle East and other controlled economy countries. It is one of the few areas-(Quorum formed). At present sales are small but at least they are in an area that provides an opportunity for growth in various countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A certain amount of confusion and duplication has arisen over the inspections. A dairy oil product requires an inspector from the dairy division, other animal fats or oils require an inspector from the meat division and vegetable oils of any sort require a dairy inspector. I realise that we cannot have an inspector for every different commodity but I believe there are times when there may be a duplication of inspection services while the same shipment is being packed. At present, the costs are very low. Recently, one exporter told me he had received a bill for 11c for an inspection fee on a commodity he was exporting to the Middle East. The Government's amendments on this occasion will be the same as those moved to the Dairy Products (Export Inspection Charge) Collection Bill. I support Senator Walsh's comments and those of the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not be as fast in speaking to the Bills as Senator Walsh. I have a far deeper interest in the poultry industry than Senator Walsh, having been a poultry farmer and an egg producer before I became a senator. I have a lot of sympathy for the egg producers in Australia and the problems that they have faced over many years. I commence my remarks by saying that the egg industry is very proud of the way it has never called upon the Government for subsidies to finance the industry when things have been going badly. They have always been prepared to get themselves out of their own problems-unlike many primary producers who, when things go bad, call upon the Government to get financial support to get them out of the problems. There is a well known saying that the policy of the National Country Party has always been to socialise losses and capitalise profits. That could never be said truthfully about egg producers in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am a little astounded when I look at the time that it took to introduce the two second reading speeches to these Bills which we are debating cognately. When the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) introduced them in the House of Representatives on 18 February he introduced the first Bill at 2.39 p.m. and the second one at 2.40 p.m.-it took a minute to read the first second reading speech and it took a minute to read the second one because the Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Bill came on at 2.41 p.m. So, those two major Bills took two minutes to introduce by way of second reading speeches. </PARA>
<PARA> I will confine my remarks to the Egg (Export Inspection Charge) Bill. The Government expects to raise $145,000 in a full year from the egg export inspection charges. Of course, if some State Ministers have their way this amount will be quite a bit in excess of $145,000, particularly if there is no change of government in Victoria in a fortnight's time. If Mr Austin, the present Minister of Agriculture, is returned to office and carries out the promises of his predecessor, Mr Smith, a Victorian Liberal government will phase out the hen quota system. Then, of course, we will go back to the Rafferty's rules situation which we were in in the early 1960s in the egg industry. It will be a dog eat dog situation. Under the protection of section 92 of the Constitution eggs will be moving to and fro across the border and no one will be able to ascertain whether, in fact, the eggs were transported across the border or whether they were produced in the State where they are retailed, as happened when there was a type of civil war in the egg industry when I was a poultry farmer in the early 1960s until 1970 when I came into this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very grateful that when I left the egg industry and became a senator it appeared that we were getting some stability in the egg industry. It now appears that some of the monopolies are trying to get control of the industry. If governments are not very careful we will see ourselves engaged in another egg war. Of course, the conclusion of that war will mean that consumers will not get cheaper eggs; they will get dearer eggs and eggs of poorer quality. In the 1960s and early 1970s the so-called free enterprise people would pick up eggs from a haystack or from under a boxthorn bush and sell them to the consumer. The interested consumer wants farm fresh eggs; there is no such thing because there is no guarantee that, in fact, the eggs are fresh. The only guarantee that we have today that an egg is fresh is an Egg Board brand on it. If a person finds an egg that is not of good quality he than has the opportunity to return it to the retailer to have it replaced. But no such thing can happen when a consumer buys an unbranded egg. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague in the other place, the Labor spokesman on Primary Industry, Mr Kerin, in speaking on this legislation pointed out that Mr Smith, the previous Minister of Agriculture in Victoria, had made some suggestions about phasing out the quota system. As I have said, Mr Austin, his successor, is very non- committal now because an election is in the offing in Victoria. When he was asked what he was going to do about continuing with Mr Smith's promise to phase out the industry he was very non-committal. He said: 'Oh, we will wait until after the Victorian election'. I can tell any egg producer who is listening tonight that if by some quirk of fate the Liberals are re-elected-I do not think they will be-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Especially after what has happened tonight. Those who saw the Australian Broadcasting Commission news at 9.50 p.m. were acquainted with the fact that the senior Ministers of this Government have been meeting in great trauma all day to discuss the possible challenge to the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) by Mr Peacock. Anything could happen. At this time I am concerned in the main about egg producers and egg consumers. I return to what I was saying-that Mr Austin is non-committal as to what he may do, if he is returned to office at the end of next week, about continuing with Mr Smith's promise to phase out the quota system, which would be disastrous for the family egg producer in Australia and also disastrous for the egg consumer. Let us hope that Mr Austin is not returned and that there is a Labor Minister of Agriculture in Victoria who has some concern for the egg producers and the consumers, as had Mr Bywaters who became Minister for Agriculture in South Australia in 1965. He agreed with Mr Adermann's legislation, that we ought to implement the plan of the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities of Australia. That helped to bring about some stability in the egg industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party, when in government, has always been concerned about the welfare not only of primary producers but also of consumers. It has been concerned to see that both sides get a fair go-that is, that the producer receives a fair price for his commodity and that the consumer does not pay an exorbitant price. Mr Kerin went on to point out in the other place that last year Australia exported 1.6 million dozen eggs and 8.9 kilotonnes of egg pulp. As I pointed out, if people such as Mr Austin carry out the threats of Mr Smith we could see within the next 12 months a much larger exportable surplus. Instead of egg producers paying $145,000 by way of export charge levy they could well be paying double that amount. Unfortunately, a lot of them will go out of business.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kerin also pointed out that following the increase in the number of eggs produced the percentage of the commercial production being sold on the export market rose from 8.7 per cent to 13.1 per cent last year. What we are saying is that Australia is selling on the export market at virtually a loss. Of course, when we have a surplus of egg production in this country we have to sell it overseas at a loss. Some people wonder why it is sold at a loss. They cannot understand the fact that a lot of the eggs which are sold overseas, particularly the pasteurised pulp, has to be kept in cold storage at an enormous cost. This has to be borne by the local producer. It is unfortunate that that happens. I give great credit to the egg industry and the Australian Egg Board, under the chairmanship of Mr Ray Fuge, who is well known to me. It has endeavoured strongly to bring about some stability in the egg industry, to bring about an equitable amount of production so that we are not faced with a surplus. It also has attempted to ensure that no monopoly takes place in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that under a Liberal Government in New South Wales some years ago, when the CEMA plan came into operation, and in particular the quota system, the sky was the limit in that State. In my own State there is a maximum limit and no one producer could have more than 50,000 birds. That, I think, is more than enough for any one producer to make a very good living out of eggs. In New South Wales the Liberal Government allowed the sky to be the limit. I am very pleased to know that the New South Wales Wran Labor Government is looking at placing a maximum limit on the number of birds that any one producer can have in that State. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree entirely with the honourable senator. At present he is having an inquiry into the egg industry in order to see that some stability can be brought about, not only for New South Wales but also for every State in Australia. I have spoken about eggs very often in this Parliament. When I looked back at the Hansard record I saw that I made my maiden speech in this place nearly 11 years ago. As a matter of fact I made it on 15 September 1971 and I spoke about eggs. At that time I warned the Senate of the problems the egg industry was facing because of overproduction. We have had that problem ever since. I must point out that I am not now engaged in the egg industry but I take a great interest in it. Egg producers and their organisation have made a determined effort to bring about some stability in the industry so that we do not have a large surplus of eggs. A large surplus does not do anybody any good. It does not bring cheaper eggs to the consumer and it does not bring a decent living to the producer. I will quote only a few of the words from my maiden speech in 1971:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For years past poultry farmers through their organisations have acquainted all State Ministers of Agriculture with this problem-</PARA>

Unfortunately, however, the powers that be, the great monopolies, are now beginning to get another grip on the industry, endeavouring to force out the family farmer. Many senators who sit opposite say that members of the Australian Labor Party have no concern with the primary producers, particularly family farmers. If they were prepared to read Hansard, they would see that that is not true. Because of our policies we continually support them, and not only in this Parliament. We fully support the family farmer and the small producer, as against the monopoly farmer, and the Rundle Street farmer, the Pitt Street farmer and the Collins Street farmer. We have no sympathy for them and we have expressed that view many times in this Parliament, but we are misrepresented by the National Country Party and the Liberal Party on every occasion when it comes to election time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Even 11 years ago, I had incorporated in Hansard an answer that I received to a question of mine from Senator Drake-Brockman when he was a member of this Parliament. Referring to his answer, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> It can be clearly seen that it is the Victorian Minister of Agriculture alone who is preventing this plan of controlled production being put to the poultry farmers by way of a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA> What sort of society are we living in when the pigheadedness of one man can put a nationwide industry in jeopardy?</PARA>
<PARA>That is the problem with which we are faced in the egg industry, and that is the problem that Mr Adermann was faced with as Minister for Primary Industry in a Menzies Government. He could not get the consensus of all the State agricultural Ministers in Australia. It is sad to say that at that time with the CEMA plan the person who was at odds with Mr Adermann was Mr David Brookman, who was the Minister of Agriculture in South Australia. He would not agree with Mr Adermann because Mr Adermann had suggested that he would not implement the legislation passed by both Houses of this Parliament until all State agriculture Ministers agreed. David Brookman would not agree. But when we got a change of government in 1965, Mr Bywaters, who lived in the same town as I did and was well conversant with problems of the poultry industry, readily agreed. So the legislation was implemented, and we have gone on from there. But unfortunately, what happened? Gabe Bywaters got the blame for the introduction of the legislation. It was thought that it was Labor legislation, not Liberal legislation. He lost his seat in 1968, and we lost a Labor government in South Australia because we were trying to protect poultry producers. They have regretted it ever since. It is often said that Gabe Bywaters was the best Minister of Agriculture that South Australia ever had. Many of the people who voted him out of office because he did away with their free trade over the border have regretted it ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that I have put my case. I have expressed my concern and that of the many people in the poultry industry who have contacted me, that, if governments do not take some consideration and cognisance of what we are saying we shall fall back into the problems that we experienced in the early 1960s-chaos in the egg marketing industry. I sound this warning tonight to all governments, not only this Government but the State governments, particularly the Victorian Government, which I hope will not be re-elected: Do not do anything drastic that will take away the livelihood of the family egg producer and, in particular, take away the good quality egg which the consumer is now receiving. As Senator Walsh, who led for the Opposition on these Bills, said, we support the legislation with the warning that, if due consideration is not given to overproduction and if production gets out of hand, there is a possibility that the egg producers, instead of having to find $145,000 in the next 12 months as an egg export levy as envisaged in this legislation, will have to find double or treble that amount. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1982 and the Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Collection Bill 1982 are identical in purpose to the three groups of Bills which have just been passed. Their purpose is to impose and collect an inspection levy or fee for inspecting exports which fee is designed to cover half the actual costs of providing the export inspection service. I understand that Senator Peter Rae or someone from the Government side will be moving at the conclusion of the second reading debate that these two Bills be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for investigation and report by the middle of the year or thereabouts. This investigation is regarded as something of a test case for the inspection services, in this area to see whether the Senate Committee can detect areas in which improvements in efficiency and reductions in cost are attainable. If the Committee should be so persuaded in respect of honey inspection services I would expect a more wide ranging investigation by the Finance and Government Operations Committee of other inspection services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been claimed to me, and I think to other members of parliament, that the proposed charge which is in excess of $6 a tonne for honey is excessive when viewed against charges for other perishable commodities such as dairy products, which I think will have a levy of about $2.50 a tonne. I do not accept that it necessarily follows that a charge is excessive because it is 2 1/2 times the charge imposed on some other product. The basis of levying these charges is not the perishability of the product or the value of the product; the basis on which the charges are levied is one of cost. One may or may not disagree with that being an appropriate basis for determining the charges but the cost of providing a service does not necessarily bear any relation to the value of the product or to the quantity of the product being inspected. That is one of the matters which I would expect the Committee ultimately will take into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been alleged that in some specific instances, which I will not go into now, there are identifiable instances of inefficiency on the part of the Department of Primary Industry inspection services with respect to honey inspection. I do not propose to detail those allegations now, much less pass judgment on their validity or otherwise. That is a matter for the Committee to investigate at the appropriate time. The Opposition will not be opposing the second readings of the Bills and will support the motion to refer them to the Finance and Government Operations Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a relatively small group of primary producers, the honey producers and beekeepers certainly have done their homework as far as the honey inspection charge legislation is concerned. I have had a considerable number of calls and messages not only from Tasmania but also from a variety of places around Australia. The industry is facing a fairly difficult period. Apparently this is mainly as a result of very heavy sales of honey from China, which has brought down the price by probably $200 a tonne on an Australian average. The situation in relation to international markets is quite difficult as supply is high. The industry has had a lot of difficulty trying to cope with varying Australian exchange rates. It has suffered enormous problems with shipping and the markets have varied considerably from place to place. The honey producers make up a relatively small group and as far as shipping is concerned unfortunately they get treated that way, particularly in comparison with the producers of larger items of primary produce such as wool and meat or of minerals and things of that nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian honey is of a very high quality and the inspection service has been able to maintain that. But the markets that the honey producers have been shipping to have been very difficult because of the unreliability of being able to get their product into the right place at the right time. In many cases the markets have been lost because of the unreliability of shipping. Beekeeping is carried on right throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will hold up the Parliament for only 3 1/2 minutes. I refer to Administrative Bulletin 82/10 issued on Paddy's Day, 17 March 1982. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>STAFF ACCESS TO NON-MEMBERS' BAR. </PARA>
<PARA>I think my remarks are more properly directed to you, Mr President, than to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Peter Baume). The Bulletin continues:</PARA>
<PARA> All staff are reminded that access to the non-Members' bar is prohibited during working hours. This means that the non-Members' bar is not to be frequented by a House of Representatives staff member--</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that this applies also to Senate staff members-</PARA>
<PARA>from the time of commencing duty to the time of ceasing duty, excluding the staff member's recognised lunch and dinner periods. </PARA>
<PARA>It is signed by I. C. Harris, who is the Operations Manager. I consider this to be an infringement of civil liberties because, in a properly run establishment, there ought to be provision for morning and afternoon teas. There are people on shift work. An arbitrary sort of statement like this takes away the rights of people to be able to do what they want in their own time. I assume that you, Mr President, will issue a similar order saying that senators of this chamber and members of the other place will not be allowed to enter the members' bar except during the lunch and dinner breaks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, senators and members, including the President. It will mean that other people working in this place will not be allowed to have access to the non-members' bar. This matter was raised with me, incidentally, by an absolute teetotaller. He does have an addiction to Coca Cola and likes to go and get a can of Coke during his morning tea breaks. I recall something of this kind happening years ago when I worked in a trade. My then 4* year old daughter had been admitted to hospital with an acute appendix problem and was operated on. I remember going to my then boss and saying: 'Can I ring the hospital to see how my little daughter is during morning tea?' He said: 'No way. You cannot use an office phone'. I said: 'I am prepared to pay for the use of the office phone', which in those days cost four or five pence. He said: 'No way'. This meant I had to run approximately half a mile to a public call box to ring the hospital and be back on time, otherwise I would have been sacked. I assume that the penalty in this case will be dismissal if any infringement of the direction occurs. I was able to make the phone call to discover that my daughter was progressing favourably. I came back and was very abusive to the boss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, I hope that you will have a look at the situation and see that such a dictatorial order is not issued to staff working either on this side of the Parliament or in the other place. If this is carried to a logical conclusion I suggest that the same rule apply to all members of the Senate and all members of the House of Representatives and to their staff, including their highly paid private secretaries. Perhaps this rule can apply also so that newspapers will not allow journalists to go for a drink and write stories for their papers. This is an infringement of civil liberties. I do not think this sort of order should be issued. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to two decisions which have been made in recent times by the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority which have had an impact on the community. The first was a decision last year to increase the price of letting school halls and facilities to community groups. It has been the practice in this community for some 20 years or more to encourage groups to use the school halls and not to seek to have other community facilities built. This has worked very well until just recently. The decision to increase the hire of school halls is a decision which was probably made quite reasonably within the context of the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority. The Authority's primary function, of course, is to run the school system and to see that its funds are devoted towards that end. But the increased cost of using school halls for community purposes has had a quite serious impact on a number of groups. I mention just one. The Canberra marching girls used to meet at Lyneham primary school twice a week, on each occasion for three hours. That group paid $7 a session-$14 a week. The new price is $5 per hour which means that the group has to pay $15 per session or $30 per week. As I say, from the Schools Authority point of view that is perhaps a defensible decision, but given that we do not have the same number of old institutes, old church halls and buildings of that nature in this city people have become used to using school halls and this change has imposed a hardship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other decision was to rationalise the use of school buildings to try to get more groups to use one school and then not use another. This decision also has upset a number of groups. It is not really desirable to have, for example, young boy scouts travelling on their bikes from one suburb to another in a way that some are now being asked to do. Certainly the Schools Authority is working on refinements of this arrangement but there really has been a serious change in direction in the way the community has been asked to use schools in the past. The same situation does not exist in any State. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a document which I have had prepared. It sets out the arrangements for the hire and use of school buildings in each State. I will not refer to that document in any detail; I think it speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>STATE EDUCATION DEPARTMENTAL POLICY ON THE USE OF SCHOOL FACILITIES BY COMMUNITY GROUPS</PARA>
<PARA>NEW SOUTH WALES</PARA>
<PARA> Information supplied by Public Relations Section, N.S.W. Education Department. </PARA>
<PARA> School buildings and grounds are available for use by community groups provided that:</PARA>
<PARA> the work of the school is not interfered with</PARA>
<PARA> the community groups agree to respect and maintain the school facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision in each case is made by the school principal. </PARA>
<PARA> Nominal fees for use may be determined by the school principal or school council, however, some groups are exempt from paying fees, e.g.:</PARA>
<PARA> groups approved by the Minister for Education, e.g., Board of Adult Education, TAFE, or other groups associated with the Minister's portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> meetings of parents' groups. </PARA>
<PARA> functions involving pupils of the school. </PARA>
<PARA> cultural and education functions where there is no admission charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Boy Scouts, Girl Guides. </PARA>
<PARA>VICTORIA</PARA>
<PARA> Information supplied by Buildings Section, Victorian Education Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of school buildings by community groups is actively encouraged by the Department. The decision concerning such use is made by the school principal and the school council. It is left to the school principal and the school council to determine whether fees will be charged. If charges are made, they are merely to cover the costs of maintenance, electricity charges, et cetera. There are no groups that are automatically exempt from charges. </PARA>
<PARA>SOUTH AUSTRALIA</PARA>
<PARA> Information supplied by the Regulations Clerk, South Australian Dept of Education. </PARA>
<PARA> The school council and school principal (as an ex officio member of school council) determine all aspects of hiring of school facilities. The Education Department used to specify minimum and maximum hiring rates, however from 1 June 1981 all school councils now have greater discretion to determine hiring charges . In some circumstances, school councils may waive the payment of fees. From 1 October 1982 any groups hiring school facilities will be required to enter into formal agreements with the school council indemnifying the Minister for Education against damages to the value of $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> Automatic exemptions from hiring charges exist for four groups: election purposes, religious organisations, Family Life Movement and ethnic groups conducting classes in language and culture. </PARA>
<PARA>QUEENSLAND</PARA>
<PARA> Information supplied by Chief Clerk, Administrative Services Section, Queensland Education Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department encourages the use of school facilities by community groups. The decision concerning use is made by the school principal. </PARA>
<PARA> A nominal deposit of $5 (which is returnable) is required to cover cleaning costs. This amount can be varied by the principal. In cases where school facilities have been provided under subsidy, the P &amp; C Association may ask for a donation from the group hiring those facilities. There is no policing of such practices by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>WESTERN AUSTRALIA</PARA>
<PARA> Information supplied by Building Services Section, Western Australian Department of Education. </PARA>
<PARA> Hiring arrangements are determined by the school principal. Charges are not made for irregular use of facilities or for groups such as Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> If the principal wishes to charge for the regular use of facilities, those charges are determined by the school and not by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>TASMANIA</PARA>
<PARA> Information supplied by Assistant Director-General, Tasmanian Education Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department encourages the use of school facilities by community groups. In each case, use of facilities is negotiated between the group and the school principal. </PARA>
<PARA> A nominal charge (of $2 or $3) is prescribed by the Department, however it is levied at the discretion of the principal. </PARA>
<PARA> Groups automatically exempted from this charge are:</PARA>
<PARA> any school group</PARA>
<PARA> any group under the umbrella of the Department, e.g. Adult Education Board</PARA>
<PARA> groups using the facilities for educational purposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may well be, of course, that there needs to be some rationalisation of the use of and the paying for community services. It well may be also that community funds should be used in some respects for this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other matter to which I wish to refer to emphasise what I regard as the reasonableness of the case I am presenting somewhat briefly is part of last year's Budget Speech. I will not read the whole paragraph. However, the Treasurer (Mr Howard), referring to an increase in stamp duties in the Australian Capital Territory, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have decided to bring the range and levels of Australian Capital Territory stamp duties more into line with those of the States. </PARA>
<PARA>I would ask that the use and hire of school buildings in the Australian Capital Territory be brought more into line with the practice adoted in the States. </PARA>

<PARA> (11) The Commonwealth would share, equally with the authority accepting ownership, the cost of approved maintenance and operation of facilities. Expected annual costs to each the Commonwealth and the local owner would be in the order of $150,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) The authority accepting ownership would be responsible for staff required to manage and operate the airport facilities transferred. The Commonwealth would retain responsibility for operational facilities and services such as air traffic control, communication, fire and navigation aids.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) The primary responsibility of the owner is to operate and maintain a licensed aerodrome open to public use in accordance with the Air Navigation Act, Regulations and Orders. The responsibility for costs is set out in answer to questions 11 and 12.

<PARA> (15) Subject to the provision of funds for that purpose by the Parliament, the Government would make grants to the local authority for the whole cost of bringing the aircraft movement area to full standard for current and known future aviation needs and share 50 per cent of cost for any approved terminal building developments. The Commonwealth would also provide grants on a continuing basis for approved airport maintenance and development works on a 50/ 50 basis. The owner receives free transfer of all necessary airport facilities and retains all aerodrome sourced revenues to cover its share of costs.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) The Commonwealth would reimburse the local owner for the full cost of a feasibility study into the introduction of ALOP at Alice Springs Airport. My Department would need to advise on and review the study brief in terms of relevance to Alice Springs Airport, technical adequacy and compliance with Commonwealth policy. Disbursement of such funds, of course, is subject to their provision by the Parliament for that purpose.</PARA>

<PARA> (5) The Firefighters' Union (FFU) placed a black ban on the new 9,100 litre appliance in support of a claim that four Airport Firefighters should man and operate this vehicle. The Department of Transport contends that two Airport Firefighters could adequately operate this appliance and that the issue of its manning could not be viewed in isolation from the role of the entire shift complement at the fireground. The Department successfully demonstrated the vehicle to the FFU in all operational configurations with a two-man crew on Friday 12 February.</PARA>
<PARA> In the past, manning principles associated the numbers of firefighters required with the type of vehicle provided that is a minimum number of firefighters was specified as being required for the effective manning and operation of each RFFS vehicle type.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 February 1982 (Hansard, page 14), Senator Peter Rae asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What research work has been undertaken to assess which industries and which areas in Australia will be most adversely affected if the closer economic relations with New Zealand proposals go ahead? If such work has been undertaken , what are the results and will they be made available? If the work has not been undertaken, will the Minister put to his colleague a suggestion that the work should be undertaken before any further discussions take place with New Zealand?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resurces has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with guidelines contained in the Joint Communique issued by the Australian and New Zealand Prime Ministers in Wellington in March 1980, officials on both sides have undertaken a series of studies on methods and detailed arrangements by which the two governments might proceed to implement progressive moves towards a closer trans-Tasman economic relationship (CER).</PARA>
<PARA> A report by officials was presented to the two governments early in 1981. The report contained the basis of possible new trading arrangements, including those for the gradual and progressive elimination of tariffs and quantitative restrictions and measures to ensure fair competition in trans-Tasman trade. The report indicated that officials had established a broad area of common ground. However, as confirmed by the Minister for Trade and Resources in discussions with Prime Minister Muldoon and other New Zealand Ministers in May 1981, differences of view remained in respect of a number of issues which are seen as fundamental to any new agreement. These include the setting of a firm date for the ultimate elimination of quantitative restrictions between the two countries , the future of performance-based export incentives in trans-Tasman trade, the position of dairy products under a CER, and sensitive horticulture issues.</PARA>
<PARA> Officials have continued to study these and other outstanding questions, and as appropriate, consultations have taken place between Australian and New Zealand industry groups including the two dairy industries. Senior officials meetings are to be held in April, as preparation for early Ministerial level negotiations aimed at reaching agreement on a CER package which could then be submitted to the two governments for final decision.</PARA>
<PARA> Several of the issues identified for study by the Prime Ministers reflected recognition of the fact that further liberalisation of trans-Tasman trade could have an unfair adverse impact on certain industries in each country given differences in the nature and extent of agricultural support/stabilisation arrangements, export incentive schemes and tariffs applied against third countries. It was also necessary to take account of such factors in devising possible new trading arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> Any assessment of the potential impact of a CER on Australian industries needs to have regard to features of the trading framework that has evolved under NAFTA. Under existing arrangements, imports from New Zealand enter Australia either free or at very low rates of duty. New Zealand exporters also have the benefit of generous performance-based export incentive arrangements. On the other hand, many Australian exports to New Zealand face duties which are generally higher and are further restricted by import licensing. Under an appropriately structured CER, these and other factors contributing to inequality of trading opportunity and unfair competition would be gradually removed. The proposed new arrangements would have, as their primary purpose, the elimination of imbalances in opportunity confronting Australian producers in trans-Tasman trade.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not expected that any Australian industries would be adversely affected at the outset of a CER. However, over time it could be expected that some rationalisation and restructuring of industry would occur with the removal of trade barriers leading to increased trade and competition between the two countries. However the gradualism inherent in CER mechanisms should ensure that any adjustment pressures in either country can be accommodated. Overall, such pressures are unlikely to be of major significance when compared with those occurring within the domestic economy and as a result of Australia's trade with the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that consultations with State governments and interested industry oranisations have been held at key stages in the CER exercise. The Government is committed to making public the proposed new arrangements and consulting fully with interested parties before final decisions are taken.</PARA>
