<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 16 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That all members of the Women's Services 1939-45 War qualify as ''Australian Soldier'' under the Defence Service Homes Act for loans because on voluntarily joining the Australian Forces they took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies making themselves available for combat duty in War Zones, and according to Acts and Regulations of the period the Military women had enlisted for service anywhere, some Naval women to sail in any waters, with all servicewomen available for service in Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA> As those members of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force of 1939-45 War who were not sent to War Zones are granted loans, refusal to grant eligibility to all ex-servicewomen of 1939- 45 War is unjust and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that you amend the Defence Service Homes Act by repealing Sub-section 4 (2A) (b) (c) (d) of the Principal Act as amended by No. 137 of 1978, and grant eligibility to all members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, and the Voluntary Aid Detachment of 1939-45 War.</PARA>

<PARA> That:</PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian and Australian National Railways systems were intended to provide essential transport services to country, semi-isolated and isolated regions;</PARA>
<PARA> Australian National Railways' large increases in freight and parcel rates are forcing people to use Australia Post and road transport services;</PARA>

<PARA> At the direction of the Federal Government, the Australian National Railways Commission is destroying country rail services in South Australia;</PARA>

<PARA>To the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That it is clearly apparent that Australian society is becoming more polarised- that the rich at home and abroad are becoming richer, profiting from Australia's mineral wealth, whilst pensioners and the disadvantaged, some three million people, are becoming a race apart.</PARA>
<PARA> That, of necessity, the Federal government take action that all Australians share the wealth of their country by the transfer of resources to income security, health care and housing therefore, your petitioners urge that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. All pension and benefits be raised to at least 30 per cent of the national average male earnings seasonally adjusted.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Removal of the means/income test on the pensioner health benefit imposed by Federal legislation 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> Reintroduction of Medibank; in so doing restore all Australians to equality of citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To alleviate Australia's shortage of housing stock within the capacity of people to pay (rental and ownership) the Federal Government immediately inject $ 200 million into State housing authorities, which will, in addition, alleviate unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-1979 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as happened with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That, if the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty year leases, they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests.</PARA>
<PARA> That, on past evidence, these interests will clearly have the full backing of the Queensland Government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the constitutional power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your petitioners' sincere belief that it has already failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Aboriginal people of Queensland have stated that they want land rights and self-management.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should make use of its constitutional and legislative powers to grant full land rights and self-management to the Aboriginal people of Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA> Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> Governmental deregulation of interest rates and the resultant competition for investors' funds is against the national interest. It is inflationary and penetrates every sphere of the economy. It is an intolerable burden on first home buyers and individuals or families already in possession of a mortgage. Constantly increasing interest rates have a staggering effect on the future budgetary planning of these people. Those most affected are, of course, the poor , but recent increases have hit even the middle income earner. Ordinary Australians should not be forced to pay for the excessive profits announced regularly by financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should pass an Act amending the Banking Act (1959), providing that increases in the rate of interest be limited to 1 per cent per annum, and that any increases above that amount be made subject to the approval of both Houses of Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Australian Broadcasting Commission (generally known as the ABC), because of the method by which its Commissioners are appointed, is constantly in danger of becoming a mouthpiece for the Government of the day, rather than a national broadcasting organization providing unbiased, independent information, education and entertainment to all Australians, and that the independence of the ABC is currently being threatened by two proposals of the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission.

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That the Minatome uranium deposit at Ben Lomond, near Charters Towers, exists within hydrologically unstable ground in a region of intense seasonal rainfall and is generally regarded as uneconomical and unsafe.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The rationale behind the Government's intention to reduce expenditure as far as possible is, of course, to reduce the deficit, thereby taking the pressure off loan borrowing in the community and thus to take pressure off interest rates. I would think that this would have the support of all Australians. I understand that a misunderstanding took place about a memorandum and a wrong conclusion was drawn. I understand that the particular cuts to which Senator Button has referred were not intended in any of the areas mentioned. I am not aware of what has happened regarding the Government Information Unit. It is one of the most economic units in terms of cost of any government in Australia. It is many times smaller than that which is led by the Government headed by the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Wran, and it is much smaller than that which the previous Whitlam Government operated.

Can Victoria and the Snowy Mountains Scheme continue to prop up New South Wales in winter and avoid major blackouts? Can the Minister confirm that although the Liddell generator plant supplies 10 per cent of New South Wales capacity, it will not be in use again before June or July of this year and that because of continuing industrial disputes in that State it may be considerably later? Will the Minister comment on whether there is any risk to the Australian Capital Territory of blackouts this winter?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="72" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can fully understand Senator Reid's concern that with heavy reliance upon New South Wales power generation Australian Capital Territory residents could be at risk in the winter months. As to the supply of electricity, the daily consumption for New South Wales is at present in the order of 100 gigawatt hours, of which Victoria is supplying around 10 per cent and the Snowy Mountains Scheme between 5 per cent and 15 per cent. In effect, up to 20 per cent of New South Wales power has been coming from the Snowy and Victoria. It is true that the Premier of New South Wales has indicated that he will largely forgo the maintenance that normally takes place in power stations in summer time. It is very valid to maintain them in summer time because they are used heavily in winter time. The Premier has indicated that he will forgo it so as not to draw down further on water in summer time. Already the draw-down on water on the Snowy is such that there will be a discounted amount for winter time as that is the ordinary agreement. So there is, in fact, some risk. The Australian Capital Territory has an entitlement of 670 gigawatt hours per year from the Snowy. Last year's total consumption was 1,558 gigawatt hours. Therefore, 57 per cent was provided by New South Wales under contract. The sad fact of the matter is that the installed capacity of electric power in New South Wales well exceeds what the normal demand should be. Indeed, over the last five years or more, the installed capacity has been some 30 per cent in excess of demand. So the problem is not installed capacity; it lies at the heart of maintenance and operational practices, and therefore it lies at the heart of mismanagement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Incidentally, when Mr Wran was asked what was the cause, he said that he really did not know. The Premier is on record as saying that. Liddell, in fact, has four 500 megawatt units.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was asked about the capacity of Liddell power station. It has a total installed capacity of 2,000 megawatts, that is, four units of 500 megawatts. Three of the four units have been broken down. To put it in perspective, Liddell represents almost one-quarter of the total installed capacity of New South Wales of some 8,300 megawatts, from memory, excluding the amount supplied by the Snowy. As I understand it, set No. 2 at Liddell will be back in March, set No. 3 will be back in June and set No. 4 will be back in July . Each are of 500 megawatts. If indeed that is achieved the people of that State and of the Australian Capital Territory will be in some peril with regard to their electric power for winter.

Is the Minister aware that this decision to boost military aid follows widespread reports of a sickening massacre by Salvadorean troops last December in Morozan Province where reliable sources have estimated that up to 1,000 people were systematically slaughtered by the military and that even United States spokesmen concede that many civilians were killed? Is this consistent with the philosophy of some United States hawks that 'the head of the junta is a rotten son-of-a-bitch but at least he is our son-of-a-bitch'? In the light of this information, which is merely the latest well-documented report of atrocities committed by the military government against civilians, will the Minister bring pressure to bear on the United States to reverse its decision to send more military aid to El Salvador and to allow the people of that country to resolve their own problems in as peaceful a fashion as possible?</PARA></TALK.START>

He was a person with very considerable knowledge of foreign affairs and, happily, an independent mind. I now direct myself to the question. As to the latter part, the Government of El Salvador has announced its intention to hold elections for a constituent assembly on 28 March . The Australian Government hopes the elections will contribute in due course to a process of peaceful political settlement and reconciliation in El Salvador. The declared intention of the armed left wing guerrilla groups to disrupt the elections is to be deplored. That must be kept in mind. Although El Salvador is far removed from Australia the loss of life and the extent of human suffering there, which Senator Chipp has spoken about, continue to be of very deep concern to the Australian Government. The Government of the United States of America has taken its stand on El Salvador in the face of evidence of external support for left wing guerrilla movements operating inside the country. The Australian Government fully understands why the United States should view these developments so close to home with such deep misgivings. The United States has a long-standing interest and role in Central America, a region of direct strategic concern for it.</PARA></TALK.START>

The anti-American philosophy of a left wing socialist party comes through very strongly indeed. The fact is that the misgivings in the United States have been heightened by the continued external support for left wing guerrilla groups that have caused the Government of El Salvador to request further military aid. At the same time the Australian Government has noted also that the United States Government has underlined the importance of economic and social reform in El Salvador and has given over $126m in non-military economic aid during the last year. That ought to be taken into consideration. I do not say this in response to Senator Chipp, because his question was a serious one, but I say that it is a great pity that the Australian Labor Party tends always to side with left wing radicals instead of looking at the picture in the wider scene.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like other senators, I am aware of the importance which the new animal quarantine facility will have for Australia and for a whole range of activities in relation to our own quarantine precautions. I am aware also that Mr Wilson, the Minister whom I represent, recently had discussions with the Cocos community in which the matter of self-determination was raised. The Minister has indicated to the islanders that they should choose the time at which this self-determination or independence should take place. They have yet to make a decision as to when that time should be. The choices that are available to the islanders seem to be integration with Australia-if that happened there would be no problem in the matter which Senator Thomas has raised -they may decide to enter into a state of free association with Australia, or they may decide to become completely independent. It is up to the islanders to decide what they wish and to set some time. The Australian Government has told the United Nations that it will arrange for the act of determination to take place when requested. I am quite certain that whatever outcome flows from that act of determination, it will be the desire of the Australian Government to ensure that the animal quarantine facility continues to be available. Whichever of those options is chosen I am sure that appropriate arrangements will be made with the Cocos islanders to ensure that we still have access to those facilities .</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we know, the question of crime generally is largely a matter for State laws. Crime by computer has certain technical and sophisticated problems associated with it, but essentially it is still a matter for the application of the criminal laws as they exist at present. The Commonwealth's responsibility is limited to the Australian Capital Territory and matters involving computers that perhaps should be operated by the Commonwealth, or the use of computers to defraud the Commonwealth. There have not been many cases involving breaches of the criminal law by the use of computers operated by the Commonwealth, although I understand that there have been some convictions. So it is certainly not beyond the capacity of the criminal law or the potential of the present criminal investigators to cope with this problem. So far as I am aware, at the moment there are no deficiencies in the Crimes Act which would require a special amendment to cope with this problem. The Senate will recall that during the last session of the Parliament I proposed a number of amendments to the Crimes Act, so we do keep a very close eye on it. If any such deficiencies are pointed up, of course we would seek to take steps to provide for them. As far as criminal investigation and law enforcement are concerned, those are matters for the Australian Federal Police, who I understand have some special training in regard to the possibility of computer crime.

He indicated that the application for a refund must be made direct to the Commissioner of Taxation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Judging from the nature of the question, I think there is some misinformation in the mind of the honourable senator or in the mind of whoever asked her to gain a response on this matter because certain tax exempt organisations have long been permitted to claim from the Commissioner of Taxation the sales tax component of goods bought at retail price, thus including sales tax in that retail price. On 18 December last year the Treasurer announced an extension of this option to schools, universities, councils and other tax exempt organisations which were not previously included in that exemption. It is to be stressed that this is an option and there is no compulsion on any tax exempt organisation to reclaim sales tax direct from the Commissioner of Taxation. The Treasurer advises that organisations are at complete liberty to adopt or to retain the alternative arrangement under which books or other articles are bought at wholesale price or indented through a retailer from wholesale tax free stocks and invoiced free of sales tax on production of a sales tax exemption certificate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since all schools and other institutes of learning are exempt from sales tax there is no question of the total abolition of sales tax on class 4 and 5 schools.

I understand that Qantas has proposed not only normal economy fares on this route but also a range of lower promotional fares which are comparable with those available to or from points in Australia other than Port Hedland. A promotional fare applicable to round trip travel between Port Hedland and Bali includes a 28 -day excursion fare priced from $420 or 15.6c per kilometre, an individual inclusive tour fare with an air fare component priced from $296 or 11c per kilometre and a group inclusive tour fare priced from $240 or 8.9c per kilometre .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, follows somewhat the question asked by my leader, Senator Button, earlier today. I refer to the directive from the Department of Finance instructing all departments to withdraw travel warrants, cut overtime and reduce purchases of equipment, goods and services. Has the Government received a report , now reportedly more than a year old, that 444 staff members are employed by 28 Federal departments and 47 statutory authorities, whose duties are primarily directed or related to dissemination of information relating to Government functions? Is it not a fact that the sale of the Government's policies by these officers is regarded as unsatisfactory by the Government? Is the Government similarly critical of the Government Information Unit and its failure to sell the Fraser Government and its policies? In view of this large public relations armoury of the Government, what is the purpose of the new proposed information unit under the organisation of the Department of Administrative Services? How can these expensive exercises remain untouched in view of the restraints suggested when all other Government departments are expected to reduce their expenditures between now and the end of the financial year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the report to which Senator Gietzelt has referred. I will ask my colleagues to see whether such a report exists. As to the economy exercised by this Government, as I said, by contrast with the Labor Government and State Labor governments, this Government's expenditure on public information is minute indeed. As to whether we are dissatisfied, let me simply say that the product, as distinct from the public relations, of this Government has been endorsed three times in three elections-in 1975, in 1977 and again in 1980-as being the right product. Therefore, obviously the message of that product has been received and received clearly by the electors. On the other hand, both the product and the public relations of the Australian Labor Party have been rejected. The economy in Government staff and Government expenditure is one that permeates the whole of Government spending. It is one that has enabled the people of Australia to look to this Government and say that it is the good manager that they want in government, by contrast with the disaster of the past.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the several years that I have been the Minister responsible we have had under constant review the measures that could be taken to stregthen the safety of the platforms in Bass Strait so that there might not be any danger. The test is one that is described as the necessity for the platforms to be strong enough to resist a 100-year wave; that is, a wave of mammoth proportions that allegedly might come every 100 years. No one should ever be complacent in these matters. The platform involved in the recent disaster off the coast of Canada, however tragic that disaster was, should not be compared with the platforms in Bass Strait. The platform that reversed in Canada operated from a semi-submersible drilling ship which, although claimed to be unsinkable, did not have the kind of anchorages that permanent platforms have . The platforms in Bass Strait have an underpinning through their legs going 250 feet into the ground, pinning them down. In more recent times extra strengthening has taken place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Attorney-General, although I fear that Senator Messner, as the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, might feel obliged to answer it. Has the Minister seen the reports of the decision yesterday by the Queensland Supreme Court in the Pine Vale case, drastically reducing the investigative powers of the National Companies and Securities Commission and making a nonsense of the practical operation of the takeover code? Does the Minister agree, following the extraordinarily narrow and technical interpretation of Mr Justic Sheahan in this case and the equally narrow and unadventurous decision of Mr Justic Needham in the Industrial Equity Ltd case last December, that there is a need for urgent amendment of the legislation and an urgent meeting of the Ministerial Council to set that in train? In particular, will the Commonwealth propose the insertion in the relevant legislation, not only of specific remedial provisions but also a provision along the lines of section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act, requiring the courts to have regard to the manifest purpose of the legislation? Finally, has this course of events concentrated at all the mind of the Government any more clearly on the utility and virtue of unilateral Commonwealth legislation in this field, rather than having to rely on the cumbersome and disjointed procedures of the present co-operative scheme?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, the Government is studying as a matter of urgency the decision that was handed down by Mr Justice Sheahan yesterday. Senator Evans asked whether the Government sees virtue in swapping to some other kind of system which he has advocated in this place for some time. I point out to him that it appears from the Press reports on this matter which have been available to the Government in the last day or two that the problems which he envisages will be overcome when the companies code comes into operation on 1 July this year. That is because the Ministerial Council, at its meeting on 12 February this year, decided to insert a provision into the companies code along the lines of section 13 of the securities industries code. I understand the new provision will be contained in a statute law revision Bill of 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regarding the other matter, IEL and the acquisition of those shares in the Huttons Ltd case, I believe that acquisition occurred before 1 July 1981 and consequently the share acquisition code which came into force after that date would not have applied at that time. So on both the points which Senator Evans has sought to make in his question, regarding the effectiveness of the operation of both the takeover code and the companies code which is yet to come into force , his argument falls to the ground.</PARA>

Of course I realise that that figure may now be somewhat higher. Now that Telecom has decided to increase public telephone calls to 20 cents, will this mean that Telecom will re-examine the number of public telephones that are installed and consequently install many more so that those people who are without a private telephone will have a public telephone more easily available to them? Will Telecom convert most telephones to take 50 cent pieces as well as 20 cent pieces so that people who make subscriber trunk dialling calls, long distance calls, will not get arm ache from putting the 20 cent coins in? Finally, will Telecom convert as many public telephones as possible to the international subscriber dialling system so that people without that service available to them at home will have it available at public telephones?</PARA></TALK.START>

The first three questions that he raises are matters of policy which will have to go to the Minister. I think we have to ask whether the $1,100 requires updating since 1979 in light of price changes. We would have to find out from the Minister what the effect of the new tariffs to which Senator Townley refers will be on the whole economy of putting in public telephones, what effect that will have upon the policy of provision and whether it will mean a capacity to put more telephones in.

In other words, the changes have taken into account changes in the cost of living over that period. It is also true that in the initial part of the three year period to which the honourable senator referred there were changes in excess of the CPI . That is certainly true. If we look at the percentage figures and relate them not to the CPI but to average weekly earnings and look at the figures over the period of the 1970s we find that there was a considerable increase in terms of percentage of average weekly earnings from the early part of the 1970s to 1975. The figure has remained roughly constant until the very recent spurt in wages. I will produce those figures also for the honourable senator.

That was a triumph, I would take it in the honourable senator's terms, of co-operation between Federal and State governments!

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It said it very early in the piece. It might not write that now; it said it some time ago. I refer the Senate to the sort of things which were being said about new federalism in 1976. In April 1976, for example, Senator Carrick said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The basic principle of federalism is that the people know best and that it is a good thing to bring government as close to the people as possible, to consult them, to invite them to express their views . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I agree that this is an impeccable statement. He went on to say in the same month in 1976:</PARA>
<PARA>It is fundamental to federalism that there should be teamwork, a working dialogue, in all three spheres. It is fundamental that the Commonwealth should be inviting the States and local government to co-operate in economic management . </PARA>
<PARA>The new federalism was promoted in those sorts of terms. There was lot of rhetoric about an end to centralism, for example, in fiscal policy. Senator Carrick said, again in 1976:</PARA>
<PARA>We have said that centralism is a foul thing, that it corrupts government, that it destroys the sovereignty of the States and others and that is bad. </PARA>
<PARA>Since that period of high-flown rhetoric when attacks on centralism were regarded as good political mileage a lot of rhetoric has flowed under the bridge . It was quite clear that, according to the Government in 1976, new federalism was going to provide a barrier against centralist authoritarian control. In 1976 , in an official Government statement, it was said:</PARA>
<PARA>We must restructure our forms and institutions of government and our attitudes of mind to achieve co-operation not conflict, partnership and not domination. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of that sort of statement the shoddy exercise at last year's Premiers Conference draws a dramatic illustration of how those high-flown attitudes of mind have been debased by this Government. They were high-flown attitudes of mind. I personally have a high regard for many of the principles underlying the notion of new federalism. There is a lot to be said for them in terms of good government. The fact that they have failed is an indictment of bad government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is six years later now and we can see what a farce this policy has been. It is an additional failure, a sham and a classic example of this Government's capacity to say one thing and to do another. The history of new federalism has been a record of unfulfilled promises and empty undertakings. After six years of new federalism it is clear that the only change that has taken place is that the Commonwealth's grip over State finances has, in fact, strengthened. Conflict rather than co-operation, domination rather than partnership, continue to characterise Commonwealth-State relations while competition and self-interest are the distinguishing features of interstate relations. That is not just an indictment of the Fraser Government; of course, State governments are involved in that process as well. The States, far from becoming more responsible and accountable in fiscal matters, have had to rely more and more on Commonwealth financial assistance. As Professor Mathews said in his recent paper:</PARA>
<PARA>After six years of the new arrangements it has become clear that they have not significantly changed the basis of intergovernmental financial arrangements in Australia, except in the direction of strengthening the Commonwealth's control over State functions. </PARA>
<PARA>Consultation with the States on fiscal policy has become a joke. The Commonwealth has continued to make unilateral decisions about the shared revenue base and the structure of Commonwealth taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recording this ill-fated policy and the stages of it as it has whimpered to an end. The so-called new arrangements were based on 35 points of understanding which were agreed at three Premiers Conferences in 1976. they included promises to keep the States informed of changes to their tax entitlements and to institute a periodical review of the tax-sharing arrangements. A major review was to take place in 1981. What happened to all these laudable but insincere promises? During the first four years the States simply got what they were guaranteed under the old formula, the so-called Whitlam formula. The only guarantee for 1981-82 was that the States' tax grants would be less in absolute terms than in the previous years. Given the rate of inflation this means only that the States would get less money. The so-called review of the tax-sharing arrangements in 1981 simply took the shape of a unilateral declaration by the present government that new and drastic arrangements were to take place in tax-sharing arrangements. There was not even a pretence of consultation, not even a pretence of new federalism co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the so-called razor gang-the Government's completely discredited stunt of a year ago-is another grand example of the failure of the Government to consult with the States as it professed to do. I will, of course, refer to Professor Mathews a lot because he is one of the most reputabe commentators and most informed academics on Federal-State relations. He said about the razor gang :</PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of the Review of Commonwealth Functions seemed to be concerned not with improving efficiency in government but rather with reducing the Commonwealth Budget deficit by shifting expenditure responsibilities to the States or by disposing of Commonwealth property and activities to private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>It was not concerned, as he said, with efficiency in government. As we have often described it, it is a cosmetic exercise designed to achieve anything but efficiency in government. It is quite clear now that the States have had a raw deal out of the so-called new federalism. Even those premiers who enthusiastically embraced the new arrangements in 1976-some of them being slow thinkers, I suspect-in the mistaken belief that they would be better off have found that they have been victims of a Federal Government trap. On 3 April this year that trap will spring tight round the corpse of Lindsay Thompson in Victoria. He is one of the first victims of the decline in ability to deliver government services because of the consequences of his Government's acquiescence in the new federalism policy. Financially, the States are no better off in real terms. Restraints continue to be imposed upon them by unilateral Commonwealth decree. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give honourable senators some examples about matters upon which the States have been misled. In 1975 the Liberal Party policy speech promised to minimise special purpose payments to States by absorbing them in general purpose grants in order to give the States responsibility for programs. Not a bad idea! But what has happened? The Government has simply cut programs by reducing special purposes grants without allowing tax entitlements to grow to allow States to take over the responsibilities apparently allotted to them. So one has had a significant decline in the delivery of government services because of this action by the Government. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a list of those special purpose payments which have either ceased or been reduced in money terms as a result of the application of government policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The question of State taxes was, of course, fundamental to the new federalism. Fraser federalism or Carrick federalism promised each State the right to impose an income tax surcharge on its people or to give them a rebate. The Fraser Government has shown a total lack of interest in providing any tax room for the States to impose such taxation. There has been no co-operation or consultation on the question of what tax room would be allowed to the States in order to deal with that stage of proposed new federalism to make the States responsible for gathering revenue in respect of their expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The so-called 1981 review was a general review in that year of the tax sharing arrangements. But after that it became hard to find any bits, even of the new federalism, amongst the rubble that was left of the Government's policy on Commonwealth- State relations. If we look hard to see what remained we find that no State henceforth was to receive any less in its tax sharing grant than it received in absolute money terms the previous year. The guarantee does not mean very much. As Professor Mathews put it:</PARA>
<PARA>For 1981-82 there was to be a substantial reduction in the amount which the States would have received under the original personal income tax sharing arrangements, to be affected by arbitrarily increasing total State and Northern Territory tax sharing grants by only 9 per cent when the tax sharing formula would have resulted in an increase of 16.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>That is to say-again I quote-'by arbitrarily acting in the way in which the Commonwealth Government did'. The States, of course, retain the right to impose income tax, a right which is laughable in the face of a tax burden which is already high and inequitably distributed. The Commonwealth retains the right to declare any change in the Commonwealth's tax to be a special surcharge and so excluded from the tax sharing base-a ludicrous and ironic commitment to consultation, a policy which, despite all its statements and all its rhetoric, the Government has never carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser brand of federalism and its architects have duped the Australian people again. It is another example of the Government's giving with the one hand and taking away with the other. A further example is the attitude of this Commonwealth Government to the borrowing programs of the States for the purpose of financing infrastructure development. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole excursion into the new federalism has been an exercise in deception and an illustration of the failure of this Government to develop a rational Commonwealth-State fiscal policy. The features of the present division of fiscal responsibility are clear. Revenue collection is still overwhelmingly in the hands of the Commonwealth. Two-thirds of State government revenue is derived from Commonwealth grants and one-quarter of local government revenue is derived from Commonwealth grants, a situation which compares very unfavourably with the other great federations of the world when one looks at the figures for revenue in the provinces of Canada, and so on. This does not square up with the Government's professed aims of redistributing fiscal responsibility under its federalism policy. What we have in 1982 is a denial of everything that the Government said it was going to do in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> The new federalism policy has basically failed for several reasons. It has failed because of a lack of consultation and co-operation. It has failed because of another monetarist ideological commitment of this Government which expressed itself in the slogan: 'Squeeze the public sector and the private sector will take up the slack'. Of course, what in fact has happened in Commonwealth-State relations is that, sure, the public sector has been squeezed but, like a blancmange, it is the Commonwealth sector which has felt the squeeze, and the State public sector has blown out in the six years of this Government since new federalism came into being. If one looks at the figures-I will seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard-State public services have increased significantly between December 1975 and October 1981 from roughly 885,000 people to 1,012,000 people while the Commonwealth Public Service suffered a slight decline in 1978 and has increased slightly only in October 1981. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the other ideological strain which the new federalism ran into was the Government's commitment to monetarism. As Professor Mathews puts it again:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It has used its centralised financing powers to return to the thoroughly discredited policies of the great depression, involving acceptance of high levels of unemployment at the same time as urgent capital works are deferred for lack of funds. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is a situation which profoundly affects the States. In my State of Victoria, for example, the hospitals are broke-a shocking situation for a State government facing an election on 3 April. But who put that Government to the jump? The Fraser Government put it to the jump. It is a mixture of State government incompetence and Fraser Government ideology that has resulted in that situation in Victoria. Similarly, things like school dental services are broke in Victoria. Dental services are being denied to kids in Victoria because of the ramifications of this policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there was concern to reduce the central power of government-a legitimate concern. The Government instead has ensured that it has maintained a tight, centralised, fiscal policy. Confusion reigns because of that as the Government has refused to acknowledge its responsibilities in areas such as health and education and restraints on public spending have resulted in cuts in essential public works and development, and massive unemployment-all of which, of course, affect the States as well. The Government has failed also to pursue a strongminded and rational policy on tax avoidance. This has added to its problems of revenue collection. Again, as Professor Mathews said, if the same enthusiasm were to be shown by the Commonwealth for controlling revenue collections as for controlling government expenditures-about which we heard a bit at Question Time today-higher rates of taxation would be unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> That again is an indictment of this Government's policies in this area. There has been an abandonment of government responsibility in whole areas of social services. There have been political deals with the States rather than a rational and responsible policy of fixed management, the $16m grant to Queensland last year being a classic example of a backdoor deal and not a consistent application of a policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, before developing the argument I think it is essential to clarify a few positions. First of all, Senator Button does not stand here today as a professed federalist who regrets that federalism has not been fully introduced. On the contrary, he stands here as the leader in this chamber of the Labor Party pledged to unqualified centralism. Let us get the thing right from the start. All the crocodile tears about whether a degree of federalism has been achieved are purely that and are being shed in the knowledge of the Loan Council meeting on Friday and with some hopes of some pickings in a Victorian election. But there will be none as we will see in the journey that we take.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To put this matter into true perspective one must first of all look at what was the situation before we introduced new federalism because one would think that what has happened now, rather than being an improvement, is some sort of disaster. I have quoted before in this place a very revered ex-Premier, a Labor Premier, Mr Dunstan. I will now use his words to describe for us in this place what the position was under the Whitlam Labor Government in terms of its policies of relationships with the States. Mr Dunstan addressed the State Convention of the Australian Labor Party on 16 June 1974 and he said this:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . the Federal Government's policy-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Whitlam Government's policy-</PARA>
<PARA>was forcing State Governments into regressive tax measures. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Centralised decision-making from Canberra could spell 'disaster' for industries and workers in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Difficult though it may be to apply still further increases in the fields of State taxes, we will be forced again this year to levy additional revenues to finance services of an adequate standard. </PARA>
<PARA>He then said that a week before Mr Whitlam had informed him that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . South Australia would get no more money than was prescribed in the tax reimbursement formula, although plainly it would be insufficient to meet the State's needs. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dunstan said:</PARA>
<PARA>The State has no means of reducing its expenditure markedly from revenue sources . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I want honourable senators to take note of his next words. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it to be essential for the Labor Party to decide in Federal conference that the formula for provision of money to the States from Federal income tax should be an adequate and fixed percentage of income tax revenues to be returned to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>So, in summary what he said was that the Whitlam Government's relations with the States were disastrous, that it was forcing increased regressive taxes on the States, pressurising them, that the States were, in fact, forced to reduce their work and that the solution was to bring in a revenue-sharing system to the States. Mr Whitlam, who was then the leader, had been on public record in two prepared addresses to the nation stating his views. First of all he said-I paraphrase him-that the best thing that any Labor member of a State Parliament could do for Australia was to work for the destruction of that State Parliament. In other words, quite clearly Mr Whitlam said that the State parliaments ought to be destroyed. In another address he went further and said that he saw the abolition of State parliaments in Australia and that there would be one centralised government with great national powers over the economy and some provincial governments. This is the situation against which we start, a situation in which even the Labor Premiers condemned the Whitlam Government, a situation in which, day by day, the papers were full of dog fights between the Premiers and the Whitlam Government. Indeed, the Premiers did much to expose the dangers of the Whitlam Government. Mr Dunstan said that the right solution was revenue sharing on a fixed basis. That is fascinating because it is precisely what this Federal Government has done. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me point out what this new federalism is because there are three or four matters that ought to be kept in mind. Let me take local government as a start. Under the Whitlam Government local government was faced with an enormous squeeze , with great inflation rising to 17 per cent in the March quarter of 1975, and with interest rates rising. Local government in Australia found that even after putting up rates more and more it could do less and less work. Indeed, some local councils were increasing their rates by as much as 30 per cent a year under the Whitlam Government. The important thing is that this so-called government that is now in opposition advocating that we are doing wrong had dealt local government a crippling blow, a reduction in real money, a reduction in real services. What has this Government done under the new federalism? There is a great silence from Senator Button. It has revolutionised local government. For the first time, local government has been brought to the table as an equal of State and Federal government. For the first time, an advisory council for intergovernmental relations has been set up-</PARA>

Indeed, if anyone wants to sneer let them go to a local government conference and knock it. I tell Senator Button and Senator Walsh, who are now sneering, that local government regards this as one of the great breakthroughs in reform for local government in Australia. Furthermore, whereas local government was bedevilled by tied grants before the Federal Government introduced a system of revenue sharing for local government, it now gets 2 per cent of Commonwealth revenue untied. What has happened is that local government has been freed from the tied grants of the Whitlam Labor Government and has been able, under our administration, to modify and mitigate its rates and to get on with its programs.</PARA></TALK.START>

Would Senator Button have the strictures imposed on local government that were imposed upon them under the Whitlam Administration or local government as it is today? Ask local government that. The rhetoric of Senator Button regarding State governments was very interesting. He said that the States had had a raw deal, that they had been squeezed. He said, quite rightly, that the States had in fact been able to increase the number of their public servants by over a hundred thousand while the Commonwealth had reduced its number of public servants by in the order of 10,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the figures are in that order of proportion. The numbers may be more than that. The fact is that Senator Button said that there was a demonstration of a squeeze. In the first five years of the Fraser Government every State government in this country was able, year by year, to introduce and to implement major tax cuts and to expand its programs. How was that a squeeze if they had, in fact, more money than they needed and were giving it back to the community? State governments have even abolished probate-a thing that the Federal Labor Party would deplore. After all, Senator Walsh is on record as indicating that he would like to reinstate death duties at the Federal level. A Labor government would want to get at the estates of the dead. Of course it would. But State by State, States were able to reduce taxation and expand their functions. So where was the squeeze? It was said that the States did not have any real powers passed over to them, that this was more a centralisation. I remember very well the debate over days in this place on the off-shore petroleum and mineral legislation. How much we remember that this Government said that, although the powers in that respect had been clearly centralised in Canberra by the High Court, we would voluntarily cede the powers to the States by legislation. The boys who are now crying crocodile tears about federalism were then saying: 'You must not do this. We want to clutch the powers '. They were talking Whitlamism-the best thing that a Labor member of a State parliament can do is to work for the destruction of the State Parliament. Senator Button has the nerve to talk about the Victorian election when his own leader was out to destroy the Victorian State Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about Mr Whitlam. No doubt now honourable senators opposite wish that he had never said these things. No doubt they would like to forget that in Victoria, under a new leader, Labor supporters are nervously saying: 'Let us see whether we can promote Mr Wran as an alternative. Let us have a Wran-type of government in Victoria'. With a Wran-type of government in Victoria there would be twice as many strikes. It would be like New South Wales. As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said, New South Wales is the strike capital of Australia. Almost half of the working days lost in Australia are lost in New South Wales. By any measure the Liberal Government in Victoria is a progressive government. It has a surplus of electric power to expand its industries. It is able to get the New South Wales Government out of its mortgage. Yet here Senator Button is trying to take a quick trick by saying that on 3 April there will be judgment on this situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the situation. We are asked to compare this Government with the three years of Whitlamism, the professed policies of which were to destroy State and local government. It is quite clear from the statements of Mr Whitlam that he did not believe in State governments at all. Local government was forced into penury, as was State government, based upon what Mr Dunstan said. Can honourable senators opposite deny what he said? Was he wrong when he said those things I have quoted? The silence is a beautiful answer. They cannot deny what Mr Dunstan said because they have said that he was the model on this thing. So, he was right when he said that the real solution is tax sharing-a fixed percentage of the tax. What have we done? We have given the States a fixed percentage of the tax. So, one by one we go down this road. Have we given a raw deal to the States ? It was Dunstan who said that the States were getting a raw deal under the Labor Government-the Hayden-Whitlam Government-which was reducing the States' services and putting on regressive taxation so that the States were being strangled. There is a time warp in Senator Button's mind because he described perfectly what happened then. </PARA>
<PARA> He then talked about the squeeze on the States that was happening under this Government. He said that the States were having to take on more and more public servants while we took on fewer but the States, on the other hand, did not have the money. In fact, I have reminded the Parliament that year by year not only did they have the money to do that but they had surplus money. They went from deficit budgeting under Labor to a surplus whereby they could cut taxation. Let us keep a little in mind this question that has been raised about whether we have strangled the States. The suggestion is that we have forced them to do more but not given them more money. I have demonstrated what has happened to the off- shore petroleum legislation. But much more has happened. Many functions have been passed to the States and absorbed and, along with that, an appropriate amount of money-the amount that the Commonwealth has been spending-has been absorbed into the formula so that the States have the money to undertake the functions. Under Labor year by year the percentage of specific purpose grants increased relative to general purpose grants. In other words, under Labor more and more the States were being told: 'Here is your money and you have to do this with it', and less and less were they being told: 'Here is some money untied', until the ratio was almost 50-50. Bit by bit we have reversed that trend until today the general purpose payments to the States constitute 67 per cent of all revenue passed to the States and only 33 per cent of it is tied-a vast reversal of what has happened in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> One would think that Professor Mathews was making an indictment on this matter. What a strange thing for honourable senators opposite to call him their disciple when he is an avowed federalist to his back teeth and they are avowed and professed centralists pledged to have all power in Canberra. Day after day, week after week and year after year they have always said here that it is absolutely wrong for the States to be asked to raise taxes. They are opposed to that. It is worth noting, for instance, that Professor Mathews in his criticisms said that Mr Wran had said that there would be no increase in the rate of any New South Wales tax for the fifth consecutive year and that the States preferred to leave the bulk of their revenue raising to the Commonwealth. First of all, Mr Wran has given the lie to Senator Button's claim of a squeeze. There has been no increase in the rate of any New South Wales tax for the fifth consecutive year and yet New South Wales has been able to expand its public service. But the important thing is that Mr Wran said that the States have preferred to leave the bulk of their revenue raising to the Commonwealth. In other words, even though the federalism provisions were given to them, they preferred not to use them. Professor Mathews went on to say that one of the fundamental difficulties was that it appeared that the States either could not or would not exercise their revenue raising powers, although they have the facilities to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a fundamental error of belief in this country, a belief that was engendered by the Whitlam-Hayden Labor Government. That is the belief that the Commonwealth has all the money-it is the rich man-and that the States have no money, they are poor. I want all Australians to get in their minds the simple fact that of all public finance spent in Australia, of all the money taken out of the taxpayers' pockets and spent in Australia, 52 per cent is spent by the States and local government and only 48 per cent is spent by the Commonwealth. So, in fact the Commonwealth is the minority spender of money and the States are the bigger spenders of money. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me knock Senator Button's propositions one by one. What nerve to say that we have not done enough on the journey to federalism when in fact Senator Button and his party are professed centralists. What nerve to say that when in fact the Whitlam Goverment was the greatest centraliser, the greatest distorter of federalism there was. What nerve, in the face of what Mr Dunstan said, to cite figures on the capacity of the States to increase their staff without also citing figures on their capacity to cut taxes and, therefore, revealing their surplus of money over the years. But none of these things are said. How could honourable senators opposite forget this Government's revolutionary and great reforms of local government? We have had a great opportunity to contrast how Hayden, Whitlam and Button did it and how we are doing it, and I know how the public will judge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is appropriate that the Senate should be discussing Commonwealth-State relationships. The matter of public importance before the Senate deals with the failure of new federalism. We are concerned not with going back to 1973, 1974 or 1975 but with making the necessary comparisons between the events that now characterise themselves in Premiers Conferences. This coming Friday the Premiers Conference will be held here in Canberra. We will see another one of the festering sores of the Liberal- National Country Parties performance. We will see again the sort of divisiveness flowing from that Conference, which has been marked by similar instances over the last couple of years. We are, of course, concerned about the unsatisfactory, inequitable and disorganised state of Federal-State financial and other relationships. That is why we believe that we ought to be discussing today the failure of the Fraser Government's federalism policy. It is a policy that originated in the mind of Senator Carrick and was taken on board by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It became a central plank of the Fraser Government 's policy for the 1975 and 1977 elections but, interestingly enough, it was forgotten in the 1980 election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When in Opposition in September 1975 Mr Fraser promised that if he were elected to government he would introduce a new form of Federal-State financial relations . He put this in a rather grandiose setting. He talked about the need to protect individual freedoms and States' rights and the need to provide an effective barrier against authoritarian centralist control. Those are terms with which Senator Carrick regaled us through the years 1975, 1976 particularly and 1977. But he has not done so in more recent times because even he, if he were to look at this matter objectively, would have to say that the federalism policies of the Fraser Government are in tatters. Senator Carrick and Mr Fraser tried to create the impression that this new form of Federal-State financial relations would enable States to be freer of central control than was previously the case. To those ends Mr Fraser proposed, firstly, to give the States a set percentage of income tax for revenue purposes and, secondly, to allow the States to impose an income tax surcharge-in theory to give a rebate. It is interesting that stage 2 of the new federalism policy has never been implemented, largely because of the reluctance and the refusal of the States to become involved in that stage. Mr Fraser in his policy document of September 1975 said that these measures would do the following:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . ensure that the States will have substantially the financial capacity to meet their financial responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, State and local governments, being closer to the people, are involved in the processes of providing services to the people. It was proper in those circumstances, having regard to the wealth of this country, that the States should be increasing their services to the Australian people, because that is what the Australian people want and demand of their State and local authorities. The Prime Minister was clearly saying that the new kind of financial relationships would enable the States to be better able to look after themselves financially than had previously been the case. It has now become clear to all but the most partial observers that the Fraser-Carrick new federalism is a fraud . Under the cover of this highblown rhetoric which we often hear spoken in the Senate by Senator Carrick and in another place by Mr Fraser they have attempted to do three things. They have attempted to shift the responsibility for social programs-that is, programs that benefit the ordinary people-back to the States. They have attempted to force the States to raise their own revenue for programs while cutting back on Commonwealth grants. The much talked about Federal deficit has therefore been transferred to the States. Who can deny that every State government in our Commonwealth today is having difficulty in meeting the services demanded by the citizens in the respective States?</PARA>
<PARA> Through manipulating the Federal-State tax sharing arrangements the Government has sought to control more tightly the economic policies of the State governments. This is the very reverse of the claim it made in 1975. Have we not seen evidence of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister seeking to determine the development programs of the State governments, in particular those of my State of New South Wales? In fact, Mr Fraser's dose of new federalism has neglected areas of social need, eroded the chances for an equitable distribution of taxation, reduced Australian planning and control of resource development-surely that is the responsibility of a national government-fragmented the Australian social and economic scene and driven the State Premiers into firm opposition to the Australian Government and its policies. There is not a Premier anywhere in Australia who is satisfied with the programs imposed upon him by the financial policies of the Fraser Administration. When Mr Fraser first unveiled his new federalism policy, the non-Labor Premiers hailed it, looking forward to, as they said in a joint statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a new era of Commonwealth-State co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that what they are saying today? I think Senator Button referred to them as slow thinkers. I would refer to them as slow learners. It has taken them a number of years to wake up to the problems imposed upon them by the Federal Government. They are coming to the Premiers Conference for another confrontation this Friday. In their most recent Budgets at least two Liberal State governments made clear what they thought of Fraser's new federalism. I must say in relation to my State that the Premier, Mr Wran, was the one who refused to accept the guidelines of the new federalism policy and who said that he would not introduce new taxes as was required under the implementation of stage 2 of that program. What of Mr Tonkin from South Australia? He provides one example of his thinking in his 1981-82 Budget statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Budget for 1981-82 shows an increase of only 8 per cent in funds for the States, which is well below the current and expected level of inflation. That increase compares with a very high increase of 15 per cent ( almost double the rate of increase to the States) on expenditures for Commonwealth purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The contrast is stark. The Commonwealth's success in restraining its expenditures has been achieved at the expense of the States. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably . . . the restraints I have just mentioned have made it necessary to adjust some rates of taxation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So the States have been forced to increase the taxes and charges imposed upon their own citizens. In Victoria, Mr Thompson's Budget statement was no less blunt. Referring to the States' submissions to the Federal Government for sufficient funds to cover programs, it reads:</PARA>
<PARA> No response was received from the Commonwealth until the Premiers Conference on 4 May 1981, when the State premiers were presented virtually with a fait accompli which was to apply in 1981-82 and which represented a substantial reduction in the reasonable expectations of the States for that year. Thus, because of the cessation of the tax-sharing formula, the determination of the States' tax-sharing entitlement for 1981-82 was reached in a series of separate negotiated steps, with the decisions resting finally with the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know of the big steal by the Commonwealth of $70m of the States' funds, to which Senator Button referred. Of course, that, as Senator Button sought to show, is what we are seeking to compare. We are not seeking to deal with something that happened seven, eight or nine years ago but what is happening currently in relationships between the Commonwealth and the States. So there we have Fraser's federalism in a nutshell, described by Liberals, by Fraser's own people, his own supporters. They describe a system of Federal-State relationships which rips off the States, rips off the people and attempts to absolve the Federal Government of responsibility while in reality putting the strings of control in Federal hands insofar as we have the purse strings here in Canberra. Is it any wonder therefore that the State Premiers will come to Canberra this Friday ready for a bloody battle? Is it any wonder that we are to have another example of confrontation between the six States as they unite against the Commonwealth's policies and against the Commonwealth dictating to them the way in which their social programs shall be developed and the way in which their development programs shall be curtailed?</PARA>
<PARA> If we are to liken Federal-State relationships these days to a battle, then we must look for the casualties struck down in the fight which is now synomynous with the annual meetings of the Premiers Conference. There are casualties. They can be found amongst the homeless who have been struck down by the $526.4m cut in real net payments to the States for housing. I will not quote the New South Wales Minister for Housing, but I remind honourable senators of the statements made by the Victorian Minister for Housing, Mr Kennett, in his trenchant, consistent and strong criticism of the policies of the Commonwealth in the area of public housing. Of course, these facts were left alone in the debate. All Senator Carrick can do is to try to turn the clock back. Perhaps we paid for our sins in 1975 but the Government will certainly pay for its sins in 1983; make no mistake about it. The States will not be on the Government's side, whatever the colour of their political representation. </PARA>
<PARA> Who are the others who have lost out? They can be found amongst those forced to pay increased State charges through the system of double taxation forced upon them by Mr Fraser's federalism. I admit that the New South Wales Government was able to take special steps to extend its services and avoid increases in State taxes by using some of the reserves that have been accumulated over many years. That resulted from good housekeeping and good business acumen being applied. But that moment has passed and they are now confronted with a reduction in services or a squeeze on the Federal Government for more funds. We can look amongst those who have lost out because of the 29 per cent real cut in capital funds for the States since 1975-76. Almost a third has been cut from the capital funds from which the States have to finance their capital works programs. As has been pointed out in previous debates, the public works programs are carried out largely by private contractors. It is no wonder, therefore, that the economy is in the state that it is in today. </PARA>
<PARA> What about those who need assistance under the special purpose grants for the States? Those grants were reduced by 16.1 per cent in the most recent Budget. The Government claims-Senator Carrick repeats it-that this cut is in untied grants. But the facts tell a different story. In truth, the responsibility for housing, health, social welfare and Aboriginal advancement is palmed off to the States. It is no wonder that Australia's foremost expert in Federal-State relationships, Professor Russell Mathews, recently described the present state of affairs as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a shambles where there once was a system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . used its centralised financing powers to return to the thoroughly discredited policies of the Great Depression, involving acceptance of high levels of unemployment at the same time as urgent capital works are deferred for lack of funds. </PARA>
<PARA>When will this Government take notice of the State Premiers and these sorts of experts? When will it respond to the needs of Australia's people? I turn briefly again to the metaphor of the battle in describing Federal-State relationships. We have seen the casualties in this battle, but who are the victors? In line with the Government's resource development mania-a mania which daily is becoming more and more unreal as we see the boom disintegrating-the victors are the resource rich States, the mining regions and the mining giants. In passing back to the states key responsibilities -as President Reagan is currently trying to do-such as the ability to levy charges or to abolish them, the policy of new federalism is leaving the way open for States to see who can offer the most concessions to the mining giants and who can give them the most tempting invitation to exploit the mineral wealth of the States. We see resource rich States such as Queensland and Western Australia bending over backwards to lock themselves into the international economy and to be the resource base for that economy. They are succeeding in doing it with the full support of the pass-the- buck policy of the new federalism of Fraser and Carrick. </PARA>
<PARA> At what cost is this happening? Firstly, it is at the cost of revenue for Australia, as recent studies at the Australian National University centre of economic policy research show. They show that ad hoc, inconsistent, rival and duplicate systems of State and Federal resource taxing result in a real reduction of the revenue that could be collected for public use under a planned and national system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This year and in the preceding years of the Fraser Government the people of Australia have recognised the importance it has placed on bringing power and decisions back to the people; bringing those matters that can be decided at the local level to local government; bringing those matters that are best decided at the State level to State government; and limiting the amount of bureaucracy, power and decision making in this distant, centralised place of Canberra. That imaginative and important emphasis of the Fraser Liberal program has been recognised by the people of Australia and endorsed by them, notably in the election of 1975 and in subsequent elections. The Opposition is now trying to tap in to that popular support for new federalism. In feint and crocodile tear ways it is trying to lament that not quite all of it has been fulfilled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard two shadow Ministers of the Australian Labor Party, the Opposition in the Senate chamber, speaking at length about federalism. Not once have they taken away any jot or tittle of the Labor Party's commitment to centralism. They had every opportunity over two long-ranging, well thought out, prepared speeches to start to deny the Labor Party's enduring commitment to centralism, the destruction of the States, the destruction even of local governments and the destruction of the Senate. That is the Labor Party's commitment and not once did either of the shadow Ministers dare to trespass upon the Caucus commitment to centralism. In those speeches we have seen a quite hypocritical attack upon the Government. The shadow Ministers tried to allege that the prospect of new federalism, the bringing of power back to the people under the Fraser Government, has gone only 90 per cent of the way. It has, of course, been a magnificent change recognised by the people of Australia but it has not gone quite all of the way. Those speakers, from their distant, centralist position, have tried to give a little enlightenment in the development of this popular policy. Even Senator Button, who said that he personally, despite Caucus, saw very real merits in federalism and in bringing power back to the people, was not able to sustain that personal preference and commitment which is not popular in the centralist Caucus of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps those people of Australia interested in this periodic debate will note the tired arguments of the Opposition. They are more tired of it this year than they were before because the Opposition is missing Senator Wriedt. He had a particular interest in this matter. As one Liberal senator with a very strong interest in the implementation of Fraser-Carrick federalism-as it was put by the Opposition-I was very interested to hear the arguments that Senator Wriedt put forward in the past. They were put forward with much more knowledge and interest than were the feint speeches that we heard today. But even Senator Wriedt was not convincing in his jumbled arithmetic. He was not able to lead even me, an interested listener in the Senate, to the logic or the bottom line of his arguments. He tried to say that federalism was being implemented but not to the fullest extent or to the advantage of some of the growing rich and fat State governments. The speeches we have heard from the Opposition today, even after Senator Wriedt's lame-approach attack on the Government, are very tired indeed. I am all the more convinced that we are hearing a load of tired rhetoric because a premiers conference is coming up this week in Canberra and perhaps Opposition senators may try to attach some criticism to the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been the import of new federalism? As all Australians who are interested in politics know, the States, having sovereign governments, ceded specific powers under the terms of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. When this Commonwealth was formed at the beginning of this century specific named powers and responsibilities were given to the Commonwealth Parliament. Sovereignty for the remaining powers remained with the States and this is the federalist structure. We are not a unitary state such as New Zealand or the United Kingdom; we are a state which is made up of independent sovereign States such as South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and so on. Each State has ceded particular powers to the Commonwealth. That is not a centralist system; that is a system where defined and restricted powers come to the centre; sovereignty is, in the main, kept by the States. That is what we call federalism. </PARA>
<PARA> However, particularly during the Whitlam Labor period, this constitutional foundation for Australian Government, in balance between Canberra and the States , was totally upset. The Whitlam Government, by aggrandisement brought more and more powers to itself and kept the responsibility of making more and more decisions, by government Ministers and the ever increasing bureaucracy that developed during those years, here in Canberra. The people of Australia found it difficult to get to those who made the decisions. Not every Australian, in remote country areas or even in suburbs and cities of our capitals, was able to have access to the decision-makers in this increasingly Whitlam centralised Canberra. With popular insistence the Liberal Party came back to reassert its own foundation of political philosophy, a true federalism; it decentralised power to local and State centres. This resurgence of federalism was called 'new federalism'. </PARA>
<PARA> For this leadership Senator Button has given responsibility to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Government in this chamber, Senator Sir John Carrick. Senator Carrick was described by Senator Button as the leading intellectual of the Liberal Party. That may well be the case. Certainly at that time, amongst the shadow Ministers who determined the kinds of remedies that were important for Australia, Senator Carrick had the responsibility for this important question of Federal-State relations. With his experience as general secretary of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, his direct knowledge of the affairs of the New South Wales Parliament and Government and also his experience here in the Commonwealth, he was ideally placed to reassert what was all along the Liberal emphasis upon a proper balance in the distribution of powers in Australia. I think that the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, and Senator Carrick, have been rightly named by the Opposition as the leaders, the authors, of this particular emphasis. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time I was not a senator. I was the policy co-ordinator of the Liberal Party in my own State of South Australia and I welcomed the clarity and intellectual analysis in these implications of federalism which were very clearly set out in those years. Since I have been a senator in this place, in the last four years, I have been one of the strongest supporters of that clear statement of the Liberal position which was set out in 1975. What has been done has already been set out by Senator Carrick in his speech today. Local government has never before had such a high proportion of public revenue. In real terms the amount of Commonwealth money given to local government in every part of Australia has more than doubled. The principle behind that was set out in a slogan or phrase. The Fraser Government made a direct promise that 2 per cent of personal income taxation was the goal that we would strive for to make sure that local government had the finance to achieve the decisions that were appropriate in the local area. And we did achieve that goal. We have achieved that enormous growth in disbursement of public money to local government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button contradicted himself when he, I think, used the word 'blancmange ' in the sense that there was a kind of squeezing out of the State Public Service and revenue throughout the 1970s. We have been so committed to ensuring the financial foundation of the States that perhaps even the generous policies of the Fraser Government have gone beyond what may have been best in terms of allowing some blowout of State Governments. During the last year or two I, as a Liberal senator, have welcomed the restraint that the Treasurer, Mr Howard, and the Prime Minister and others involved in Premiers Conferences have shown. That restraint is a direct reflection of the policies on which this Government was elected in 1975, 1977 and 1980. I believe we should take that matter seriously. We should not allow Government expenditure in every field, not least the States, which is still the biggest area in Commonwealth Government spending after social security, to be unrestrained. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that to fulfil the responsible economic policies that have been clearly set forth by the Fraser Government there must be restraint at Premiers Conferences. Whatever arguments are put by the States for infrastructure financing, through loan accounts or through the direct share of Commonwealth revenue, whilst the Fraser Government, I believe, has had a record of listening most carefully and of truly consulting with the States at Premiers Conferences, there must be an overall perspective of restraint along with all of the other areas of Government spending. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to a few concrete examples that have not been touched on by Senator Carrick. One is the quarantine arrangements in Australia. The Whitlam Government had a report which recommended centralising quarantine literally to fulfil the responsibility of the Commonwealth, it being responsible for this area. However, it is important for State experts to have a direct involvement in quarantine. Therefore we ensured, by consultation with the States, that State agricultural department officers and veterinarians are directly involved in fulfilling the quarantine functions of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I could give other such examples relating to the health package. Many have commended the Commonwealth Government's recent health package. I call it the MacKellar health package because the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) was most careful in pulling together the different elements of it for Cabinet approval. The health package policy that now operates in Australia was most mindful of new federalism. It was mindful of the importance of bringing responsibilities as far as possible to the States. I could talk about education and about roads. In the past we had seven categories of roads. We determined every sort of road and the allocation of funds to each category. The number of categories has now been reduced to three. I could go on and say that we could do more towards new federalism for example, in the area of childhood services, and even in some aspects of arts funding such as the Dix report recommends about music. I totally reject the Opposition's accusations about any failure of new federalism and assert that this Government must continue on the path of decentralising power and bringing close to the people decisions and responsibilities that can be close to the people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been a somewhat fascinating debate on Senator Button's matter of public importance relating to the failure of new federalism. I was rather surprised, however, to hear Senator Teague, given his professional background, say that the Liberal Party had invented the phrase 'new federalism'. He should know as well as I do that 'new federalism' was used in relation to the New Deal of President Roosevelt. Indeed, if we refer only to Australia, Mr Whitlam, in September 1971, published the paper which got the whole thing going, a paper called 'A New Federalism' published in the Journal of Australian Political Science. Therefore, in this debate with nothing to go on other than the fact that we are talking about the failure of new federalism, I think we must look at the record of the Australian Labor Party's new federalism policy and the Liberal party's new federalism policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset, it seems to me to be a sham debate today. I think probably most people have accepted-certainly political scientists in this country have accepted-that new federalism is purely a tactical expression used in the competitive struggle to win national power. Other than that, it has very little to recommend it. The particular aspect of new federalism that people have been concerned about relates basically to the share of revenue that is available at the various levels of government. That is the argument that must be entered into . We wholeheartedly support the Liberal Party's new federalism policy in that it sets out, basically, that there should be greater involvement on the part of the States in the raising and expenditure of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation which was passed in 1978 allowing the States to impose a percentage surcharge or to allow a percentage rebate on personal income tax has not been taken up by the States. The problem in relation to federalism is not one that is confined to the Federal level. Indeed, it is a malaise for both the Federal Government and the State governments. The Australian Democrats hold quite firmly to the view that those areas for which either of those levels of government has responsibility would be best served by allowing the government responsible to raise taxes to pay for them. In other words, at the moment we probably have the worst of all possible worlds. At election time there is confusion in the minds of the electors as to who is responsible. The Federal Government, in a Federal election, is able to blame the States for many of the ills that it has caused. Likewise, in State elections, such as the one currently under way, the State governments are able to blame the Federal Government for the problems which are really of their own making. That particular brand of federalism is probably the worst that we could have devised. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go back to the beginning of federation, we find that the three major problems in the conventions in relation to finance were those relating to tariffs, the inequitable economic power of the States which were going to enter into federation and the emerging problem that the various Crown colonies saw of the relationship between the Commonwealth Government and the States. Those three problems are still with us. They are still the major political and economic problems on our plate in 1982. We have the problem of tariffs, the problem of the resources being differentially spread out throughout Australia-I refer particularly to the resource rich States-and the problem of disbursement of funds between the Commonwealth, the States and local government. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the lauding that the Liberal party has given to its own version of a new federalism and its claim that local government authorities are very happy with it has very little to do with reality. If one takes the time and effort to travel as I have travelled in the last few months throughout one's State talking to shire clerks about the problems of their local areas, one will discover that one of the major problems is of a Federal making. It relates to a new policy in relation to roads and the fact that road moneys, instead of being funnelled to the shires, are being funnelled to private enterprise for the building of Federal roads in their areas. This is causing extraordinary difficulties in many of the small towns in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether people have ever bothered to look at the figures in relation to that but in one shire that I visited two weeks ago 30 men will have to be put off because the shire could not possibly enter into the types of competitive arrangements that private enterprise can enter into. The shire clerk said that the shire was not able to enter into such arrangements because it had to be responsible to its ratepayers. If this shire puts off 30 people it will lose 30 people from the main town in the shire. That will be 10 per cent of the population of that town. That is what we mean when we talk about decentralisation, the fundamental political element in federalism. That is what the whole federal system is about-the notion of having effective decentralisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Every policy that goes through this Parliament should be looked at, not only in terms of a particular political ideology, but also in terms of what it may be able to do to strengthen federalism and to strengthen, in particular, decentralisation in this country. It is only by effective policies for decentralisation-not the types that we have seen in the last few years-that we will be able to maintain the people who currently live in the country and rural areas of this nation, and it is hoped that we will be able to start reversing the trend and build up again the population in country areas. That is absolutely vital and essential for the health and well-being of this country. We must look at every policy that goes through this place in those terms as well as in terms of the political ideology of the party that is ruling at any time. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax legislation that I mentioned enabling State governments to raise taxes was attacked very strongly by the States. The States said that they did not want a bar of raising their own personal income taxes. What they did not allude to in that Bill, which was a Liberal Government sponsored Bill, was that they were also given the opportunity to grant a percentage rebate. In other words, the States said that they did not want to buy into that because if they did the odium for raising taxes would fall on them. In other words, they were not willing to come into a true federalism. They were fairly happy to remain in their existing shambles. In that they have been aided by the present Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it was one of its own Bills which permitted the States to raise or lower percentage income taxes, this Federal Government did not provide room to allow the States to take advantage of that. It gave the States a very good excuse for not taking on their responsibilities. We have a stalemate, a situation in which the central Government is constantly taking unto itself more and more power. It is a situation in which State governments are unwilling to take back the powers that they should take back and should exercise. But unless there is reasonable fiscal reform in relation to the amount of tax that the Federal Government wishes and continues to levy-I refer to the enormous increase , for example, of $5.5m in income tax in this financial year-where is the room for a developing federalism?</PARA>
<PARA> The elements which have been discussed in the Senate so far in this session come together on this policy. It is still of fundamental concern to try to have developed in this country a rational and reasonable Federal system. The division of power which was seen as so necessary in the last century is even more necessary now. The Australian Democrats are very firmly a federalist party, a decentralist party. If those decentralisation policies are to be put into operation a central government must make room for them. It must enable State governments to take advantage of those Bills that the Liberal Government has proposed. In other words, it must be very careful while talking about new federalism to have policies which enable new federalism to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very revealing parallel between Whitlam's new federalism and the new federalism of the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. The new federalism talked about in those articles by Mr Whitlam prior to the Labor Party coming to power changed during the period it was in power to a policy of more and more power being taken by the central Government. But if one looks at the policies that were proposed beforehand one sees that while the Labor Government talked about new federalism its policies very clearly pointed to a centralisation of power. In other words, one of the things one might be able to say for the Labor Government at that time is that it attempted to achieve the things it was talking about in terms of centralisation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems with which one is faced with Liberal rhetoric is that whilst the Liberals still talk about it we are still heading in the opposite direction; we are still heading towards centralisation. What is very difficult to determine from what the Government spokesmen have said today is whether this was the original intention of the Government or whether it just happened. New federalism is pure rhetoric. Over the last 10 years, since 1972, it was probably never meant to be anything else. It is probably the type of policy which can be sold to the electorate on the suggestion that the encroachment of centralising power be constantly attacked. That goes down well in the electorate, but whether there has ever been any intention on the part of either the Liberal-National Country Party coalition or the Labor Party to do anything effective and useful about it is probably as much the guess of anybody in the electorate as it is the guess of those respective party leaders. We would strongly support the bringing forward of any legislation which effectively centralised power, which effectively gave power back to the lower or higher levels, however one likes to put it, of the Australian community, which gave local government a much more effective and incisive input into finances and which made States responsible not only for programs but also for raising the revenue to finance those programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is about the alleged failure of the new federalism. I suppose the best way to deal with that matter at the outset is to refer the Senate to some figures that appeared in the 1981 Commonwealth Grants Commission report on State Tax Sharing Entitlements. I will cite the figures for only New South Wales and South Australia in this context. I refer to page 37 of that document below the heading 'Formula Entitlements'. In 1974-75 New South Wales received $737.522m and South Australia received $261. 737m. In 1979-80 New South Wales received $1,663.467m compared with $737m in 1974-75. South Australia received $630.392m compared with $261.737m in 1974-75. I do not think that is pure rhetoric at all; it is pure fact, and that is what we ought to be considering here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Macklin mentioned the 1971 Whitlam paper on new federalism. I should have thought it would be more appropriate to style that new centralism because one of the first things that the Whitlam Goverment embarked upon was an attempt to destroy local government as we know it today in favour of the development of 40-odd regional areas that would be subject to centralised control from Canberra . In other words, if a local government wanted to buy a grader, for example, it would have to refer it to Canberra before that expenditure could be authorised. As far as I am concerned that is totally wrong and is not at all in the spirit of what we regard as federalism. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser, when talking in the debate on the Review of Commonwealth Functions in April last year, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Only individuals have full knowledge of their own needs, wants and priorities; politicians, officials and bureaucrats neither have this knowledge nor can ever have it. This is why government must not be intrusive and why strong and efficient government must not grow into big and bureaucratic government. </PARA>
<PARA> Big government concentrates power, loses a perspective on its own limitations, and leaves less room for people to make their own choices. </PARA>
<PARA> And we must not forget that it is people, their knowledge and their talents, their enterprise and their determination, their belief that they can succeed, who have built Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Contrary to what has been suggested by Opposition speakers, the spirit of federalism is to put into the hands of State and local governments a greater capacity to deal with their own affairs and to give them more responsibility. We would like to encourage them to follow the example of the Federal Government under Prime Minister Fraser with respect to curtailing and reducing public expenditure in an attempt to transfer the emphasis to the private sector. I believe that the Government is pursuing a course which is of benefit to the whole nation. When Senator Macklin was referring to the high rate of personal income tax I heard Senator Mason suggest by way of interjection that we ought to reduce personal income tax. I am sure that is the objective of the Government. The Australian Democrats really make me laugh when they talk about reducing personal income tax. Their continual errors of judgment, as they call them, are making this Government face a situation in which our revenue will be reduced. I refer to their threat to deny the Government the sales tax legislation. This will slow down the capacity of the Federal Government to reduce personal income taxes. We all realise they are too high, and the objective of the Government is to reduce that imposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that I referred to only yesterday was the suggestion that the Australian Democrats intend to deny the Government the oil levy Bill. The Government has encouraged private enterprise to step up its drilling operations. these operations will be doubled during the next 12 months at a cost of something like $800m. But no, the Democrats would like to provide these companies with a $45m windfall profit, denying that revenue to the Government and again slowing down the process of the Government being able to reduce personal income tax. Already the delay in implementing sales tax has cost the Government $80m in revenue. I think the Democrats must face the fact that they are deluding the people and are, in effect, holding a gun at the Government's head to get their own way with respect to certain elements of the sales tax Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government's intentions are to pursue federalism as it has in the past. The figures show that this has been successful. I believe that the Federal Opposition is determined to pursue a course which would mean the weakening of the State governments. Of course, that was the object of the Whitlam Government when it was going to establish regional local government areas. That, of course, was to be the forerunner to the abolition of the States. This is quite clear from what Mr Hawke said in the Boyer lectures in 1979. He clearly advocated the abolition of the States when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The perpetration of this anachronistic lunacy is hurting Australians every day of the week. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no justification now, in terms of the interests and the rights of 14 million Australians, to perpetrate this dangerous anachronism. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe . . . that Australians would be better served by the elimination of the second tier of government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Labor Party that seems keen to do away with a federal system would do well to bear in mind the views of Dr Frohnmayer, Professor of Law at the University of Oregon, when he warned on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program Guest of Honour in January 1981:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite four decades of governmental centralisation the achievement of congressional supremacy and the expansion of national power in the United States , new voices there argue that the Federal principle does not have lasting significance. </PARA>
<PARA>Pointing to similarities between the revival in federalist policies in Australia and in the United States he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Rhetoric and reality for new federalism advocates are virtually identical in both nations, the need for local control, the bewildering diversity of regional problems, the realities of geographical distance and population dispersion, the greater accountability of local elected officials and the value of innovation and experimentation in state laboratories of Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I think everything that needs to be said has been said. The Government's policies are working. The figures that I cited earlier show that quite conclusively. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the business of the day be called on. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes to eliminate the following from the Broadcasting and Television Act of 1942-73. Sub-section 4 and 4A in section 116 which read:</PARA>
<PARA> '(4) Subject to the next succeeding sub-section, the Commission or a licensee shall not, at any time between the end of an election period and the close of the poll on the day on which the election is held, broadcast or televise election matter. </PARA>
<PARA> (4A) Where, in respect of-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an election of a member of the House of Representatives that is not a general election; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an election of a member or members of a House of the Parliament of a State,</PARA>
<PARA>The Board is of the opinion that programs broadcast from a particular broadcasting station or televised from a particular television station are not ordinarily received in the part of the Commonwealth to which the election relates, the Board may, by notice in writing served on or sent by post to the Commission or the licensee of the station, as the case requires, exempt the Commission or the licensee, as the case requires, from compliance with the last preceding sub-section in respect of the broadcasting or televising from that station of election matter relating to that election.'</PARA>
<PARA> It would also be necessary to eliminate that phrase ''the Wednesday next preceding'' from the definition of ''election period'' in sub-section (6). </PARA>
<PARA> This particular recommendation to have a pre-election 'blackout' was proposed simultaneously in March 1942 by the Joint Committee on Wireless Broadcasting ( the Gibson Committee) and by Arthur Calwell who was Minister for Information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gibson Committee's recommendation was that: 'the Act should be amended to provide for . . . Wednesday night preceding an election day to be the last permissible occasion for the broadcasting of a political speech before that election day . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>(Recommendation 38)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In support of its position, the Gibson Committee provided he following rationale:</PARA>
<PARA>'. . . it might be argued that the field of broadcasting should be as free as that of the newspaper world, where unrestricted licence, subject only to the possibility of libel action, is the condition which obtains at all times. But commercial broadcasting can be more easily controlled than newspapers and in any case, there is no reason why the public should be asked to accept anything less than the highest possible ethical standard that can be attained by those who hold commercial broadcasting licences. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore broadcasting is a virtual monopoly, whereas the publication of newspapers is not'. </PARA>
<PARA>(Paragraph 408)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> To reinforce its position it argued:</PARA>
<PARA> 'In making our recommendation on this phase of broadcasting, we are not desirous of discouraging political-mindedness; on the contrary we feel that an enlightened and informed electorate is the best safeguard for the successful operation of democratic forms of government.'</PARA>
<PARA> In urging the adoption of the Canadian practice, that all broadcasts shall cease for a period before election day, we desire to establish what might be called a 'breathing space' which will make more difficult the snatching of victory by any one party in a manner that might do incalculable national harm.'</PARA>
<PARA>(Paragraphs 410, 411)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The idea of the pre-election 'breathing space' was foreshadowed earlier in the report at which point the committee drew in another factor to justify its attitude:</PARA>
<PARA> 'It seems to us that if all political broadcasts concluded on the Wednesday before election day, the nation would be better able to assess the merits of each party's programme, and what is even more important, would be less likely to be stampeded by false and fictitious claims and by dangerous and unsubstantiated charges, the ''Zinoviev'' letter episode and the ''Reichstag'' fire incident must not find their counterparts in Australian radio transmission.'</PARA>
<PARA>(Paragraph 268)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It is worth pointing out that radio and television were most definitely not used in association with the Zinoviev letter in Britain in 1925, the incident that Arthur Calwell in 1969 used as his major reason for not trusting commercial radio, for the obvious fact that the BBC had not commenced its regular broadcasting services at that time and, in fact, did not commence until 1927. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report in 1954, the Royal Commission on Television recommended that the blackout should apply to television and radio equally:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The provision of section 89 (2) of the Broadcasting Act 1942-1953 which provides that no political matter shall be broadcast on the two days preceding . . . should be applied to the televising of political matter on both the national and the commercial television services.'</PARA>
<PARA>(Paragraph 466-Recommendation 57)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The only modifications to the original provision were made in 1969 by an amendment through the inclusion of sub-section 116 (4A) which allows the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to exempt from the blackout provision, particular stations during by-elections for the House of Representatives and State elections. Before 1969, even a by-election for one seat meant a nation- wide blanket application of the blackout. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the provision was introduced into the legislation in 1942, there have been several occasions, usually during an election lead-up, when politicians have defended the ban. Their argument has been based invariably on one of the following premises:</PARA>
<PARA> It inhibits the possibility of last-minute deception. </PARA>
<PARA> It provides respite from political pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> It reflects the Commonwealth Government's power to control one element of the media. </PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of last-minute deception is not lessened by the blackout, it is merely moved forward a few days. In addition the reverse is the case. If a newspaper makes a statement on polling day then, at present, there is no way of gaining redress. However, if the electronic media were in operation then the likely situation would be that a right of reply would be granted and, at least, some ground could be made up by the offended party. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument about breathing spaces is a thoroughly paternalistic one. As Donald Horne has put it:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The whole idea of breathing spaces, peace and calm, and quiet study of candidates' records is so artificial that it is laughable . . .'</PARA>
<PARA> One might say generally that political activity feeds on discussion and the energetic presentation of issues but it languishes in government-enforced ' breathing spaces'. A society in which elections went 'calmly and quietly' would almost certainly not be a democratic one. Calm and quiet are usually enforced from above . . .'</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp on 11th October 1980 put the point about discrimination against one media source in this way:</PARA>
<PARA> 'If we are genuinely committed to freedom of speech, there is no excuse for this continued political censorship of radio and television before an election. It is blatant discrimination to allow the Press to report on election issues at this time, yet impose a blackout on radio and television. </PARA>
<PARA> If people do not want to read about the election they can skip stories in their newspapers, or not buy a newspaper at all. People should be given the same freedom of choice on radio and television. </PARA>
<PARA> If they did not want to listen to or view election material, they could change to another station or switch off'. </PARA>
<PARA> Radio and television may be more intrusive than newspapers, but I question whether the difference is of sufficient significance as to warrant a curtailment of freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Chipp has said, everybody is free to turn off electoral broadcasts- indeed, anyone who wishes to impose a personal or domestic pre-election blackout is free so to do with only minor disruptions to listening and viewing habits. </PARA>
<PARA> Even with the broadcasting blackout, those who object to electoral material close to polling day will still be bombarded by newspapers, posters, bumper stickers, slogan buttons. T-shirts, graffiti and other eye-catching material. Their homes will still be invaded by loud-hailers in the hands of party supporters cruising through the suburbs thundering out electoral messages. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition to the ban has come from many organisations and individuals. In 1969 , for example, Mr Peacock, speaking on the broadcasting and television bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA> ''I therefore put it to the Minister than the ban on the broadcasting of election matter during the 3 days prior to the close of the poll is outmoded. During this period we can read in our daily newspapers all that pertains to the electoral battle that is going on. Although the current news on the election, which is of utmost importance to the nation, is fully reported in the newspapers , it cannot be reported by the television or radio stations from the Wednesday night prior to the poll on Saturday. Frankly, I believe that this legislation belongs to a bygone era. I think it is a negation of the principle that news should be unfettered. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister is aware, the broadcasting ban applies to both Federal and State elections. Under the Broadcasting and Television Act-the Act which will be amended by the Bill that the House is now debating-all television and radio stations are prohibited from broadcasting any election matter from the Thursday morning up to the close of the poll on the Saturday. I make a strong statement whan I say that I think it is an absurd piece of legislation which debars television and radio stations from fulfilling their role of bringing current news and information on all major issues of the day to the public. I urge the Minister to consider whether the Act can be amendmend in this regard before the next Federal election.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in its report '' 'Self-regulation for Broadcasters'-a report on the Public inquiry into the concept of self-regulation for Australian Broadcasters-Australian Broadcasting tribunal, AGPS, Canberra, 1977'', when considering evidence which had been given regarding section 166 (4) , made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA> ''The Tribunal finds it difficult to disagree with the bulk of the witnesses, particularly as the provision is not consistent with the practice of most other Western countries. The embargo was originally introduced to restrict the transmission of last-minute, alarmist material in election campaigns. There is, however, nothing to prevent newspapers from presenting such material and we believe it inequitable to discriminate between media.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Postal and Telecommunications Department in its report-''Australian Broadcasting'' recommended:</PARA>
<PARA> ''It is proposed that the 'election period' be defined as the period commencing on the day of issue of the writ or writs for an election and ending at midnight on the day preceding the day of the poll, thereby limiting the 'blackout' period to those hours between midnight and the close of the poll.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, in 1977 felt that the electronic blackout was a bit antiquated and promised to review the ban after the election, as did the A.L .P. according to a report in 'The Age' of 7th December of that year. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978 Mr Tony Staley, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, told the Melbourne Press Club that he hoped to end the ban on the broadcasting of political news and commentary. The ban, he said, was ''absurd and odd''. That ban is still absurd and odd but it has not been repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> The A.J.A. has constantly opposed the provisions of the Broadcasting Act which allow this censorship and made the point in October 1980 that it was disturbed that politicians give only lip service to suggestions that the offending section be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> Derryn Hinch has, over the years, waged his own personal battle to have the ban lifted and has been joined by the Federation of Radio Broadcasters. Their report ''A Proposal To End The Election 'Blackout' '', while endorsing a lesser proposal still advocates the abolition of the blackout in its entirety-as does the Public Broadcasting Association of Australia, the Australian Newspapers Council and the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations. </PARA>
<PARA> The absurdities of the ban are apparent at every Federal election or by- election. A few examples must suffice. </PARA>
<PARA> In October 1980, the afternoon host of Sydney radio station 2GB, thought she was on safe ground if she put to air an incisive piece on the summer cockroach plague. An alderman of the Sydney City Council's community services and health committee was interviewed. He claimed to have been bitten by a cockroach, but made the fatal mistake of saying that cockroaches were the number one enemy of the ALP City Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The programme's producers feared mere mention of the ALP would be in contravention of the Broadcasting and Television Act. The cockroach story was put off until after the election. </PARA>
<PARA> In April 1981 ABC national news bulletins, which emanate from Sydney were prohibited from making any reference to a row in Parliament between Mr Fraser and Mr Hayden over the Rundle shale oil issue. This was because of the by- election for the NSW seat of Wentworth. Listeners were duly informed that they were hearing restricted bulletins. Victorians were able to hear a report of the Rundle row in the Victorian edition immediately following the national news. </PARA>
<PARA> What makes the whole thing farcical is that the ABC is obliged to broadcast Parliament, so listeners throughout Australia, including NSW, were able to hear the entire debate between Mr Hayden and Mr Fraser when it took place. </PARA>
<PARA> There is even a Q.C.'s advice that if, for argument's sake, the wife of the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition were at a flower show and fell from the podium and sprained her ankle, a television or radio station that broadcast the information would be liable to prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to remove a perversion of freedom of the Press and the public's right to know; it seeks to avoid the situation whereby radio and television have to go through the absurd charade of pretending politics do not exist during the last 72 hours of each election campaign; it seeks to avoid the situation whereby a radio broadcaster can be acting against the law by merely reading from a newspaper story about a current election campaign. It takes the commonsense stance that if it is good enough for a newspaper to report on political events during the last day of a campaign then it is good enough for a radio or television station to do the same. </PARA>
<PARA> The pre-election blackout on radio and TV commentary is neither reasonable nor logical. There is no rational argument as to why the electronic media should be muzzled. The community is entitled to receive comment and information on all issues affecting their vote on all available media services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not 1942. It is 1982-forty years on, we live in a society in which an ever-increasing number of people rely on the electronic media to receive news and background information. The electronic newspaper is now in Australia and yet we have a law which says that if it is printed on paper it is legal but if it is printed on paper and shown on a screen it is illegal. What is the situation if instead of the electronic newspaper being broadcast it is relayed through cable into homes and offices?</PARA>
<PARA> While most parliamentarians come from the cities of this country, I would remind all senators that there are still many towns and settlements in this country which do not receive their daily newspaper for some days after it is printed. In this case to blackout their main means of information, namely radio and television, is to put them at a serious disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> In a pre-election situation electronic media is able to offer more immediate means for community feedback and consultation and an effective means for the correction of any untrue or mistaken statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The election blackout must be removed. It is a democratic right for all Australian citizens to have access to all information from all sources. It is time this absurd and regressive ban was removed. This Bill will dispose of it in its entirety. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it has been supplied to other people and other parties who are concerned directly with industrial relations. I wonder whether it is not , in fact, a deliberate attempt to deprive me and the Democrats of information necessary to make a fully informed comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statement by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) on behalf of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) identifies four factors affecting industrial relations in this country. The first factor is the structure of Australian unions and their heavy dependence on craft unions rather than industry or even enterprise unions. The second is a breakdown of any sense of commitment to bargains made and the spirit and intent of conciliation and arbitration processes. Thirdly is the constant resort to indiscriminate use of union power, often before the parties have reached the bargaining table, as a first rather than a last resort. Fourthly is the Federal-State division of industrial powers. A cynic might add that the Government is also a major problem in industrial relations at present. There were four major whinges but the Government has tackled only one in any concrete sense, that is, the structure of Australian unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, having suffered the embarrassment of being forced to negotiate its own legislation last year when Senator Button introduced a Bill to encourage the amalgamation of unions, now says that it will encourage the creation of industry unions. It is difficult to see how this can be done except by union amalgamation. In fact, this was what Senator Button's attempt encouraged last year. We believe that union amalgamation is a worthy aim. As I have said several times since entering this Senate, Australia has far too many unions-about 11 times as many as, for example, West Germany. Union amalgamation, therefore, is to be welcomed, especially on an industry basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The mention which is made in the Government's report on enterprise unions, however, disturbs me greatly as it had disturbed the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Apparently the Government intends to allow employees of any enterprise or company with more than 100 employees to form a union. I can only say that this would be sheer madness. The number of individual unions would mushroom ten- fold. I ask the Minister to clarify the Government's position on this point as a matter of some urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government appears to be doing something positive on one front and, at the same time, something negative-taking a step backwards-on another front. Let us talk about the other three fronts that the Government has raised in its statement. Unions and employers will not regain magically a sense of commitment to bargains made in the spirit and intent of conciliation and arbitration processes simply because the Government asks them to do so, even if the Government asks very nicely. It is naive to expect that to happen. Instead we believe that the Government should introduce a legislative framework for direct bargaining and binding contracts between unions and employers. Such legislation need not necessarily be modelled on the American system but it must recognise the value of Australian traditions and institutions. This would surely be a more effective measure than simply asking the employers and unions to be good people.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the saddest things in Australia's industrial life is the gulf between labour, organised or not organised, and capital. It is a division which has existed in our society-as in many others-for centuries. I believe passionately that the way to industrial harmony is through industrial democracy. Such brilliant and compassionate men as Carl Zeiss, Fletcher Jones and many others have shown that is can work. The Bill which passed this Senate in the last days of 1981 was a start. I fervently hope that eventually it will become law. If the interests of workers and capital become more closely identified each has more to gain through improved industrial relations. Unions are suspicious of things such as profit sharing and employee share ownership. They are suspicious that these are just one-way streets and that labour gives away more than the employers. But this has been demonstrated to be not the case in Germany, Scandanavia and Japan. Employees can do just as well and may be in a position to gain more from the introduction and practice of the principles of industrial democracy. It is the experience of these countries with industrial democracy that it greatly reduces industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, Mr Viner said that employers have complained of the Federal-State division of industrial relations powers. Of course, our complex political and legal system is a heavy millstone around the neck of industrial relations whichever way we go, as it is in many other fields. But successive administrations have shown little inclination to do anything about this. The expense of having seven separate wages tribunals is immense, yet Australians appear to accept this mad hatter's tea party with the resigned air of people unable to shape their own destiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the first priority in industrial relations has to be to repeal the present Conciliation and Arbitration Act and to replace it with modern legislation which reflects today's attitudes and needs. The present Act is one of the most complex in the land and it is 80 years old. It is a major impediment to progressive industrial relations in this country. Why should the Act be changed? The most important decision which has to be made is the kind of wages and conditions fixing system that we want. Traditionally Australia has had a central wage fixing authority-the Commission itself. However, the Commission has not been alone in this central wage fixing approach. Australia is bedevilled also by six State wage body industry groups and over-award payments in negotiations on a company by company basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats propose a major simplification of this hugely expensive and ineffective system, based on the abolition of the negotiating role of industry associations and State wages authorities and a major role change for the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. We believe that the Commission should set minimum wages and conditions and monitor adherence to agreements, but that over-award wages and conditions ought to be negotiated on a company by company basis with agreements codified in written, binding contracts. I stress the words 'a company by company basis' or 'an enterprise by enterprise basis'. Those two words are synonymous. Surely companies are the best judges of what they can afford and the productivity improvements that they can achieve-not industry associations or distant wages tribunals. Surely local union officials are the best judges of when to press and when to back off in negotiating contracts. Both sides, on a company to company basis, would have access to all the resources under the command of the industrial unions. That is the first priority-a basic change in the law under which our conciliation and arbitration procedures operate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the chaos in industrial relations is such that a constructive approach to a revision of our Conciliation and Arbitration Act would be welcomed by the States. The fact that we have had wage indexation for three years proves that the States are prepared to co-operate with the Commonwealth in the wage fixing area. Indexation was not possible without State co-operation. I believe State co-operation would be forthcoming in a basic revision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. There is no other way. The Act has to be revised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second priority is the creation of a climate in which the traditional labour versus capital conflict can be dissolved. That is the essential thrust of the Industrial Democracy Bill. The Australian Democrats were very proud to have it passed in the Senate in November. That Bill was-and this speaks volumes for industrial relations in Australia-the first such Bill ever to be introduced into the Australian Parliament. The Bill seeks to encourage, by means of a reduction in company tax, the creation of works councils, profit centre groups, profit sharing and employee share ownership. The Australian Democrats believe in the rapid development of manufacturing industry on the sure and firm foundation of a partnership between capital and labour and not on confrontation. Our long term aim is development of this concept to the point where 50 per cent of the shares of companies are owned by employees-in other words, a partnership between capital and labour. Employee share ownership has been praised by the Chairman of the Sydney Stock Exchange, Mr Frank Mullens. It is also, I understand, the platform of the Liberal Party, although not much has been done to encourage it during the lifetime of this Parliament. Enlightened industrial relations policies are undoubtedly the key to the success of industry in Germany and Japan . English speaking countries keep their heads in the sand and they will do so at their own peril. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government can play a decisive role in industrial relations by skilful blending of legislation, leadership and education in this area. Australia has industrial chaos because the Government cannot make up its mind whether to adopt a centralised or decentralised wage fixing approach. These two approaches are basically in conflict but yet at present we have both. Fewer unions or company unions are two approaches that are basically in conflict. The Government has not yet resolved that conflict. A central wage fixing system can only work if the unions are prepared to stop their direct bargaining with companies on over-award payments and rely on the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I believe it is unrealistic to expect the unions to do that. The only practical approach is to move to decentralised direct bargaining, tailored to meet the Australian tradition, the Australian character and Australian aims. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate somewhat amazed at the infantile concept of the habits of the Australian work force as set out in this document. It could be said at the outset that this is a sort of political St Paul document, the message ahead of the ultimate legislation. That may be good because perhaps even at this late stage Mr Viner, the Minister for Industrial Relations, will realise what a narrow, transparent document it is. I say that because an assessment of the Australian work force, irrespective of the industry, over the last five years, taking into account the impact of the inevitable technological changes, reveals that the average rank and file trade unionist has a fear of uncertainty. Quite a number of recent disputes have arisen over the question of relativity. People have said: 'What's the difference ? It's only a matter of a few dollars in different classifications?' Other people realise that often it is a question of promotion or progression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give honourable senators a classic illustration. Let us take the case of the recent New South Wales State railway dispute. It is very nice to have across -the-board broadband agreements when X dollars are paid on an industrial basis. But in many services and public utilities the main inducement is a little difference in the various grades. I think this is manifest in the New South Wales railways where within five years a membership of 20,000 will be compressed to about 13,000. In the traffic grades it is doubtful whether, in the light of certain technological changes, there will be speed of progression for people going, for example, from station assistant to shunter to signal man with all the various relativities. I have in mind the computerisation of the signal system virtually from Newcastle to the Queensland border. The example I have given of the railway system could be perpetuated in so many other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to this weird idea of plant unions, for want of a better name. Has the Government looked at the container industry at the moment? It could be said, I think undeniably, that some mergers of the Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia, the Federated Clerks Union of Australia and the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia would be advantageous. But if we take the Viner concept of these plant organisations, in Sydney at present there is one container terminal where there will be redundancies. If there is to be a narrow concept, a cocoon as it were, of one terminal, how will rapport be reached with another section of those particular classifications? How are all those classifications absorbed? In contrast, the amalgamation of the three unions concerned in the container industry, or even two of them, would be advantageous. I make that point because the average rank and file member in an industry asks himself at 25 years of age: 'Where will I be when I am 50?'</PARA>
<PARA> I think this problem is epitomised at the other end of the scale in small industries involving, for example, the confectionary union. Recently Rowntrees, a chocolate manufacturer, was absorbed by another company. A person over 55 may get, and does get in most instances, a fairly generous severance pay. But what happens to the others? I raised this matter with the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr Neil Brown, during the Rowntree windup. The people over 55-the union of course agreed to this-got, in a sense, a modified golden handshake. But what happened to those people between 25 and 40? The company vaguely said: 'Well , the Commonwealth Employment Office will place them'. When we get this drivel from the Government in this statement, it makes me wonder whether it ever realises the difficulties caused by redundancies and how people are placed. </PARA>
<PARA> I sat with Barney French of the Federated Rubber and Allied Workers Union of Australia in negotiations for the workers in the phase-out of the Dunlop company . Dunlop consolidated its industry in Victoria, and I do not object to union consolidation. I can remember meeting the then Minister for Productivity, the present Minister for Immigration and Ethnic affairs, Mr Macphee, with a delegation from the union. To the Minister's credit, negotiations were opened up with Goodyear regarding that company absorbing Dunlop's tyre builders and kindred grades. The other employer said: 'Oh well, of course that is a noisy industry and some of those men have hearing problems. How will we know in X number of years when these men claim industrial deafness that they did not have these hearing problems before? Should I absorb the lot of them?' In this case, with a little bit of give and take, effective redundancy absorption occurred. But in respect of the instances which I have given there have been no utterances from the Government. The Government has the Industrial Relations Bureau. Does it ever realise the human element involved in industrial relations? People who are made redundant are not just a group of statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> Without even getting into the field of collective bargaining, I emphasise again that, if the Government wants this minute fragmentation into plant and company unions, it should look, as it does not appear to have done, at the history of United States trade unions and at some of the bloody battles that took place even in the era when President Roosevelt tried to bring civilisation to American trade union relations. There has never been in Australia any of the violence on the shopfloor or outside that was experienced in the United States. The closest I can get to it is the ill-fated dispute on the Kalgoorlie goldfields in 1934 when the mining companies created racialism between the various groups. Besides that, it is very hard to think of any other instances. One thinks of Rothbury, but they are very few and far between. If we get unions into these narrow confines, I do not believe that any of the Australian employers that Mr Viner claims are applauding his scheme will give people permanent employment. Pigs might fly! The smaller a union, the more inclined the employers will be to say: 'You are a good and faithful servant. We cannot do anything for you. Report to the Commonwealth Employment Office'. Once we get this fragmentation, we will get complete chaos. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take it a little further. Senator McIntosh is a long-standing and experienced member of a major trade union in the metal industry. He would know, and we know, that with the best of intentions the Government says to the unions: 'Do not be Luddites. Do not resist change'. Does the Government not realise that throughout the open-cut coal fields in Australia of recent times the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australasia has been operating the machinery and the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union has been providing the maintenance, whereas in the underground mines the miners' federation has been the major and dominant group? It is inevitable that there will be honest differences and disputations, but it is wrong to say, whenever there is a strike, that the Australian Labor Party inspired it. I am sorry that the wife of the Queensland Premier is not present in the chamber. The Country Party in Queensland inspired the miners' federation in the taxation brawl it had with the Treasurer John Howard with respect to taxation of certain allowances for habitation in distant places. Of course, because it suited the Country Party it cheered on the miners' federation in that instance, but in New South Wales it is said to be anarchist and in Western Australia, I suppose, it would be said to be the same. This shows the Government's inconsistency and hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> A Country Party member of the Queensland State Government, whose nickname I was told by former Senator McAuliffe is Pinkie Lester, is an avid organiser for the union, and what he said about John Howard left anything that we said about him in the other place very poor in comparison. I make that indictment of the Country Party. When it suited it for an electoral advantage it tried to become super-militant. It says something for it as a union bargainer that I do not think John Howard has yet done anything about taxing the rental allowance of miners and other people who work in distant areas. That shows how much hypocrisy has been produced. </PARA>
<PARA> I go to another example. Mr Deputy President, you would have noticed the incessant dialogue I have had with the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). I have said: 'The Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia is endeavouring to go into the resources field in Western Australia, but we have a State arbitration set-up and a Federal one. What are you doing to anticipate to some extent the collisions that will arise?' All I have got from Senator Durack, who is a very polite and pleasant Minister, is: 'Well, it is a deep question. We have to keep talking'. What I want to know is when Sir John Moore and his counterpart in Western Australia will come up with a formula to anticipate a little of the give and take that will unquestionably arise when some unions from the east seek to go into Western Australia. I am not attempting to provide a formula now, but I believe we should be ready for it. Instead of putting out 12 roneoed sheets of half-baked ideas, it would be much better if Mr Viner said: 'Sir John Moore has spoken to the presidents of all the State industrial commissions. This is the formula we have for the new deployment of trade unions'. That has not been done and that is the alarming indictment I make at this stage. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now that the sightboard has been adjusted I can continue with my speech. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was attempting to analyse the statement of the Minister for Industrial Relations. I made the point that in formulating any proper industrial policy one has to analyse the motivations of the Australian work force. I repeat-I have said this on at least five occasions when we have dealt with this type of legislation-that since well over five years ago when the full thrust of the technological revolution hit Australia there has been no forward planning from the Government down. Originally this was so in relation to the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association and has remained the situation in relation to all the subsequent adjustments that occurred. If I were looking for a key word in relation to current wage agreements it would be 'relativity'. It may be that in some selected areas a person maintains his industrial status regardless of what industry he goes to, but in so many areas it is a matter of progressing from a lower grade to the ultimate in perhaps 10 years time. That is why unions are rightly so jealous of maintaining that relativity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It might be argued that before we departed from the two tier wage system in which the fitter was the benchmark for the purpose of making adjustments-we had the base rate and a margin for skill-it was much easier to assess wage trends. Of course, the Government has never been prepared to recognise public utilities and public services generally; it has always put the glamour industries first with the others trailing behind. Let us take the recent transport situation. I refer to the railway industry. There is no question in my mind that if greater recognition had been given to various grades and their relationships with one another the parties involved would not have become locked in. The Minister's statement is lacking in certain respects. There are obviously constant collisions. I refer to the conflict between State and Federal awards. It was only when serious problems arose at Kernell that some attempts were made by the Industrial Commission of New South Wales and its Federal counterpart under Sir John Moore to devise a formula. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in dialogue with Senator McIntosh before dinner, we are facing a similar situation in Western Australia. I do not concur completely with the Government about the ambit of the resources boom but we know that as unions from the eastern States seek certain coverage it is inevitable that there will be some disputation. I have had very little response from the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, as to how far we have gone with summit talks on these matters. The problem is not insoluble. This problem looms large each year in the report of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Last night Senator Scott dealt fleetingly with it but the Minister said very little about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the point about fragmentation of trade unions. The containerisation industry is probably crying out for mergers. I have in mind the situation concerning the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, the Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia and the Federated Clerks Union of Australia. Let us take Mr Viner's suggestion that small is best. What would be the situation in the container industry in this regard? I know that in the port of Sydney there would be 78 redundancies in one container depot. If we had this minute union component that the Minister talks about there would be no way of siphoning off those people to other depots. In contrast, if we implemented the merger that I suggest, the last-on-first-to-go syndrome would apply. I know that the question of suitability is also a factor, but by and large that principle works best. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed that on page 14 of his circulated statement the Minister referred to the Printing and Kindred Industries Union and the 35-hour working week that was negotiated to apply from December 1982. It always amazes me that whoever prepares these speeches for Mr Viner does not realise that the 40-hour working week came in in 1947. At every trade fair that has been held since, in every trade journal that has been published since and at any inspection of any workshop or plant by a Senate committee that has taken place since, a particular piece of equipment or labour saving device that was not available five years ago is proudly pointed to. I simply say this: Government members who espouse the virtues of the private enterprise system may think that, after all the industrial innovations since 1947, we should simply say to the Printing and Kindred Industries Union: 'You cannot have your shorter working week; it is an indictment on technological change'. The Government has gloated about this matter. I have heard Ministers talking about certain friction between the Australian Journalists Association and the PKIU. That problem has been resolved to a large degree. Obviously with the intense technological development in that area the shorter working week is a reasonable flow on. Both the previous Australian Council of Trade Unions chieftain, Bob Hawke, and his successor, Cliff Dolan, have made it abundantly clear that the question of shorter working hours and technological changes depends specifically on the trade unions involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to deal with two other points because they are related to the national wage case. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been quoted as saying: ' Well, of course, we as a government have certain limits. We can make submissions only indirectly'. But he is remarkably quiet about two points. At least three years ago when the National Labour Advisory Council met the idea was put that we should look at the situation in Western Europe. I refer to the German and French trade unions and, to a lesser degree, the Scandinavians and the effects of stabilised health schemes. The Government has always argued in terms of the number of days lost. I made it abundantly clear to the Government in relation to the duration of strikes that some of the metal trade unions in the United States have been out on strike for eight or nine months and that in the maritime industry one West Coast dispute went on for seven months. That took place under the leadership of Harry Bridges, whom the Government always tries to tell us we should emulate. There is no use in our going overseas to look at precedents. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I wish to make is that in stabilising the wage system the Government refuses to face up to two things. When the Labour Advisory Council met three years ago the idea was put that, just as in Western Europe, the role of the Government and the trade unions was to provide stable hospital and medical coverage. Whatever the Government argues about its loyalty to private hospital funds, the simple egalitarian concept is that medical benefit contributions be part of a person's taxable income which he or she pays once a year. Under that concept a person is not subject to the fluctuations every quarter in the premium of the private hospital fund. That is the first point. Secondly, at least when it comes to settling once a year, the process worker does not pay as much for his hospital and medical coverage as does the production manager. The Government should have been prepared to go to the ACTU and to say: 'We will give you this universal coverage. We will expand the Medibank concept. That will virtually roll all the private funds. If people want to have parallel coverage they can do so but the basic rates will be stable'. Nobody says that any health coverage system is free but there should be an equitable system meshed in with the wage system. Unquestionably, people in the trade union movement such as Cliff Dolan would endorse those remarks. This matter was discussed in early exploratory talks that were held but the Prime Minister backed off. I have no doubt that the stabilisation of such a vital cost factor in the economy would have been a bargaining point. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I refer to the European model. It has never been infra dig for European governments to subsidise a basic commodity, whether it be potatoes or meat. During the latter stages of the Chifley Government and at the end of wartime controls subsidies were hard to apply. Economics can be simplified for the trade union movement and the people at large to understand if there is a component in the Budget of x million dollars to keep such things as meat and potatoes accessible to people. That is a good selling point if a government wants a controlled economy. This Government has always backed away from this point. Some of the drivel contained in this statement indicates that the Government will say to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that there have been sizable changes in margins and, therefore, it cannot adopt a general wage. The Government cannot go to the ACTU or to the people at large and argue as we have argued at times about whether private enterprise has been a little greedy in claiming depreciation of plant or whether it has always done the right thing. In the final analysis, the wage earner who has no other income has very little flexibility when he gets his assessment notice at the end of June. We all know that some people have to pay a little more than they anticipated. They can negotiate to pay by instalments within a certain range. But people who have income from other sources-I was about to call them the buccaneers of commerce, but I may transgress and, in deference to you, Mr Deputy President, I will change that term-have a greater manoeuvrability to stall or delay concerning their taxation obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Prime Minister wants industrial peace he can do a number of things. Firstly, by having a more developed computerisation of our manpower statistics, he would be able to foreshadow industrial demands. Secondly, a more across the board effective redundancy scheme should be implemented. Another factor is wage relativity. It is no use harping and badgering the trade union movement. Many of its militants today, such as the air traffic controllers-I assure honourable senators that they are not affiliated with my party although some individuals might vote for the Labor Party and it is their right to be swinging voters- cannot be saddled as being puppets on a string, run by the Labor Party. I assure the honourabe senator from Queensland who is sitting on my left that, although she was not in the chamber when I spoke before the suspension of the sitting, I asked:' Who are the militants'. Let us take the role of the National Country Party in the federal electorate of Dawson when the miners had a problem with John Howard about whether they should pay tax on certain rent concessions for working in distant places. Pinkie Lester, who was more militant than anyone else , was a member of the Country Party. The honourable senator is nodding her head so I accept that she agrees that there are justifiable stoppages and strikes. The honourable senator is now in a dither. Pinkie Lester said there were and he has not divorced himself from that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear a lot of drivel about which group is more holy than the other in regard to industrial relations. It comes back to a theme I have often talked about. In a better educated society Jack is as good as his master. I do not care how eloquent a trade union leader is. There is a tendency-I suppose it is good in a democratic society-when a union has put in a submission for someone to ask: ' What about Clause C? Does it mean this?'. The union secretary will say: 'I think it does'. Someone else at the back of the hall will get up and say: 'I move that you come back in a couple of days and tell us just what it means'. We all know the art of negotiation. I would not expect a union secretary to go to the first meeting and to say: 'This is what we meant' because he would not have got that undertaking from the employer. We talk a lot about collective bargaining. There should be a bit of give and take. Honourable senators may imagine that if there is a stoppage on one day the union, the judge and the employer will get together and the union will go back to its members the next day and say that everything is apples. It does not work that way. Five honourable senators could sit outside and have a cup of coffee together. We all regard ourselves as reasonable people. But if honourable senators opposite think that we could reach a settlement in an hour's time, I can assure them that it does not work that way. If it does not work in a small dimension how do people expect it to work on a broad industry basis. There is no way that it will. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the duration of stoppages in this country has never been comparable with those in some other countries, notably that of the longshoremen in the United States of America and one or two other areas. This document has supposedly been produced by a sort of modern day political St Paul. It is the message before we get the legislation. Opposition senators, such as my leader, Senator Button, have shown wisdom in dealing with this matter. The problem should be taken in a proper way, firstly, by accepting intelligent mergers of trade unions in given areas with a minimum of delay. Decisions should be reached by the rank and file members. Secondly, the Government should take a good hard look at future basic wage assessments, consider some way of including health coverage as a component and not ignore food subsidies. If it does so it will get a better response from the trade union movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a ministerial statement on wage determination and industrial relations put down in the Senate by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), representing the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner). Yesterday, I picked up a copy of that day's edition of the Daily Commercial News and Shipping List. This paper contains a four-page supplement giving the current and pending strike status in Australia and overseas countries. Three of the four pages cover Australia. Thirty-four current disputes and 44 pending disputes in Australia are listed. Is it any wonder that, as the Minister said in the statement, the simple truth is that the people of Australia are fed up with strikes? 'Enough is enough' are the words the Minister used. I repeat and confirm them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Figures for the days lost in the September 1981 quarter have recently been released. They show that 1,147,000 working days were lost in Australia during that period. Industrial disputes in the sea transport industry cost Australia an average of almost $1.5m per day for each day of 1981. That means that over $500m -half a billion dollars-were lost in one industry in one year in this nation. That represents over $35 for every man, woman and child in Australia. The year 1981 concluded without one single day being completed which was free of disputes affecting at least one sector of shipping. One strike, the flags of convenience bans by maritime unions, resulted in the loss of 2000 ship days at a cost of $ 25m and delays of as long as four months for ships trying to load at Newcastle and Port Kembla. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ships off Newcastle and Port Kembla are Neville Wran's navy. Thirty-odd ships are anchored off the New South Wales coast almost permanently. Yesterday there was a report that over 50 ships were anchored off the coast, being kept waiting by the maritime unions. Not only are they losing time but also we are losing our coal export markets because confidence in Australia, as a dependable supplier, has been severely shaken. During this period costs to Australian shipping operators have significantly increased by contributions to insure against strikes. It has almost reached the stage where the club of insurers is refusing to insure Australian shippers. Until January 1982 Australian operators were paying more than double the average premium. In January 1982 new increased premiums were imposed which will again substantially increase the burden which these shippers have to pay. I know that honourable senators opposite tend to think that this is just a matter of some company paying a fee and it does not concern them at all. But the ultimate result is that Australians have to pay the cost. Whether importers or exporters pay the burden in the first instance, ultimately every Australian, every man, woman and child in this nation, bears this cost. One shipping company has just given Australia away and withdrawn its services from the Australian trade so we have even less competition in that industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite remarkable that the Australian Labor Party leaders have remained strangely silent about these disputes. Apparently they are quite content to allow our private enterprise in Australia to be slowly strangled by these activities. The Wran Government in New South Wales has even entered into sweetheart deals with some unions in the power industry, thus reducing the hours worked from 37 to 35, well knowing that the consequences would be flow-on demands in private enterprise. Yet despite giving in to union demands, what has happened in New South Wales? There is turmoil in the very industries in which the Government entered into arrangements with the unions. The transport, oil and power industries in New South Wales are in absolute chaos and the reason is very simple. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wran has now finally lashed out. We all know what the reason is. It is the extremists within the union movement and the extremists within the Australian Labour Party, the left-wingers in the organisation, who have created these problems for Mr Wran and the people of Australia. They have created problems wherever the ALP manages to get into government. They create problems for the ALP and for the nation. Now Mr Wran has finally agreed to lash out. I do not know why he lashed out at this late stage. Perhaps it is because the New South Wales State election is over. But whatever the reason his attack is long overdue . No one would disagree with his statements about the lunacy and bloody- mindedness of some union leaders, or his statement that 'union leaders do not give two hoots for the public or for their fellow workers'. He is right in saying that some elements of the union movement seem determined to kill the goose that laid the golden egg-in other words, to kill his Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales, under Labor, has become the strike capital of Australia. In the June quarter of 1981, 53 per cent of the industrial disputes in Australia were in New South Wales. In February 1981 over two-thirds of the working days lost in Australia were in New South Wales. In the first 10 months of 1981 44 per cent of working days lost in Australia were lost due to strikes and industrial stoppages in New South Wales. Over the same period that is almost two-thirds more than in Victoria. Mr Wran's performance is in marked contrast to that of the current Victorian Premier, Mr Thompson, who has demonstrated his talents with the difficult industrial disputes at Newport and Loy Yang, with great success. He is to be congratulated for his success in resolving those disputes. Of course-</PARA>

This nation was being bankrupted by his own left wing. Mr Wran has finally given us an outburst but what have we heard from the Federal leaders? What has Mr Hayden or Mr Hawke said about these things? They have remained silent. Telecom Australia and the Australian Postal Commission employees ran a strike in November and December 1975 but not a word was heard from Mr Hayden or Mr Hawke. There were disputes in New South Wales coal and power industries and ongoing waterfront and seamen's disputes but not a word was heard from either of them. Of course Mr Hawke knows all about the problems of the left wing because when he was the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions he failed to implement the ACTU's new rules for control of the union movement. Under the left wing influence Mr Hawke was unable to implement the ACTU's rules. The result under his presidency was chaos. I will compare that with the well organised control of the ACTU when it was under the presidency of Mr Albert Monk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ALP can offer nothing but the same formula that failed in 1974. Few aspects of our national life cause more concern to Australians than the state of our industrial relations. An atmosphere of confrontation which Australia is unable to afford pervades our industrial relations. Constant strikes have brought inconvenience and frustration to our citizens and the loss of wages to workers, whether directly involved or not. The productivity of enterprise has suffered immeasurable damage and Australia's trade and balance of payments have been harmed to a dangerous extent. Even Mr Wran finally acknowledged a tendency on the part of many unions to strike first and talk afterwards. Australia's record is indefensible when our relative prosperity is taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite these massive losses to our productivity throughout the nation, this is still a highly prosperous nation. Let us consider the value and quality of our houses, the furniture in our homes, the television sets, the cars and boats. If honourable senators really want to know how wealthy this country is let them look at the size of the dogs which people keep walking around the streets of our capital cities. It is unbelievable to be confronted with dogs which stand three feet six inches high. Sometimes there is not one but two dogs; that is how wealthy this nation is. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has produced this paper and in it he has suggested a formula that could significantly improve the basis of our industrial relations. It does not seek unnecessary conflict with the unions but rather industrial peace. The three main ingredients of the proposals are as follows: Firstly, the right of employers to stand down workers who, while not on strike themselves, cannot be usefully employed because of strike action by others, secondly, amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to remove preference to unionists clauses; and thirdly, encouragement of the formation of unions based on industries or enterprise.

Senator LEWIS-I take strong exception to ALP senators standing up in the middle of my speeches and having that nonsense written into Hansard. It is only done for that purpose. If anyone in due course reads Hansard he will say: ' Lewis was reading his speech'. That is absolute nonsense and the honourable senator knows that.

I hope that in due course there will be some development of worker participation in industries. I believe that this is the big possibility for the solution to our industrial problems. It may very well be that enterprise-based unions, which the Opposition apparently so strongly opposes, will lead to worker participation in industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard Senator Lewis make an attack on the trade union movement. He said that all industrial disputation in this country was of their making. It is my belief that governments should keep right out of the industrial relations arena. If governments, Federal or State, want to improve industrial relations then I believe that they should vacate this area completely. The Federal Government could play a valuable role in industrial relations by improving trade union training courses and by training the employers of this country in industrial relations. Never in all my life have I seen worse management than exists in Australia. I think there is a lot to be desired in management in this country. I think the Federal Government could play a role in setting up training facilities for improving management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A lot has been said about improving industrial relations. It is my firm conviction that industrial relations will improve only when conciliation really means something in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Many people refer to this Act as the Arbitration Act. They forget that 'Conciliation' comes before ' Arbitration'. Firms that have taken an interest and consulted with the unions at their work place have overcome the problems that exist in industrial relations. Fletcher Jones and Staff Pty Ltd is one of those firms; there are many others. It is because it has not been beyond management's dignity to go on to the shop floor and converse with the workers to find out what their problems were that many of these firms have overcome industrial relations problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that collective bargaining is one of the ways forward and should be investigated. I worked in probably the most turbulent of all industries, the waterfront industry. I was one of the people who encouraged the union to go into collective bargaining. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has not got worse. I believe that it was because of mismanagement by management that industrial relations problems escalated. When sensible agreements were worked out in 1967 with the employers, they thought that they would probably do away with the numbers of waterside workers if they allowed them permanency in their jobs. Sensible agreements were made. Unfortunately some people in the employers group thought they could farm work out to people outside the industry. They gave work to the storemen and packers outside that industry. That was the worst thing they could possibly have done. We told them so at the time. Within 12 months they had more industrial disputation outside the waterfront. They would not allow amalgamation with the waterside workers. Today they are looking at that quite differently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There should be industry unions. If industry unions are not allowed to be formed we can never have industrial peace. The fact is that employers come to agreements with the major unions and they forget about the little groups of people who belong to the multitude of other unions within the industry. That is their downfall; there is no doubt about that. I was Acting Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation of Port Adelaide. We had come to a sensible agreement. Three people were supplying fuel to the waterfront in that port. Employers would not give them reasonable conditions comparable with those enjoyed by waterside workers in that port. The employers were prepared to close that port rather than give satisfactory conditions to those three people. I went to the employers and virtually told them what to do. People in all parts of an industry should belong to the one union. When collective bargaining is finalised no section of an industry will be forgotten. It is natural that, if a wage rise or better conditions are given to one group of people, turmoil will be created in other sections of that industry. That is what is happening. Many employers are blind to this. I believe there should be better training of employers as managers and for unions. Many unions and many employers have not been educated enough to be able to negotiate. Until the day comes that they are educated we cannot expect better industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial relations in this country have been used as a political football. I believe that that is the worst aspect of it. Governments, both State and Federal , have used and encouraged strikes to overcome all sorts of difficulties. They then go to the people and say that the problems are the fault of the workers, the strikers. Not one worker whom I have known over the years has ever wanted to go on strike. He has been forced to go on strike. </PARA>
<PARA> The conciliation and arbitration court system is so jammed up that if one makes a claim to the court it is nothing to have to wait for three, four or five years to have it heard. Until one goes on strike one cannot even have a matter heard by a court. That is the truth of the matter. If we have to rely on th arbitration court system I believe we will never have industrial peace. It is up to the trade union movement and the employers. I believe that no attempt should be made to go to an arbitration court. </PARA>
<PARA> There should be collective bargaining. People should work out the problems together. Workers should understand the problems of an industry. More information should pass from management to labour. If that happened, there would be less intrigue and there would be more contentment. People who work in an industry and who are prepared to give their life's work to that industry are entitled to some security. They are entitled to know whether that industry will be profitable and whether it is selling its products. Nothing should be hidden from the employees in an industry. There should be a working relationship. There are many ways in which management and labour can and should get together. There is nothing wrong with the Australian worker. I have seen many workers from all over this country. If they have been led by decent, capable men who can deal with workers, industries have progressed. I believe the Australian worker, given a chance, is the best worker in the world. </PARA>

The average person in this country is reasonably well educated and healthy. We have huge mineral resources in this country. We can supply all the food we can eat and we export large quantities. If a sincere attempt were made to arrive at better industrial relations they could be achieved, but while industrial relations are used as a political football by trying to implement laws in this place, better industrial relations will never be achieved. There will always be mistrust and anxiety. People involved in collective bargaining do not have a judge to blame. If they accept a bad agreement they can blame only themselves. I believe that is the answer. We should involve people. It is ridiculous; no worker wants to take out of an industry more than it is possible to take out. What is the sense of killing the goose that lays the golden egg?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said before, workers in this country want security and a reasonable return for their labour. Many industrial problems are caused because many matters are hidden within an industry, and that should not be the case. There should be more open negotiation and better forward planning. Information should be given to the workers in an industry. I believe that is the way in which we can overcome the problems. The problems will never be resolved by legislation. A lot of hard work is involved in resolving them. All the claptrap that has been put down in the Parliament is rubbish. The only way in which we can come to some sensible solution is for the Government to put some more money into training unionists and employers. There is no other way. The more people we bring into an industrial dispute the longer that industrial dispute takes to settle. My experience is that the people involved in disputes should keep away from lawyers and governments. The employers and the workers are the only people who should be able to work out those problems. The problem is always made much worse by bringing in a third party. If we refer to the history of the trade union movement we see that when disputing parties kept away from lawyers they were far better off. Governments have no place and no role to play in this situation. The worst thing a government ever did in the waterfront industry was to establish the stevedoring industry authority. That was the biggest thorn in the side of the employers and the workers. I do not believe that the involvement of a third party improves industrial relations one iota. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to improve industrial relations. The whole of Australia can improve; we can make it a better country. People do not want to go on strike but they are forced to do so because of the system. Many people who have knocked the trade union movement in the past have forgotten what the trade union movement has done in Australia. It has brought about a better and fairer sharing of the wealth of this country. If anyone thinks we can work without a trade union movement, he should look at countries where trade unions are not allowed to operate freely. In those countries 90 per cent of the wealth is owned by 10 per cent of the population. It is a disgrace how dictatorships restrict trade unions . Do we want to happen in this country what is happening today in Poland and other places like that? We hear members of the Government continually knocking the trade union movement. Instead of trying to help overcome problems they are creating problems. The Utah strike in the coal industry was never warranted; that should never have come about. People who work hard in isolated areas should have a tax rebate on their housing. People who work on railway lines in the middle of nowhere and live in terrible conditions should get cheaper rent. Why should they be charged a higher rate of taxation because they get that benefit? That was a ridiculous strike. There was also a strike in Western Australia caused by Court's terrible legislation which provided that if more than three people held a meeting they could be fined. A group of unionists held a meeting in an open paddock. They were not interfering with anyone. The leaders were gaoled. If honourable senators think that that type of attitude will bring about better industrial relations they have another think coming. We can never have peace in those conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments should get right out of the industrial relations area and encourage workers and employers to get together to work and to build good products. I believe in people working when they are at the work place. Both employers and unionists can do a job. This country can do much better; there is no doubt about that. Legislation or ministerial statements such as this one will not help at all. I do not believe that this Government has seriously looked at solving the problems. The Government wants to use industrial relations as a political football. That is unfair, unjust and unwarranted. That is not the way in which to solve the problem. There are better ways, and it is about time we started to pursue them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia has often been called the lucky country. Most of us take this assessment as a self-evident truth, although its author actually intended it ironically. If looked at from outside-by Singapore, say, or Japan-we must seem to have everything going for us: Immense natural resources, an homogeneous and well educated population, negligible racial frictions, plenty of space and sunshine, a very strong strategic situation with no discernible threats. What more could any nation want? Yet to those same foreign countries we seem to have a desire to destroy ourselves. Insane industrial disputes seem to be the order of the day: 'A tinge of lunacy', as the New South Wales Labor Premier, Mr Wran, said. Strikes are destroying our reputation overseas as a reliable supplier. Our living conditions suffer through transport strikes, power strikes and mail strikes. The list seems endless. Perhaps the most useful service Telecom Australia could provide would be a dial- a-strike service. Yet to foreigners, and to an increasing number of Australians too, these strikes not only harm an enormous number of people but also they do not do anyone any good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apparent wage gains are soon eaten up by wage induced inflation. Unions try to leap-frog other unions with catch-up claims and the whole business starts again- as if it had ever stopped. More and more Australians are feeling that there must be a better way of getting fair wages and conditions of employment. They feel helpless. Industrial action seems to be above the law, above community interests . Things certainly will not be changed by anti-strike marches, though these are an indication that the public is fed up with strikes, nor will they be changed by tinkering piecemeal with the law, trying to impose a solution. We must solve the problem by reaching a consensus of reasonable people-there are plenty of them- and on the process isolate the totally unreasonable people. There are not as many of those as some people think. </PARA>
<PARA> What is wrong with our system of industrial relations? The first and in many ways the most intractable problem is the 'them' and 'us' attitude between labour and management which we have largely inherited from Britain. The idea that the job of the employees is to oppose the management whatever the cost may be was perhaps summed up in a poem by Henry Lawson called 'The Old Unionist' which had the old unionist saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't know if the cause be wrong,</PARA>
<PARA> Or if the cause be right-</PARA>
<PARA> I've had my day and sung my song,</PARA>
<PARA> And fought the bitter fight. </PARA>

<PARA> The boys are driving at,</PARA>
<PARA> But I've been Union twenty years,</PARA>
<PARA> And I'm too old to 'rat'. </PARA>
<PARA>That irrational attitude is what is doing immense damage to a rational approach to our industrial relations. Somehow-the government must give the lead-we have to break down this 'them' and 'us' confrontational attitude. One way in which this has been exacerbated-I regret to say this particularly as a distinguished lawyer is in the chair of the Senate-is by the excessive legalism of our industrial relations procedure. That too uses the confrontational adversary system of 'them' and 'us' to try to solve industrial problems. That is very damaging in trying to achieve a reasonable consensus. The revolutionary, Jack Cade, who led a revolt in the reign of Henry VI said at the start of his revolution or so Shakespeare had him say: 'The first thing we must do is to kill off all the lawyers'. I think that might be going a little far, nevertheless in the field of industrial relations it would not be a bad start. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those with law degrees. I think there are some bush lawyers around who would, no doubt, survive. Nevertheless, we have to get away from the excessive legalism of our industrial relations problems. The adversary system which is the basis of British law does immense damage to the sensible resolution of industrial problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second great problem that we have is in the number of unions. We have at the moment according to the last count-the count is always a little uncertain- 316 unions. This causes damage because there is an endless field of demarcation disputes. We can see this right across the Australian industrial scene-for example, on the waterfront and we have by far the worst waterfront record in the world; over half such disputes in the world occurred in Australia-or even in an activity like building the Omega tower in Victoria. Demarcation disputes are the most intractable problems that we have. But there is even worse than that. Any one of a number of unions which is dissatisfied can go on strike and bring an entire industry to a halt. The other unions involved, which may want no part of this and which may think the union concerned is totally wrong, are powerless to prevent that strike. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at this problem. If you want to travel by air any one of 11 unions could stop you-the unions of the airline hostesses, the flight stewards, the airline flight engineers, the air pilots, the transport workers, civil air operations and all the transport workers. If you travel by train any one of 19 unions might stop you. If you want to build a city building one of at least 20 unions could call a halt. If you want to build a ship no less than 10 unions are involved. The situation is absurd. If it did not exist no one would believe that any country would be so mad as to have it. This, of course, has given rise to what the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) has just introduced-a system whereby when one union goes on strike employers can stand down the members of other unions for whom there is no suitable work. That is, I think and I hope, a transition provision until we can arrive at a situation of having industry unions or enterprise unions where that requirement would not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that we badly need a single union involved with each enterprise. There are two approaches to this: One is the industry union system which is widely used in West Germany and Sweden and the other is the enterprise union system which is most developed in Japan. There is something to be said for each of them though for the Japanese system to work requires an informal negotiating system which is peculiarly Japanese and which would be hard to transpose into this country. Nor do I think the West German system of industry unions would be immediately adaptable to Australia. For instance, in West Germany there are only 16 unions covering what to us would be an enormous range of activities. Nevertheless, I think we can and should work towards having single unions for each enterprise. These would normally be industry unions but sometimes, where appropriate, we would accept-we must facilitate this-having single enterprise unions. I do not suggest for a moment that enterprise unions would be practical as the general solution to Australia's industrial relations problems. </PARA>
<PARA> How will we achieve industry unions? The Australian Council of Trade Unions' policy on this issue is transparently phoney. It says that it is in favour of industry unions achieved through a process of amalgamation. There is no way in which we will achieve industry unions through a process of amalgamation. Many existing unions-the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union is one simple example-extend across a range of industries by any definition. If we want to achieve industry unions we must do it by both amalgamation and by breaking up existing unions so that they can achieve a single union covering that industry. We must agree-I think the Government has to take the lead again in this-on what we are trying to achieve with industry unions and find what industries there are . I think, if we look at it, we will probably find that there are about 60 industries in Australia which would justify having a separate industry union. That must be the subject of discussion and agreement. When we introduce our legislation on amalgamations we must encourage those amalgamations which lead to industry unions and strongly discourage amalgamations that lead away from industry unions. If the ACTU is sincere it will strongly support the Government in that action. </PARA>
<PARA> The third great problem area is our wage settling procedure which at the moment is not working. I think most people would agree with that. The arbitration system has largely broken down. We have to look for a new system of wage settling. One solution that we must look at very carefully is enforceable contracts between management and unions in particular enterprises or particular industries where appropriate. At the moment a number of agreements of this nature have been reached but the ordinary common law remedies for breach of contract will not apply because under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act if a dispute occurs it will go to the arbitration system. We need an amendment to the Act to make enforceable contracts between management and labour for a prescribed period effective. That is a system which works reasonably well in America and one which we should look at very carefully in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth great difficulty that we have-it is almost a second feature of the ' them' and 'us' attitude-is the lack of worker involvement in management. To my mind there is no reason in principle why the suppliers of capital should have all the say in what goes on in industry or in enterprise and the providers of labour have none. What we must work towards is a system whereby there is balanced and appropriate representation influenced by both parties-not merely by a strike, no-strike mechanism from labour, but one in which labour can have a sensible input into looking at the way in which that industry can best prosper. During the last parliamentary session Senator Siddons raised a proposal to that end. I did not agree with that proposal, but I agree with his purpose. What we must look at-I believe the Senate is the appropriate place to do it-is how we can work towards that. Again, for that to be achieved will require active government action. </PARA>
<PARA> The final area of concern is the very weak position of the ACTU. Its normal reaction when anything happens-let us say a demarcation dispute between two of its member unions-is to wring its hands. What we have to do, somehow, is to give the ACTU more power, by legislation if necessary, but also to make it more responsible to the community, because a weak ACTU is a very bad thing for the community and for the industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I have outlined what I believe is wrong and what are the areas of concern in our industrial relations. They will not be solved quickly or easily. Many of them are ingrained into our system and our society. What the Minister has done is to tackle some of these problems. I think it is quite wrong to say that what he has done is confrontational. The people of this country are sick and tired of what is going on in our industrial relations area. They are looking to the Government to give a lead. I suppose one could say that any lead is bound to be confrontational. What we must do though as a government is to give a lead as to what needs to be done. What the Minister has done-I support what he has done-is to indicate that we will introduce the power to stand down employees for whom there is no work when industrial action has stopped the business of an enterprise. We have to understand that these proposals on stand down powers operate only if there is industrial action and employees cannot be usefully employed because of that action. If the unions accept the normal process of negotiation, of conciliation and arbitration, there will be no requirement for stand downs. </PARA>

But the unions are not so confined. The unions take it upon themselves-there is no legal restraint on them-to carry out actions far wider than those necessary for the wages and conditions of their members. They take political actions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps Senator Harradine and I can have a duologue on this. I said earlier when the honourable senator was not in the chamber that I am not opposed to compulsory unionism. I think it is appropriate if we can confine the union to dealing with matters that fall within its terms of reference or its proper sphere of action with regard to the wages and conditions of employment of members. Once it gets beyond that I think it is inappropriate to make the membership compulsory. I accept that in many unions there is de facto compulsory unionism. I would hate, for instance, to be a painter and docker in Victoria and refuse to join the union. I would watch my back very carefully when I walked around the streets of Port Melbourne. Therefore, that is a fact that we have to recognise. I would like to see this accepted as an interim phase, but that we should accept, if we can negotiate it with the trade union movement, that the trade unions will be legally limited to dealing with matters that concern their industrial behaviour. Then I would personally be prepared to support compulsory unionism. At the moment what the Minister has done is to accept the reality of the industrial situation as it is, where the unions are claiming far wider powers and activities than that. In those circumstances I do not think he could reasonably suggest that we should compel people to be members of the union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one other area in which I believe the Government must give a lead. People are looking for someone to try to sort out this mess. One other area in which the Government must give a lead is to set its own house in order. After all, the Federal Government is by far the biggest employer of labour in the country. It must set an example. Commonwealth public servants are a special type of employee. They are servants of the public. It is a clear absurdity for them to be striking against the public that they are supposed to be serving. In my view, such behaviour is as unacceptable as it is for the Defence Force to mutiny . </PARA>
<PARA> In compensation for the restrictions imposed by their special status, public servants have great benefits. They have-despite the Commonwealth Employees ( Redeployment and Retirement) Act-virtual job tenure for their working life, except for dishonesty or gross incompetence. Even in the latter case it is difficult to effect a discharge. They are promised 'fair comparability' of wages and working conditions. They have an extremely generous indexed superannuation scheme, of a generosity which could not possibly be matched by any employer other than the Government. Trans Australia Airlines, by a decision of the Whitlam Government, was obliged to give Commonwealth-level superannuation to employees. One can see that if it were to meet its requirements it would be bankrupt. There is no way in which a private enterprise employer could give the superannuation benefits that are available to Commonwealth employees. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been-or rather, there was-a long tradition that public servants did not strike. This has gone by the board in recent years, although, to their great credit, a large number of public servants, perhaps a majority, refuse to be involved in any such prostitution of their profession. The militants must not be permitted to have it both ways. If they want to use the methods of the industrial jungle to extort from the public they are supposed to be serving, if they want to extort pay and working conditions in excess of what the Public Service Arbitrator considers fairly comparable with private sector employment, then they must give up the special compensations they receive-their security of tenure, and their extraordinarily generous superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that all new recruits to the Commonwealth Public Service should be required to give a 'no strike' undertaking. Breach of this undertaking should result in instant dismissal. If they want to withdraw their labour, they should withdraw it right out of the Public Service. Existing public servants should be given an opportunity to sign a 'no strike' undertaking. If they do, they would deserve and continue to receive the compensating benefits of job security and superannuation. For those who refuse, and who, therefore, wish to be able to indulge in industrial blackmail, they should lose job security and should be forced into a special superannuation system, equivalent with those in private industry, with no indexation and with benefits related to contributions. This superannuation change could well save the taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars a year, which would be some compensation for the injuries inflicted on them by their so-called servants. Some may say that this would be a retrospective change in conditions. So it would, but the change came when public servants started to strike against the public. These changes would merely bring conditions into line with behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, of course, implicit in having a 'no strike' requirement for public servants that they be treated fairly as regards wages and working conditions. As I said earlier, the Government has accepted fair comparability between the Public Service and the private sector. The machinery must be checked to ensure that discrepancies come promptly before the Public Service Arbitrator. But the umpire's decision must then be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one final point on this issue. Work bans-the refusal to do particular types of work which are normally carried out by the public servant-are a most pernicious development. It is absurd that public servants should refuse to do their job and yet remain at work on full pay. Stand downs without pay should be automatic and immediate, not held in reserve and used after hesitation and with much telegraphing of the punch. A work ban is a form of strike, and it will not go away if one pretends not to notice it. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for what the Government must do to restore its reputation as a responsible employer. This is only one matter on which the Government must give a lead. What the people are looking for in this area of industrial relations is leadership from the Government. We do not want confrontation. We want discussion , understanding and improvement but we will get that only if the Government is prepared to give, as it is giving, a lead in the necessary changes in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hamer said a lot about 'them and us' and I certainly believe the situation is one of 'them and us'. I agree with him when he refers to the excessive role of lawyers in the industrial process. The statement made by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) is the most recent development in the confrontationist campaign to reduce the standard of living of wage and salary earners. The Fraser Government is responsible for the situation in industrial relations today. The background to this statement is that in the field of industrial relations the Government's program is based on double talk and misinformation. On 16 January the Canberra Times reported that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There was a strong indication of a softening of the Government's industrial- relations policy from legal sanctions to co-operation in an address by the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, in Sydney yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser told the national convention of the Young Liberals in Sydney that the establishment of a better industrial climate would be a major item for discussion at this month's talks with the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA>That story was spread throughout Australia. Tonight we have the Government's statement before us in this chamber and it is the complete opposite. It shows the bias against the Labor movement. It will increase significantly the industrial disputes in this country. The Government states on page 11 of the statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is no room for any general wage increases to be granted in the national wage case and there should be no return to indexation. </PARA>
<PARA>It should be remembered that in the 15 national wage cases since 1975 the Fraser Government has opposed the Australian Council of Trade Unions' claim every time in that it has not supported full indexation, despite the pledge by the Liberal Prime Minister in 1975. This Government now seeks an industry by industry solution, it says, but I will show honourable senators that this is far from the truth because the Government has a mixed bag of inconsistent propositions. Its strategy is still the same. With the usual euphemisms, the statement says that the industry by industry negotiations appear to offer 'a real chance of containing the rate of inflation'. In other words, it is an attempt to prevent wages increasing at all. The significance of this statement can only be judged when we examine the new weapon of the Fraser Government-the enterprise union. A union in every work place is the threat of the proposals in this paper. This is a probable result of Senator Hamer and other senators and government advisers going to Japan. It is an importation we do not want from Japan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister for Veterans' Affairs wants the Japanese company unions then we in the Labor movement certainly will not accept them. The Australian wage and salary earners will reject company unions. They are simply not acceptable. They are un-Australian. They are alien and they will be rejected by the Australian people. But the Prime Minister has released his kamikaze pilot . I do not know whether the Minister for Veterans' Affairs wants to join him. There will be a great deal of destruction in what this Government will do if it goes ahead with legislation based on this paper. The trade union movement must defend its coverage, its economic interest and the interests of people in competing companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us consider this proposal for a moment. In one street there could be two companies. One company could persuade its workers to join the company's union and there could be a complete mess because the companies could be doing exactly the same thing. From my experience as a former union official I can say that the first person to complain will be the company disaffected. It will complain about the company that gets an economic edge because of the exploitation of people in these so-called enterprise organisations. I well remember in the early 1950s a friend of mine in the advertising industry trying to form a union in that industry. He was going great guns. He had 800 people signed up when all of a sudden he realised that people were being encouraged by employers to join the company-style union because of the proposal for the Federated Clerks Union of Australia to be given coverage in the advertising industry. Of course, he immediately realised that he was being used and withdrew from the situation. The clerks gained that coverage. That is the sort of thing that will be occurring in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Enterprise unions mean turmoil in industry. Instead of the 300-odd unions we have now, the potential is for 2,000 unions. Anybody who believes in any order in the system-and that is what honourable senators opposite claim they believe in-should consider for a moment the paper work involved in such a situation. But , of course, they do not really want 2,000 unions. What they want to do is to weaken the trade union movement. The enterprise unions, so-called, are just the opposite to the policy of the Australian Labor party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. No decent trade union organisation would allow people to be denied the resources of research and advocacy that the official trade union movement in this country represents at the moment. It is most mischievous of the Minister for Industrial Relations to say on page 19 of the statement that the objective in the paper is similiar to the objectives of the Labour movement. In practice the position is that industry-based unions come as the result of painstaking discussion and negotiation. The Liberal-National Country Party governments have caused difficulties in this process. The current frustration of union amalgamation is the result of this Government's anti-union bias. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak with some experience in this area. I was involved in the State and national discussions between two printing unions as the Secretary of the New South Wales branch of the printing trade union. In fact over six years of careful negotiations and the use of the democratic process we amalgamated the two printing unions. The result was the Printing and Kindred Industries Union, a union that my colleague Senator Tony Mulvihill correctly congratulated on being the result of a proper amalgamation process and a union that was then capable of dealing with the tremendous problems of technological change in the newspaper, magazine and other sections of the printing industry. That would have been impossible without the amalgamation of the printing unions on an industry basis. This is the sort of policy that is carried forward in the ACTU and Labor Party platforms. It is the sort of union that gives protection to people all over Australia, whether they be in large or small enterprises. It is the sort of organisation that we need in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's paper will only create anarchy. The Government's proposal contains the concept of a potential of 2,000 unions. I think we should consider for a moment what company unions mean. The use of the threat of sacking people or the taking away from them of reasonable promotion possibilities will be the order of the day. Conversely, union activists in a company union can expect all the worst jobs and even little things such as not getting overtime. Anybody with industrial experience knows that there are a hundred ways of discriminating against people who are activists in trade unions. The Viner plan invites racism. Every type of person can be disadvantaged. Women, people of ethnic backgrounds, the old, the young-all are vulnerable under the proposal that this Government puts forward because they will all be members of company unions in which there will be perhaps 100 people. Who would be the secretary of a small company union of fewer than 100 people? I suggest that the identikit picture of the secretary of an enterprise union is that of a pannikin boss, a crawler or some other person of that nature-certainly the sort of person who is unacceptable in the labour movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The trade union movement is berated in the Minister's statement. The vast majority of people in the trade union movement are fine Australians serving their colleagues and their country. The officials of trade unions in the vast majority of cases bring to an individual factory skill and objectivity. They also personify all the other people in that industry. That is the very thing that this Government wants to take away with its proposal for company organisations. That is the very thing that Australian workers will reject. </PARA>
<PARA> The paper that has been presented is a very interesting one. It has 23 pages. Because of my printing background I could not but look at the sub-headings. There are only two of them in 23 pages. The first sub-heading says 'What Lies Ahead'. Of course, the next paragraph gives it away, because it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policies over recent years have achieved considerable success in bringing about economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>What this Government says lies ahead are in fact the same lies that are behind it. Throughout the Minister's statement there is this continuing deceit about who is causing the problem. It is this Government that has destroyed the consensus on wage indexation. It destroyed it deliberately, and now the Minister says that there should be no return to indexation. For all its faults, indexation did give aid to workers in weak sections of industry. The Government destroyed that aid. Now it wants to destroy those workers' organisation totally by forcing them into tame cat enterprise unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the rise in industrial disputes is simple-living standards are falling. The Fraser Government is responsible. Recently interest rates have risen to record levels. We must not forget that as interest rates rise, so do repayment rates. Even worse, home buyers who may have a loan that takes up to, say, a quarter of their wage would need to get a wage rise four times greater than the rise in interest on their loan. This is compounded by the lack of tax indexation whereby, because of heavy taxes, workers need a rise significantly higher than the rate of inflation to stay afloat. The Government has said a lot about inflationary expectations. But what about tax expectations? The Government 's already severe cuts in the social wage of health and welfare benefits have been added to by sales taxes. This year the average household will pay $2,460 in indirect taxes in 1981-82 prices. On the same basis they paid only $1,950 in 1975-76. The major money lenders, the big banks, are doing very well out of those monetarist policies described by one cynic as tight money, loose regulation and a warm place to count the profits. That really is symptomatic of this government, but the banks are doing very well indeed. The results of last financial year for the big five free enterprise banks show a total profit of $ 531m, an increase of 30 per cent in one year. Over the past five years profits have increased by $370m, or well over threefold. Australians know who is holding us to ransom. Bank profits are far in excess of any wage increases or of inflation. Bank profits have in fact been increasing at about three times the rate of increase in average weekly earnings and average company profits over the last six years, as Maximilian Walsh points out in the journal Australian Business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government talks about union power. Which union has the power that the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd has at Whyalla or Port Kembla or that the banks I have described have? The top 200 companies get 40 per cent of the profits generated in Australia. The bottom 32,000 companies get the other 60 per cent. The Government has the power to prevent this but it does not do so. Instead it sabotages indexation and then attacks the unions, as it is doing at present. As I have said, it opposed every one of the 15 ACTU applications for full indexation in the national wage cases. It mouths words such as 'justice' and ' responsibility' when it really means wage restraint. That is the essence of the document before us today. It is, I suggest to Senator Hamer, a case of 'them' and 'us'. </PARA>
<PARA> Economic recovery is a mirage. The Government claims in the paper that over two years the economy has created a quarter of a million jobs. The facts are that this Government has created half a million unemployed at least. Inflation is up to 11 per cent and the Treasury itself blames the latest jump on 'a number of government taxes and charges'. That is the essence of current industrial unrest. The Government claims that wages threaten the recovery and that real wages have risen in the recent past. Looking at the long term we can see that since 1975-76 productivity has risen by 6 per cent and real wages have fallen by 2 per cent. The recent Treasury 'Roundup of Economic Statistics' says that growth in employment is slowing down. The Government's economic policy is a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 14 of the Minister's statement the Government refers to a recent agreement on wages and hours in the printing industry. The agreement provides for wage increases and reduced working hours in the printing industry. The Minister's opposition to the union's agreement with several thousand employers in the printing industry is an indication of the Fraser Government's attitude to a real agreement by people who know the problems of an industry. It gives the lie to the Government's claim that it is interested in industry agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's lack of planning in the field of technological change is incredible. It is well known. The productivity increases achieved through technological change have been dramatic. This is particularly so in the newspaper, printing and packaging industry. The Australian Financial Review on 11 March 1980 reported that in the printing industry in 1979-80 real wages were down by 9.1 per cent, employment was down by 6.9 per cent, productivity was up by 6.6 per cent and profits were up by 15.7 per cent. The Australian Bureau of Statistics pointed out that the basic tradesman's average real wage fell by $3. 38. At the same time, in 1980 the Australian Financial Review reported in its Survey of Annual Profitability report that four out of five companies had increased profits. Two companies in five had increased their profits from 10 per cent to 50 per cent. This Government cannot stop the movement of industries in this direction. I was a tradesman in this industry 20 years ago. The changes in technique and the increases in productivity that have taken place are incredible . Yet the printing industry dispute, if it can be called that, has been resolved by an agreement. Only five and a half working days were lost between April and October last year through industrial disputation in that industry. Essentially those days were taken up by report-back meetings with the people involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government is creating a smokescreen over industrial relations. Nothing is more typical than an article in last Sunday's issue of the Sunday Telegraph from the Murdoch stable. The article is headed 'Strikers' Wives get $ 2m'. Of course, it is a regurgitation of Senator Chaney's statement in this chamber last year when he mentioned six disputes and claimed that the community was subsidising them through the welfare system. Let us look at some of those disputes. One involved the Utah company, the profits of which were described in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday as 'enormous and amazing'. Honourable senators will recall the enormous funds this company shipped to its United States parent several years ago. There was no talk of preventing this blatant rip-off by the company. Another dispute mentioned by Senator Chaney involved Nabalco Pty Ltd at Gove. This company has recently been questioned by the Icelandic Government about alleged transfer pricing of profits out of Australia. What will the Government do about this? It is a case of 'them and us'. It is the difference between who the Government favours and what it is doing in the proposed industrial package set out in the Minister's statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on and on but the facts are simple: The Government does not give a damn about transnational companies. It thinks it is okay for Utah to ship $100m out of Australia in one year if Utah wants to do so. But if an industrial worker tries to get $20 a week more because he has to pay higher rent or higher interest rates on his home loan, because of rising costs of necessities, crippling petrol prices and, of course, higher taxation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be $50 the way the Government is going. The money means nothing if what is known as the social wage has increased. The cost of health care, the cost of education, the cost of every necessity of life have increased because of this Government's action. The Government's own advisers, in the report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Economic Strategy released in 1980, said just that. The report reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the overall burden of taxation (as a proportion of GDP) has increased. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the answer. Let us not hear any rubbish about taxation having fallen. This is quite apart from the crippling sales taxes that the Government has already imposed and seeks still to impose. It is undeniable that for the Government to attack wage and salary earners who try to defend their standard of living is cruel hypocrisy. Even more hypoctitical is the following claim on page 17 of the Minister's statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that no section of the community can be above the law. </PARA>
<PARA>What a statement! I shall repeat it:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that no section of the community can be above the law. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that any executive or professional with a good accountant is way above the law. Billions of dollars are slipping through to tax avoiders while the Government tries to tell us that only a few hundred million dollars-it's $ 973m-is involved. The people who are above the law are not the strikers and not their spouses but the friends of the Fraser Government. My authority on this matter is none other than Eric Risstrom, Secretary to the Australian Taxpayers Association. He estimates that tax evasion and avoidance cost the community $7 billion a year. This is one of the few growth industries in Australia. That represents $30 a week for every household in this country. That is where the $20 -or $50 according to the honourable senator-is chasing its tail, because $30 a week from every householder is being forgone by this Government. It is the friend of tax avoiders. It has introduced this statement in order to try to place the blame on to the shoulders of wage and salary earners. The Australian people will reject it. If the presentation of the paper has something to do with the Lowe by-election, the Government is acting very foolishly because it has tampered with something that is far too serious to be involved in a cheap political trick. I hope that the Government does not go ahead with the proposals foreshadowed in its statement. If it does it will do so at its peril. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President-(Quorum formed). I believe that the debate really centres on whether there is some connection between the present problems faced by the Australian people in relation to the economy and the industrial relations problem that is also faced by them. Firstly , I wish to make it perfectly clear that I am not talking about the types of union to which Senator Elstob was referring. I am not talking about the moderate unions which make up by far the majority of unions in Australia. I am not talking about the unions the executives of which are not interested in doing away with our democratic way of life. I am talking about the Halfpennys, the Carmichaels, the Gallaghers and those radical unions that we all know only too well. They are dedicated to the destruction of our way of life and the democracy that we know only too well. If there are any doubts in the minds of honourable senators opposite that what I am saying is true, let me refresh their memories of what happened two months ago. Senator Lewis referred to this matter but I will elaborate on it. An article in the Australian Financial Review stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Continued industrial strife on the Australian waterfront has forced the world's largest insurer of losses to shipowners . . . to take the unprecedented step of suspending insurance for ships operating in Australian waters. </PARA>
<PARA> The London-based Shipowners Mutual Strike Assurance Association has telexed the Australian Chamber of Shipping saying it has given one month's notice of termination 'to all its Australian members and to non-Australian members trading to that continent with bad records'. </PARA>
<PARA> In its telex the association expressed 'deep regret' with the move which, according to the Chamber of Shipping, will affect all major shipowners operating vessels to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The executive director of the Chamber of Shipping . . . said the decision means , that from 31 January 1982, shipowners trading to Australia will lose their strike protection insurance unless they are prepared to accept punitive loadings on premiums . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In its telex, the association said that cover would only be offered to prospective members if they were prepared to have claims arising in Australian waters excluded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Amalgamated Metalworkers and Shipwrights Union was responsible. We did not have in 1981 one day free of some major confrontation on our waterfront. When we have a reputation in the world like that, and when big companies say that they will not insure our shipping freight, it results only in more ships doing what some ships already do; that is, pick up our exports in Singapore. The ships will not even come within our waters. As I have already said, this results in higher freight costs and less competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some time ago I spoke in this place about the effect of the problems on our waterfront on the apple industry. I will refresh the memories of honourable senators on this matter. Let us compare Australia with New Zealand. The cost of loading a carton of apples in that country is $US.325. In Tasmania it is $US1.16 . The total freight cost to get that carton of apples to England is $6.50. What on earth will the lack of insurance on ships coming within Australian waters do to that amount of $6.50? No foreign ships will come to pick up our apples. What will the resulting freight increase do to the apple industry in Tasmania? It is already in a disastrous state. What on earth will the tremendous increase in freight do to our competition, with New Zealand, for example? Less competition will mean fewer jobs. Yet I have not heard one Australian Labor party senator mention the unemployment rate during this debate. They are just not interested. They did not mention unemployment problems at all. All they are interested in doing is increasing benefits to those people who have jobs. They are not interested in the fact that if our exports are less competitive more people will be unemployed and fewer jobs will be available. It did not enter their heads. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told every time we mention industrial relations that we are union bashing. As a matter of fact, Mr Hayden and Mr Wran did not get together with their public statements the other day. Mr Hayden accused Mr Fraser of union bashing because he dared to mention a few of the problems we have in this country with the unions. On the same news item, Mr Wran was quoted as saying that there was a touch of lunacy and that there might be some bloody mindedness within the union movement. He was not accused of union bashing by Mr Hayden, perhaps they were at odds with each other. As Senator Lewis said, the cost of these strikes is prohibitive to this country. We are losing $1.5m a day on the waterfront. Senator Lewis went into the details even more thoroughly. The cost in wages to the unionists alone is prohibitive. The unionists themselves do not want to go on strike. It is the executive-the Halfpennys, the Carmichaels and the Gallaghers-which forces the unionists into striking. </PARA>

If we dare mention any of those radical unions we are told it is confrontation. Of course, it is never said that the unions might be indulging in a little confrontation. It is always this Government which is indulging in confrontation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 8 December Mr Carmichael announced that he had a new metal trades agreement. He was very careful to say that the new agreement was a great step forward but the union would not give up the right to strike. It would give up the right to strike for dollars but it would not give up the right to strike. That is very important. He has assured us that the union is giving up the right to strike on wages but not on political matters, because political matters will bring down this country when unionists take it into their own hands to take political decisions which are nothing to do with a true union movement. On 9 February, in conjunction with Mr Hayden, he said that his union had had a rethink about the dollar strike because now it wanted a social wage. What did Mr Hayden do? Mr Hayden welcomed that statement by the AMWSU. He welcomed Mr Carmichael when he said: 'Good. This is what our Labor Government wants'. Mr Carmichael, for some reason or other, thinks that he only confronts this Government when he indulges in a campaign for a social wage. Whenever he indulges in any campaign at all he naturally hurts his own members, who lose wages, and he also hurts employers. We could not possibly give any credence to any promise that that man is likely to give. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party have said that they will not support the stand-down clause. This has already worked and worked well in the Public Service. For some time now we have used the stand-down clauses and they have been effective. If 10 people out of a work force of 200 employed by a company or business go on strike and thus prevent the remainder of the work force working, I see no reason why those 190 employees who do not have a job to do should be paid just to turn up. I believe that if we introduce this stand- down clause those 10 striking employees may think twice about putting all their mates out of a job. I think there would be enough pressure from their mates for them to say: 'Think again. Let us act through the arbitration court and not take strike action'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) said in his statement that there should be more equal bargaining. We know-and I am sure that Senator Elstob would agree-that whenever the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission hands down a decision employers abide by it. They never say: 'We are not going to abide by that. We are going to lock our doors'. The employers have never done that but the unions do it whenever they feel like it. When the Arbitration Commission brings down a decision the unions abide by it if they want to; if they do not want to abide by it they say: 'Not on your life. We will go on strike'! What sort of equal bargaining power is that?</PARA>

In 1974 in Labor's term there were 6.2 million days lost through industrial disputes. I ask the honourable senators to compare that figure with the figures either before or after 1974. In 1980, the last year for which we have full data, 3.3 million working days were lost.</PARA></TALK.START>

Today we have had lessons from the Opposition on what we should do. But let us look at the record and we will see who has the worst record.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do not tell us how we should work. Do not tell us you are crash hot on industrial relations. History proves that the Labor Party is no good and that at least we are doing something about the situation. I have dealt with the need for standowns. I think the Australian people believe that they are justified. Standowns have worked within the Commonwealth context and I believe they will substantially help industrial relations generally. I turn to union amalgamations. It seems there is some sort of agreement between the Labor Party and the Liberal party on industry based unions, but there we seem to part company because Senator Childs has said that the Labor party does not believe in enterprise unions. He did not say why. He just said that he did not believe in them.</PARA></TALK.START>

I believe that we can have successful enterprise unions. We do not need to amalgamate to get them. As was said earlier, I can foresee that perhaps Fletcher Jones and Staff Pty Ltd could set up its own union. It has worker participation that is the envy of a lot of companies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have certainly read Hansard. It is legislation that we discarded and voted against and I certainly have never been in agreement with it . I do not believe we should say that only 25 per cent of a union need vote and that if only half of those vote for amalgamation then amalgamation will take place. This results in only 12 1/2 per cent of a union having a right to say: ' We will amalgamate'. That sort of democracy is not the sort of democracy that I am interested in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to voluntary unionism. I am well aware that voluntary unionism is not one of Senator Harradine's pet hobbies. I believe he justifiably puts forward his views. If we look at the matter we will see that it is a question of philosophy. The Labor Party, being a socialist party, feels that people should be forced to do certain things that a socialist government believes they should do. We as a Government say that we believe people should be able to please themselves. We do not believe that people should have to join an organisation if they do not want to join it. Every time I hear people say: 'We will force people to belong to an organisation', I object. Compulsory unionism means that if one does not join a union one does not get a job. I cannot go along with compulsory unionism. Union preference is, I believe, compulsory unionism because unless one belongs to a union one does not get a job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, I disagree entirely with Senator Harradine's concept. I believe that our philosophy which states that nobody should be forced to join a union is 100 per cent right. The last thing I want to mention is the present situation that exists in New South Wales. Mr Wran, in New South Wales, played along with unions in the Electricity Commission of New South Wales. He said to the unions: 'Righto, we will give you a 37 1/2-hour week'. That was in 1980. In 1981 it was down to a 35-hour week. Now what sort of position is the Electricity Commission in? Those workers promised extra productivity but what has happened? All maintenance has been put aside. With a 35-hour week there was no way that they could carry out the maintenance in the time required. Now Mr Wran says that he is sorry that electricity is not available but that it is all the fault of the unions. Indeed, it was all Mr Wran's fault. If Mr Wran had not handed down a 35-hour week then the maintenance would have been carried out and New South Wales would not be in the situation it is in. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 18 January 1982 which Senator Gietzelt might find interesting states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In November, 1980, Neville wran, under attack from the Opposition over the introduction of a 37 1/2-hour week in the Electricity Commission, invited the people of NSW to make a comparison between electricity supplies in NSW and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> ''So bad has been the planning under a Liberal Government that, within another two and a half to three years, Victoria will face a bleak prospect of intermittent blackout,'' the Premier said. ''That cannot be said in NSW.''</PARA>
<PARA>What has happened now? New South Wales is buying electricity from Victoria. So much for the industrial relations of the Premier of New South Wales. He handed those workers a 35-hour week in return for promises of extra productivity but they cannot carry out the necessary maintenance in a 35-hour week. As a result that State has ended up having blackouts that are absolutely disastrous. The Australian Labor Party is dead scared of touching the unions. The Labor Party will never mention union irresponsibility. It is dead scared it will lose the money it receives for elections if it does. It is supported financially by radical union mobs and it is dead scared of being critical of them at all. It is a sorry state in this country when the union movement absolutely runs the Labor Party because of financial commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to my original point. I have proved that the economy of this country is ravaged by industrial unrest. Completely irresponsible unions are, not accidentally, but deliberately, trying to destroy our way of life. If the Government does not take some action then I believe that it is irresponsible. We will not be intimidated by the Opposition accusing us of union bashing every time we open our mouths about these unions. We will not be intimidated; we will take the action we need to take. I believe that that is the responsible way of going about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter the debate at this stage not only because of the misrepresentation by Senator Walters of my position relating to preference, but also because I believe the stand-down proposition will be totally discriminatory to my State of Tasmania.

However, I cannot pursue the debate at this point because I will be seeking to adjourn the debate at this time.

<PARA>By way of explanation for honourable senators who are taking part in this debate which has been sprung on the Senate at a late hour this evening as a result of the important debate that has been going on on industrial relations having been taken out of the hands of the Government, we are now proceeding to deal with amendments to the Archives Bill which reached Committee stage some time ago. Many amendments to the the Bill have been foreshadowed by the Government, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. The Senate Clerks have very helpfully prepared a detailed schedule of these amendments clause by clause, identifying Government amendments in printed form, Opposition amendments in small type and Australian Democrat amendments in large type. </PARA>

I think this will facilitate progress in what will be a rather difficult technical exercise which surprisingly has been thrust upon the Senate, contrary to the arrangements of the day, at a late hour this evening. The first three amendments on the list are Government amendments to clause 3. Their object is to exclude bodies established under a law of Norfolk Island from the operation of the Archives Bill. This is in accordance with the Freedom of Information Bill and recognising that Norfolk Island is in the initial stages of transition to full self-government and that access to government information is a matter for local administration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Amendments 4 and 5 on the consolidated list are the first Opposition amendments in what will be quite a long process of consideration of the Archives Bill by this chamber in Committee. I very briefly, though I will not enter in any sense into a recap of the second reading debate given the time that has elapsed, indicate that the Opposition, whilst commending the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) for bring in an Archives Bill which at last gives a statutory framework and a legislative scheme for the Australian Archives to operate under, and agreeing in princple, finds that much of the Bill is deficient in that the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs have in so many instances-some 35 that the Opposition is concerned about -been ignored. It is in relation to those 35 recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee that the Opposition will move its amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that point because I think honourable senators on all sides of the chamber ought to be aware that the amendments to be moved by the Australian Democrats or by Australian Labor Party senators are not of their own whim or fancy or in any sense partisan. They are simply bringing to the chamber recommendations from the Senate Standing Committee which is itself a bipartisan committee of six distinguished members of this chamber under the leadership of Senator Missen, in the case of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, and former Senator Davidson in the case of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. All these amendments are brought forward on behalf, in a sense, of those Senate standing committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments 4 and 5 are to do with definitional clauses and simply insert in the definition of 'Commonwealth institution' the words 'the Executive Council' and the words 'the Governor-General'. Later on in the Bill where the words 'records of a Commonwealth institution' occur that has the effect of ensuring that records belonging to the Executive Council and the Governor-General will come within the purview of the Bill. At the moment only records belonging to a Commonwealth institution as defined in clause 3 came within the purview of the Bill. 'Commonwealth institution' is defined in the Bill as:</PARA>
<PARA>a body, other than a State, established by or in accordance with the Constitution, including the Senate, the House of Representatives and the High Court;</PARA>
<PARA>Records of those institutions are records of a Commonwealth institution. Records of a department, of a Federal court or a court of a Territory will come within the purview of the Bill. Records of an authority of the Commonwealth and records of the Administration of a territory other than the Northern Territory or Norfolk Island-this will be covered by a government amendment to be moved a little later-are included under 'Commonwealth institution'. We propose that records belonging to the Governor-General and the Executive Council should come within the purview of the Bill. We will explain in greater detail later when we come to the substantive clauses dealing with the attempt by this Bill to exclude records of the Governor-General and the Executive Council why that should be so.</PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, we are dealing here with records which are 30 years of age or older. I emphasise that point. We are not dealing for example with records of the Governor-General or the Executive Council of a currency in political terms; we are dealing with historical documents which lie probably at the very heart of the history of this nation. Records of the Governor-General and of the Executive Council must be the very essence of the history of the governments of Australia. For that reason we believe that 30 years-or 25 years after 5 years if an Australian Democrats amendment to be moved in a moment passes-should be available for consideration by historians and by those who have an interest in our history. This is merely a definitional matter but it is the first of those matters which arise out of the Senate commitee reports. I commend the amendments to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not go into the substance of the matter before Senator Missen if he wishes to speak ahead of me. But I have a difficulty. It is one that will arise throughout consideration of this complicated series of amendments because we are now dealing with amendments which are part of a series of amendments that raise some major issues of policy in relation to the Archives Bill. On the face of it one of the amendments seems simply to be widening the definition of 'Commonwealth institution' to include the Executive Council. There may be some debate for and against that. To debate this in that narrow way would really miss the point of what the amendment is about. The amendment is part of amendments which have wider policy implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to waste the time of the Committe by debating whether the definition 'Commonwealth institution' should be expanded to include the Executive Council without us really debating the issue why the definition of ' Commonwealth institution' is to be expanded to include it. I raise this as a matter which I think the Committee perhaps ought to consider. We have a first amendment which is one of a series of amendments which are scattered throughout this long list and are not grouped together. It has been decided that we will not proceed in that way. Nevertheless we do not want unrealistic debate on a particular amendment. I suggest for consideration of the Committee that when we have an amendment like this which is one of a group we have a policy debate in relation to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I indicated in my opening remarks that indeed I realised that in a sense we were not merely dealing with a definitional clause but that, in fact, this would have repercussions throughout the consideration of the Archives Bill. We are bringing about a situation in which, wherever the words 'records of a Commonwealth institution' occur throughout the Bill we will be referring, amongst other things, to the possibility that records belonging to the Executive Council or a Governor-General will become subject to the Bill. Everyone knows what the clauses of the Bill purport to do-they purport to make available such records to the general public as of right after the lapse of 30 years, as the Bill is presently drafted, and perhaps after a quarter of a century after five years if the Australian Democrats amendment is accepted. I would have thought it was perfectly plain, so that when one comes to read about the ability of the Archives to seek the transfer of record of documents from a Commonwealth institution to Archives it will now include the records of the Executive Council or Governor-General. Everyone can comprehend that. That is the nature of the definitional section. Where it is stated that all records in the possession of the Archives or a Commonwealth institution in the open access period shall become available to the public as of right, we now know that amongst other Commonwealth institutions, such as this Senate chamber or the High Court which is presently provided for, we additionally will include the records of the Governor-General or the Executive Council. That is the nature of the definitional section.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to why the records of the Governor-General or the Executive Council should be available, I simply reiterate the point that was made in evidence time and again by historians before the Committee, namely, that to exclude these records would be like trying to understand-I think this is what one of the historians said to us-the history of a company without having the minutes of the board of directors. Here we have the very essence of the governance of this country. Therefore it is extremely important that they fall within the purview of the Act in a way which, if other amendments are carried as put forward by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, those records will be available, as I said, as of right. At the present moment the Bill purports to exclude entirely from the operation of the open access provisions records of the Governor-General and records of the Executive Council. Furthermore, it does so conclusively. There is no way at the present moment whereby an historian who wants access to those records of 30 years of age or over can go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and seek a reversal of the decision to prevent him from having access to those documents. The fact is that we are here setting the basis in a definitional clause, as is necessary at the beginning of the Bill, for those further amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I desire to speak briefly on this amendment and to indicate my attitude to the whole series of amendments that are before the chamber during the committee stage of this debate. Honourable senators have to understand that the committee stage of this debate follows the fact that of the three Bills, the two major ones were referred to the Senate Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which reported in November 1979. I was Chairman of that committee. I refer to the report which is before us-a very massive report. It was one of the largest investigations ever done by a committee of this Parliament. I stand by the recommendations of that committee. There are many features of the Archives Bill which are in the same area as the Freedom of Information Bill, in particular those relating to access to documents . Other aspects of the Archives Bill were referred to the Senate Committee on Education and the Arts which was chaired by Senator Davidson. I am not referring to the amendments that relate to that area, but I am concerned with the recommendations which that Senate Committee unanimously made and which are contained in the report. That committee consisted of three Liberal senators- Senator Hamer, Senator Puplick and myself-and three Labor senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition amendments are mostly a reflection of the implementation of the recommendations of the Senate Committee. It is true that a number of the Government amendments also do that to a certain degree. It should be explained that after the report of that Committee, when a new Bill was brought into the Parliament for freedom of information and for Archives, discussions took place between a number of Liberal senators, the Government and the Attorney-General ( Senator Durack), which ultimately resulted, in the course of the debate on the Freedom of Information Bill, in some compromise proposals which the Liberal senators accepted. Some of those proposals, particularly in regard to a documents review tribunal, have been transferred, quite appropriately, into the Archives Bill in accordance with that agreement. Consequently, as far as the Government amendments are concerned, I have no problem in supporting them. I think they are proper. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there are detailed negotiations with the Government and agreements were reached as far as the Freedom of Information Bill was concerned, we well know that that Bill has not yet passed through the House of Representatives. I trust that it will do so without any further delay. As the Bill left this chamber it did not incorporate all the agreements which were entered into with the Government by Liberal senators. I regret that. I have spoken about that and did so before I went overseas in June of last year. I have not ben successful in getting into that Bill those amendments, which are mainly related to public interest clauses. I am pleased to see that those amendments are in the Victorian Government's Bill. Regrettably, therefore, the record of the Government with respect to the completion of agreements with Liberal senators over the Freedom of Information Bill is unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as this Bill is concerned, I have endeavoured for some nine monts to engage in discussions with the Government over the Committee's recommendations and the Opposition amendments when they came along. I have been unsuccessful in having any such discussions. Therefore, I do not propose to vote down amendments which my Senate Committee recommended unanimously. I believe that the recommendations in that report are still as sound today as they were when we delivered that report in November 1979. Since I have not had the courtesy or opportunity of discussing the matter or of finding out why they have been rejected-if they have been rejected; I suppose I must conclude that-I am afraid that so far as I am concerned I propose to abstain from voting on all the amendments relating to the implementation of my Committee's report. Basically, those are most of the amendments which the Labor Opposition is moving. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats take this matter into different areas. I am sure that there is considerable merit in a number of their amendments. But these are not matters which my Committee has discussed. They are not matters which have been discussed by the Government. I do not propose to support those amendments. The result of this will be, I think, that possibly some amendments will be carried and the Government may not be willing to accept them. If so, the Government can explain to the House of Representatives why they will not be accepted. No doubt those amendments may be taken out in the House of Representatives. If so one must accept that that is as far as the Government wants to go and that is as good a Bill as we need.</PARA>
<PARA> We need to pass the Archives Bill through this Parliament. It has been delayed terribly. It is still here nine months after it probably should have been concluded. From this point of view I do not propose to engage in any detail in this debate. I will take an interest in the debate. Therefore, I propose to abstain from voting on the Labor Party's amendments, to oppose the amendments of the Australian Democrats and to support the Government amendments. I hope that the Government may see fit still to accept some of the recommendations that the Senate Committee put forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we leave clause 3 I would like to seek an assurance on a particular matter from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). Before I do, perhaps it would clarify things and perhaps even help the Whips if I make clear where I stand as a member of the Senate committee which made a number of recommendations on this Bill. I stand by the recommendations. I think they were correct. They would make this a better Bill. On the other hand, as General Wolfe once said: 'War is an option of difficulties.' So is politics. I think we need an Archives Bill urgently. I think this is the best Bill we are going to get. I think it would be better if more of the recommendations of the Committee had been incorporated. Nevertheless, I am prepared to vote for and to accept the Bill as it is. When I say 'as it is', I mean with the Government's amendments which go a fair way, but by no means completely, towards adopting the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I leave clause 3 though, I would like to raise an issue that is causing great concern in the film industry, and that is the possible damage to the film archive of the National Library. It would be highly undesirable if we set up two competing film archives. The National Library film archive is an admirable organisation. It must be supported and must not be subverted or damaged by having a rival organisation in the Australian Archives. I would like an assurance from the Attorney-General. This assurance is necessary because the definition of 'record' on page 3 of the Bill provides for the inclusion of film 'that is, or has been, kept by reason of any information or matter that it contains or can be obtained from it or by reason of its connection with any event, person, circumstance or thing'. As that definition reads, it would appear possible for the National Archives to demand and keep films produced by the Australian Film Commission, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Film Australia and other government producers. I think it must be made quite clear- and I ask the Attorney-General to do so-that this is not the intention of the Government and will not be the intention of the Australian Archives. Certainly the Australian Archives keep microfiche or film records in documentary form but films which are produced for exhibition, for viewing by the public, must not be part of the film archive. They must be part of the National Library archive. I would like an assurance from the Attorney-General that that will be the policy of the Government in this matter. </PARA>

I hope that Senator Missen will extend the same courtesy to what we are doing here. But I understand; all of us here are slightly scarred by the trauma of the Freedom of Information Bill. I see the preface to these comments in this Committee stage as being due to that. With your permission, Mr Chairman, I simply call honourable senators' attention to the appalling and disgraceful way in which the Government used the closing hours of its control in this place to force through an enormous number of useful areas of the Freedom of Information Bill which ought to have been debated and discussed in this place but which were not.

I would hope that because of that we would have some hope for the future of the world and that we might be legislating for a time which is a good deal more liberal than our present time. Let us as least hope that it is not less liberal than at present. I feel that we would be justified in this place in at least having that degree of liberality whereby we felt that with caution we could achieve it. With all due hope, I do not think we will get terribly far beyond the Bill. Whatever little things we do I think will not change the course of history very substantially or shake the earth. On that basis, I think it only reasonable to expect that some amendments should be allowed to pass. I hope the Government sees the matter in that light rather than in a purely obstructive light. I think it would be terrible if that happened with this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, I would like to refer to clauses 4 and 5. I find what Senator Tate has said pursuasive. He is right. There is no reason why the Governor-General in Executive Council should not come within the purview of this Bill. If indeed there are reasons-and I think this is the key to the way in which we approach this matter; it is certainly the way in which the Australian Democrats will look at it-we would like to hear them. At this stage, and before we vote on the measure, I would like to hear from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) good and cogent reasons why, indeed, well into the twenty-first century, records involving the Governor-General in Executive Council should not come within the purview of the Archives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak only briefly, in part to allay some of the fears of Senator Mason and also to anticipate some of the things which might be said by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). I invite the attention of honourable senators to consolidated amendment No. 26 which the Opposition intends to move and which provides a regulation-making power, subject to approval by each House of the Parliament, especially to protect certain records of the Governor-General and records in the possession of a court. This measure has been included in the amendment in particular because the Committee found that there was a case for protecting correspondence between the Monarch and the Governor-General-of course it is protected in the United Kingdom by vice -regal rules of 60 years' secrecy and so on-and also certain records in the possession of a court. The latter is a reference to judges' notebooks and so on; but it is irrelevant for this immediate purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment contains some provision for a regulation-making power, with the concurrence of each House, to enable certain records of the Governor-General to be protected. I wanted to make that clear. Otherwise, the purpose of the definitional section being altered in the way in which we propose is to enable, in later operative sections of the Act, those documents to come within the purview of the Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal first with the point raised by Senator Hamer in relation to the definition of 'records ' which includes film. Concern has been expressed by a number of people as to what is the purpose of including the word 'film' in the definition of 'record' for the purposes of the Archives Act. Fear has been expressed that this will expand the role of the Australian Archives into the area of preserving film and having a film library, and that this would duplicate the work that is being done in this regard by the National Library.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to assure Senator Hamer and the Committee and all those who have been concerned about the matter that that is not the intention of the Government or, indeed, of the Australian Archives. The reason that the word 'film' appears in the definition of 'record' is that some departments have kept normal departmental files in the form of microfilm. Many departments have highly classified records in film form which are a necessary and integral part of their administrative activities. They must be treated under the conditions of security appropriate to their nature and therefore can only be provided for by the Archives. Only films produced by Commonwealth agencies are Commonwealth records. Films produced for commercial purposes by non-Commonwealth agencies are not Commonwealth records and do not come under the provisions of the legislation. In the broad, the matters of concern raised by Senator Hamer will not be the policy of the Archives. Indeed, such films will not be within the normal definition of 'film' that appears here. There might be an area where consultation and ministerial agreement between the Archives and other relevant authorities is necessary. That would be in relation to commercially-produced films with the production of which the Australian Film Commission is associated. Where the Commonwealth, through that Commission, makes grants for scripting or production of those films, there would be no question of Commonwealth ownership. In cases where the Commission invests in a film production along with commercial interests it might have a degree of ownership depending upon the legal basis on which the investment was made. But I understand that the Director-General of the Australian Archives and the National Library are agreed that they can and will negotiate on these matters as necessary. Therefore, there is no need to change the definition that appears. I want to make it very clear that it is certainly not the intention of the Government to change the present arrangements. Indeed, I doubt whether in most cases there would be, under the definition, any power in the Archives to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the substance of the amendment moved by Senator Tate. The Bill as proposed proceeds on the basis that records of certain institutions will not be assigned to the Archives for custody purposes. The amendment proposes to extend the definition of a Commonwealth institution in a way which would cut across the policy which has been adopted by the Government. The intention has been that Executive Council records and records in relation to the Cabinet, the parliamentary departments and the courts generally would not be assigned to the custody of Archives. The reason for that is the special nature of such records. The records of the Executive Council and of the Governor-General are in a particularly sensitive and special category and arrangements have been in place for some time in relation to their custody. The United Kingdom Government and the Queen would have a very close interest in those records, and different arrangements are made in the United Kingdom from those made here. For instance, Palace records, I understand, have a closed access period of 60 years, not the 30 years under the arrangements here. </PARA>

I have dealt with Executive Council records, which are the subject of the particular amendment, but there are other documents of a sensitive character such as Cabinet records. It is the Government's view that such records should be retained within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and not be deposited with Archives and that the records of the parliamentary departments should remain there.</PARA></TALK.START>

I believe the success of these arrangements and of the attitude of the Government is shown in the fact that of all Cabinet records generated between the foundation of the Commonwealth and 1950 fewer than 200 have been exempted. The vast majority of such records are made available. I know that the amendment, if accepted, would provide a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and that, therefore, different rights would be created in relation to access, if it was refused. But it is not the Government's policy, as I have indicated from its past practice, to hold all but to hold only a very few records of this kind after the open access period of 30 years. Under the freedom of information legislation, when it is passed, anyone who is refused access will have the opportunity to take the matter up with the proposed Documents Review Tribunal and that Tribunal will be able to make its public recommendation to government. The pressure that we discussed in relation to the Freedom of Information Bill will be brought to bear on governments in that way. So, it is not true to say that the decision will be entirely one of government. Although it will be made by government, it will have that very strong influence of the views of the Documents Review Tribunal. The Government's attitude is that the actual custody of these records should be retained in the hands of those who for good reason have custody of them now, and that in the long run the amendment will not really affect access, after the open access period, to the vast majority of documents in this category.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to raise a matter which I believe concerns Queensland residents who have paid more income tax than necessary because of an ambiguous instruction on income tax forms. Resident taxpayers are entitled to a concessional rebate of 32c for each dollar of allowable concessional expenditure greater than $1,590. Concessional expenditure includes such expenditure as medical and associated expenditures, funeral expenses, education expenses, rates and land taxes, life insurance premiums, superannuation, adoption expenses and calls paid to afforestation companies. This evening, however, I will deal with just education expenses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The maximum rebatable amount which a taxpayer may claim for each dependent student is $250. On the 1981 income tax return-indeed, since 1977-taxpayers have been instructed to 'subtract Government assistance for fees and books'. Prior to 1977 taxpayers were instructed on the tax form to subtract the level of Federal Government assistance received. There is a real difference between deducting Federal Government assistance and deducting government assistance. In Queensland -similar situations may prevail in other States-the State Government grants a textbook allowance to secondary school students. The allowance varies from $20 a year to $60 a year depending upon the year of study. Since 1977 many taxpayers have been deducting the amount they have received by way of textbook allowance from the education expenses of their children. When the instruction on the income tax return is 'subtract Government assistance for fees and books', this would seem to be a reasonable course of action. One taxpayer who did this in Queensland was not convinced that he should have done so and asked to have his last three returns reviewed. He was subsequently granted a refund because he had included in his tax return the amount he had received by way of textbook allowance. At about the same time I wrote to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) about this general matter. In part, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer replied:</PARA>
<PARA>He-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Commissioner of Taxation-</PARA>
<PARA>advised that a specific provision of the income tax law authorises the reduction from a claim for education expenses of the amount of any allowance received or receivable under a scheme for the provision by the Commonwealth Government of secondary scholarships, technical scholarships or assistance in the education of isolated children. This is outlined on Page 2 of Schedule 'A' of the Income Tax Return Forms A or B. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner went on to say that payments received from the State Government for book allowances are not treated as scholarship benefits or assistance and do not have to be subtracted from education expenses claimed as concessional rebatable expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is clear that taxpayers are not required to deduct State Government book allowances from expenditures they have incurred on behalf of their dependent children. Yet because of the way in which the tax form is worded some parents are obviously deducting these amounts. Some remedial action is necessary. Firstly, the Government must admit publicly that this wording on the income tax return form is ambiguous and invite taxpayers who may have been misled to ask for a review of their income tax assessments. Secondly, the Government must ensure that when the next income tax form is printed the word 'Commonwealth' or 'Federal' appears before the word 'Government' on the form. This will make it clear to those who are receiving State Government assistance for books that they should not subtract this amount from their education expenses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to this debate will be short. The subject matter is directed to you, Mr President. I was unhappy about the interference tonight by a gentleman from another place, who is a Minister, who had an animated conversation with a member of the Senate from the gallery behind me. On previous occasions about 20 years ago, not long before I came into this place, I happened to be in the other House when a similar sort of thing took place as members were filing into the chamber for a division. That matter finally finished up before the Privileges Committee because a member of the goverment of the day raised the matter with the Speaker. From memory, I think it was in 1960. In 1975 an honourable member from another place came into this House and spoke from the gallery in front of me to a member of the then Government. He also was required to submit an apology to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I realise that the Minister concerned, Mr N. A. Brown, and the Senator concerned, Senator Archer, are both comparatively new to the parliament. I realise that they probably do not know their Standing Orders. I was saddened by the fact that during the counting of the division when I could have raised it but did not because I did not want to interfere with the counting, you, Mr President, had looked around the chamber on several occasions and you failed to see this animated conversation going on. I was under the impression, in fact, that the visitor from another place sitting in the gallery was trying to persuade the senator to come and vote with the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The dignity of this place has to be maintained and it is the responsibility not only of you, sir, but also of honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. If that is not maintained then any Tom, Dick and Harry can come into the galleries and conduct a conversation during a division and persuade people to change their vote if they are able to do so. I do not know whether that was the subject of the conversation tonight, but it was audible and it was witnessed by me and members of my party as we sat on your right hand during that division. I hope that this will not happen again. I am not asking for the matter to go to the Privileges Committee. I am seeking your assurance that it will never, ever be allowed to happen in this chamber while you occupy the very dignified and high office of President. </PARA>
