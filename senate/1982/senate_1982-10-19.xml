<PARA>(1) The latest estimate by the Australian Taxpayers' Association is that $7,000m a year is being lost in taxation revenue;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Ordinance extensively amends the Canberra Showgrounds Trust Ordinance 1976. The Canberra Showground Trust has been reconstituted as the National Exhibition Centre Trust and the showgrounds renamed as the National Exhibition Centre. It also strengthens the powers of the Minister for the Capital Territory in the areas of oversighting of policy and the letting of contracts, removes the Trust's borrowing power and the requirement that members of the Trust be selected from the members of nominated bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main reason why we sought to have this Ordinance disallowed was that it would have removed the requirement for the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly to be represented on the National Exhibition Centre Trust. The showgrounds here in Canberra cater primarily to the needs of the local community and are used mainly by local organisations for activities. </PARA>
<PARA> I could not accept the argument of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) that 'with recognition of the national role of the centre, and the wider scope of the proposed uses, it is no longer appropriate that representation on the Trust be tied to specific bodies'. As Canberra is the nation's capital many of its community facilities fulfil a dual role-to meet the needs of the local population and to serve the purposes of the nation. As this particular community facility fulfils an important local need, even if its national role were to be enhanced as envisioned by the Minister, it remains essential that the Assembly be able to scrutinise the affairs of this major community facility to ensure that the needs of the local people are also being met. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning I received a letter from the Minister for the Capital Territory advising me:</PARA>
<PARA> I am prepared to undertake to amend the Ordinance to make provision for the appointment of an Assembly member on the understanding that the motion to disallow the Ordinance will not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of this advice, I am prepared to withdraw the motion to disallow the Australian Capital Territory National Exhibition Centre Trust Ordinance, 1982. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That Business of the Senate, Notice of Motion No. 1, standing in my name and relating to the disallowance of the National Exhibition Centre Trust Ordinance 1982, be postponed till the next day of sitting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the announcement of Sir Phillip Lynch's intention to resign as the honourable member for Flinders. While we very much regret the circumstances which apparently forced Sir Phillip Lynch to resign, I ask why his resignation has not yet been given. If he is unable to continue to represent the electorate of Flinders effectively, should not the Government move promptly to enable a by-election to take place, or is the electorate to be left without adequate representation while the Prime Minister weighs up the prospect of an early general election?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The question of a date of resignation from the Parliament by Sir Phillip Lynch is a matter for him, as it would be for any other member of this Parliament. I have no doubt that he will make up his mind about that. When his resignation has been lodged, it is a matter for Mr Speaker to determine the date of filling the seat of Flinders. Only the Labor Party-largely, of course, through Mr Bob Hawke, who was rather keen to be a leader-has been promoting the idea of elections. I notice its anxieties. Beyond any doubt, if it went to the electors, as in the past it would be defeated and it would be back in lesser numbers where it is now in the Parliament.</PARA>

Time after time after time, the Australian Labor Party in this chamber is opposing good industries. For example, there is opposition to mining areas of South Australia including Roxby Downs and now uranium enrichment is opposed. I am aware of the keen interest of South Australia, and indeed, I think, of Queensland, in securing such an industry. I want to make it perfectly clear that that industry, which functions in a number of countries, is regarded, in relation to health, as a very safe industry. It is seen as one which presents no more threats to health than any chemical industry; it is not in itself a radioactive industry; and in fact uranium hexafluoride has a lower radiation than yellowcake and indeed lower than the ore itself in the ground. So, one must stop the kind of scare tactics that the Labor Party is constantly putting up. I repeat: A uranium enrichment industry, functioning as it does in a number of countries, has high health standards, has offered no threats at all to health, and is a chemical industry which--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ah, we are now talking about the commencement date. This is the Labor Party again knocking and knocking. A uranium enrichment industry has two characteristics. The first is conversion, whereby the yellowcake is converted under particular temperature by gas fluorine into uranium hexafluoride, a white powder. It is then spun in centrifuges so that the differing atomic weights of U235 and U238 are separated, so that the approximately 0.7 per cent of yellowcake is enriched to about 3.7 per cent. Whilst I am mentioning this matter, I give the lie to any thought that such an industry could be a weapons industry. It could not, in any way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The industry would have enormous benefits for the particular State. I am told that it would employ some several thousand people to construct the plant, with at least 600 to 800 people permanently engaged directly, quite apart from the indirect benefits of all the ancillary industries. It could be integrated, and of course would be if it were in South Australia, with Roxby Downs or Honeymoon because those metal minings depend upon not only mining any one metal but also extracting copper, gold and uranium, as a balance, to earn a profit in a world which is cost conscious at this moment. So it would in fact be a significant thing in the integration of an industry.</PARA>
<PARA> I can only commend the Tonkin Government for its striving to get industries. I repeat: What South Australia has been suffering from is those 10 or 12 years or so of Labor State government when industries were repelled from the area. Now, of course, there is excitement that there will be industries coming to the State , with of course the foreshadowing of a liquids pipeline coming from the Cooper Basin bringing another major industry to South Australia.</PARA>

<QUESTION PAGE="1543" SPEAKER="Ray Sen R." NAMEID="UI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Social Security. Is it a fact that child care bodies funded by the Commonwealth Government are required to cater for disadvantaged families but that funding from the Commonwealth is insufficient to make up the shortfall caused by this special provision? Is it a fact that a majority of the 165 community child care bodies in Victoria funded by the Commonwealth Government will show a financial deficit in their operations by December this year? Will the Government give an undertaking that in its review of child care funding arrangements it will provide for additional funding for occasional child care facilities?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1543" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a rather odd three-part question because the parts do not relate in any way to each other. However, I will try to pick up the disparate points raised. It has been a requirement of the Commonwealth since, I think, 1976 that Commonwealth funded child care facilities should give priority of access to certain high need groups. The Prime Minister and the then Minister for Social Security both made statements in regard to this area, indicating that people such as sole parents, new migrants and others with a particular need for child care should be given priority of access. In addition, the Child Care Act provided for additional subsidy to be available for those having priority of access and there was also a provision for assistance to be given in cases of high economic need. One of the difficulties in the administration of the program is picked up by the second part of the honourable senator's question. The amount of the additional subsidies was stipulated by the Child Care Act and it is a fact that sometimes it was not possible for organisations to provide an adequate subsidy to admit those on very low incomes. I am sorry that the honourable senator has not bothered to read the material issued by me at the time of the Budget, which made it clear that we would be introducing a new form of subsidy, a special economic needs subsidy, which would give the child care centres much greater flexibility in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should mention to the Senate that we will, of necessity, be feeling our way because we do not have sufficient statistical material on the incomes of those using child care centres to be able to say precisely what levels of subsidy will be required, but already users have been circularised and advised that as from 1 January they will receive quarterly in advance a subsidy at the rate of, I think , $10 per week per effective full time child in each institution. This will enable organisations to start giving additional subsidy to economically needy cases. That will be monitored by the Department of Social Security in conjunction with the organisations and the amount of subsidy paid will be adjusted according to need. It would be envisaged that some child care centres catering for a substantial number of clients not in economic need would need less subsidy than others catering for people with greater economic need. The change in funding procedures, which will not take effect until 1 January, will not affect any deficits currently being experienced by centres but it should significantly increase the flexibility of centres in dealing with economically needy cases after 1 January. I regard that as a very important change in our approach to the funding of Commonwealth subsidised child care centres.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the third part of the question, which related to occasional care, I must say that I have considerable sympathy for the point made by Senator Robert Ray. In fact, until recently the established priority of my Department has been to provide full day care in priority to other forms of day care. That has been in accordance with the general professional advice available in this area. My own contact with users, particularly in suburban areas and not least in the western suburbs of Sydney, has convinced me that there is probably a high social need for occasional care in many of those areas and I would see it getting a rather higher priority in allocations than perhaps it has received over recent years. That is a matter which reflects my own experience of having contact with people seeking an extension of our activity in child care and I do think that for a very substantial number of mothers the occasional access to child care facilities can be of very real value and importance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been pointed out in the question, many hundreds of child care organisations are receiving subsidy from the Commonwealth. The extent of the subsidy is known to those organisations. It is their individual responsibility to budget to fit within the subsidies available. Additional economic need subsidies are available to organisations and some may be able to get assistance in that way. But in general it is the responsibility of the organisations concerned to budget within the confines of available assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>

The need to import drought fodder for stock inherently has some problems, apart from the cost, associated with it, particularly with regard to the importation of noxious insects, weeds and plant diseases. Does the Australian Wheat Board have a legislative requirement to keep back supplies of feed grain situated in areas adjacent to the regions where livestock are traditionally grazed, as a national insurance against drought?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations: Is the Government or the Minister aware that workers of International Harvester Australia Ltd-a wholly foreign owned subsidiary which like other multinational corporations has most likely repatriated millions of dollars of profits-are having a battle to secure their retrenchment pay? Is the Minister aware that the decision of the Supreme Court in Victoria yesterday means that retrenchment pay due to the 2,500 workers of International Harvester is secure only so long as the company is in receivership and not in liquidation? Is the Minister aware that if any of the lenders-as they are legally entitled to do-applies for and wins the appointment of a provisional liquidator to International Harvester, any priority for retrenchment pay will disappear, which would result in workers receiving only 25 cents of every dollar they are entitled to in retrenchment pay?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question asked by Senator Chipp is very complex and involves the possibility of change to company law in Australia, which is clearly a matter for consideration by the Attorney-General. I will therefore ask Mr Macphee to examine the question asked by Senator Chipp and to consult with the Acting Attorney-General to enable a sensible response to be given. On the introduction to the question, I observe that there is nothing in the law, of course, which puts a foreign owned subsidiary in any position of advantage when compared with any Australian company or employer. From that point of view, I do not think the fact that International Harvester Australia Ltd is a foreign company is particularly relevant. I do not think it is helpful, either, to refer to the possibility of profits being repatriated overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On what information is available to me, this is not a situation where some foreign company is taking money out of Australia and waxing fat on it. The fact is that the International Harvester parent company as well as its Australian subsidiary is in difficulty. I do not think it is a case where a surplus of assets is stashed away somewhere which would amount to some abuse of the position of the employers in Australia. I understand the reasoning behind the question. It is proper for us to be concerned about the position of those employers. It is proper for us to be concerned about the position of suppliers and other people who are probably creditors of the company and who would similarly have welfare problems in the event of obligations not being met. In all of these cases where substantial commercial concerns run at a difficulty and that difficulty is real, it is unlikely that the problem can be solved by some mere legislative change. The point raised is a serious one and I will see that the relevant Ministers get a chance to consider it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister representing the Minister for Health consider that the Federal Government is right to intervene on behalf of taxpayers in Victoria over the Victorian Government's levy on health insurance? Is this State levy intended to streamline the process of payments for services for out- patients in hospitals?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the move by the Victorian Government to impose and collect a levy, as has been set out by Senator Hamer. I am also aware of the fact that despite the professed purpose of the levy to finance out-patient services in Victoria, the levy will in fact collect twice the cost of the liability which the funds have for the services which are rendered. In other words, the Victorian Government cannot claim that it is using the levy simply to recoup the costs of providing the services; it is using it also as a general revenue raising measure. This was referred to in some of the newspapers. I note that the Age newspaper in its editorial acknowledged that that is one of the purposes. The levy is to a significant degree a fund raising exercise by the Victorian Government for the hospitals in that State. It is an imposition which it is imposing upon people who contribute to health insurance in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government believes it is essential to take action to protect the insured public and taxpayers against excessive health cost increases wherever they occur. The Government believes it has a responsibility under its insurance powers to protect the interests of contributors. In this case, with the levy being in excess of what can be reasonably put down as the cost of the services provided, it is our view that the only way to protect the rights of contributors is to oppose the levy. We believe, in any event, that general levies do not represent the best way of going about recovering the cost of delivering these services. We observe that the Victorian Government has failed to collect charges from insured patients for out-patient services at the point where the services are given. This is something for which the Victorian Government itself must answer. The imposition of an excessive levy in the way which is being proposed is one which will disadvantage those who contribute to health insurance funds in Victoria. It is for that reason that my colleague has made the announcement that he has. The Commonwealth will seek to take action to prevent this occurring.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I said before regarding the New South Wales Government's cost of electric power is, in fact, quite correct. Recent surveys have shown that the price of industrial electric power in New South Wales is astronomical, not only in Australian terms but also because it is regarded as being amongst the highest in the free world. That is a record that is hard to keep up with. That statement has to be made against the background of what I said earlier. Since Senator Elstob has reminded me, I pointed out that the Wran Government went to the electors on the price of its electricity and the availability of excess electricity supply. It said two things: First, that in New South Wales electricity was the cheapest in Australia and would remain so and that is demonstrably wrong; secondly, that New South Wales, if it elected a Wran government, would have a great capacity to produce excess electricity and thus would be able to create full employment by attracting additional manufacturers who were electricity consumers. In fact, the very reverse is true. New South Wales could not operate its installed capacity and did not have any excess electricity at all. What I said is abundantly right. The fact of the matter is that, in contrast to that, the Tonkin Government has gone out to get industries, is showing that it is able to attract industry and is showing that it is able to draw from the Cooper Basin the condensates by pipeline to establish a petro-chemical industry in Whyalla.</PARA></TALK.START>

I repeat, in case the insinuations are there: I have never had any Rundle shares or any other shares other than one very slight venture quite some years ago-10 or 20 years ago. I have no shares. I have no interests at all. Nor is my family in any shareholding situation. That interjection was made because, in response to Senator Elstob, I was pointing out that in contrast to the Australian Labor Party the South Australian Government of today has developed a vigorous approach to attracting new industries. I repeat: The opening of Roxby Downs, with its great potential, the identification of new mineral findings in recent times and the identification recently of some potentially useful coal deposits are all good news for South Australia. The South Australian Government is vigorously pursuing these things in the face of a Labor Opposition which aims to stop Roxby Downs and to stop uranium enrichment and which is out to see that the people of South Australia do not benefit from its great potential. I think it bodes very badly for Senator Elstob to try to compare South Australia with New South Wales.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lajovic asked, first, whether I am aware of certain general concerns that have been expressed. I am aware of them. Indeed, they are the subject of discussion and comment by Ministers for Education when they meet at the Australian Education Council. The training and preparation of teachers within any State are, of course, primarily responsibilities which that State bears although we, through the colleges of advanced education and the major role they have in teacher training, have a major interest as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that changes are going on in the demography of Australian school students. We have a reducing number of students in the primary school sector while we still have an increasing number of students in the secondary sector, although we expect that that will level out and the demography will change over the next decade. Even within the secondary school sector changes are occurring in terms of both subject preference-the kinds of offerings which are available-and the priorities which are given by schools as to subjects which should be taught. The problem which colleges of advanced education face in planning their course offerings for training teachers and, I suppose, the problem which State authorities face is that the lead times involved-the time between the taking of a decision that more or less of a certain kind of teacher is needed and the time those teachers actually become available-are quite considerable. I think the State authorities have considerable difficulties in planning these things. I can assure Senator Lajovic , however, that they are aware of the issue and the difficulties and that considerable efforts are being made by the State authorities and the colleges of advanced education, which have the responsibility for training teachers, to try to get some better consonance between the need for teachers in particular subjects and the kind of training which is occurring. Having said all that, I have no doubt that there will be some shortages of particular subject teachers. As priorities change in the future, those shortages will continue to appear here and there within the sectors.</PARA>

The increase in the Commonwealth direct funding for housing under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement this year was of the order of $70m-an increase of 27 per cent. At the same time, the Commonwealth at the time of the Premiers Conference indicated that the States would receive the ability to use a greater proportion of their works and housing program loan funds at a concessional rate of interest. The Commonwealth indicated to the States that if they chose to divert further expenditure into that area the works and housing money so diverted would be made available to the States at the concessional interest rates payable under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. The interest rate is 4.5 per cent per annum and the money is repayable over 53 years. It is certainly a very low interest rate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> In the Senate last week I incorporated in Hansard a table showing the expenditure by the Commonwealth and States over a 10-year period. That table, which is accessible to all honourable senators, shows that over a period of years there has been a decline in the amount of Commonwealth funding going into the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. Contemporaneously, of course, there has been a considerable increase in State funds. That reflects the attitude of this Government, which is to free up the general revenue payments to the States and to leave the States with a higher discretion as to what expenditure they undertake. The increase in Commonwealth funding in the current financial year- the additional incentive that we gave in respect of loan funds-shows expenditure this year to be at a very high rate both in real terms and in money terms in comparison with the last 10 years. I am satisfied that there will be a very considerable effort in the housing field overall during this financial year. The Commonwealth's changes were in recognition of the fact that there has been an increase in the waiting list and that there is an increased housing problem. That is certainly acknowledged by me and by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> I should mention that it is not merely in that area that the Commonwealth has housing responsibilities. If one looks at the other programs that we undertake, such as the aged and disabled housing program, the Homeless Persons Assistance Act and emergency accommodation for families, one will find in each case substantial funds-in most cases substantially increased funds-again in recognition of what is seen as a more difficult housing situation. The Commonwealth's efforts are also not restricted to the welfare housing area. I briefly mention the very considerable concessions made in the housing area generally in the housing package announced in March and in the Budget decisions which involved an extension of assistance for home buyers to bridge the deposit gap and of course the very welcome introduction of tax deductibility for interest in excess of 10 per cent. So, across a whole range of measures, the Commonwealth has acknowledged the tightness and difficulty in the housing market and we certainly are seeing signs that those Commonwealth measures are having a positive effect.</PARA>

The Australian National Director of Community Aid Abroad charged at a CAA convention in Melbourne that Australian aid programs have not reached the poor of the Third World countries and that Australian funding is directed to those countries that are more important to Australia's security. It was further stated that Australia would get better value if non- government agencies, rather than government authorities, handled the distribution of aid.

The donor is not without influence in shaping the nature and scope of projects to achieve consistency in its aid policies and to ensure responsible expenditure of what are, after all, public moneys; but, in exercising such influence; we must be careful lest our activities be seen or resented by the recipient government as an unwarranted interference in its internal affairs. The Australian Government has particular responsibilities to provide aid to our regional neighbours. In all our aid to these and other countries, we attempt to strike a balance between activities that promote growth and those that help the poorest sectors of the community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In case one thinks that my response in particularity is to a Dorothy Dix question, let me say that it happens to be true because Senator Walsh gave my office notice of the particularities of his question. Therefore, I have a brief before me in that regard. The Government has had a look at the matter that has been raised. I am advised that the Minister is satisfied that the Export Development Grants Board and the Department of Trade and Resources have acted fully in accordance with the export market development grants legislation. The firm of Westwools Pty Ltd submitted a claim for EMDG in respect of the period 1 July 1976 to 30 June 1977. The Board investigated whether the claimant had a grant entitlement and in August 1978 determined a grant of $97, 034. Subsequent to the determination, the Department arranged in the usual manner, through the Department of Finance, for a cheque for $97,034 to be sent on 26 September 1978 to Westwools Pty Ltd, the company that had incurred the eligible expenditure in 1976-77. Under EMDG legislation, once the Board has determined a grant entitlement, the claimant has a legal right to be paid by the Commonwealth. I should add that the EMDG legislation does not require the Board to seek information about the claimants' financial liabilities, including tax liabilities, in order to investigate and determine their grant entitlements. As it relates to taxation, such information is in any event unavailable to persons outside the Taxation Office. As to specifics, the cheque was made payable to Westwools Pty Ltd, P.O. Box 397, Fremantle, Western Australia and dated 26 September 1978. The cheque was marked 'not negotiable-account payee only'. The cheque was paid into the ANZ Bank in Fremantle on 2 October 1978.</PARA></TALK.START>

This complex task has been made more difficult by the uncertain estimates of the quantity of wheat which will be needed for feeding of stock in drought affected areas. These estimates vary with changes in the outlook for stock when there is rain. The Australian Wheat Board is moving general purpose wheat from Queensland to New South Wales in order to have supplies of wheat available for feeding to stock.

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is one of several measures designed to give effect to the new diesel fuel duty rebate arrangements foreshadowed by my colleague the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his Budget speech on 17 August 1982. On and from 8 p.m. on that date the existing diesel fuel certificate scheme, wherein certificates were issued to purchasers of diesel fuel for 'off road' use to obtain the fuel at duty free prices, will be terminated. In its place this Bill will introduce a new rebate system which will require all purchases of diesel fuel to be made at the duty paid price with rebates payable to persons in certain categories for their 'off road' use. The relevant customs and excise by-laws which provided the authority for the issuance of diesel fuel certificates under the previous scheme were revoked on 17 August 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains amendments to a number of pieces of legislation, including amendments to the Diesel Fuel Taxation (Administration) Act 1957, to terminate the operation of that Act on and from 8 p.m. on 17 August. Any purchases of diesel fuel for 'off road' use made at duty free rates under the certificate scheme, up to 8 p.m. on 17 August, will remain subject to the end use provisions of that act. Similarly, purchasers who, before 8 p.m. on 17 August, purchased diesel fuel at duty inclusive prices and used that fuel for 'off road' purposes will be entitled to rebates as provided for under the old arrangements. The Bill also amends the Customs Act and the Excise Act to introduce new provisions into both of those Acts relating to the new rebate system. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now outline some of the details of the new rebate system. As from 8 p.m. on 17 August all diesel fuel sales have been at a price inclusive of the duty. This means that no users of diesel fuel have been able to purchase, as they did in the past, duty free diesel fuel from oil companies, agencies or distributors. The users of diesel fuel in the categories defined in clause 5 of the Bill who purchase the fuel for their 'off road' purposes are, however, eligible for a rebate of the duty paid on the diesel fuel used in their operations. </PARA>
<PARA> To simplify the claiming process an amendment was made in the other place to enable persons to claim a rebate immediately after they have purchased the fuel for the specified uses. Previously they would have been required to use the fuel before a rebate application could be lodged. To obtain the rebate a user must lodge an application with a Collector of Customs. It is proposed that payments of the rebate will be made on the basis of the estimated proportion of the fuel proposed to be used for the specified purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Domestic users may claim a rebate at any time. Amendments were made in the other place to enable other than domestic users to claim a rebate after three months of a previous claim or after 1000 litres of fuel have been purchased. 1000 litres is equivalent to a rebate of $62 at the current rate of duty. This change was made to benefit small users of the fuel, particularly those users engaged in primary production. </PARA>
<PARA> The categories I referred to earlier relate to the use of the fuel in agriculture, mining, forestry and fishing applications, in domestic premises, hospitals, aged persons' homes, and nursing homes. So as not to disadvantage sawmills located outside a forest, amendments were also made in the other place to extend the rebate eligibility to milling operations carried on at a sawmill located outside a forest or plantation including the transport of timber, other than on a public road, to those sawmills. Previously rebate was restricted to forestry milling and to the processing of timber in a forest or plantation. A further amendment was made to make it clear that fuel used in providing domestic lighting for residential premises will be eligible for the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the revised criteria whereby rebates will be paid on purchases of diesel fuel for use, rather than on amounts of fuel used, in the defined categories, amendments were also made in the other place to include provision for the recovery of rebates paid to a person in circumstances where the person initially purchases the fuel for use in the defined categories but subsequently uses that fuel in some other manner. Claims for the rebate will be processed after the date upon which the amending legislation receives the Royal Assent and it is proposed to amend the customs and excise regulations to set out the requirements relating to applications for the rebate and to the procedures for claiming rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains certain investigative powers similar to the powers contained in the Diesel Fuel Taxation (Administration) Act. These powers are essential for the protection of the revenue and for the effective administration of the new rebate system. It is expected that rebates paid to claimants under the new scheme will amount to approximately $112m per annum. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill gives effect to most of the social security and welfare measures which were in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) two months ago. In the view of the Opposition-and, I believe, of the general public-those measures give little joy to pensioners, to the unemployed or to low income families. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) promised, as expressed in the Governor-General's Speech of 17 February 1976: 'The Government will not permit economic recovery to take place at the expense of those who are less well off.' That promise was never kept. Economic recovery has not taken place. Economic conditions have not been worse since the Depression of the 1930s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The changes that have taken place have improved the lot of high income earners, particularly by way of tax frauds, while the less well off have suffered. Year by year pensioners have found that their pension has declined in relation to average weekly earnings. The Prime Minister, in his 1975 election speech, said: 'The real value of pensions will be preserved.' Pensioners know better. Under Labor they saw pensions rise from 19.7 per cent of average weekly earnings, which it had been under the McMahon Government, to almost 24 per cent. The pension rose twice as fast as the cost of living. But under this Government, the Fraser Government, the pension has dropped to under 22 per cent of average weekly earnings. The Prime Minister, in his 1977 election speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have taken politics out of the pension increases by linking them automatically with the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA>That must be news indeed to pensioners. Under successive Fraser governments the pensioners have become more political than ever before. Every senator and member of this Parliament knows that the pensioners are increasingly angry and increasingly militant because this Government has taken it for granted that, by indexing pensions to cost of living rises based on a consumer price index five months out of date, it can then forget about the pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The single pension is currently $5 a week below the poverty line. The pension of a widow or deserted wife with three children is almost $25 a week below the poverty line. This legislation will give a small rise, but it will be swallowed up by rent increases and sales tax rises so that they will get no overall benefit from it and their pensions will still be below what Professor Henderson called an 'austere' poverty line. The poorest pensioners, the 451,000 pensioners on supplementary assistance-that is, people who have almost no other income and who pay rent-will get out of this Budget only the $3.10 a week which relates to cost increases they have been paying for the last five months and $2 towards increased rent. These payments are extraordinarily mean. It is no wonder that pensioners are demonstrating increasingly against the Government. The Opposition is pleased to see that the legislation is being amended so that a person in receipt of a wife's pension who is overseas when her husband dies can qualify for a widow's pension without having to return to Australia. I should point out that my colleague Senator Grimes has made several representations about this. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to make some comments on some of the specific provisions of the legislation. First, I refer to clause 77 which applies to the unemployment benefit. It is evident from the Government's discriminatory treatment of the unemployed that it still blames them rather than itself for the appallingly high rate of unemployment in this country. Although the benefit for the single adult unemployed is being increased it is being taken only to half the married rate and probably is reaching that only because this highly moralistic Government is embarrassed that many of the unemployed are claiming de facto relationships because it pays them more than taking a single status. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators to consider that the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat report of poverty measurement has stated that increased unemployment has increased the numbers below the poverty line and that the extent of poverty is now markedly greater for the non-aged single persons who are unemployed. The number of unemployed receiving the adult single rate benefit grew to 264,000 last May-it would, of course, be much higher now. Of those 264,000 some 262,000 people had no income apart from the $58.10, which is $21 a week below the poverty line. I am sure honourable senators will agree with me that it is this country's shame to have so many unemployed. It is this country's shame that those victims of government policy are treated so badly by wealthy Cabinet Ministers. The Government is increasing the rate, but only to $64.40 which, again, will be close to $20 below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that this single rate applies also to special beneficiaries whom we are seeing in increasing numbers as more claimants are refused invalid pension and sickness benefits. I remind the Senate that several thousand of these special beneficiaries are single women who have given up work to look after sick or aged parents and are paid well below the poverty line for this selfless work. The unemployment benefit for the single junior and adult unemployed is the only income support payment which is not indexed. The Government has made a moral judgment that they are less worthy or less significant than pensioners and a political judgment that the public agrees with it and that it can get away with this despicable meanness to the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to some of the other discriminations against the unemployed. They are not given rent assistance which pensioners receive. If they are unlucky enough to have an accident or to fall ill their sickness benefit rate will not include the supplementary allowance. They are given no fringe benefits except the health card. They get no assistance with mortgage payments, rate payments, travel, car registration, hearing aids, spectacles, dental treatment-the list goes on. They face the same costs as other families but they are given no compensation for the cost of living rises and no assistance in the rental market . </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the token rise of $4 a week for the young unemployed. All that can be said about that is that it is an insulting and heartless measure. Their parents cannot keep them on that amount if they themselves are unemployed or poor. Living away from home on that amount of money is an absolute disaster. I think it is particularly disappointing to honourable senators in this place that the Government's decision on the young unemployed was so heartless because a committee of the Senate undertook a very thorough investigation into the circumstances of homeless youth. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It made many recommendations which have not been incorporated in the Budget, as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) would know. The family income supplement has been introduced in some European countries, including Britain. On 24 August this year, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser ) said that his Government introduced the family income supplement-not a Labor government or a socialist government. He knows very well that the family income supplement was an Australian Labor Party proposal which was announced by us in May 1980. The Liberal Party, which had scorned the Labor proposal at that time, took over the name and the principle, amending it only so as to pay as little as possible. Instead of hundreds of thousands of families with children being eligible, no more than 30,000 families in Australia are expected to be able to take it up. That is the difference between the two parties, a difference in a genuine concern for low income families by the Labor Party and a stingy tokenism by the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's supplement will help at most 30,000 families and yet the Prime Minister has had the hide to call it the most far-sighted reform since the introduction of family allowances. If that is the most far-sighted reform this Government has been capable of, no wonder it is in the chaotic state that it is and no wonder its credibility is as low as it is. It is to be kept to working families where the breadwinners earn below award wages, unless there are five or more children where the breadwinner can earn award wages or a few dollars over. The average weighted minimum weekly wage last July was $229. In the past two years, that wage has risen by 11 per cent a year, so we would expect the minimum wage, when the family income supplement is introduced next May, to be over $250 a week. This means that single income families, with the breadwinner on a minimum award wage, would have to have four dependent children to get any benefit at all. This small proportion of families would be mainly single females whose awards are lower, under award workers and a few farmers and self-employed persons whose incomes are at or can be brought down to that level. </PARA>
<PARA> We also remind the Senate that the Prime Minister boasted that the Budget would benefit a family earning $300 a week with two children and a mortgage of $25,000 by about $17 or $18 a week. He even called it a 'fairly typical situation'. The truth is that such families represent fewer than 0.8 per cent of Australian families. It will come as no suprise to the general public to realise that the Prime Minister is so erroneous in his concept of what the average family is and what it earns. The family income supplement will be paid to families who are eligible for disadvantaged health cards, reinforcing the poverty stigma. We all remember that, although this Government was willing to spend millions on advertising middle class housing benefits at the time of the Victorian election, it refused to spend more than a few thousand dollars on radio to inform people of their rights to health care cards. I doubt whether we will see a sizable promotion budget for the family income supplement because the Government saves money where there is a low uptake. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like at this stage to point out that the minimum wage figures quoted on page 30 of the explanatory notes are misleading and, in our view, seriously and deliberately misleading. The notional minimum wage, as quoted in the national wage case, bears no relation to minimum wage awards, as Senator Chaney well knows. The explanatory notes give a notional weekly wage of $140.30 in May 1982. The actual weighted minimum award weekly wage in May 1982 was $221.18. I believe that the Minister should be condemned for this attempt to mislead the Parliament and the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point to be made about tying the family health income supplement to the disadvantaged persons health card is that the health card is not indexed to the consumer price index as is the pension rate. It is increased by around only 70 per cent and so falls further back in relation to price movements each six months. This means that many people on low wages who qualified for the family income supplement could in the following six months find that because their wages had been increased by the CPI they had become ineligible for the family income supplement because those levels had risen by only 70 per cent of the CPI. What a way to penalise a family!</PARA>
<PARA> Family allowances are to be increased for the first two children for the first time since 1976 but the real value of those allowances is still far below the value of eight years ago. A family with two children will receive $10.25 a month less than if those family allowances had kept pace with inflation. Every group in the country concerned with poverty and welfare has urged the Government to increase family allowances and it has taken it seven years to respond. Even the Government's own report on poverty measurements stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Couples with children are more likely than those without to have low income in relation to needs while sole parents are among the neediest of groups. There are more couples with one or two children with low income in relation to their needs than couples with three children or more. </PARA>
<PARA>If the family allowance had been indexed, a family with five children would be $ 398.40 a year better off. If the family allowance had been indexed, the Fraser Government would be outlaying another $396m this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to point out that the slight improvement in the income test for the unemployed, the sick and special beneficiaries is token only. There are so few beneficiaries who can find part time or casual work that there is no reason to penalise them by imposing a far harsher means test than is imposed on pensioners. They are paid less; they get no indexation, no concessions; and, if they do find work, they are allowed to keep less of their earnings than pensioners. On 6 September 1976, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Those who are economically disadvantaged through no fault of their own should be able to look to Governments for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>But his actions indicate that the Government gives as little assistance as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to point out that the increase in personal care subsidy is only the second increase since 1974. The first was early in 1980. The subsidy is now about the same value as it was when Labor took it to $60 a month in 1974. The Joint Working Party on Hostel Accommodation made many recommendations in 1979 which have not yet been implemented. It also pointed out that the decline in the value of the age pension could not assist the financing of services expected in hostels. Significant losses were being made by hostels in most States. Senator Chaney put Mr Hodges in charge of a study of the aged legislation and procedures , but the ludicrous secrecy with which this was done meant that the Parliament still has no idea what recommendations were made by the then Liberal back bencher who had access to departmental facilities as well as interest groups. There was no good reason for not releasing this report to the Parliament and it is a bad precedent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our view that the mobility allowance recognises that transport is a major cost option for disabled people who are unable to use public transport. It will be welcomed by members of the disabled community and, as a concept, it is welcomed by the Opposition. Our concern-it is a serious one-is about the restrictions imposed on eligibility. It is hard to see how people are going to qualify to make use of the $18m allocated for a full year's operation. The major eligibility condition is that recipients must be engaged in gainful employment, including sheltered employment, for at least 20 hours a week. Many people will be excluded by this provision. What about disabled people who are looking for work? They are to be punished, as are the non-disabled unemployed, instead of being assisted and encouraged to help themselves. It is a mistake to think that, if they cannot find open employment, there is always sheltered employment to fall bank on. Sheltered workshops have long waiting lists. What about disabled people for whom gainful employment is not an option? For instance what about women who are fully occupied caring for families and others who are too severely disabled to contemplate employment? Once again the Government's obsession with the work ethic forces these people to depend on charity or not to go out unless they have resources of their own. The requirement that gainful employment be undertaken for at least 20 hours a week is out of line with conditions for the sheltered employment allowance, which is payable to a person working 18 hours a week over three days, although the person must be working towards full time employment. This kind of anomaly-a mean one at that-should not be countenanced at the introduction of an important measure. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that there are other honourable senators who wish to participate in the debate. The Opposition has many reservations and many concerns about the measures before us. However, because of the measures in the Bill that we do support and because we recognise the urgency of making available as early as possible those few measures of assistance to the potential beneficiaries, we do not oppose this legislation. On behalf of the Opposition, I move the following second reading amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) deplores the Government's failure to protect the value of social security pensions, benefits and payments generally; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to Senator Ryan's speech, one would think that Australian people generally have not considered that the welfare budget has been a good one. Yet the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney) was absolutely deluged with thank you letters from all groups associated with social welfare. I could read out dozens of them. I will just nominate a few when I come to them. The Budget has been acclaimed as a family Budget. The family consisting of a sole breadwinner with a dependent spouse and two children has been advantaged to a considerable extent. Such advantages have been sought by many women's groups and family groups and they have written to me , and particularly Senator Chaney, saying thank you for the increases in benefit to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give one example which was given by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and which I think needs reiterating. I refer to a sole breadwinner on $300 a week with a dependent spouse and two children and surmise that the family is paying off the family home with a mortgage of $25,000 at an interest rate of 13 1/2 per cent. The total weekly benefit will be $16.84. That is a considerable amount for that family. From next month the personal tax changes will mean an additional saving of $10.54 a week. The home loan interest rebate will be $5.05 a week. The increase in the family allowance will be $4.25 a week. That makes a total of $19 .84 a week. If we take off the indirect taxes, which at the most would be $3, that family will be better off by $16.84. As I have said, it is a family Budget and has been acknowledged as such. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an unfair tax burden on single income families. In recognition of this the Government increased the dependent spouse rebate by $200 from $830 to $1,030 for taxpayers with dependent children. This also applies to daughter- housekeepers. The sole parent rebate has also increased. This makes a considerable reduction in the tax payable by single income families.

I am indicating the various means of assistance to families. I will come to pensioners later. The standard rate of tax has decreased from 32c in the dollar to 30c in the dollar. The level at which the tax changes from 30c in the dollar to 46c in the dollar has been increased from $17,894 to $19,500.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Colston does not understand that a reduction in income tax and increases in the social security area will help people bringing up families, I cannot explain it any better to him. I have already said that it is a family Budget and that social security matters particularly have helped the family cope. I extend this to include all the benefits that families have received. A family income supplement is to be introduced in May next year. The new cash benefit for low income families is $10 a week for each child. This is a means tested benefit and is applicable to the health card for the disadvantaged. For instance in November 1982 that amount will be $184. We do not yet know what it will be in May next year but it is linked to the health card for disadvantaged persons. It is being brought in particularly to overcome the anomalies that exist at the moment whereby those with large families on low incomes do not receive the same income as unemployed people can get by way of extra assistance for each child. The cut-off point tapers off. It has been reduced on the basis of $1 for every $2 income over the amount. Pharmaceutical concessions have been given to those disadvantaged groups. Families on low incomes with a health card will now have to pay only $2 for each item. Previously such people were stretched considerably to pay their chemist bills. They have also been helped quite considerably in the housing assistance area. The family man-the single income earner-will now benefit considerably from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the subject of age pensions. From 1 November the single pension rate will be $154.50 per fortnight and the married rate will be $257.60 a fortnight. The income which a single pensioner can earn has been increased from $20 a week to $30 a week. Now a single pensioner can earn $30 a week. Pensioners have been asking for this for quite some time and I was delighted to see that come in. The married rate has been increased from $34.50 to $50 a week. As I say, this has been greeted as very laudable by the pensioners' unions. The pension now does not cut out until the single pensioner has an income of $184.50. A married couple can earn $307.60 before the pension cuts out completely. Fringe benefits have been extended to sickness beneficiaries. The income limits for pensioner fringe benefits and health cards have been increased. The single rate has risen to $54 and the married rate to $90. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, pensioners benefit from the personal tax reductions, but they have an additional $250 rebate-that is the maximum-so a pensioner does not start paying tax now until his total income, including pension, reaches $5,429, and this again has been welcomed very greatly by pensioners. Indeed, between the figure that I have just given, $5,429 and $7,429, the tax rate is only 12 1/2 per cent, and it is not until after the figure of $7,429 a year that pensioners will pay the same as other people-30c in the dollar. Senator Ryan seemed to be indicating that the Government had been-to use her word-stingy in its social security benefits. I feel that the people of Australia have indicated where they stand about that, and I think that Senator Ryan is trying to draw a long bow. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, pharmaceutical concessions that apply to the disadvantaged groups also apply to all pensioners. The position of the pensioner who at present has the fringe benefits and does not pay anything for his drugs will remain the same , but the concessional rate of $2 per item will be available to all pensioners, no matter what their financial situation is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all to do with social welfare. For aged accommodation and disabled accommodation, $170m is being spent over the next two years-$83m this year, a considerable additional expenditure by the Government. Senior citizen centres are having an additional $7m this year-$14m in the next two years. Rental assistance will be further increased by $2 a week in the Budget, a rise of $5 a week just in this year. The rental assistance for pensioners is now $10 a week. We have been congratulated about the personal care subsidy, as I have found as I have visited nursing homes over the last couple of weeks. It has been increased by $10, from $20 to $30, for all eligible people in hostel-type accommodation. Indeed, it was backdated to July 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ryan said that there was a paltry increase from $36 to $40 for the under-18s. I underline the fact that in our Committee, which produced a unanimous report, the Opposition did not go for large increases in that $36. It was agreed in our Committee that we believed the $36 that was given last year was only a subsidy for the under-18 living within the family home. I believe that the $40 to which the Government has now increased the payment is still that -just a subsidy for the under-18 living within the family home. After all, someone who is under 18 is still the responsibility of the parents. We find that this is so in other legislation. Regarding people under 18 who, for one reason or another, have to go away from their family home or who are unable to live there and who become homeless youth, which my Committee was investigating, the Government has already earmarked $300,000 as interim assistance for that group of youth. The benefit for over-18 unemployed who are without dependants has also risen by $6.30 to $64.40 a week. The income test for unemployment and sickness benefits has also been increased to $10. This again is tapered to a $60 a week benefit. I now go on to assistance to the handicapped. Perhaps I may read a sentence from one letter that the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, received from the Association of Sheltered Workshops of New South Wales. The last sentence is:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the improvements referred to are most commendable and thank you for them. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of letter that Senator Chaney was getting. Assistance to the handicapped has been considerable. First, an income test-free health card has been given to handicapped people, invalid pensioners, for 12 months. If they decide that they want to try to get themselves a job that they are capable of doing and they find a job and can work at it for a period to see whether they can cope with it, they are given this health card for 12 months, means test-free . </PARA>
<PARA> An incentive allowance is paid to people in sheltered employment. It has been increased to $10 a week. That again is means test-free. There is a $10 a week non-taxable mobility allowance, which has been lauded by all the groups of handicapped people. It is for the severely handicapped who are unable to use public transport, if they are in employment or undertaking vocational training. There is also a $12 a month increase in the rate of the handicapped children's allowance, an increase which brings the allowance to $85 a month. Again, we have considerable expenditure by the Government in regional services- $750,000 to extend and improve these services under the Commonwealth rehabilitation services . We have $37m for capital facilities for handicapped persons assistance over a two-year period-$18.5m this year. Yet we are told by Senator Ryan that we have been stingy. Indeed, Senator Ryan hinted that the unemployed would abuse the system. I think that she does a grave disservice to the unemployed by saying that. I am sure that the majority of the people who are unemployed would not abuse the system by living in de facto relationships but would accept the situation as it is. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I may mention a few of the associations that have written letters congratulating the Government on the Budget. I believe that the fact that we have not yet debated this Budget, so long after it was brought down, has blurred the situation. The Australian Council on the Ageing said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there are many welcome initiatives and we take the opportunity to express our appreciation to you and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Council goes on in some detail. The Church of England Homes for Elderly People said:</PARA>
<PARA> This is just a short note to say thank you for your efforts on behalf of elderly people generally as reflected in the recent Budget, and to specifically thank you for the 50 per cent increase in the Personal Care Subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Voluntary Care Association of Victoria, at its meeting, also asked for the Minister to be thanked. The New South Wales Council on the Ageing said:</PARA>
<PARA> We would like to congratulate you for what we consider to be an excellent budget for the aged. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that most ACROD members would want me to write to you expressing their appreciation for the many new initiatives introduced in the current budget to assist people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>In its media release the headline says:</PARA>
<PARA> Budget welcomed by disabled lobbies. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Quadriplegic Association said much the same thing:</PARA>
<PARA> The Association applauds the measures introduced in the Federal Budget to assist disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA>Interagency said:</PARA>
<PARA> Ryde-Hunters Hill Interagency wishes to thank you for responding to our submission for increased funding for Family Day Care. </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan's speech really does not present the situation at all. In the social welfare area the Budget has done a tremendous amount for families, not only disadvantaged families but also single income families. It has made it possible for the single income earner to keep his family together. I believe it has partially righted some of the injustices which previously existed in the taxation area. I should like to refer to that aspect again. If we compare the single income and the dual income families as a family unit, and if we take the income of the dual income families together, we find that before 1 November the single income family earning $18,000 per year paid taxation amounting to $3,602. After 1 November, it will pay $2,991. The family on a dual income of $18,000 per year prior to 1 November paid taxation amounting to $3,075. After 1 November it will pay $2,643. This indicates that the single income family has gained an amount of nearly $200. I believe that the Government will be going further in this dependent spouse rebate area, which is the area that is liable to equal up this discrepancy. I should like to congratulate the Minister and the Government on bringing in this particular taxation measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this omnibus Bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1982, is to put into effect the social security provisions that were foreshadowed by this Government in the 1982 -83 Budget. The amendments affect the Aged or Disabled Persons Home Act 1954, the Delivered Meals Subsidy Act 1970 and the Social Security Act 1947. Among other things they increase unemployment and sickness benefits for some people, extend eligibility for widows pensions to widows living overseas, raise rent and meal allowances, increase the personal care subsidy for people in certain institutions and provide an incentive allowance to certain invalid pensioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no question that this Bill is a step, albeit a small and somewhat limited one, in the right direction. As the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney) indicated in his second reading speech, it recognises the plight of pensioners living in private rental accommodation, caught up, as they of course are, in the cost spiral which is due to increased interest rates, a fact which inevitably affects the rental market and hence the amount of rent that people, whether they are pensioners or not, have to pay in the private rental market. It recognises too, to a certain extent, the increasing financial problems faced by the young unemployed school leavers not all of whom, I remind Senator Walters, have parents who want or are able to care for them, despite what may well be seen as their moral responsibility. The 'generous income test'- a term used in the Minister's second reading speech-is, I suggest, more illusory than real. Certainly, while the percentage increases appear high, the actual increases mean very little. The Minister, in his second reading speech, points out that everyone who receives unemployment or sickness benefits will be able to have $10 a week of private income without affecting their rate of benefit at all , the current amount allowed being $3 a week for single people under 18 years of age and $6 a week for everyone else. I suggest that $10 a week is roughly two and a half hours cleaning, lawn mowing or window washing, and is hardly a massive amount of work to be undertaken or money earned by somebody who is trying to get himself or herself above the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my intention to go once again over the statistics relating to disadvantaged people in society. This is partly because they have been given in detail before in previous speeches, both by me and by other honourable senators, and partly because they are only ever at best an approximation, since they only ever reveal the identifiable individuals concerned and must of necessity ignore those people such as the many unemployed women, for instance, who are unable to be classified as seeking employment, perhaps because of factors such as their husband's income or because, as a previous speaker indicated, they are not specifically seeking employment since they are tied to the home as a supporting parent. Nevertheless, they are still disadvantaged people, perhaps hidden in some way from unemployment statistics. There are also those people who, out of a sense of pride, misplaced or otherwise, prefer not to register for unemployment benefit, attempting instead to go it alone. Also, as we have discovered in recent days, even the Government appears to be unable to come up with accurate figures relating to the number of unemployed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In acknowledging that the Government has gone some way towards recognising and acting to correct a number of problem areas in the social welfare system, I must add that there are still areas which need attention. These are areas which do not necessarily require additional funds but, more appropriately, a more flexible attitude to the needs of the individuals involved. Some of these areas have been mentioned to us on a number of occasions, as Senator Walters would be aware, by people who have been appearing before the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, an area which I do not intend to go into at the moment. Let us consider, for example, the subsidy to help organisations providing accommodation for elderly people to meet the cost of employing staff to provide additional services for frail aged residents. The point I am making here is not that the Government should not be increasing personal care subsidies but that it should be putting a lot more effort into planning and co-ordinating services which will enable those who are not frail aged to stay in their own homes. At the moment people who do not necessarily need intensive nursing are taking up places in some institutions because there are simply not enough or adequate community support services to enable them to remain in their own homes. For this reason, therefore, I applaud the increased meals subsidy which was another amendment in this piece of legislation. I hope that there are additional initiatives that the Government is prepared to look at in the future which will encourage the independence of the aged in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> A somewhat less actual or obvious benefit however, I suspect, is the series of measures that the Government has introduced that it maintains will be of special assistance to disabled people who are in the work force or who want to work. This includes, I might add, the mobility allowance. One wonders in this economic climate, with unemployment, redundancies, retrenchments and so on at the level that they are, how many disabled people will be able to join the work force and hence benefit from the measure which I acknowledge is good in its intention but may not prove to be the value that the Government clearly hopes it will be. </PARA>
<PARA> My other concern, and it is the subject of the amendment that has been circulated by me, relates to certain requirements which, to my mind at least, act as a disincentive to the unemployed to improve their situation and to make themselves more eligible for employment. I refer in particular here to the limit of eight hours training which is able to be undertaken per week by a person on unemployment benefit and to the fact that a person electing to strike out on his or her own runs into the very real risk of losing the unemployment benefit, notwithstanding the fact that that person is not yet in receipt of an income. Some honourable senators may recall that I raised that latter problem some weeks ago after two South Australian men pooled their limited resources to buy a truck in order to give them mobility, particularly in the metropolitan area of Adelaide, as they went from house to house looking for work on their own initiative. Unfortunately, as a result of that their unemployment benefit was cut off and it was only after a media campaign that it was resumed. The former matter raises the question of where one draws the line. The unemployment benefit is available to anyone looking for work more or less on a full time basis. The existing legislation concedes that some people undertake training or retraining programs but it limits the time spent on these to less than two hours a day. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the unemployment benefit was originally designed to tide people over short term periods of being out of work. Unfortunately, over the last decade or so times have changed and many people are now forced to exist on the unemployment benefit for considerable periods. Compared with pensioners, for example, unemployment beneficiaries are disadvantaged in many ways, as the Labor Party amendment indicates. The fact that they are limited in the amount of training that they can undertake in any given week is yet another problem that they face. I think irrespective of whether we use the figures that the Government gave us in the Budget or the more recent figures, we would all recognise that the present level of unemployment is chronic and is a structural problem in our economic system. Now, instead of unemployed people being between jobs, many are out of the work force for months at a time. The longer they are out of the work force the less employable they become, the more depressed they become and the more need they have to attend some sort of training or retraining program. It is imperative that the Government assist those people who still have the energy and the inclination to climb out of that predicament. It is for that reason that, whilst supporting the Australian Labor Party's amendment which consists of a series of motherhood statements, I wish to add two additional points. I now move:</PARA>
<PARA> After sub-paragraph (iv) of the words to be added, add:</PARA>
<PARA> '(v) unemployed people to undertake training courses for up to 16 hours per week (instead of the present limit of 8 hours per week) before becoming ineligible for unemployment benefits, and</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) unemployed people to receive unemployment benefits while they are engaged in setting up a small business with the purpose of becoming self-employed but before they derive an income from that business'. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, I repeat that it is imperative, given the changing circumstances, that governments' attitudes to pensions, to people on the unemployment benefit, to the disabled and to care of the aged in the community become more flexible than they have been in the past to allow the maximum amount of independence for those people and the minimum amount of institutionalisation and despondency in those who are becoming part of an increasingly disadvantaged proportion of our community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Budget was introduced in August it contained certain social security measures. At first blush the Budget seemed to have some element of generosity for social security beneficiaries but, although it was conceived as an election Budget, this apparent generosity to social security recipients was soon seen to be quite transparent. Because the Budget was designed as an early election Budget it did contain some advances and some improvements, but after seven years of neglect what was offered could be described as too little and too late. The Opposition, through my colleague Senator Ryan, moved an amendment which I reiterate. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) deplores the Government's failure to protect the value of social security pensions, benefits and payments generally; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) is of the opinion that the Bill should also provide for-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) greater increases in payments to the under-18 unemployed,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) increases in payments for children to maintain the real value of those payments,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) eligibility for mobility allowance for disabled persons working 18 hours a week, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) an end to the discrimination against the unemployed'. </PARA>
<PARA>To that Senator Haines moved a further amendment. I want to speak to the amendment moved by Senator Ryan. I intend to work through parts of the amendment , showing why it should be accepted by the Senate. The failure to protect the real value of social security pensions, benefits and payments generally will be evident from my remarks throughout my speech. I turn first to that part of the amendment which deals with discrimination against the unemployed. In doing so I shall first mention some aspects in relation to pensions. The increase in pensions payable from November, next month, is based on consumer price index increases for the six months from January to June 1982. Therefore, the increases are catch-up increases only. They are five months late at that. As Senator Ryan pointed out in her speech, they will soon be swallowed up anyway by increased charges, including the increases in sales taxes brought in in this Budget. The pension increases will take the single rate to $77.25 a week and the married rate to $128.80 a week. Despite indexation, however, the standard rate pension has fallen in terms of percentage of average weekly earnings. In 1975 the standard rate pension was about 24.4 per cent of average weekly earnings. Now it is only about 22.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that we may be headed towards a situation similar to that which prevailed under the McMahon Liberal Government when the standard rate of pension was under 20 per cent of average weekly earnings. I sometimes wonder whether it will require again the advent of a Labor government to bring pensions to a reasonable level once more. The Whitlam Labor Government did just that, despite economic difficulties and frustration caused by vindictive behaviour, especially in this chamber. It raised the standard rate of pension from under 20 per cent to 24.5 per cent of average weekly earnings. We did not quite reach our goal of 25 per cent but we got close. That contrasts with a slow and gradual erosion under the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Before illustrating the discrimination against the unemployed that is mentioned in the amendment, I make reference to supplementary assistance. As a consequence of this Budget the most needy of pensioners in private rental accommodation will receive supplementary assistance of up to $10 a week. But what is the position now with the unemployed? Let us first consider a breadwinner with a dependent spouse and children. Firstly, the allowance received for children is subject to tax. That is not the case for pensioners. I ask: Why do we have discrimination in such a mean way simply because a person dares to lose his or her job? The breadwinner to whom I refer cannot receive supplementary assistance. Why this discrimination? Are all the unemployed supposed to be in low cost housing so that they do not need supplementary assistance? Apart from the health care card, the unemployed do not receive fringe benefits which provide concessions in relation to public transport, rates, car registration and telephone rentals. Nor do they receive pharmaceuticals free of charge as do pensioners. Why are the unemployed regarded as less worthy in this regard than pensioners? These are areas of discrimination which could be removed by this Government but sadly they are not mentioned in the legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA> So far I have considered only married persons who are unemployed. But let us look at the single unemployed people without dependants. From next month, these people will receive $12.85 a week less than the single rate pension. The unemployment benefit is not indexed. So, when the rates of pensions are adjusted next May in accordance with the indexation guidelines, the single unemployed will fall even further behind. But the discrimination does not end there. Whereas the single rate pensioner from next month will be able to earn $30 a week before his or her pension starts to cut out, the unemployed can earn only $ 10 a week. Why are not conditions similar for all benefits? Why are not conditions for unemployed persons and other pensioners as similar as possible? Surely the needs of pensioners and unemployment beneficiaries are not all that different that unemployment beneficiaries should be subject to such discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved by Senator Ryan mentions that this Bill should provide for greater increases in payments to the under-18 unemployed. Let us look at the plight of this group. The unemployed near adults of 16 or 17 years of age have for years and years been eligible for only $36 a week. Now there is to be a paltry increase of only $4 a week-the first increase in seven years. How are young people expected to live on $40 a week? We should consider those 16 and 17- year-olds in rural areas who are forced to move to the cities in search of work. Many young people who grow up in rural areas know in their heart of hearts that they will never gain employment and that they will have to move away from home to the cities or provincial cities to search for work. Of course, these young people do not qualify for rental assistance when they do move away from home. It seems to me that this is an area about which the National Party should be particularly concerned. The National Party says that it looks after people in country areas. Even though the word 'Country' has been dropped from the name of the party, if it cares about country people it should be concerned about these young people who have to move away from their home in rural areas in search of work and have to exist, as from next month, on $40 a week with no chance of receiving supplementary assistance. This group has been the most harshly treated in this Government's seven years of neglect. I can see no reason why any honourable senator should vote against that part of Senator Ryan's amendment which seeks greater increases in payments to the under-18 unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> I recently read the 11 October 1982 issue of the Christian Science Monitor. An article in that publication entitled 'Unemployment shadows darken' commenced in this way:</PARA>
<PARA> 'And what are you going to do when you leave school?' parliamentary candidate Harriet Harmon asked a 16-year-old boy in his final year in blue-collar Peckham, South London, the other day. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I'm going to be unemployed,' the boy said sadly. </PARA>
<PARA>This is only too true even in Australia for many of the people who come out of school nowadays. If this incident happened in Australia, the young lad may have said: 'I'm going to be unemployed and see how I can live on $40 a week.'</PARA>
<PARA> It is only too easy for us in this chamber and for those in Parliament in general to pretend that there is no real problem in respect of the young unemployed. Yet problems do exist. An article in the Courier-Mail of 21 August 1982 reported that 42 per cent of all admissions at Salvation Army hostels for men and women in Brisbane are aged 18 years or under. In other words, almost half of those people who go along to the Salvation Army hostels in Brisbane are 18 years of age or under. I would like to quote further from that Courier-Mail article. It said this as well:</PARA>
<PARA> One third of those who stay at the St Vincent de Paul shelter for homeless men are under 25 and one sixth are under 18. Ten years ago, the average age of those living at the society's shelters was 48. Today it is 32. </PARA>
<PARA> Officials of both the Salvation Army and the Society of St Vincent de Paul believe that the major cause of this increase is an inability by young people to exist on unemployment benefits, which until this week's Budget had remained at $ 36 a week since 1975. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend to honourable senators a reading of that article in full in the Courier-Mail. However, I want to quote some further excerpts. </PARA>
<PARA> A young journalist from the Courier-Mail went to the trouble of trying to live on $36 a week. This is part of what he said after his experience:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . 'as one who for some years has been used to earning a living wage, I found it impossible to exist without charity. My budget was just over $5 a day. Clearly I could not afford to rent a place or eat on that; the alternatives were shelters or the streets. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Despite the knowledge that mine was only a sojourn among the unemployed, I had to make a more serious mental adjustment in order to deal with the psychological aspects of life on the dole. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Depression was something I confronted. Faced with so much desperation, I became desperate myself. How was I going to get through my time? On occasions, it seemed a little like a gaol sentence. And on a practical level, what to do during the day?</PARA>
<PARA> 'Unemployment, I found, is about loneliness and boredom. On $5 a day you cannot go to the pictures or the pub. Many youngsters, however, can stretch their dole cheque to include a tube of aeroplane glue. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Unemployment is also about intellectual and emotional poverty. The 15-year-old who runs away from home and school and ends up in a hostel full of derelict alcoholics is starting life with little going for him. Virtually all his relationships are confined to the limits of his immediate environment. </PARA>
<PARA>One aspect of that article struck me in particular. The total article is well worth reading. I probably did not realise-and many of us probably do not realise -that if one has only $5 a day so much in life is just not available. The reporter mentioned that one cannot even go to the pictures; one cannot get away from the boredom and the desperation that one faces; one has to rely on charity for a place to live at night and a place to eat. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be asked why I have concentrated my remarks on the unemployed. I have done so simply because this Government, without any apparent concern, has allowed half a million Australians to become unemployed. While it has become harder and harder to obtain work, the amount that is available to the jobless by way of the unemployment benefit has become in real terms less and less. This is exactly the reverse of what the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, argued some years ago . I would like to quote from a Press statement that Mr Fraser issued back on 8 September 1974 when he was the shadow Minister for Labour. In that Press statement he talked about unemployment statistics which had been released for August 1974. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the government should consider closely the situation that as unemployment rises so too should unemployment benefits increase. This proposal rests on the principle that as it becomes harder to get work so too should the compensation for those out of work be increased. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister was saying then as shadow Minister for Labour that because unemployment was increasing in the community the unemployment benefit should increase also. At that stage the number of unemployed was about 150,000. We now have slightly over half a million people who are unemployed. Unemployment has certainly increased. I wonder what the Prime Minister now thinks about his statement that the unemployment benefit should be increased. Perhaps he has changed his mind. Perhaps he changed his mind on 11 November 1975. Before leaving the area of unemployment benefit I note that this area of the Budget was deliberately deceptive. This has been admitted by some Government members. The Budget was based on an estimated expenditure on unemployment benefit of $1,567m in 1982-83. This was based on an average of 395,000 beneficiaries for the whole year. However, in August the figure for unemployment beneficiaries was already 422,000 and climbing. No doubt the Government thought there would be an early election and that this deception would not be noticed. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved by Senator Ryan mentions that increases are needed in payments for children for those payments to maintain their real value. I can well remember being present in this chamber when a Bill came before it which sought to replace the old child endowment scheme with a system of family allowances. I had not been a member of the Senate for very long. I can remember the surprise on this side when such an advance came from the other side. The change cost the Government nothing. We did not argue about that because it just took money from one area and put it into what we thought was a more worthy area. The system removed the income tax deductions for dependent children and used the money thus saved for the family allowance program. Unfortunately, the family allowance payments have not been properly adjusted and have thus lost much of their purchasing power. To illustrate this I refer to a table which was prepared for me by the statistics section of the Parliamentary Library. I have discussed this table with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), who is in the chamber. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to work through this table and mention some aspects of it. The table has a column which shows what the monthly family allowance payments were in May 1976. Honourable senators will remember that in 1976 family allowance payments were made on a four-week basis. They were later changed to a calendar month basis. I have adjusted the rates so that they are in terms of calendar months. The figures for May 1976 are indicated, as are the actual figures for January 1982. The table has a column for January 1982 because there were some changes in last year's Budget which took effect at the beginning of this year. Those changes related to third and subsequent children; not to first and second children. The third column shows the actual figures for November 1982 -that is, next month-when the provisions contained in this Bill will come into operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next column shows what the rates would be if they had been indexed over the period from May 1976 to the current time. The indexation has been worked out for May and November based on six-monthly movements in the consumer price index to the previous December and June quarters respectively. The final column, which is perhaps the most revealing of all, shows the difference in the actual figures as from next month and what the figures would be had they been indexed. That column shows that a family with one child would be $5.60 a month worse off now than it was under the 1976 family allowance levels. A family with two children-to obtain this figure we require a cumulative adding of the last column in this table- would be a $13.80 a month worse off. A family with three children would be $23. 55 a month worse off; a family with four children would be $33.30 a month worse off; and a family with five or six children would be $44.95 a month or $56.60 a month worse off respectively. I mention these figures so that we can see the import of that part of the amendment moved by Senator Ryan which refers to increases in payments for children to maintain the real value of those payments. The real value of those payments has not been maintained. It should be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to outline what the publication 'Comet' said about the Budget as it relates to pensioners. The 'Comet' is a pensioners' publication which emanates from Brisbane. The publication mentioned the following: Increases in ' free area' limits-the first time since the income test was introduced in 1976; increases in fringe benefit levels, which are still far behind the levels that would prevail if full indexation had taken place; increases in supplementary assistance-the 'Comet' suggested there was a good argument for doubling the rate of assistance; and a pensioner tax rebate. The 'Comet' then went on to say that there was nothing there for the basic pensioner. Except for the small increases in supplementary assistance, I agree with the comments of that publication. The adjustments to the basic pension, as I mentioned earlier, only adjust for the loss of the purchasing power of pensioners. Apart from that, which pensioners should expect, and apart from the supplementary assistance, what the 'Comet' said was quite correct. I commend the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Ryan to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill and to commend the Government on its sensitivity to problems faced by some sections of the Australian community. I feel that the Government has put its money where its mouth is and provided substantial assistance to those in our community most in need of particular help ; namely, families with three or more children, pensioners and the unemployed. This legislation helps to consolidate those initiatives taken by the Government in last year's Budget to direct available increases in welfare expenditure to those in greatest need, doing so at a time of deepening economic recession worldwide. There is no doubt that there are some needy sections of the community which it is the Government's responsibility to try to aid. Without letting the social security bill get completely out of hand, I feel that our Government is trying to achieve just that. The 1982-83 Budget provided for an increase in the social security and welfare expenditure of the Department of Social Security from $9,997m in 1981-82 to $11,471m, which is an increase of some 18 per cent. In these difficult economic times it is certainly gratifying to see that ours is a caring government and is trying to the best of its ability, with limited funds , to relieve some of that burden within the confines of sensible economic management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those in the unfortunate position of being unemployed this Government has provided some relief. The unemployment benefit for single people aged 18 years and over who have no dependants has been increased, by $6.30 a week, to $64.40 a week, or half the unemployment benefit received by a married person. If one takes into account the automatic increases, linked to the consumer price index, that will come into effect next month, the rate will be $77.25 for a single person over 18 and $128.80 for a married couple. In addition, to encourage unemployed people to take advantage of opportunities to earn extra income and gain job experience by way of casual work, the Government will allow an unemployed person to earn more without losing his or her entitlement to unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I still maintain that much could be achieved in our community if unemployed people were required to do some sort of community work in return for their unemployment cheque. There are always plenty of community-type projects that could be undertaken. I am sure that this would have the effect, firstly, of relieving the boredom of the unemployed person and, secondly, of achieving worthwhile undertakings in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The income test for unemployment and sickness benefits has been made more generous for those whose income at present is largely restricted to those benefits. It will mean that everyone who receives an unemployment or sickness benefit will be able to have a private income of $10 a week without that benefit being affected adversely. The amount currently allowed is $3 a week for single people under 18 and $6 for everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators would agree that these measures are certainly a very worthy attempt on the part of our Government to help those in our community who are most in need of assistance. I am particularly gratified that the Federal Government has seen fit to introduce some much needed relief measures for families. </PARA>
<PARA> Since my entry into Federal Parliament last year I have constantly stressed the need to introduce some sort of financial assistance for our Australian families. The rate of family allowance has been increased by 50 per cent for the first and second children of a family. This brings the family allowance for the first child to $22.80 a month and for the second to $32.55 a month. These measures which will cost some $375m in a full year, consolidate the increases for the third and subsequent children that were introduced in last year's Budget. Whilst it will be of particular benefit to the 1.6 million families in Australia who have one or two children, all 2.1 million families with children will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I feel it is worth noting that the rates are still only approximately 80 per cent of what they would have been had family allowances been indexed in the same way as have pensions. The family income supplement represents a commendable move in aiding low income families, particularly when the allowance is based on the joint income of both parents. Those people with an income less than the threshold amount will be eligible for the maximum rate of allowance for each child. The threshold amount is that income which a married couple with no children may have before they cease to be eligible for a health care card. </PARA>
<PARA> I also support the principle of requiring applicants for supporting parent benefit to show that they have taken appropriate steps to obtain maintenance. In the majority of cases this burden will fall on a woman finding it difficult to manage. I believe that the policy should be exercised with considerable compassion. Perhaps the Government could consider allowing the person claiming maintenance to assign his or her rights to a specialised agency set up for this purpose. The liable parent contribution scheme which applies in New Zealand may be worthy of some consideration in this regard. The increase in the spouse rebate for spouses with dependent children, combined with the lowering of the tax rate and the higher tax threshold, has improved the position of single income families to the tune of $163.50 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> However, whilst this is an improvement, there is still some distance to go. I am sure that an increase in the spouse rebate would be a necessary part of this. To my way of thinking, confining the increase in the spouse rebate to the notion of dependency is a somewhat unfair and unsatisfactory concept. Even taking into consideration the good news in the Budget, the position remains that single income families are taxed more than are dual income families. This is a matter of injustice which should be remedied. Why is it that a single income family pays in tax $6.70 a week more than does a dual income family? The spouse rebate has always been available on the basis that two cannot live as cheaply as one and that an earning spouse supporting a non-earning spouse is entitled to a rebate from income. </PARA>
<PARA> The spouse rebate is the only acknowledgment by the Government of the myriad of services by way of which single income families, either with or without children , subsidise the commercial economy. Attaching the increase in the rebate to the notion of caring for children is an exclusive concept. It excludes spouses who may be caring for grandchildren, parents or other persons. Earlier this year the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) acknowledged the heavy reliance that State governments now place on voluntary agencies. The $830 spouse rebate allowed to those without children would not pay three weeks salary for one social worker to perform some of the duties carried out by these women. Those families that receive higher business or professional incomes already have opportunities to split their incomes. Therefore, the failure to increase fully the spouse rebate mostly affects low and middle income earners. I feel that what I have put is a worthwhile proposal and I hope that the Minister and his Department will give it serious consideration in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Most pensioners will benefit from the automatic CPI-linked increases in the rates of pensions that will come into effect next month. This will increase the single rate of pension by $3.10 to $77.25 a week and the married rate by $5.20 to $128.80 a week. I also welcome the fact that from November single pensioners will be able to receive $30 of private income a week and couples $50 a week before their pension is affected. This is the first adjustment of these income levels for several years and will increase them from their current levels of $20 a week for single people and $34.50 for couples. As a result of these changes, pensioners will have an increased disposable income. They will be further assisted by the new pensioner tax rebate scheme, which is being introduced to protect pensioners with a modest income. </PARA>
<PARA> Other initiatives to be commended in this package include: An increase in the pensioner health benefit income limits to $54 a week for single pensioners and $ 90 a week for married pensioners; pharmaceutical concessions for all pensioners; an increase in the personal care subsidy for frail aged residents in subsidised hostels from $20 to $30 a week; a new income test-free rehabilitation allowance for pensioners or beneficiaries who undertake rehabilitation programs; an increase in the handicapped child's allowance by $12 to $85 a month; the earmarking of $300,000 for interim assistance to homeless youth; and increases in subsidy funds for services for aged and disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA> I applaud all these initiatives, which have been designed to assist those in our community who are in the greatest need. This Government has shown its care and compassion for the less fortunate in our country. At a time of world-wide economic recession it has acted on that concern. Within the confines of tight economic management the Federal Government has certainly put its money where its mouth is. I commend Minister Chaney and his Department for their obvious compassion and understanding of the hardships faced by some in our country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Bjelke-Petersen and Senator Walters for their support of the legislation and for the comments they made on the Budget provisions for welfare. The Budget provisions represent an attempt by the Government to come to grips with the difficulties which some people in Australia, indeed a great number of people, face. I think that the summary of the provisions which was made both by Senator Walters and Senator Bjelke-Petersen helps bring out the very positive nature of the social security aspects of the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to pick up a couple of points that Senator Bjelke-Petersen made and about which she expressed some concern. She referred to the decision to reactivate the existing requirement that women seeking support of my Department who are supporting parents should have to seek maintenance. She was concerned that that decision should be administered in a humane way. I would like to assure the Senate that the rules which have been laid down governing the application of that section are that, first, the requirement is not a pre- condition to the grant of benefit. In other words, somebody seeking assistance will not be required to meet that condition before assistance will be provided. Instead, a 3-month period is allowed for the applicant to take whatever action would be reasonable to seek maintenance from the non-supporting spouse. In some cases that action would be nil. In other cases action, such as going to the courts and so on, would be required. It is intended that this rule should be administered in a flexible and humane way. I would be anxious to hear of any situations in which that was not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bjelke-Petersen also raised the possibility that we could take a different approach to the whole question of maintenance by the non-supporting parent. I would like to confirm to the Senate that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and I have under consideration the recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act which raised that possibility. We are examining the possibility of having a collection agency. There is already a precedent for that in Australia. In Western Australia the Family Court acts as an agent in this regard. In South Australia, the Department for Community Welfare Services acts in that regard. I think it is generally accepted among those who are informed in this area that those experiments have been worth while and warrant the same system being available around Australia. I am not anxious and my Department is not anxious for the Department of Social Security to assume that role. It is accepted that there should be some reform and change in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I note also the suggestion relating to the New Zealand scheme. I do not know whether it is the New Zealand origins of the honourable senator's spouse which have led her to know of this but, in fact, the welfare Ministers of Australia have been keeping under examination the New Zealand experiment in that area. There have been early administrative problems but again it represents a most interesting approach-the imposition of a departmental administration which exacts from a non-supporting spouse a statutorily determined level of assistance or maintenance. That is something which may well be worth while implementing in Australia. We are watching the New Zealand experiment with interest. I might also add that there are similar schemes in some parts of the United States. My attention was drawn when I was in Queensland to a similar experiment in the State of New York which apparently has been quite successful. I can say to the Senate that that area of country is under careful survey. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of splitting incomes-that is the second matter raised by Senator Bjelke-Petersen-is a matter of concern. She drew attention to the fact that, notwithstanding the concession which is given to the single income family through the dependent spouse allowance, there is still a discrepancy in favour of those who can split their income. Senator Bjelke-Petersen set the figure at $ 6.70 a week and I think that is an accurate figure. I do not produce it as an official government figure but my recollection is that the differential is of that order. In other words, there is something like a $1,300 tax advantage in splitting ones' income because one gets the benefit of two tax-free areas. That $1,300 advantage is reduced to a $300 a year advantage or something a little more than that by the $1,000 plus which is going through the dependent spouse tax rebate. The only qualification I would place on the points made by Senator Bjelke-Peterson is that it is argued by those who obtain two incomes in the family that usually costs are involved in two people earning an income. There are usually fares and other additional costs. There may be costs for additional clothing and so on. Some would argue that already the dependent spouse tax rebate does in fact more than equalise the position. It would be difficult to be exact because, of course, the expenses of earning income vary from person to person. It probably would be reasonable to say that most people who have to use public transport to go to work in Australia today would spend at least $1 a day on fares. Those offsetting matters need to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to deal now with the less friendly part of the debate which took place this afternoon. One of the marked features of the debate was the lack of analysis by the Opposition of what was causing difficulty in the welfare area, although I concede that Senator Colston made reference to increased unemployment as a critical factor. I accept that point very readily. But what was even more marked was the total lack of any prescription by the Opposition. I did not hear any suggestion by the Opposition of what it believes it could or would do if it were in government today. Whilst I have every sympathy for the Opposition's wish not to commit itself-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition Whip says 'neither it should'. It is interesting that an Opposition which holds itself out as the alternative government of this country does not see itself as being under any obligation to indicate its alternative policies. Over the rather excited interjections of the Opposition Whip may I say that there is nothing on the record which suggests what the Opposition believes it would or could do were it in government-a very unlikely event. I think we are entitled to take with a grain of salt some of the criticisms which were made because I think they were made for the sake of criticism and without any attempt to say what the Opposition thought was realistically possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me touch on some of the particular points which were raised. I suppose the key criticism made was that there was little in this Budget for the people who are dependent upon welfare or, indeed, affected by welfare. Many of the people who are assisted by my Department are not by any stretch of the imagination within the category of welfare. The Department is involved in things such as the family allowance which is paid to people across a very broad range of incomes. It is engaged in the payment of pensions to people who are free of income tests and so on. It is not true to say that all of the provisions of my Department relate solely to welfare in the sense of the relief of need. Rather than use a great deal of the time of the Senate-the Senate has been co-operative in trying to move through the legislation today-I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a list of 18 items which was circulated to honourable senators at the time the Budget was introduced and which sets out the main features of the social security budget in 1982-83. I think it is an ample answer to the point that there is nothing of substance in this Budget for welfare. I have shown this list to Senator Colston; no shadow Minister was present in the chamber at the time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I wish simply to underline a few features of that. As was pointed out in the Budget statement I put down, some 75 per cent of that very considerable expenditure increase is accounted for by increases in benefits through indexation and increases in numbers of beneficiaries. I think it is important to make that point because there is very considerable automatic growth in social security expenditure, which affects the ability of government to pick up new initiatives. I believe one should try to make it very clear that three-quarters of that very large amount of increase in welfare expenditure was picked up by those two simple things: An updating of the amount of benefits to take inflation into account and an increase in the number of beneficiaries. Of course, that still leaves 25 per cent of that very considerable sum to provide for new initiatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it should be noted that in this legislation provision is made for two new initiatives of very considerable welfare significance. I will touch on them. The first is the family income supplement, which was criticised in the debate as being too narrow but which represents the new step for Australian welfare of providing an income supplement to low income earning families with children. We have had in Australia the very odd situation whereby some low income earners could be better off unemployed than employed. Clearly, that is socially very undesirable. It is scarcely likely to contribute to good community attitudes or to a successfully operating community. The family income supplement, which provides a supplement per child for people who are in employment but earning low incomes, will remove that anomaly. I believe it is an important first step. We will need to monitor it very carefully. Even though its operation may be restricted to 30,000 families initially, it represents a new initiative on which it may well be productive to build. The second substantial initiative is the mobility allowance. It is described as being a very good initiative, but it is criticised in the amendment which is before us-I will come back to that-for being, again, too limited. I can only say that a measure which is estimated to advantage some 35,000 disabled people must be regarded as a very useful initial foray into this field. As I said at the time of the presentation of the Budget, it is a new move which we will monitor carefully and we will be prepared to adjust in the light of experience. I thought one particularly interesting suggestion put forward by Senator Ryan in her speech-I think it was probably one of the most positive points she made-and that her reference to the severely disabled woman who might be undertaking virtually the full care of a home and family. I think that is a very interesting additional category which might be considered. I give this public undertaking that in our monitoring of that scheme I certainly will ensure that further consideration is given to that category of severely disabled persons. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other matters. They are much smaller in size at this stage, although they are of potentially great importance. In this Budget we have provided for a pilot project in attendant care. It is one of the major concerns brought forward during the International Year of Disabled Persons. I hope very shortly to be able to announce the beginnings of a pilot scheme in attendant care which will help to give us policy guidance in developments in that field. The other area of great significance to the disabled is that we have picked up the suggestion that we should do something to reduce the disincentives for disabled people to re-enter the work force. The matters which were touched on in debate-the provisions which will enable severely disabled people to get health care cover for a period of up to a year, which will enable them to get eased readmission to the ranks of invalid pensioners if their attempts to re-enter employment fail-are important steps in removing some of the very real disincentives which at present face severely handicapped people when they wish to enter open employment. I believe that this is a positive step which would be generally welcomed around the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I will turn in a moment to the amendments proposed by both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. First, I just touch on a couple of the other points of detail which were raised. Reference was made by both Senator Ryan and, I think, Senator Colston, to the level of indexed benefits and their alleged loss of value. It is, of course, by definition a fact that at present the bulk of social security income maintenance payments is protected against the ravages of inflation. They are protected against changes in the cost of living by a twice yearly automatic adjustment. That adjustment takes place without the need for further intervention by this Parliament. It is also true, of course, that if average weekly earnings rise at a rate greater than that of inflation the relative value of pensions to average weekly earnings will decline. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard one further table which was prepared by my Department in October 1982, showing the standard rate of pension as a percentage of average weekly total earnings of all male employees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That table confirms that during the life of the Australian Labor Party the standard rate of pension reached a peak of 24.5 per cent of average weekly earnings. It is interesting to see that during the rest of 1975 that declined to 23.7 per cent. In the final quarter of 1975 it went back up to 24.4 per cent. Those variations reflect the changes in average weekly earnings when notched up against the biannual changes to pensions according to changes in the cost of living. The history since we came into government is of some interest. The percentage ran along at a fairly steady rate of between 23.9 per cent and over 24 per cent of average weekly earnings over a period of some years. It reached 24.9 per cent in the June quarter of 1977, it was 25 per cent in the June quarter of 1978 and reached 25.2 per cent in the December quarter of 1978. It is true that since that time there has been a decline. That reflects the fact that over recent years average weekly earnings have increased at a much faster rate than has the rate of inflation. That is the simple explanation. It does not represent a reduction in the purchasing power of the pension; rather, it simply represents a change in the relative position of the pension to average weekly earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It remains true that if, in Australia in 1982, during a period when we have economic difficulties, employed Australians continue to demand increases in their earnings greater than increases in productivity pensioners, the unemployed and all other sections of the community will have to suffer by comparison. One cannot get quarts out of pint pots, as Mr Hayden said in the 1975 Budget debate. The fact is that if wage and salary earners take out of the system increases which are greater than true economic growth, by definition, there has to be less left for pensioners, for profits and for all sectors of the economy which are dependent upon taking from the total pool. So if one wishes to change the ratio of pensions and other benefits to average weekly earnings it may require increases in pensions and benefits and it certainly will require the sort of wage restraint that this Government has been seeking. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to touch on one other matter which is specific, and that is the very critical references which are made in these amendments to homeless youth. It seems to me that Senator Ryan, who spoke for the Opposition, had not bothered to study the report to which she referred, the report on homeless youth from the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare. I refer her and the Senate to that report and in particular to page 161, which refers to government responsibility with respect to unemployed youth. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the majority of cases the government's responsibility is to support the family, not to take over its function. The real dilemma of government is knowing at what point family support for a young person can be considered to have ceased to exist. Both parents and youth should not be enabled to readily shirk their responsibilities and obligations. At the same time, governments should not wait until the last moment to provide assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>At page 163 the Senate Committee report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In most countries examined, there appears to be a very strong attitude that families should support unemployed youth. For example, in West Germany there is a statutory requirement that families and relatives must support all children until such time as they are able to obtain full time employment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was a Labor and Liberal committee of which, amongst others, Senator Grimes was a member. The report continued at page 164:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has framed its income recommendations around a demonstrated needs basis. Consequently, it has been unable to accept recommendations from many witnesses who have proposed across the board increases in unemployment benefits and other allowances. While across the board increases would be by far the simplest of schemes to administer, the cost to revenue would be extremely high, and the implementation of such a scheme under the present economic conditions would almost certainly mean less funds available for other social welfare programs. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn to the specific recommendations of the Committee. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee RECOMMENDS that an allowance equivalent to the difference between the over 18 years of age unemployment rate and the junior unemployment benefit rate should be made available to certain unemployed youth under 18 years of age. These would include:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) those who have had to establish themselves, for one reason or another, away from the family or statutory home;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) those whose family's financial circumstances are such that the additional benefit would enable the family to remain together as a unit rather than the young person being forced into possible homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not quote at any greater length from that report. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to make is that the Committee did not recommend overall increases in unemployment benefit for that age group. Rather, it recommended a more selective approach. That report was available to me and to the Government on, I think, the day of the Budget. I had preliminary discussions with the Committee during this year, for which I thank it, and I was in part guided by its advice in what came out of the Budget. But I point out that with respect to youth we have, firstly, increased the rate of unemployment benefit, secondly, increased the rate of support to those caring for homeless youth and, thirdly, made new funds available to agencies working with homeless youth. That serious problem is one recognised as such by the Government and we are seeking to respond to it in a responsible and proper way. I believe that the measures that we put in the Budget are in accord with the spirit of the two-party recommendations of the Senate Select Committee and I undertake that we will do a close policy examination in this area in conjunction with State Ministers over the coming months. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the amendments moved by the Opposition and the Democrats. The Senate will not be surprised to know that the Government rejects the views contained in the amendments. I will touch on the various components of the Labor Party's amendment. Firstly, the amendment states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) deplores the Government's failure to protect the value of social security pensions, benefits and payments generally. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply remind the Senate of this Government's institution of twice-yearly indexation and of the fact that non-indexed benefits have over recent Budgets received indexation level adjustments. So there has been a protection of the purchasing power of virtually all of the pensions and benefits paid through my Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The next part of the amendment states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) is of the opinion that the Bill should also provide for-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) greater increases in payments to the under-18 unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>I have already referred to the Senate Committee report and to the fact that the Government has made adjustments which I believe are consistent with that report. The amendment continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) increases in payments for children to maintain the real value of those payments. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the 50 per cent increase in family allowance for first and second children, and the addition to the dependent spouse rebates where dependent children are involved, represents a substantial concession to the very real needs of families with children. The amendment continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) eligibility for mobility allowance for disabled persons working 18 hours a week. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply say that that represents a reduction of only two hours a week on what the Government proposes and I have indicated that we regard this as something to be monitored and watched in practice. We will be prepared to adjust in the light of experience. The final point of complaint in the Labor Party's amendment calls for:</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) an end to the discrimination against the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>That was mainly said to relate to the failure to index benefits. As I have just pointed out, in fact these allowances have received indexation level adjustments in the current Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved by the Australian Democrats provides:</PARA>
<PARA> (v) unemployed people to undertake training courses for up to 16 hours per week (instead of the present limit of 8 hours per week) before becoming ineligible for unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>To this proposal, I say that the eight hours limit was only ever regarded as a guide within the Department. It was put down as a figure below which benefit could automatically be permitted. The practice in the Department-I understand there has been a recent change-is to be much more flexible in that judgment. It is my wish that the Department be flexible, and that those people who are undertaking training which does not preclude their availability for fulltime work be eligible for benefits. I do not think there is any great distance between us on that point. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point raised by the Democrats is:</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) unemployed people to receive unemployment benefits while they are engaged in setting up a small business with the purpose of becoming self-employed but before they derive an income from that business. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to say that, whilst we have some room to move in that area, the suggestion that people engaged in business and self-employed ought to be entitled to unemployment benefit during periods where they can claim not to have income opens up a very difficult line of country. The fact is that what income is available to a person with a business will often vary considerably from time to time, from week to week, from month to month. The determination whether a business is profitable is not always an easy matter. For example, a business is often without cash because of its expanding needs for working capital. The business may well be in a position where profits are being made, income tax liability is accruing and yet there is a real shortage of ready cash. As a practising solicitor in a well established firm, I sometimes found that there was not very much ready cash because of working capital and other requirements. There is a substantial point there but it is not an area in which the Department blindly administers the rule. Factual cases are examined carefully. But I wish to emphasise that it is an area of very considerable difficulty in which the possibility of very real abuse can be opened up if it is allowed to go too far. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget represents an attempt by the Government to come to grips with some of the realities of Australia in 1982. Many of the measures contained in it reflect views which were put forcefully to me by disabled and aged persons over the past 12 months. I believe that we can properly claim that it is a reasonable contribution to Australian welfare in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I close by saying that about the time when we were preparing the Budget I was struck by the words of Mr Ronald Mendelsohn who wrote a book called Fair Go on welfare issues in Australia which is very critical in many parts of the efforts that we have made. There are two things which are worth remembering in a debate where we have naturally concentrated on the provisions of cash benefits and services by government. I quote very briefly from pages 197 and 198 of that book in which Mr Mendelsohn said:</PARA>
<PARA> A welfare society calls for qualities of spirit and effort, love and toleration , not necessarily present in such welfare states as we have so far seen. </PARA>
<PARA>I say 'Amen' to that and believe that that is an important element of having a good welfare system. On page 198, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> Only a society technically advanced and producing a steadily rising flow of physical things, skilled services and advanced information could really be a welfare society. </PARA>
<PARA>I say 'Amen' to that also. I trust that Australia will soon be able to resume a path of economic growth which is essential to the solution of the welfare problems of 1982. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish very briefly to indicate that the Opposition is prepared to accept the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats which seeks to add sub-paragraphs (v) and (vi) to the amendment moved by the Opposition. In so doing, I reply to Senator Chaney's assertions that we have failed to offer any alternative in this debate. I point out to him that it is not the role of the Opposition, 12 months before an election is to take place , to detail in an expenditure way how we would deal with this problem of social welfare payments. We are not in the business of determining the role of government when we are in opposition; but we are in the business of raising valid criticisms of what we believe to be crumbs from the table in respect of the way in which the Government is dealing with social security benefits. We are also in the process of preparing a program which, when the election date is announced, will relate to what our policy would be at that election. Our policy at an election this year would be clearly different because of different economic circumstances from what it would be if an election were held in November or December 1983. To accept the challenge by the Minister and announce where we stand today when we might have an entirely different set of circumstances next year, to which even the Minister refers, would put us in the invidious position of the Government being able to say that we were being irresponsible when we were obviously dealing with a different set of circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the relevant question which must be faced by the Senate is that this Government's Budget for the ensuing year is based upon a no-growth concept. If the Opposition were to accept that principle, it would find itself in a difficult position as regards social security benefits. Our policies are designed to regenerate the Australian economy, to get growth and to get across to the community a development concept which would provide increases in average weekly earnings and in living standards and which would enable us then to perform a proper function of indicating at an election time what our policies would be in respect of social security pensions and unemployment benefit, particularly unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us face the fact that in the brief couple of months since the Budget was first put together we have seen an alarming increase in the degree of unemployment. That in itself has prompted the Opposition to raise the question of the rubbery figures in respect of social security payments to the unemployed. If the rate of about 1,200 people a day losing their jobs were to continue during the balance of this year and most of 1983, what an absurd position the Opposition would be placed in if it were to telegraph what it would do in the light of a dramatic fall in revenue and a dramatic increase in social security payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Without rehashing the questions raised by the Opposition, it ought to be said that our proposals are designed to be critical of the Government's Budget allocations in this respect, and we reject emphatically any suggestion that in so doing we are being irresponsible and lacking in any detail about what we propose to offer as an alternative to the Budget. The Government is responsible for producing the Budget. We are responsible for criticising it. When the time comes, we shall be announcing our policies, designed to get the economy back into a healthier state and, as a consequence of that, we shall be in a position to offer very improved and increased social security benefits to all those who qualify at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of circumstances beyond my control, I could not mention some matters during the Committee stage. However, I should like to pose a question for the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). I shall have to pose all of it in one question because I shall not be able to break it up at this stage. My question relates to clause 108 of this legislation . Among other things, and perhaps principally, clause 108 proposes to amend section 22 (2) of the Social Services Amendment Act 1981 to ensure that the savings provision has a once only effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I pose the following question: Under the provisions that exist now, before this legislation comes into effect, if a person was in government housing on 1 February and was receiving supplementary assistance and, therefore, retained the supplementary assistance due to the savings provision, and subsequently undertook casual employment and lost the eligibility for supplementary assistance, would such a person have been eligible to receive the supplementary assistance once again after having come off that casual employment, assuming that all other conditions were equal and that the person was still in the government owned residence? If that is so, is that what clause 108 is intended to rectify? If the clause is intended to rectify something else, perhaps I could be informed of what that is. Also, why was it necessary to deem this to have taken effect from 1 February this year rather than from some date after this Bill is passed-say, when it receives royal assent, or 1 November, or something like that?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply- I am glad that Senator Colston has had the opportunity on the third reading to raise the matter which he wished to raise in Committee. I would not wish to see him deprived of that opportunity because he has been following up this matter with some care for some time. Indeed, he raised it with me last August and I have just had to write him a letter correcting the reply which I gave him then. The example raised by Senator Colston in the debate this afternoon is the situation of a person who is in government housing and who would, therefore, under the provisions that came into operation on 1 February, not be eligible for supplementary assistance because he is getting subsidised government accommodation, but who continues to receive supplementary assistance because of the saving provision in the Social Services Amendment Act 1981. That person would lose that entitlement to supplementary assistance when he lost entitlement under the rules applying before 1 February 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If, for example, a person receiving supplementary assistance in those circumstances had an increase in income, the old income test would be applied, the entitlement to supplementary assistance would disappear and would not be revived subsequently. The position is that a person in the circumstances raised by Senator Colston would not be entitled to supplementary assistance as the Act is presently drafted if it were properly applied. </PARA>
<PARA> The anomaly that we are seeking to rectify in the current amending Bill is the situation of a person who was receiving supplementary assistance prior to February 1982 and who qualified for a higher rate of assistance under the new provisions. It was intended that that person would cease to have his saved eligibility. If, for instance, he had a continuing entitlement, but was entitled at a higher rate under the new provisions, he would be effectively given continuity and that continuity applied even if he lost eligibility and then regained it. In other words, he could reapply if he fell under the old pre- February conditions. That is the anomaly. It arose because of the inclusion of two words which are being deleted by the clause to which Senator Colston referred, the words 'or applies' in section 22 of the principal Act. So the particular circumstance which Senator Colston has raised on the third reading is not a circumstance which is affected at all by the legislation which is currently before the Senate. What is being rectified is a quite different circumstance in which a person who was receiving supplementary assistance prior to February 1982 and who qualified for a higher rate of assistance under the new provisions was able to go back and claim under the pre-February 1982 provisions. That was an anomaly that was unintended and it will cease to be by the removal of those two words. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition would like to congratualate the Government on the Repatriation Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 . It represents the most flattering piece of repatriation legislation to be brought down in a long time in that it mirrors so clearly key aspects of Australian Labor Party policy. What amazes me, however, is the bare-faced manner in which the Government is now touting reforms which it rejected out of hand less than 12 months ago when the Opposition had the temerity to move them here and in another place. Let me remind the Senate of some of those reforms that are now to be-properly in our view, of course-enshrined in legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nobody can possibly object to the proposal that extends eligibility for repatriation benefits to members of peacekeeping forces who served as representatives of Australia prior to 2 November 1981. When this Government amended the Repatriation Act a year ago to give such benefits to those serving overseas after 2 November 1981, my colleague Senator Grimes moved that repatriation benefits be extended to their predecessors. The Government rejected this. When, earlier this year, the Government moved to extend entitlement to cover Australian members of the multinational force now serving in Sinai, the Opposition again attempted to persuade the Government to rethink its dogmatic position on those who had served with peacekeeping observation and monitoring forces before 2 November 1981. The Government again rejected it. Then in July this year the ALP national conference adopted as part of its policy on veterans' affairs a commitment to introduce legislation relating to overseas service so as to provide equality of repatriation entitlements for veterans of all wars, designated campaigns or peacekeeping duties at least equivalent to those now enjoyed by World War II veterans. And surprise, surprise! The Government, sniffing the wind of an early election, decided to adopt this measure in relation to peacekeeping duties and turned it into its very own Budget promise. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the measure is baldly announced with no attempt at justification shows how much the Government thinks of the men who will benefit. There is no praise for the quiet heroism of these forgotten men; no understanding of the unreported hazards of peacekeeping operations; no apology for the years they have been kept in limbo; no listing of the places in which they served out of sight and, to all intents and purposes, out of mind. So let me remind the Government of the men we are talking about now, the men the Opposition was talking about, apparently in vain, only a year ago and again earlier this year. It is a long list. From 1947 to 1951 Australia participated in peacekeeping groups in Greece following the civil war there. Similarly, Australia was represented in the peacekeeping force in Indonesia from 1947 to 1957 following the war against the Dutch. From 1956 to the present day we have been part of the United Nations truce supervisory organisation in the Middle East. Australians have been serving since 1949 in the Kashmir in a similar role in the wake of border conflicts between India and Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA> We sent a small contingent to the Lebanon in 1958 and assisted United Nations forces in the Congo between 1960 and 1964. Cyprus, of course, has been a regular posting for Australian police officers serving with the United Nations civilian police force since 1964. Australian servicemen joined the observer mission that was sent to the Yemen after United Nations intervention there in 1963-64. Again in the Middle East, our involvement in the United Nations Emergency Force II in the Suez Canal area lasted from 1973 to 1980. Australia's role in the observation operation during the 1980 Zimbabwe election was our most recent international involvement, save for the controversial Sinai contingent which commenced service this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret very much that the Royal Australian Air Force observation unit that served at Ubon in Thailand in 1962 is not part of this list for the Government's purposes, although it clearly should be. It goes without saying that we support this part of the amendment. I urge the Government to review as a matter of urgency the delineation of designated campaigns to include the RAAF contingent at Ubon and any other unit so displaced in terms of access to benefits and defence force homes, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> The notorious 'arisen out of' provision is also subject to the amendments proposed by this Bill. The Opposition supports the extension of what is commonly known as the 'arisen out of or attributable to' provision to members of the forces who participated in conflicts other than World War II. I have already mentioned the ALP platform item dealing with this. It is supported by other items promising the extension of liberal treatment to all ex-service personnel disabled as a result of war service and to their dependants. The ALP is firmly of the opinion that our ex-servicemen are entitled to know that their disabilities will be treated and that they themselves will be treated compassionately. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) made gratuitous mention of the worries of Vietnam veterans in this context. He spoke derisively of the publicity given to the veterans' belief that they have been disadvantaged by not being subject to the 'arisen out of' clause applicable to World War II veterans. He claimed that very few instances have come to attention where eligibility for disability pension would arise because of the application of the 'arisen out of or attributable to' provision apart from the 'occurrence' provision. The simple reason for this is that many veterans have assumed their probable ineligibility and have not bothered to apply. There is no doubt that their patronage of the counselling service is to some extent affected by whether they believe they will get a fair go if they do bother to lodge a claim. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of the correspondence and personal representations senators and members deal with are from veterans who, rightly or wrongly, believe they are getting a raw deal from the Department of Veterans' Affairs and its agencies. Much of it concerns what they are convinced to be actual misdiagnosis and poor treatment of conditions they believe to be due to their war service. This is particularly so with Vietnam veterans suffering classic post-traumatic stress syndrome. An unknown number of suicides is a chilling reminder of how permanent was the damage the veterans suffered. We therefore support this move by the Government, a move we have advocated before, in the name of those veterans and their families who have been denied a fair deal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is good at last to have it acknowledged by this Government, whose Liberal predecessors have been such enthusiastic and shameless war-mongers, that, as the Minister said: 'The Government considers that the same principles of eligibility should apply to all veterans for all conflicts . . .'. We accept in good faith the rider to that comment-'. . . unless there is good reason to introduce specific principles and provisions for particular conflicts or for particular groups of veterans'-and trust that it will not be used in any other than the best interests of our veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I remind the Government that the single move most calculated to assist the well-being and state of mind of Vietnam veterans would be, as we continually urge, to hold an independent judicial inquiry into the effects of herbicides and pesticides on Vietnam veterans. This proposal was actually passed in the Senate a year ago, only to be cynically ignored by the Government. It is now the all but unanimous policy of the National Conference of Ex-Service Organisations, although the Returned Services League, out of deference to the Government, has held the line against such a move. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it not strange, that this Government, which has been so anxious to appoint royal commissions and inquiries into everything under the sun, including the bottom of the harbour, just cannot face the prospect of opening the Pandora's box containing the legacy of the Vietnam war? But if it is good enough to have a royal commission into the substitution of meat carcasses, it is surely good enough to have an independent judicial inquiry into the effects of herbicides and pesticides on men prepared to die in Vietnam, many of whom, having survived that war, have made the terrible decision to end their lives here. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn again to the Government's promised review of the 'arisen out of' provisions which it claims will be part of the thorough review of all repatriation legislation now about to be undertaken. It is not the first review of legislation in this government's term of office. It would not be too harsh to advise veterans not to wait, breathless, for its outcome, since most previous reviews have been singularly ineffective and the slow moving and cumbersome Department has been either loathe to implement reform or, quite simply, incapable of effecting reform. As always, it is the veterans who have suffered unconscionable delays in the hearing and determination of their claims. It may be a truism, but here, more than anywhere else in the system, justice delayed is justice denied. In fact it might be more accurate to say that justice delayed is justice betrayed. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the further inexplicable quirks in the system is sorted out by this legislation. At last the Government, which was so tardy in introducing the category of benefit at all, is to extend service pension eligibility to Commonwealth and allied mariners who served in a theatre of war during World War II. The indefatigable battlers for these ex-merchant mariners have finally got a reward for their persistence in pursuing their particular cause, a cause supported by the ALP and denied by successive conservative governments. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister was queried last year on why the long-delayed pension was not being extended to Commonwealth and allied mariners, his lame and patently untrue rejoinder was that nobody had asked for it. That, of course, was completely untrue-just ask Bob Nelson from Newcastle or Joy Antcliffe from Perth who spearheaded the drive for recognition of the mariners' contribution. In the words of John Curtin, recalled by a merchant mariner's wife during the debate on this matter:</PARA>
<PARA> They wear no uniform, but just a badge with the letters MN. When you see it, raise your hat to the wearer. </PARA>
<PARA>At least now the remaining men who wore that badge in World War II will have a tangible reminder of the gratitude of us all. </PARA>
<PARA> For those veterans who received the 100 per cent general rate in respect of suffering pulmonary tuberculosis prior to November 1978, which this Government tore out of their hands at about the same time it decided to tax newsboys, there is in this legislation a belated acknowledgement of error. There is no retrospectivity, of course, because these are not tax dodgers, just veterans. But at least it is being restored and again the Opposition has seen its stand vindicated by a government which chooses to restore justice only in accord with the prevailing election winds. </PARA>
<PARA> Another section of ALP policy adopted by the Government is in respect of disregarding as income any disability pension when assessing levels of service pension and fringe benefits. The Minister claims that the RSL has described this move as historic. What a pity that the RSL did not so proclaim the same ALP policy adopted in July-a month before this one surfaced in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to the specific additional measures which the Opposition believes should be incorporated in this Bill. There is clearly a need for Government to recognise the selfless contribution that the wives of totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen have made to the care of their husbands over the years, often to the detriment of their own health. This is a cause that has been taken up by TPI associations and the National Conference of Ex-Service Organisations, and the ALP platform on veterans' affairs now includes an undertaking to provide relief and treatment, where appropriate, for the wives of TPI veterans. I hardly need cite again the overwhelming case for the independent judicial inquiry which this Senate endorsed almost a year ago. On behalf of the Opposition, I now move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill should provide for-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) increased benefits for the wives of totally and permanently incapacitated veterans, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an immediate independent judicial inquiry into the effect on Vietnam veterans of their exposure to herbicides and pesticides.'</PARA>
<PARA>I commend the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Repatriation Legislation Amendment Bill is the second such Bill the Senate has discussed within the year. It is interesting that the legislation is undergoing change at a time of considerable turmoil amongst veterans' organisations concerning the purposes and functioning of the Repatriation Act, which affects them so closely. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) has announced that he is undertaking a complete review of the Act. The Australian Democrats would certainly support such a review, particularly if the Minister carried out the promises that he has made publicly that the ex-service associations will be intimately involved in the redrafting or reworking of the Repatriation Act. This Bill gives to veterans a range of benefits that anyone who has been working in the field would certainly believe is their wont. They would certainly thank the Government for having moved on so many measures at the one time. I believe that in a sense some of the people feel overwhelmed by the fact that with so little movement in many areas they will receive so much in a short time. They are extremely grateful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to go through some of the items covered by the Bill because I believe that a number of the items are extremely important to certain groups of veterans. In a debate such as this it is worthwhile raising why the Government has a duty and an obligation to these veterans. Many people in the community seem to feel that bludgers may be afoot in this area. I feel it is necessary to raise the types of difficulties that many veterans run up against in acquiring these benefits. Many people think that one needs simply to write in to get these benefits. That is very far from the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The first matter I raise relates to the proposal in the Bill to extend the liability provision 'arisen out of or attributable to' to World War I, Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam veterans. I introduced a private member's Bill in relation to Vietnam veterans and sought an amendment to the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act. In my second reading speech I acknowledged that other veterans suffered under an identical disability and it would be necessary to amend the legislation under which they come. Certainly the amendment to the repatriation legislation is a much neater and clearer way of bringing all those veterans into the same eligibility category. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Veterans' Affairs in his second reading speech seemed to play down somewhat the necessity for this legislative change. I feel this is unfortunate because an appeal against a decision of the Repatriation Review Tribunal lodged in the New South Wales District Registry of the Federal Court of Australia specifically questioned this item. In particular, under the heading ' Questions of law to be raised on the Appeal', the notice of appeal states:</PARA>
<PARA> Did the Tribunal fail to apply section 6 (1) of the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962 . . . by treating the expression 'has resulted from' as if it were 'arising out of'?</PARA>
<PARA>I think the point is well taken in that appeal. I believe that if that appeal had been proceeded with the veteran may very well not have succeeded, that on at least one reasonable reading of the Act as it stands those veterans were not covered to the same extent as are World War II veterans. So I think that this change is extremely important, not only for that reason in law but also because so many veterans at their conferences in the last year have looked at this aspect and have been concerned about whether it applies to them. I believe that that in itself would justify the legislative change that is proposed in the Bill before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seeks to disregard the disability pension in the income test for the purpose of determining eligibility for service pension and fringe benefits. I think that this is an excellent move and again I congratulate the Government on that amendment. I believe it is something for which various organisations have fought over a long period. Those organisations are very grateful to the Government for having acceded to what I believe has been an extremely reasonable request on their part in terms of the basic philosophical reason the country supports their members for the services that they in turn have given to the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also seeks to extend eligibility for the service pension to former Commonwealth and allied mariners. It also seeks to extend benefits to representatives of Australia who served with peacekeeping, monitoring and observing forces. As Senator Ryan has already suggested, this is something that has been urged upon the Government for some time-certainly it was urged upon it during the last debate we had on repatriation legislation in, I believe, April this year. It is good to see that at last the logic of those claims has struck the Government with sufficient force for it to do something and to include them in this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also proposes that a range of benefits be increased. Whilst I feel that this is certainly welcomed by veterans, it is certainly no more than their due. Indeed, I think it would be far better if all of these attendant allowances and pensions were indexed. I believe that we ought to remove the necessity for legislation to come before the Senate time and again to increase these amounts. The indexation of benefits would give stability to these pensions in terms of the expectations of the veterans themselves. I hope that this is the last time that the Senate has to deal with legislation which seeks to increase benefits such as the attendant allowance. Legislation should be introduced, upon review of the present arrangements, to index all benefits so that we have a settled position, not one which can be taken up at times which are politically opportune. We should bear in mind the needs of pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government in this legislation picks up one other item which was the subject of a private members Bill I introduced into this place. I refer to the restoration of the disability pension at the 100 per cent general rate for veterans who received or were eligible to receive a disability pension for pulmonary tuberculosis. It is interesting to note that on the last occasion we debated this matter-that was on 26 November 1981-the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, in his reply to why it was being rejected at the time by the Government , said:</PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons, the Government maintains its opposition to the Bill. It believes that its decision in 1978 was correct . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Thank goodness at last it has seen that that statement of the Minister was not correct, that its position was wrong in equity and in justice and that that ought to have been the case in 1978. Again, I believe it is a pity that, having recognised the justice of the case, those pensioners who have been deprived since 1978 and who have suffered that disability since 1978 are not now to be recompensed upon the belated recognition of the justice of their case. I am not quite sure what type of argument is being used in this case. However, the argument presumably must run as follows: From 1945 to 1978 someone suffered from the disability of pulmonary tuberculosis; from 1978 to 1983 the person did not suffer from that disease; and from 1983 onwards he did suffer from it. That is an absurd and farcical proposition if ever there were one. I believe the tuberculosis veterans themselves see as absurd and grossly unjust this situation which has been visited upon them by an arbitrary act of government and firmly upheld by governments of all political persuasions. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this measure has probably done the Government very little good in terms of creating a feeling of confidence amongst pensioners, a feeling that if they do not keep battling for the pensions and allowances that have been granted to them by government a predatory government will take those benefits away. In a sense I think that is an excessively poor situation. Many ex-service organisations have not had an influx of new members. However, veterans from our most recent conflicts have seen fit to form special organisations which are concerned with people who served in those conflicts. They have not, to a great extent, become involved in organisations such as the Totally and Permanently Disabled Soldiers Association and other organisations which were established following World War II. Therefore, many of these organisations, which still have a great deal of work on their hands, do not have young members with the physical capacity to carry out their onerous duties on behalf of their fellow veterans. I believe it is a pity that the Government should engage in an act such as this and so create in those veterans' minds the belief that of necessity they must constantly fight over and over again simply to retain those items that they felt had been sworn to them almost on oath by government after government. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise two other matters on the Repatriation Act in this debate since it is one of the occasions on which one can look at the Act and at what might be the more immediate problems that seem to be facing the veterans' organisations. One of those must be-I know that it is one matter to which the Minister has paid a great deal of attention but it is one to which, I feel, we cannot pay too much attention-the method by which a person can get a claim upheld. As I mentioned at the beginning, that method is a long and arduous one for many veterans. It is not simply a matter, as is often believed in the community at large, of writing a letter saying: 'I am a veteran and I want an allowance'. That is far from the case. Yet it seems to be abroad, certainly in many young people's minds, that this is the operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The operation is a very searching one. It is one in which a great deal of care and consideration takes place. The operation is extremely costly. The point of my concern is the possibility that we may now have created a system in which we are putting people to too great a pressure. If one looks at the number of appeals which are going through to the Repatriation Review Tribunal one will see that far too many are going through to that level. If one looks at the statistics it would seem that many more appeals ought to be being granted at the Repatriation Board level. I believe more appeals could be granted at the Board level if there were closer application to the items that appear in the Repatriation Act itself. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not so long ago that we saw an historical judgment of the High Court of Australia which suggested to the Repatriation Review Tribunal that it was not interpreting the law as it was clearly laid down in the Repatriation Act. I believe that the Repatriation Act in many ways contains some extremely useful commonsense notions that are being put aside in favour of more legalistic approaches. While these more legalistic approaches are providing many of the ranges of appeal for veterans, they also seem to be providing them with a great deal more heartache, worry, concern and, above all, cost. This is an area which I believe must be on the top of the priority list of any review that is undertaken. On looking at the more commonsense notions which are currently available, while not taking away those rights of appeal, I believe more appeals could be granted at the Board level and fewer would have to go on to appeal. If one reads some of the reasons for decisions which are stated at the top levels, one will find it almost incomprehensible why claims had not been granted prior to the case that I mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The other item I raise concerns the notion of eligible service which has been raised with the Minister in recent times. I hope that in the Minister's reply he will point to what is the current activity and the thinking of the Government in relation to those items. I refer to the principal Act and sections 107H, 107J and 107K which, when taken together, interpret what is meant by eligible service , the problem being that in terms of the Act a disabled regular serviceman or servicewoman, or retired regular serviceman or servicewoman, will have some difficulty in what seems to be an emerging interpretation-I put it as low as that-on the part of the Repatriation Boards in relation to what might be eligible service. I believe that it should not be necessary to have these interpretations climb to the level of the High Court. The costs, such as those involved in the previous case which was taken to that extent, have almost always come down on behalf of the Repatriation Act's more commonsense approach. If one looked at the Act and at the interpretation and tenor of that Act one would not accept that emerging interpretation of the Repatriation Board. Rather one would come down on behalf of the veterans and take the widest possible interpretation of what might be eligible service. Since the Minister has had some prior notification in relation to that matter, it might be as well to leave that side of it to enable us to complete this stage of the legislation today. At the Committee stage of the Bill, I will be moving two amendments. I think that it is appropriate to leave the discussion of those amendments until that stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Opposition senators and the Australian Democrats for their support of the legislation. Before dealing with some of the real benefits of this legislation, I wish to deal with a few points that have been raised in the course of the debate. Firstly, I turn to some of the comments made by Senator Ryan. In the first place, she drew attention to the fact that in her estimation the Government had somehow purloined the Australian Labor Party's policy in respect of veterans' affairs and had adopted that policy almost holus-bolus in this legislation. I deny that. Until I read a copy of the Australian Labor Party's conference statement of policy which was incorporated in the House of Representatives Hansard on 13 October 1982 by Dr Blewett, we had no access at all to this information. As far as I know, there has been no published document available to the general public in respect of policy statements of the ALP. I note that this veterans' affairs policy was apparently resolved at the biennial conference of the Australian Labor Party in Canberra held between 5 and 9 July this year. Anybody who understands the Budget processes of government would know that the process by which new policy proposals are put into the decision making process within government starts back in February of any year. Consequently, I can assure the Senate that I had no knowledge of what the ALP's policy would have been at the time when I determined certain policy initiatives which were subsequently decided upon by the Government during its Budget deliberations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite apart from the attempt by Labor to take credit where none was due, let me just make one or two other points that Senator Ryan made during her speech. She drew attention to the fact that there were still considerable problems with delays in the determination of appeals and claims put forward by veterans. That is so. There is considerable difficulty in this area. That has been acknowledged by the Government on many occasions. However, steps have been taken to try to improve that situation. I think that Senator Macklin drew our attention to one of the very considerable reasons why this does occur. In fact the system has over time become more legalistic than it was intended to be and that is as a result of successive representations by the ex-service community and the findings of the Toose inquiry, which led to a series of amendments being made to the law in 1977, and consequently led to a far more complex and more legalistic form of legislation and determination system than perhaps there ought to be in situations especially of the kind to which Senator Macklin drew our attention. </PARA>
<PARA> This area does deserve a considerable rethink. The Government, in concert with the ex-service organisations, is undertaking a review at this very moment. A number of suggestions have been put forward and discussed at various meetings of veterans' organisations. I will not deal with those matters in detail at this stage but they could result in very significant changes in the extent of the delay experienced under the present system. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan raised the matter of airmen who had served at Ubon in Thailand. Last year I undertook to look into that matter and it remains under consideration. It is one of those that I will be reviewing within the context of the overall review of the legislation that I announced a month or two ago. Senator Macklin drew our attention to the position of tuberculosis pensioners and the restoration of the 100 per cent pension rate payable to those who were otherwise entitled to it before its withdrawal in 1978. He quoted me as saying that the 1978 decision was correct. It was based on medical evidence available at the time that those who were receiving TB pensions had been in every case, I believe, cured as a result of treatment received through the repatriation system or otherwise. Consequently, the degree of disability from which they were suffering would be a matter for individual, rather than blanket, determination as the law then provided. For that reason, the Government provided that the pension should not be taken away but rather should be frozen at the 1978 level. A system of reviewing the disabilities of individual veterans was instituted. In some cases the degree of disability pension available was upgraded. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that point because it does cause some difficulty in contemplating Senator Macklin's proposed amendment, which seeks retrospective payment of the disability pension available to TB pensioners. Such retrospectivity would extend , of course, to the 1978 period. There could well be veterans who had received some form of increased disability pension during the interim and there would be a problem in reconciling the withdrawal of that benefit with the granting of a further benefit under the retrospective payment of a TB pension that would flow to them. For that reason, severe practical difficulties are involved and the Government will oppose the proposed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin also drew our attention to the problems involved in the determination process and the fact that a number of cases proceed to the Repatriation Review Tribunal level rather than being determined at lower levels in the system. I wish to point out that approximately 75 per cent of the cases that flow through the determination process in a given year are successfully determined before they reach the Repatriation Review Tribunal. Therefore, only a minority of cases proceed beyond that point. Obviously, they are the ones in which there is a basis for contention, either on legalistic grounds or the common sense grounds to which Senator Macklin has referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to re-emphasise some of the points that were made in the second reading speech. The Budget measures are given effect in the Bill and demonstrate in a formal way the Government's continuing concern to ensure that those who have served Australia and our Commonwealth partners and allies in war and warlike conflicts may be certain of receiving adequate compensation for the losses they have suffered, and the sacrifices they have made, during their service. The measures covered in the Bill represent the best Budget, from the point of view of veterans and their dependants, that has been brought down in many years. Honourable senators need not rely on what I say. That has been well and truly stated in public by veterans' organisations. It was particularly gratifying to note the very firm and quick public support given to the Budget decisions by the Returned Services League of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Two initiatives taken in the Budget are of historic significance. The first relates to the new entitlement to repatriation, medical and hospital treatment for all disabilities suffered by Second World War veterans who receive not less than 50 per cent of the general rate of pension and, of course, any level of service pension. The second is that, from 11 November, no amount of disability pension will be taken into account in assessing the level of service pension received and the eligibility for fringe benefits. It was gratifying to note the very supportive remarks of Senator Macklin and Senator Ryan in respect of that initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision means that as from 11 November a single veteran with a temporary and permanently incapacitated pension, for instance, provided he has only a limited amount of other income, will receive the full service pension. He will also be eligible for fringe benefits. That means, in round terms, an increase of more than $50 in the total fortnightly pension of the TPI pensioner. Of course, that figure may be affected by the receipt of other income but, clearly, it is a decision of fundamental importance, a most important indication of the Government's sincerity about its commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention also the increase in the amount of income allowed to a person in qualifying for the maximum rate of service pension; the extension of the service pension to merchant mariners of Commonwealth and allied countries and repatriation benefits to all Australian representatives of peacekeeping, monitoring and observing forces. I wish to mention also the extension to double orphans of eligibility for benefits. A whole range of allowances for the more severely disabled veterans has been increased. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains positive measures to aid veterans. In another place an attempt was made to divert attention from those positive measures by using the Bill as a vehicle for speaking about the problems of Vietnam veterans. It is difficult to see what other measures can be adopted immediately in respect of that group of veterans but I would like to deal with a few other matters to indicate exactly what has been done. Nearly three years ago, when the agent orange controversy arose, the Government began its attempts to get at the facts scientifically. It must be realised that we were faced with a situation in which no studies had been directed specifically to that question. A study of the possible effect on servicemen of herbicides used in Vietnam had never been undertaken. Initial studies commissioned by the Government led the researchers to conclude that the focus should be shifted from the narrow area of chemicals towards the possible effects of Vietnam service, as such. </PARA>
<PARA> In February of this year I explained publicly the revisions required in the research program. Scientific studies as complex as these inevitably take time. Nothing is achieved by undue haste. Nonetheless, I expect to have the first results of the studies-those concerning birth defects among the children of Vietnam veterans-before the end of this year. I hope by the end of next year to have the results of another study-that concerned with the causes and incidence of death, including suicides, among Vietnam veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a Senate committee has been examining the evidence on the alleged effects on the health of veterans of chemicals used in Vietnam. Its report is expected soon. It is an all-party committee on which the Government does not have a majority. The committee could not in any way be accused of being biased in favour of the Government. Provision already exists within the repatriation system for compensation to be paid and medical treatment provided to any veteran of the Vietnam conflict who has disabilities related to his service. In the event of a veteran's claim being rejected by a Repatriation Board-which comprises three members, at least one of whom must be nominated by an ex-service organisation-the veteran may appeal to the Repatriation Commission and the Repatriation Review Tribunal, which similarly includes ex-service nominees. In certain cases the matter may be referred to the Federal Court of Australia or to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Many Vietnam veterans are already receiving compensation for their disabilities . As at 30 June this year some 7,000 of the 46,000 Army, Navy and Air Force personnel who served in Vietnam were receiving disability pensions. To the end of September this year a total of 1,259 Australian veterans had lodged claims for disability in which they mentioned possible contact with chemicals in Vietnam. Of these, 410 have been accepted by the repatriation boards for various reasons not necessarily connected with chemicals while 246 claims were still to be determined. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the measures in this Bill will introduce a greater degree of uniformity of liability in the repatriation legislation. This should remove fears expressed by some people that Vietnam veterans might be at a disadvantage compared with some other veterans. Claims that extraordinary numbers of Vietnam veterans have committed suicide since discharge have appeared in some newspapers. These figures have not been substantiated. The Vietnam Veterans Association says it has a register of deaths due to suicide and other causes such as cancer but the details from this register have not been yet revealed to the Government. Conclusive figures cannot be produced from the records of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. At this stage the available figures suggest that there is no reason to believe that the rate of suicide amongst Vietnam veterans is higher than among Australian males of the same age group. I stress that that is not yet a conclusive decision. This question is expected to be settled when the statistics on mortality amongst Vietnam veterans, including suicides, are produced from the study being carried out by the Commonwealth Institute of Health. </PARA>
<PARA> The Vietnam Veterans Association is seeking a judicial inquiry into the effects of herbicides on the health of veterans. One of the amendments to be moved by the Opposition to the second reading of this Bill concerns this matter. The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment has been examining since December last year the question of the possible effects of chemicals on the health of Vietnam veterans and their families. It is capable of covering relevant matters. It has similar powers to those of judicial inquiries, including the power to summon witnesses and documents. In some respects, it may have wider powers than a judicial inquiry. The Committee has received submissions from individuals and representatives of various organisations including the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It has questioned individuals and representatives at each session. I understand that the Committee's Chairman expects to present a report on the Vietnam aspect to Parliament during the current sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> On 14 January 1981 I announced that hospital treatment was to be provided to Vietnam veterans requiring urgent medical attention. The offer was extended to all Vietnam veterans who presented themselves to the Department for treatment in respect of a condition not accepted as related to their service. They were given access to departmental institutions if medical investigations indicated that the condition required urgent treatment, and it was appropriate to provide the type of care necessary as an in-patient and, of course, that there was spare bed capacity in repatriation hospitals. If beds were not available in repatriation hospitals, accommodation was to be sought in non-repatriation hospitals under normal community arrangements by a new counselling service for Vietnam veterans then being established. These special arrangements were to be reviewed in 12 months time. </PARA>
<PARA> On 15 February this year, following a review of the decision to provide Vietnam veterans with urgent treatment in repatriation hospitals, I announced that the Government had decided to retain that benefit and to make two important extensions. The Government decided it would accept the cost of urgent treatment of Vietnam veterans in country hospitals. If the veteran was insured costs would be recouped from the health fund concerned. In addition, the Government decided that, at no cost to the family, wives and children of Vietnam veterans could receive emergency treatment at repatriation general hospitals if the hospitals had facilities to treat them and if such treatment was considered to be necessary by the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The service itself was an important government initiative. I would like to say a little more about its development. After visiting the United States in June and July of last year to see how government agencies were handling veterans' problems and to learn more of United States studies, I announced that I proposed to expand the limited counselling service for Vietnam veterans and to incorporate certain features of the American program. The Government has since established counselling centres in each State capital and in Darwin. The centres are mostly separate from departmental premises and are staffed by personnel who know Vietnam service well. The senior staff are fully qualified counsellors. The centres provide professional counselling, both in terms of psychological and social problems, not only for the veterans themselves but also for their wives and children. They are developing extensive contacts with other groups in the community which provide expertise in particular areas such as marriage guidance and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest figures show that fewer than 650 veterans or families have been recorded as having first interviews with the centres since they opened. Although it appears that only a small proportion of the 46,000 who served in Vietnam feel the need for counselling, the Government intends to leave the service intact for some time to ensure that all those who have a genuine need for this type of assistance are able to receive it. We are now considering means of extending the counselling service to provide additional assistance to veterans in non- metropolitan areas. I have been advised by members of a national advisory committee on the establishment of the counselling service. Four of the five members are Vietnam veterans and they include the National Secretary of the Returned Services League and the National President of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a brief resume of the programs for Vietnam veterans and their families. It is difficult to see what more can be done at this stage while inquiries are still being concluded. The Government's critics never make it clear what else they might want except perhaps a judicial inquiry which, as I pointed out, will achieve no more than can be achieved by the present Senate inquiry. It has been said in another place that Vietnam veterans do not want automatic compensation for their claimed disabilities. It is interesting to note that, according to a report in the August 1982 issue of Debrief, the official journal of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, it was decided at a recent meeting attended by Australian and New Zealand Vietnam veterans to mount a campaign 'to challenge government and legislation in order to obtain assistance and help equal to that being provided in Australia'. I must make the point that that decision was made in New Zealand. Obviously, New Zealand veterans and the Australian veterans who met with them believe that the assistance being provided to Australian veterans is impressive and is worth emulating in New Zealand. It is also interesting that the State of Illinois in the United States has established the Agent Orange Study Commission. According to a commissioner of that body, it is widely acknowledged in the United States that Australia is in the forefront in coming to terms with the whole agent orange question. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of war goes on long after the cessation of hostilities. We are still providing pensions and treatment for veterans of the First World War and the survivors of the Second World War and subsequent conflicts in which Australia has been involved. In the case of Vietnam veterans, the traditional approaches of providing compensation by way of service pensions and treatment for disabilities which are related to war service have been maintained. However, the Government has gone beyond the approaches of previous post-war situations in setting up the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, in providing free treatment in urgent cases and in undertaking specific detailed scientific studies. As further information becomes available and if the need exists we shall seek new ways of helping those who require help. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the question of a judicial inquiry. I raise the question of how evidence would be provided to such a judicial inquiry and what means are presently available to Vietnam veterans to receive compensation. I make the point that the repatriation legislation, by virtue of section 47 of the Act, provides that the onus is upon the Government if one likes to disprove the claim of a veteran who seeks support, treatment and other benefits from the Department . That, of course, is a very generous provision. Since the controversy about agent orange arose this section has been drawn to the attention of Vietnam veterans with the intention that they should bring forward their claims to the Department and have them dealt with in the normal way. It has always seemed to us that through that means there is a very generous provision by which people can prove their claims and obtain compensation. There has never been any determined approach by the Government to deny justice, as Senator Ryan suggested in her remarks, to those who are seeking compensation. The machinery is there and does provide an opportunity for Vietnam veterans to test their eligibility to receive compensation for war-caused disabilities. I would like to say that over and over again until we get it across to some people that opportunities for compensation already exit. One therefore has to be concerned about the continued calls for a judicial inquiry on this matter. It is extremely difficult to determine the motives of people who seek that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, of course, the outstanding question of problems caused children by virtue of birth defects arising from exposure to herbicides, other chemicals or whatever during a veteran's service in Vietnam. That is a matter which is, I hope, receiving scientific resolution through studies, the results of which will be coming forward in the next month or two. By that means we will have a basis for establishing scientifically whether there is something that the Government will need to consider further concerning the problem of birth defects. Because of the existence of the Senate Committee and the way in which it has handled its inquiry in taking evidence from all sides-I believe, from what I have read, that it has been very thorough in its examination-the Senate is a vehicle by which the issues surrounding the alleged exposure of soldiers in Vietnam to various chemicals, including agent orange, will be properly heard and determined. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some criticism by persons from the veteran community about the make-up of the Senate Committee, about the people who form part of it and, indeed, about the amount of time which that Committee has given to the issue. In answer to those critics I make the simple point that, as any honourable senator here would know, although a committee sits for a limited number of hours each day and those days might be relatively few compared with the total number of days in a year, that is not the limit of a Senate committee's inquiry. In fact many days are spent in further research. A lot of work is undertaken by staff as well and many days are spent in review and the preparation of reports which are finally brought into this place. For that reason, in trying to remove some of the doubts that surround the Senate Committee's report, I make it quite clear that I believe the Committee's role in relation to this issue has been very substantially underrated by many people in the community. In fact, very unfortunately, in some newspaper articles, it has been denigrated by people who I think do not appreciate the full ramifications of the Senate's powers of inquiry into matters brought before it and in particular to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget has eliminated gaps and anomalies in services for veterans. It has widened eligibility for treatment and for some benefits. In consultation with the major ex-service organisations we shall continue to extend and improve the veterans' affairs system to deal with changing needs and to provide security and compensation for those who served and made sacrifices for this country. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) What reasons can the Government offer for the complete collapse of Commonwealth funding of pre-schools in Victoria since 1975.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) How does the Government justify a drop in Commonwealth contributions to Victorian pre-school capital expenditure from nearly $3m in 1976-77 to just over $5,000 in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Has the introduction of block grants to the States for pre-schools in 1977, in place of the previous 75 per cent Commonwealth funding arrangement, in fact been used to gradually eliminate support for pre-schools altogether; if so, could it be concluded that the Government is not interested in ensuring Victorian parents have the widest possible access to pre-school facilities.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1588" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Basic responsibility for the provision of pre-school services lies with State Governments. The Commonwealth provides significant General Purpose Revenue to enable the States to set their own priorities and fund services accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> The General Purpose Revenue Grants to the States have increased by 82 per cent since 1978-79.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Commonwealth provides the States with funding for pre-schools in the form of an annual block grant through the Children's Services Program. In 1982-83 the grant for Victoria is $9.015m. Between 1975-76 and 1981-82 the amount paid to Victoria through the block grant totalled $78.195m.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Distribution of the pre-school block grant in each State is the prerogative of the State Government which allocates funds for capital expenditure according to its priorities. In Victoria the responsibility for the distribution of the block grant rests with the Health Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The introduction of pre-school block grants to the States in 1977 did not signify the elimination of Commonwealth support for pre-schools. For each financial year since 1977 the total pre-school block grant has exceeded $31m. In 1982-83 the total allocation is $33.09m, of which $9.015m will be provided to Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, in recognition that pre-school services are primarily the responsibility of State Governments, the Commonwealth's expenditure in the early childhood field has focused on child care rather than pre-school services. Since 1976 annual expenditure on child care has almost trebled from some $18.1m (27 per cent of the total allocation) in 1976-77 to $47.4m (59 per cent) in 1981-82. Estimated expenditure in 1982-82 is $70.04m, or 68 per cent of the year's allocation.</PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria annual Commonwealth expenditure since 1975 on children's services other than pre-school has risen from some $4.1m in 1975-76 to $12.02m in 1981-82 .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The level of Commonwealth funding for the Nunawading and Eastern Suburbs Community Legal Service in 1982-83 has not yet been decided.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The Attorney-General has approved the commencement of calendar year (as opposed to financial year) funding of community-based legal aid centres from 1 January 1983. In order to ensure continuity of funds, centres have received interim funding for the period 1 July 1982 to 31 December 1982 on the basis of 50 per cent of their allocation of funds for the 1981-82 financial year. I am informed that community-based legal aid centres support the calendar year basis of funding. Funds appropriated to the centres have increased from $175,000 in 1979-80 to $450,000 in 1982-83. The further allocation of funds to applicant centres in Victoria from 1982-83 appropriations will be subject to advice from the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 17 August 1982:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is the Government sympathetic to the position of those women in the community aged between 40 and 50 who have been taken off supporting parent's benefit or widow's pensions due to their youngest child turning 16 years of age or leaving school.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What assistance does the Government intend to offer those women who are currently prevented from re-applying for benefits until they turn 50.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is the Government aware that a reduction in the eligibility for the widow's Class B pension from 50 to 40 years of age would offer to many impoverished women the acknowledgement and security of a pension card.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1589" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (3) A female single parent with a qualifying child may be eligible for Class A widow's pension if she is a 'widow'; that is, if her husband (or de facto husband of at least three years standing) has died or she is a divorcee, has been deserted for at least six months, or her husband has been imprisoned for that period. Other single parents may receive the similar supporting parent' s benefit. A Class B widow's pension is available from age 50 for any widow, as defined above, who has no qualifying child, or from age 45 if after her 45th birthday her Class A pension ceases because she no longer has such a child.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of whether entitlement for a Class B widow's pension should be widened to provide pensions to younger women without dependants is a complex one . I appreciate that Class A widows who lose their pension before age 45 may see their exclusion as anomalous; on the other hand, many such women may have had work force experience and might be expected to maintain themselves without taxpayer support.</PARA>
<PARA> Needy 'widows' who cease to be eligible for a Class A pension before age 45, and supporting parent beneficiaries who cease to have the care of children, may qualify for invalid pension or unemployment, sickness or special benefit. An invalid pensioner is eligible for a pensioner health benefits (PHB) card on the same basis as a widow pensioner or supporting parent beneficiary. As a result of measures announced in the recent Budget, all sickness beneficiaries will be eligible for the same Commonwealth 'pensioner fringe benefits'. Unemployment and special beneficiaries (and low income persons) who are eligible for a Health Care card, are entitled to free medical and hospital treatment and from January 1983 will also receive concessional pharmaceutical benefits.</PARA>

<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) The purpose of referring to such figures is to illustrate, albeit in broad terms, the significant level of contribution currently being made by taxpayers to expenditure in the area of social security and welfare. Of course, some lower income taxpayers would in effect be contributing less than the average and those with higher incomes would be contributing more. But it is very valuable and helpful to convey some idea of the impact of the expenditure in this area on the individual taxpayers. Figures such as these provide an important background to the concerns that have been expressed about our future capacity to maintain a social security system that both meets the needs of the most financially disadvantaged members of the community and is sustainable in taxation terms.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no one bench mark for measuring poverty which would command the unqualified assent of everyone. Hence there is no one set of policy measures which would be universally accepted as leading to the abolition of poverty.</PARA>
<PARA> I have recently commented, however, about whether the problem of poverty might be tackled by making across-the-board increases in pensions and benefits, as several groups have proposed. Suggestions that have been made include raising all pensions and benefits to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings, the cost of which would be about $3,000m in a full year (or an average of some $9 to $10 a week per taxpayer). The cost of raising all pensions and benefits to 120 per cent of the Henderson poverty line, the poverty benchmark suggested by the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) in its report 'Living on the Edge', would be about $2,800m (or an average of some $8 to $9 a week per taxpayer).</PARA>
<PARA> These estimates are, of course, only broad indicators of the cost involved in such proposals. They are not intended to suggest that every taxpayer would have to pay $8 to $10 a week in additional tax to finance them; obviously some taxpayers on lower incomes would pay less than the average while those with higher incomes would pay more.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) By paragraph (c) of sub-section 59 (1) of the Social Security Act, the term 'widow' includes 'a woman whose marriage has been dissolved and who has not remarried'. In order to satisfy this definition, dissolution of a valid and subsisting marriage is required. Annulment of a marriage means that the marriage was void from the outset and consequently it does not involve dissolution of a valid and subsisting marriage. Thus, in contrast to the situation of a woman whose marriage has been dissolved, a woman whose marriage has been annulled is not entitled to a widow's pension by reason of the annulment. She may of course qualify for other forms of assistance under the Social Security Act subject to the usual conditions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Basic responsibility for the provision of pre-school services lies with State governments. The Commonwealth provides significant general purpose revenue to enable the States to set their own priorities and fund services accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> The general purpose revenue grants to the States have increased by 82 per cent since 1978-79.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Commonwealth provides the States with funding for pre-schools in the form of an annual block grant through the Children's Services Program. In 1982-83 the amount of grant for South Australia is $3.730m. Between 1975-76 and 1981-82 the amount paid to South Australia through the block grant totalled $31. 139m.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Commonwealth funding for pre-schools between 1976-77 and 1981-82 totalled $ 225.04m, broken down as follows:</PARA>

<PARA> No new capital grants for pre-schools were provided in 1976-77 and 1977-78. Capital expenditure on pre-schools over this period related to the balance of approvals under the 1973-74 interim pre-school program and the 1974-75 pre- school program.</PARA>
<PARA> From 1978-79 onwards the pre-school block grant was intended to cover both capital and recurrent expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> Distribution of the pre-school block grant in each State is the prerogative of the State Government which allocates funds for capital expenditure according to its priorities. In South Australia responsibility for allocation rests with the Office of Ministry for the Minister of Education.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Commonwealth continues to make a significant contribution to the cost of pre-school services through the Children's Services Program.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1982-83 the block grant totals $33.09m, of which $3.73m is to be provided to South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, in recognition that pre-school services are primarily the responsibility of State Governments, the Commonwealth's expenditure in the early childhood field has focussed on child care rather than pre-school services. Since 1976 annual expenditure on child care has almost trebled from some $18.1m (27 per cent of the total allocation) in 1976-77 to $47.4m (59 per cent) in 1981 -82. Estimated expenditure in 1982-83 amounts to $70.04m, or 68 per cent of the year's allocation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (4) On 9 June 1982 an officer of the Australian Embassy informed the office of the Greek Minister for Justice by telephone of developments which had occurred in the proceedings in Sydney on 7 June 1982 and requested that the information be conveyed to the Minister. On 25 June 1982 the Attorney-General signed a letter to be delivered to the Minister for Justice in Athens concerning this matter. Unfortunately a new Minister was appointed on 3 July 1982 and the former Minister left office before the Attorney-General's letter was able to be delivered to him. In a cable dated 7 July 1982 the Australian Ambassador advised that the latest information available in Athens was that the public prosecutor in charge of the proceedings has recommended to the Council of Magistrates of the Court of Appeals that the trial of the nine defendants not proceed. In light of this advice, the Attorney-General decided not to re-direct his letter to the new Minister for Justice. The Attorney-General asked to be kept informed of developments in Athens and, on 25 August, 1982, he signed a letter to be delivered to the new Minister for Justice. In his letter the Attorney-General informed the Minister of the developments which had occurred in the proceedings in Sydney on 7 June 1982 and also renewed the representations that have been made by the Australian Government on behalf of the defendants in Greece. The Attorney-General's letter was delivered to the Minister by the Australian Ambassador on 6 September 1982. On that day the Minister informed the Ambassador that he had already approached the Greek judicial authorities in this matter. The Minister said that he would make a further approach to the judicial authorities and that, while he did not have the authority to intervene directly in the judicial process, he was optimistic that the charges would be dropped.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Australian Government has not given any part of the transcript of the proceedings in Sydney to the Greek authorities. In his letter to the Minister for Justice dated 25 August 1982, however, the Attorney-General quoted that part of the transcript for 7 June 1982 in which the magistrate referred to the conduct of former Detective Chief Inspector Thomas.</PARA>

<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Universities in the States are established by State law and are self-governing institutions within the confines of their respective Acts. Subject to any constraints imposed upon them by their establishing legislation, universities are able to enter into contracts and incur income debts and obligations. Most universities have some limited income additional to that provided by the Commonwealth and such income is available to them as part of their total budgets.</PARA>
<PARA> The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act contains provisions which recognise that a university may, in some cases, incur over-expenditure in any one year. Provided that such expenditure is certified as being incurred for Commonwealth grant purposes, a university may offset the amount overspent against the following year's Commonwealth grant. Certified over-expenditure of up to one per cent of the annual grant is deemed to be expenditure for the following year. Where there is over-expenditure in excess of one per cent the Minister for Education has a discretion to approve that this be met from funds appropriated for the following year provided he is satisfied that there are special circumstances to justify his approval. Until certified statements of expenditure are presented the Commonwealth is not in a position to examine expenditure by universities. Such statements must be presented not later than 30 September in the year following the year for which the grant is provided.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Aviation has provided me with the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware of, and sympathetic to, the concern of residents in the vicinity of Perth Airport about proposed development of facilities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 September 1982 (Hansard, page 1036) Senator Macklin asked me the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to a question I asked on 8 September in relation to the allowance to wives of pensioners who are on a disability allowance and a service pension. The Minister at that time suggested that the wife's allowance had not been increased because other allowance had. Is it not a fact that in 1964 the combined value of the disability special rate , wife's allowance, attendant's allowance and service pension was $10 more than average weekly earnings and that in 1982 it is $1 less? Would not the Minister then agree that, if the wife's allowance had been indexed from $4 to $15, parity with average weekly earnings would have been maintained?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1964, a veteran and his wife, with no other income or assets, who were receiving the special (totally and permantly incapacitated) rate of pension, dependant's pension for wife, attendant's allowance (lower rate) and service pension would have received a total family income of $44.51 a week (85.4 per cent of average weekly earnings). As from 11 November 1982, they will receive $ 304.15 (93.3 per cent of average weekly earnings) provided their other income is less than $50 a week (assets are no longer taken into consideration; only the income from those assets). These amounts compare with average weekly earnings in 1964 of $52.10 a week and for the June quarter of 1982 of $326.00 a week.</PARA>
<PARA> The comparison made by Senator Macklin is misleading in the following respects :</PARA>
<PARA> (i) his calculation of pension in 1964 incorrectly assumed that a veteran and wife receiving the special (T and PI) rate pension, dependant's pension and attendant's allowance would receive service pension at the maximum rate; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the actual disposable income of T and PI pensioners and their wives is considerably in excess of average weekly earnings because the disability pension is not taxable.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the first point, it should be noted that in 1964 the full amount of disability pension and dependant's pension was taken into account in assessing the rate of service pension payable. This meant that a veteran and wife who were receiving the T and PI rate pension on and dependant's pension would not have received the maximum service pension rate payable at that time of $11.00 a week for the veteran and $6.00 a week for the wife, but would have received $2.73 a week each.</PARA>
<PARA> From 11 November 1982, disability and dependant's pensions will be disregarded in assessing the rate of service pension payable and eligibility for fringe benefits. In addition, the income limit at which service pension for married couples is reduced below the maximum rate will increase to $50 a week and the limit at which eligibility for fringe benefits ceases will increase to $90 a week for a married couple. This means that from November 1982, a T and PI pensioner and his wife who also receive attendant's allowance and service pension can have other income up to $50 a week before service pension is reduced and $90 a week other income before fringe benefit eligibility ceases. Most wives of T and PI veterans will now be eligible for free medical treatment under the Pensioner Health Benefits Scheme and this, together with the fact that disability and dependant's pensions and attendant's allowance are tax-free , gives these pensioners a higher disposable income than the average wage earner. Such pensions are in a much superior position to their counterparts in 1964.</PARA>
<PARA> Dependants' pensions have not been increased since 1964. Governments have concentrated available funds on ensuring that incapacitated veterans and war widows are adequately compensated through pensions, that they have the best possible medical treatment facilities available to them and that income tested pensions are adequate. The increases in the major repatriation pensions which have occurred as a result of movements in the consumer price index and the increases in other allowances and benefits which have occurred in the Budget context have ensured that the family as a unit receives the benefit of increased pensions and allowances. This is illustrated by the fact that, since 1964, the income through pension available to a T and PI pensioner and his wife receiving attendant's allowance and service pension has increased by approximately 683 per cent despite the fact that depedant's pension has not increased. During this period the CPI has increased by approximately 393 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The average weekly earnings (before tax) in March 1982 were $316.00. In May 1982 a veteran receiving the T and PI pension, attendant's allowance (lower rate) and service pension and his wife receiving dependant's pension and service pension received $278.76 a week. The equivalent taxable income that a wage earner would need to receive in order to have a take home pay of $278.76 a week would be $356 a week.</PARA>
<PARA> The following is a table of comparisons with the latest published average weekly earnings and minimum wage-</PARA>
<PARA>1964 1982</PARA>
<PARA>Pensions*  $44.51 p.w. $304.15 p.w. (11 November 1982) Average weekly earnings $52.10 p.w. $326.00 p.w.

<PARA> * Pensions refers to a veteran receiving the special (T and PI) Rate pension, attendant's allowance (lower rate) and service pension and his wife receiving dependants' pension and service pension.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 September 1982 (Hansard, page 1189) Senator Tate asked me , as Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Why is it that the Government will not allow the Special Prosecutor to pursue the recouping of moneys lost through trust stripping as vigorously as we may expect him to pursue the recouping of moneys lost through bottom-of-the- harbour schems?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Are we to understand from the Minister's reply that the Special Prosecutor is to be confined to prosecuting for breach of the 1980 legislation and he will not be pursuing the recovery of bottom-of-the-harbour tax moneys in respect of schemes entered into before that legislation in 1980?</PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Attorney-General has supplied the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The matters in respect of which the Special Prosecutor is to carry out his functions under the Special Prosecutors Act 1982 were specified in a notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of 22 September 1982. These matters seem likely to keep the Special Prosecutor, and those assisting him, fully occupied. The Special Prosecutor is not confined to prosecuting breaches of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980. His authority clearly extends to the pursuit of civil and criminal proceedings arising out of 'bottom -of-the-harbour' schemes entered into either before or after the commencement of that legislation.</PARA>
