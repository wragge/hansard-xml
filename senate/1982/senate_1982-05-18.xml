<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. I refer to the Evidence (Amendment) Bill, passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in March 1982 with little public discussion, which was designed to avoid the effect of the 1981 High Court of Australia decision on the Kenbi land claim, which decision entitled the Aboriginal Land Commissioner to decide whether new regulations made by the Northern Territory Administrator were invalid because they were enacted for improper purposes. Will the Attorney-General confirm that these regulations enlarged the town area of Darwin to about four times the size of Greater London and included most of the land in the Cox Peninsula which was subject to the Kenbi land claim and that they are obviously designed to defeat the land rights claim? Does the Attorney-General agree that the Bill recently passed by the Northern Territory Administration purports to copy the 1979 New South Wales Evidence (Amendment) Act which in turn sought to destroy the rights of the courts to inspect government documents? Does not that legislation set aside the effect of the landmark case of Sankey v. Whitlam and other earlier decisions of the courts? Was not the New South Wales legislation unanimously condemned by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its 1979 freedom of information report? Does the Government consider that this action by the subordinate legislature of the Northern Territory will effectively shut out the common law rights of Aboriginals and other citizens to inspection of government documents and to seek the effective protection of the courts against arbitrary Executive action?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Missen has asked a number of questions concerning the Northern Territory legislation. The questions contain some statements of fact which I cannot confirm or deny. For instance, I do not know exactly what is the new definition of the Darwin town site, the area it covers and so on. I know that it is a fairly large area but I am not sure whether it is the size Senator Missen mentioned. Also, there are certainly some significant differences between the Northern Territory Evidence (Amendment) Act and the New South Wales legislation. I would have to refresh my mind to give a more detailed answer to the Senate than I am capable of giving at the moment to that aspect of the question. I think Senator Missen's main concern relates to the Kenbi land claim which, I understand, will be proceeding following the decision of the High Court . In regard to what evidence will be available in those proceedings and whether it could be shut out by the effect of the Northern Territory Evidence (Amendment ) Act, I refer Senator Missen to an answer I gave in the Senate in March this year in reply to a question asked by Senator Kilgariff. It followed expressions of concern by Senator Robertson and Senator Evans in regard to the matter. In that answer I made it clear that the effect of the Northern Territory legislation could not override the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights ( Northern Territory) Act and the evidentiary provisions contained in it and that therefore the legislation of the Northern Territory referred to will not have the inhibiting effect on the proceedings by the Aboriginal claimants in that case.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Minister will remember saying at that time that to his understanding Argentina had no nuclear facility or capacity. Is the Minister or the Government aware that the Federal Republic of Germany has been supplying sophisticated nuclear technology to the Argentine since the 1960s, in contravention of all international safeguards? Is the Minister aware that the reactors provided to Argentina by West Germany are of the most inefficient design available for the production of electricity but of the best design for providing waste for weapons grade plutonium? Can the Minister confirm that Argentina has continued to purchase nuclear technology from West Germany, including the expertise of former leading nazis, because the West Germans, by their own obscene and boastful admissions, do not insist on international safeguards? Does this not mean that Argentina could well be close to having the capacity to explode a nuclear device ? Why is the Government so seemingly ill-informed on these matters? Is the Minister aware that neither Euratom nor the International Atomic Energy Agency has any record of any transactions between West Germany and Argentina? Finally, I ask: Will the Australian Government summon the German Ambassador to Australia and demand that he obtain an explanation of how West Germany has flouted all of these nuclear safeguards?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp asked seven questions. The Federal Republic of Germany has denied emphatically that it has acted outside the safeguards requirements. It insists that it is complying at all times with the Euratom Treaty, the London Suppliers Group guidelines and the International Atomic Energy Agency. That has been confirmed publicly by the Energy Commissioner of the European Economic Community, Count Davignon. Argentina has had a 335-megawatt pressurised heavy water reactor in operation since 1974, supplied by the FRG, and a 600-megawatt CANDU reactor is due to come on stream next year. A 680-megawatt pressurised heavy water reactor, supplied by Germany, is under construction and due to be operational in the late 1980s. Although Argentina is a party to neither the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty nor the Treaty of Tlatelolco, it has accepted IAEA safeguards on all known operating facilities. This, I should add, does not include the reprocessing plant which is not yet operational. Argentina has stated that it has not joined the NPT because it is discriminatory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Argentina says that the plutonium produced will be sold for use in fast breeder reactors and that its reprocessing program has been built up solely with indigenous technology. The Australian Safeguards Office made some comments on the British Broadcasting Corporation program that has been critical on this matter. It said that, while heavy water reactors have advantages over other reactor types in producing plutonium, other interpretations might be put upon Argentina's decision. They are: Heavy water reactors can be operated on natural uranium without dependence on foreign enrichment and the extra plutonium could be useful in a thermal recycling program designed to encourage efficient fuel utilisation. Plutonium from power reactor fuel is not suitable for explosive purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Safeguards Office said also that the fuel's long residence time in the reactor, essential for economic power production, would produce significant quantities of plutonium isotopes higher than the plutonium 239 weapons grade. To reduce the residence time to the maximum 239 production in a power reactor not only would result in uneconomical performance but also would be readily detected by safeguards measures, particularly in the case of pressurised reactors. Based on the capacity of the reprocessing plant, the Australian Safeguards Office estimates that it would take four years to produce a significant quantity of reactor grade plutonium and longer for weapons grade. That is the information I have, supplied by the Australian Safeguards Office, my own advisers and the Energy Commissioner of the European Economic Community, Count Davignon. In the course of the next 10 days I will be talking to Count Davignon and visiting the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. I will be discussing, amongst other things, these matters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think most honourable senators are aware of the work of the employment discrimination committees which have been established in all States of Australia for nearly 10 years. Their establishment followed the declaration in 1973 of a national policy to eliminate discrimination in employment and occupation. This was made following consultation with State governments, major employer organisations and the trade union movement. The fact that that policy was declared enabled the Australian Government to ratify International Labour Organisation Convention No. 111, which relates to discrimination in employment and occupation. I agree that this program should be pursued. It is a matter of concern when people are discriminated against, whether it is on the grounds established under the ILO Convention or on the other grounds which these committees deal with. I note that it is not merely the ILO grounds that are the concern of the committees but also discrimination on grounds such as age, disability, nationality, personal attributes, criminal record, medical record, trade union activities, marital status and sexuality.</PARA></TALK.START>

Of these, 2,524 came within the classes of conduct prescribed by the ILO Convention and 2,322 were for the other sorts of causes that I mentioned a few moments ago. Of the 2,524 complaints to December 1981 which come within the Convention, 1,407 were complaints of discrimination on the ground of sex.

I think whether any benefits flow to the Australian film industry from investment in the production of foreign films in Australia is a matter that could have different interpretations in different circumstances. Undoubtedly in some circumstances there could be advantages to the Australian film industry and in others it could be quite the reverse. If Senator Hamer has some interest in pursuing this matter I could seek advice from the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce noticed the recent calls by the Council of Small Business Organisation of Australia for a full inquiry into small business in this country? Is the Council's contention that the Government presently lacks specific data about this important sector of Australian business correct?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is aware of the call by the Council of Small Business Organisation of Australia for an inquiry into small business in Australia. The Minister is also aware that the statistical data on businesses of different sizes is less complete than many would like. There have, however, been recent extensions to the economic census programs of the Australian Bureau of Statistics which have resulted in significant improvements to the range and quality of data on smaller enterprises and there are further improvements in prospect. There is no evidence that lack of information has inhibited the monitoring and evaluation of small business problems and policies. There is a slight dilemma here because it may be thought desirable to obtain more data on small firms; but, on the other hand, there are frequently complaints that small business is subjected to far too much paperwork . One has to balance the need for statistics against the need to minimise the burden on small businesses with respect to reporting requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has given some consideration to the inquiry which has been called for. In his view such an inquiry is not warranted at this stage. The specific problems and needs of small businesses have been subjected to formal inquiry on a number of occasions going back to the Wiltshire committee in 1971. Small business matters are monitored by the Small Business Advisory Council and the Bureau of Industry Economics as well as by a number of tertiary institutions. The Council of Small Business Organisation plays a very valuable part in all of these matters. These groups frequently communicate their findings to the Minister and have proved very effective in identifying and publicising the concerns of small business. While the Government acknowledges the vital role of small firms in the economy and will take all measures necessary to encourage the efficient development of the sector, it does not see another inquiry at this stage as advancing that end.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most recent figures that we have been able to publish of transactions to the end of April show that the collection of provisional tax is slightly higher at this stage than it was at the same point last year. There does not seem to be any indication of slippage in the payment of provisional tax that could be related to interest rates or, for that matter, to any other reason. I think Senator Messner, on behalf of the Treasurer, indicated recently when dealing with legislation in this House that the Government has in hand a review of all the penalty provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. When that review is proceeding it is appropriate for all penalty provisions to be reviewed, and this is being conducted as a matter of some urgency. I shall refer to the Treasurer the interest of Senator Watson in the provisional tax penalties and draw to his attention the matter that has been raised. But, in a general way, all these things are subject to review, and I hope that some early consideration of them will be made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Social Security seen the reported remarks today of Lieutenant Colin Lingard of the Salvation Army in New South Wales about the serious increase in the number of people seeking emergency aid and emergency relief in that State, in particular from the Salvation Army? This comes soon after the findings of the Victorian Emergency Relief Committee that we debated in this chamber two weeks ago and its claim that the greatest cause of the increase in need for such assistance was the disastrous levels of social security payments. Does the Minister consider, in light of the reports from a second State, that the Government should take some action? Does he still consider, as he has consistently done since he has had the portfolio, that the Commonwealth really has no place in the provision of emergency aid and that this matter should be given to the States?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2016" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read those remarks attributed to Lieutenant Lingard in this morning's Press clippings just a couple of minutes ago during Question Time. I had not seen them before that time. As Senator Grimes points out, they are consistent with the claims that there is an additional requirement for emergency relief which has been put forward in Victoria over recent weeks and months. I do not accept that the requirement of emergency relief is something which is a direct function of what the honourable senator describes as the disastrous levels of social security payments. In fact, those payments in the main have been indexed to maintain their real value. There are, of course, exceptions to that but in the main they are so indexed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It does appear from the information which we have to hand that the increases in the numbers of those seeking emergency relief are related to matters other than the particular levels of pensions and benefits. The two areas where there have been significant increases in demand for emergency relief appear to be among those who are unemployed, particularly those who are unemployed for a significant period, and among those who are supporting parents. Of course, it is true that over the last 10 years there have been very significant increases in the numbers of those claiming benefits in both those categories. I think the major answer to those difficulties lies in the creation of as much employment as possible in Australia and, of course, in trying to do something about the social trends which are producing such a large number of supporting parents in the community.</PARA>
<PARA> It remains a fact on the Victorian evidence that the great bulk of pensioners and beneficiaries who receive assistance from my Department do manage on their benefits. I think the Victorian figure was that something like 6 per cent of these people might be seeking assistance. I certainly do not accept that for the generality of pensioners and beneficiaries there is an inability to live on the benefits which are provided. In regard to where responsibility lies for relief, it is true that until, I think, 1977 when this Government for the first time made some provision for emergency relief, emergency relief was always the concern of voluntary agencies and of State governments. At the time of the 1977 election a commitment of half a million dollars was made and that commitment has been met.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes correctly says that I have asserted that the responsibility for emergency relief ought to remain in the main that of State governments and voluntary agencies, the principal obligation of the Commonwealth being to look to the income maintenance system generally. In that regard I point out that as recently as a couple of years ago the States withdrew, at their insistence, from one of the areas of their traditional assistance, namely, the first six months of assistance to deserted wives. They thereby saved themselves, I think, some $ 30m and, I would have thought, freed up resources which might well have been used to improve State provision for social welfare. The Victorian Government, in fact, withdrew its direct assistance to emergency relief at about that time. This is a matter which will, I am sure, be the subject of Budget consideration both in the context of the general level of pensions and benefits and in the question of what provision ought to be made by the Commonwealth for emergency relief. It will certainly continue to be the subject of discussion between State governments and the Commonwealth Government. I think it is likely that I will continue to assert the view, which I have before, that that traditional area of the States' responsibility ought to continue to be met by them.</PARA>

As the Minister has conceded that the large numbers of these people seeking emergency relief are the unemployed and the single parent pensioners who are, in fact, further below the poverty line as measured than other groups in the community and that the complaint of voluntary agencies like the Salvation Army and of the States is that the numbers of people needing emergency assistance are increasing and increasing considerably, does he not consider that these people whom the Commonwealth has already accepted responsibility for should receive further assistance from the Commonwealth if the Commonwealth benefits are inadequate? Should not the States receive further assistance from the Commonwealth because of the situation which arises out of these inadequate benefits?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry is aware that there are very significant difficulties in the tuna fishing industry of South Australia. The problems which the industry faces, as is quite evident from the facts which are included in the honourable senator's question, really relate to the potential problem of the supply of tuna on the one hand and the problem of the world oversupply on the other hand. There is a complex of factors: There is the risk that the resource will not be available in the future for the local fishery and currently there are market problems which relate to world oversupply. This matter has been raised in the Senate on a number of occasions. I can confirm that the Minister is very much aware of the difficulties which Senator Jessop has raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current concern by scientists about the state of the southern bluefin tuna fishery results from further analysis of data on the fishery and from unprecedented record catches by Australian fishermen. The commercial decisions which were taken, and to which Senator Jessop referred, to upgrade the fleet were taken prior to the latest scientific assessment and were based on an assessment of market conditions at a time when prices were high. I understand that the tuna canneries are considering the preparation of applications for assistance in respect of protection against canned salmon and tuna imports. These applications will be closely examined by the Department when received.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Primary Industry, in conjunction with the States and industry , is examining the issues involved, including the need for the Australian tuna industry to diversify to other markets and to other tuna fisheries. In this respect grants have been made from the Fishing Industry Research Trust Account to develop tuna operations in waters off Queensland. As I said earlier, the problems are complex, they are multi-faceted and they will require the careful attention of both the Government and the industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 April Senator Jones asked me a question without notice relating to future volumes of the report of the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking. He asked whether the Minister would take steps to make sure that volumes 2 and 3 of that report are also made available to the Government and to the Leader of the Opposition in the same way as volume 1 was made available. I am advised that the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force reports directly to the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments. Volume 1 of the report was transmitted to both governments, as future volumes of the report will be. I am further advised that if it is considered inappropriate for future volumes of the report to be tabled in the Parliament the Government will give sympathetic consideration to any request for access from the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I desire to refer to a matter which arose recently concerning the chef and the parliamentary refreshment rooms. This was a matter of some controversy while I was overseas, and I take the first opportunity of making a personal explanation because I claim to have been misrepresented. The matter arose some time ago-indeed on 25 March 1982-when I was speaking on a motion to change the days and hours of meeting of the Senate. Towards the conclusion of my speech I made some off the cuff remarks concerning the obtaining of meals in the Parliament. I made the additional and marginally relevant point that the change of hours would enable members to take meals elsewhere, and I felt that this was certainly to their advantage. I see that my remarks led to an interjection by Senator Elstob which appears to be the major cause of distress to the chef and members of the staff of the parliamentary dining room. Taken in the context of the light-hearted debate which had preceded it, the interjection was understandable but, taken out of context, it could give offence to the staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was aware, at the conclusion of my remarks, that I had not entirely explained my concerns of a dietary nature, but as the matter was only marginally relevant to the subject of the debate I did not desire to proceed further at that time. However, as the Press subsequently picked up these remarks and took them out of context I feel that some explanation is necessary, particularly because the parliamentary chef appears to have some grounds for complaint. I see that, in the course of my remarks, I referred to having the food 'analysed' and I expressed the view that the meals that I had had in the parliamentary dining room had been 'absolutely outrageous'. On reflection, I feel that this was altogether too strong language and that what I should have said was that they were outrageous as far as my dietary requirements were concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make it clear that I did not remove food from the Parliament to have it analysed, and it would be obvious that logistically that would have been a rather difficult undertaking. What I meant to say was that I had had the menus and type of food analysed by dietary experts and a dietitian whom I had consulted and had ascertained that the meals taken in the dining room and at committee meetings had a calorie content something like 50 per cent excessive and that, compared with meals available in Melbourne, their cholesterol content was something like 300 per cent. This was indeed a most unsatisfactory situation so far as I was concerned, and it was of concern to my medical advisers. As a result of this analysis, I made arrangements with the parliamentary dining room to obtain suitable food, and I point out that, in the course of my short speech, I acknowledged that the parliamentary dining room had been willing to fall into line with my requirements on the subject. Characteristically, the newspapers totally ignored this comment. I should emphasise that the meals supplied to me since that time have been quite satisfactory, and I have no complaint about them . However, the Press took it upon itself to resurrect these statements some five weeks later, after I had left the country, and obviously this has caused some unhappiness so far as the dining room staff is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern with the repetitiousness of meal menus, and with the fact that the same meals are provided for lunch and dinner, continues and is a matter that should concern the Joint House Committee. But I recognise the difficulties under which the parliamentary dining room has to work and, of course, I had no intention of criticising the chef for the efforts which he is making to provide reasonable meals. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Melbourne Herald chose to weigh in with an editorial on 30 April 1982 to suggest that senators should have more to do representing their constituents than to waste the time of Parliament 'complaining about the tucker' . I do not regard the question of parliamentary meals as trivial, or the health of members as unimportant, but I do object to the trivialisation of comments such as are contained in that editorial. I believe there are many more important things that ought to be attracting the attention of the Press and, in fact, I am happy to draw its attention to recent debates which were totally ignored by it, and in which it ought to be taking a substantial interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that I do not regard these matters as trivial, and it is a pity that it is only when there is a sudden illness of a parliamentarian that any attention seems to be directed to the inadequacies of the lifestyle of members of this Parliament. Further to this, I want to say that I will certainly speak to the chef to reassure him that no personal criticism was intended. Otherwise, I have no intention of further commenting on the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -In speaking to this matter of public importance dealing with plans by the Commonwealth Government to encourage the early establishment in Australia of a nuclear industry, including enrichment of nuclear fuel and electric power through the use of nuclear reactors, I will begin by sketching in briefly the recent history and likely prospects for the nuclear industry world wide. Much has happened and much has been learnt since those euphoric days of nearly 20 years ago when uranium was seen as the source of power for tomorrow. There was a frequently used phrase-that electric power would be almost too cheap to meter. What is now revealed by hindsight is a technology so hedged in with problems of the most serious kind as to be virtually impossible to bring into successful operation in any sincere way. The hardest headed business empires of the world are now abandoning it, in many cases after spending not thousands, not millions but billions of dollars. I repeat that experienced and major enterprises are cutting their losses, after enormous expenditures on nuclear power houses, to get out of nuclear power because of the difficulties and dangers it is now shown to represent and, most importantly of all, because of its sheer lack of economic competition with other sources of electric power in the world. To instance this I will mention a recent article in the Washington Post which stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In one of the most dramatic and costly cancellations . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This is of nuclear power-</PARA>
<PARA>the Board of the Washington Public Power Supply System announced two months ago that it would terminate work on two of five nuclear power plants under construction, writing off the $2,250m already spent. </PARA>
<PARA>If we cannot understand what that means there must be something wrong with us. A responsible private enterprise authority in the United States of America, which has already spent over $2 billion on the first two of five nuclear power plants, has decided to write of the entire project and none of those plants will proceed . The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the WPPS nuclear plants . . . construction costs of the five plants the utility had proposed building soared from $4,100m to nearly $23,800m.</PARA>
<PARA>That increase in cost is almost fourfold. The basic part of the problem which I think ought to appeal to governments and hard-headed business people everywhere is that what was supposed to be a cheap and economic form of electric power is not that at all. When one looks at recent, more realistic costings which, of course are very adequate-they are done by people actually involved in the scene, not people such as us who are merely speculating or thinking about it, but people who have actually costed carefully and know their figures are right-one finds that nuclear power is far more expensive than any other kind of power that can be produced. In saying that, one has to take into account the possibility of clean-up, such as at Three Mile Island which is costing over $1 billion, and the associated similar cost of decommissioning a nuclear power house when it reaches , as it must, the end of its useful life. In that case there are perhaps greater problems with far more radioactive materials than is the case with the contaminated water which is causing so much trouble in the Three Mile Island reactor. Referring to this subject further the article in the Washington Post continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The month before that cancellation was announced--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the one I mentioned first-</PARA>
<PARA>the Oklahoma Corporation Commission ordered that no further funds from customers of the Public Service Co. of Oklahoma be spent on the Black Fox nuclear power plant. The commission said that, notwithstanding $US200m already spent on it--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Black Fox plant-</PARA>
<PARA>the plant was 'no longer economically viable'. </PARA>
<PARA> The same day Standard and Poor's Corp. reduced the bond rating of the Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, raising additional questions about the fate of one of its two nuclear power plants at Seabrook, although work is continuing. </PARA>
<PARA>The overall picture is that in 1980 16 reactors were cancelled and 70 were delayed and in 1981 six were cancelled and 44 were deferred. The article in the Washington Post continued:</PARA>
<PARA> So bleak is the outlook that General Electric has said it expects no more domestic orders this decade--</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that one of the major utility companies in the world making these plants expects no more domestic orders this decade. I will quote a statement made by a senior associate of a chemical engineering company at a meeting of chemical engineers last year. Mr John O. Sillin was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Nuclear power has become an investment with tremendous financial risks to utilities, and the utility industry itself is in such poor financial health it can no longer afford to purchase nuclear generating stations. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Sillin added:</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of a 1200 megawatt nuclear unit going into service in the early 1990s will be over $US3,200m. </PARA>
<PARA>That is over $3 billion. The figure represents an almost tenfold increase in prices since the early 1970s. Some major questions ought to be posed. If experienced major enterprises in the United States are getting out of nuclear technology why is there now such strong urging in Australia to get into it? What is the reason for the abandonment of nuclear projects all over the world? Is there a reasonable demand for uranium oxide? Is there a demand for enriched uranium which, of course, is the main fuel for nuclear power houses? Lying behind all these questions is an even more basic question. Is the Commonwealth Government of Australia planning to get into nuclear technology and, importantly and significantly, the uranium enrichment industry?</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a great deal of equivocation and shilly-shallying over this point with no clear statements of what the Government has in mind. I feel sure that this evasion on the part of the Government is due in some measure to the fact that it knows, as a result of opinion polls, that the majority of Australians are opposed to nuclear power and certainly do not want a nuclear industry in this country. If there should be any doubt about that I point to a fact which seems obvious to all the Australian Democrats. In South Australia recently Mrs Heather Southcott was able to hold the seat of Mitcham for the Australian Democrats. I believe, and I am sure Mrs Southcott would agree with me , that this was due in no small amount to the fact that most people in South Australia do not want a nuclear industry, and they certainly do not want an enrichment industry in their own territory. This matter and its urgency, I believe, depend basically on an assessment of the Government's intentions. Is it really, behind the scenes, giving the go ahead to financial interests in the nuclear field to promote their industry within Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> I make no apologies in a matter so serious and important as this for quoting from a confidential leaked document which, of course, was never intended to reach my hands but which, because of that, gives a much franker indication of what is going on than the public utterances of the Government. This 25-page document purports to be the report of the interdepartmental committee set up last year to report on a review of the Atomic Energy Act and related matters. I am confident that it is indeed a copy of that document. If that is not the case I hope the Government will say so. In many places in this document the obvious assumption is that the Government is interested in pressing on with a nuclear industry in this country much more definitely and much more quickly than it has been prepared to announce to its citizens. In one of its early conclusions in the report the committee said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . It has been concluded that the Atomic Energy Act 1953 is no longer an appropriate legislative basis for promotion, regulation and control of nuclear activities and development of an Australian nuclear industry. Effective promotion, regulation and control of nuclear activities and an Australian nuclear industry will require new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 10, this point is made:</PARA>
<PARA>the defence and security-related provisions of the Atomic Energy Act should not interfere with the envisaged commercial development of an Australian nuclear industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Envisaged by whom? That is the question we ask. Of course, there is only one answer-without doubt, the government which gave this committee its terms of reference. On page 12 the committee mentions the need for legislation to rationalise Australia's nuclear plans within our commitments under the non- proliferation treaties. The committee then says:</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation should be enacted as a matter of urgency--</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat, as a matter of urgency-</PARA>
<PARA>to provide a clear basis for meeting the Commonwealth's nuclear non- proliferation obligations which are a key element in obtaining public acceptance of developing a nuclear industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It is of some additional interest to the Australian Democrats that the problems of obtaining public acceptance of a nuclear industry in Australia are at least recognised, although I predict that they will turn out to be a good deal knottier than the Government and the proposed industry might expect. On page 19, this statement is made:</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the possible urgency associated with any decision on uranium enrichment, it may be necessary to pass specific legislation in that area as an interim measure. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not my intention to publicise information in this document beyond my purpose. However, it does include two other matters which are of public importance. They relate to the nature of the proposed enrichment industry and the possible mantle of secrecy under which it is presumably intended it might operate. On page 16 of the report the committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Since it is possible that a uranium enrichment industry in Australia would be largely owned and operated by private enterprise the reach of present Commonwealth law in that area will require careful assessment. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 15, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Uranium enrichment technology is presently--</PARA>
<PARA>I think the words sought there are 'at present'-</PARA>
<PARA>the subject of a major commercial study in Australia and before a further stage of this feasibility study on establishment of a commercial enrichment facility in Australia could proceed, access to classified information would be required. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 17 the committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia incurs a responsibility to protect sensitive nuclear technology which arises within Australia; e.g. a new process of uranium enrichment. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on that page the committee says that special legislation is urged to protect that sensitive information. The Australian Democrats find all this worrying because we are concerned that a commercially motivated uranium enrichment industry in Australia, owned extensively or even substantially outside Australia, might be allowed to operate under a veil of secrecy which would at some time and with some future government permit enrichment to nuclear weapons grade material. I remain not satisfied that there are sufficient safguards yet written in or intended to overcome this problem. There are two major ingredients in natural uranium. By far the greater proportion is U238 which is in no way suitable for atomic bombs or atomic fuel or any fissionable purpose of that kind. Of course, the fissionable element is U235. The various processes of enrichment are designed to increase the amount of that dangerous ingredient, in the product, leaving a residue of depleted uranium which has a higher concentration of U238. It can be increased and enriched to a limited extent so that it will fuel a nuclear reactor or it can be enriched even further so that the material can be used for small dirty atom bombs of the type that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The borderline between these two grades of uranium is not clear. Indeed, it varies according to circumstances such as the design of the bomb itself. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we see this proposal to enrich as having great future dangers, possibly permitting some future government to make weapons grade material and to supply it overseas. It has been suggested that the United States of America might feel that it would be useful, strategic and good to have a source of enriched uranium for weapons use outside its territory. I do not give that suggestion any credence; I merely mention it at this stage as a possibility. We are speaking of the governments of this country and of the United States not only now but also in the future. We have no way of telling what might happen in the future or what sorts of obligations might be placed on us by some future government if indeed we did have an enrichment industry in this country. It is even possible that at some stage we could have the type of government which would want to make our own very high fallout weapons because for some reason or other this had been urged on it by the propagandists. Of course, there are propagandists active in this country now, including people who should know a great deal better, who have urged that sort of action on this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought it fairly self-evident that the number of weapons that could be produced by our relatively small potential of technology would not be enough to be of any great use, especially since we could not afford expensive delivery systems to far off targets. Rather, it would have the complete effect of making us a nuclear target. Those bombs could be removed or neutralised in the case of war. I cannot see its having any effect but that. In other words, we are worried about the general aspects of Australia's going into nuclear technology because we see a process of gradualism. In the past my remarks on this matter have been misunderstood so I will clarify them here. We believe that , having gone into enrichment and having justified those risks to ourselves, it is only one further step to go into other things. For instance, we would have large amounts of depleted uranium-U238-which is blanket material for fast breeder reactors. An economic argument could be advanced that we ought to go into fast breeder reactors because we had a supply of depleted uranium, the economic use for which is in the blanket of a fast breeder. </PARA>
<PARA> Is this approach to nuclear technology in Australia in any way justified? We have an industry in complete financial disarray and disorder. Among other things , there has been a recent major slump in the price of uranium, the spot price for uranium oxide now being $US20 per lb compared with the recent price of $US40 . The world is grossly oversupplied with both natural uranium and enriched uranium. In addition, Australia already has abundant sources of power. It has vast amounts of coal and a promising future in solar and wind power technology. Why should we proceed with a nuclear power plant, as indeed Sir Charles Court proposed for Western Australia? His site at Ledge Point was only a little way upwind from Perth. I am glad to see that Mr O'Connor, his successor, has seen reason on this matter. I understand he wants nuclear power delayed until after the turn of the century. Thank God that that idiocy has been put to rest for the time being. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Coleman for the comment that it was politically expendient. At least in the pragmatic sense the obvious risk of nuclear contamination affecting Perth in the case of a major accident has been removed. If there were such a nuclear power-house in Australia what would be the consequences of even a minor accident such as that at Three Mile Island? The Three Mile Island plant will probably not operate again for another eight years. It was recently estimated to cost in excess of $1 billion to clean that up. What would happen in parts of Australia, let us say Western Australia, if it were affected by such an accident? Who would meet the huge clean-up costs? Where would alternative sources of electric power come from during that time? In other words, the question of nuclear power is a case of too many eggs in one basket for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to mention one other appalling possibility which I think is of huge importance. A remarkable and definitive 60-page article in the New Yorker magazine in February describes the vastly enhanced effect of nuclear weapons dropped on any enemy's power reactor. That alone ought to be the most powerful argument for never perpetrating this sinister and potentially tragic industry on Australia. The New Yorker magazine quotes from an article in the Scientific American which describes a special study by Dr Kosta Tsipis of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on this subject. It describes how a one megaton bomb blast on other targets would affect an area of only 26 square miles but, because of the complex effect of so many radio isotopes in the fuel rods of the reactor being attacked, the same bomb dropped on a power reactor would cause the same terrifying effect in an area of 1,700 square miles. In other words, some 60 times as much territory would be affected if the bomb were dropped on a nuclear power reactor. This would guarantee some 60 times more destruction and deaths and long term contamination of huge regions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats implore the Government not to allow the considerable commercial and financial pressures which are without doubt being brought to bear on it to prejudice the future of this country in such an insane and unnecessary fashion, bringing to us the prospects of a future which is nightmarish indeed but one which we at least can easily avoid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this world today over 200 peacetime nuclear reactors are in operation, over two hundred more are under construction and over 200 more are in the planning stages. For 20 years or more peacetime reactors have been operating in this country. No known deaths have been attributable to any operation of any nuclear reactor. On the other hand, the history of illness and death from the mining of coal and the burning of coal in power stations runs to tens of thousands of people. It is a quaint thing that anybody should get up in this place and attempt in a selective way to put fear into people's minds knowing that they can drive people into a world that is now threatened-the International Energy Agency makes this very clear-with acid rain which will destroy the ecosystem. It is already doing great damage in Canada and in the Scandinavian countries. Not a mention of this has been made because it suits the purpose of honourable senators opposite to scare. Not a mention has been made of the greenhouse effect of overheating the atmosphere from the overburning of coal. Not a mention has been made of the ravaging of the environment by the overuse of the only other non- renewable petrochemical in this country. But there has been an attempt to scare as though there is something new, different and inherently dangerous in building nuclear power stations. This has been done regardless of Australia's 20 years of experience in this field and regardless of the 200 or more nuclear reactors operating now, the 200 or more being built and the 200 or more being designed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What a quaint situation it is that the Australian Democrats can be so selective that they have failed to say what is being said right round this world today by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, by the International Energy Agency and by all countries, irrespective of whether they are socialist or liberal. There is no way in which the living standards of the people of this world and society as we know it can be maintained unless we increase the use of peacetime nuclear electric power. Why, indeed, have the Australian Democrats not made mention of this? From what has been said it would not matter whether we trebled coal or gas production, whether we had the most massive conservation or whether we made the most massive use of the renewables-solar, wind or biomass. We need to have a significantly increasing use of nuclear power for peacetime purposes. Those who look at the Falkland Islands dispute today and see how an air-to-sea missile can take out a tanker without any trouble will know that in a situation of peril there is no way that oil or coal will move across the surface of this world. Therefore, the world will move more and more towards the use of uranium in this capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Against the background that it is universally agreed that there is an imperative need to safeguard living standards and to safeguard the social and political stability of people and against the track record of the world, we get this tissue of misrepresentations. How is it that an honourable senator can get up in this Senate and say selectively that the Americans are lowering the number of nuclear power stations one by one without acknowledging to this Senate that even more coal fired power stations are being cancelled? Does he argue then that the rejection of contracts for coal fired power stations means that the Americans are going out of the coal fired electric power generation business? What nonsense! We have had one of the most dangerously selective presentations I have heard in this Senate. I reject it out of hand. The fact is that in a period of recession around the world many countries have slowed down their building of power plants, whether they be coal, oil, gas or nuclear plants. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate concerns Australia and the nuclear industry. I want to make it perfectly clear that no government has announced any intention at all of building a peacetime nuclear power plant. I want to look at the two things that are happening in Australia, firstly, the mining and milling of uranium and, secondly, prospectively the enrichment of uranium. I will take, step by step, the selective scare tactics and destroy them. Under the Whitlam Government, the royal commission headed by Mr Justice Fox and known as the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry was set up. It laboured long and heard evidence from expert witnesses everywhere in Australia. Mr Justice Fox subsequently became the Ambassador-At-Large for Nuclear Affairs. The royal commission brought in two reports. It looked at all aspects of the nuclear cycle. It looked at the mining and milling of uranium and the generation of electric power by nuclear fission. One would have thought that instead of scaring the daylights out of Australians, one would go to the report that has been universally adopted and not challenged in any way. What does the report say? I will read the first of its conclusions. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The hazards of mining and milling uranium, if those activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian uranium mines. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Fox goes on to say in the report that it can be a proper safeguarded industry to mine and mill uranium in Australia. That is being done. Yet fear is being engendered in people about that. All the time I hear most remarkable nonsense spoken in this place about the dangers of yellowcake and the supposed high radioactivity of yellowcake. That is absolute nonsense. Yellowcake is regarded as being of such shallow radioactivity that it does not need high safeguard supervision other than for its bulk in case of conversion. I hear nonsense talked of the peril of having an enrichment industry, as though radioactivity has anything to do with a uranium enrichment industry. It is to the nth degree wrong for anyone to get up in this place and misrepresent what is happening to the people of Australia. The fact is, as I have said here repeatedly, that yellowcake in itself is poisonous. If it is eaten it will make one very uncomfortable indeed. Often one used to lick it off one's Reeves's gay pastel paints-that nice little yellow paint that one used to paint with as a child, before one knew. It is poisonous to eat, but so are many other things. It is very shallow in its radioactivity. It is monitored so that we follow its course through all its changes in the cycle. It is not high in radioactivity. It offers no major threat, and Mr Justice Fox said so. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, uranium enrichment is the taking of yellowcake and combining it, first of all, in a conversion process with the gas fluorine. It is entirely a chemical process, and not a radioactive process. It is the taking of fluorine, combining it with the yellowcake, and producing uranium hexafluoride, which is produced into a white powder. It is a chemical process, needing safeguards, as all toxic chemicals do, but it is not in itself radioactive. Let me make it abundantly clear that that is so. Then, taking it from the conversion stage, there is the separating of the isotopes of the hexafluoride according to their atomic weights, largely by a centrifugal method. It is not a radioactive situation or threat but is a chemical process or a physical process. These are the basic things being talked about. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put it straight, because no one can ever be complacent about radioactivity. Let me quote facts from the World Health Organisation publication 'Facts about low-level radiation':</PARA>
<PARA> Taking into account all the radiation (both natural and man-made) that a population is exposed to and the total number of cancer cases (from all causes) that are recorded, it is about 100 times more likely that cancer will be produced in the average individual by some other cause than by radiation. </PARA>
<PARA>Here are the facts coming out all the time. Here is the latest publication, World Health Organisation endorsed. An average person living in Canberra at this moment is subject to 104 millirems-that is, units of radiation. It is 102 in Sydney. It is two more here because of the altitude of Canberra. Those figures are made up in this way: From cosmic rays, 45 millirems; from soil, 15 millirems ; from food, water and air, 25 millirems. Let us get this in perspective: It is 45 millirems from cosmic rays, 15 from soil, and 25 from water, food and air. From air travel, on a round trip Sydney-Perth, the figure is 3. From diagnostic X-rays, the figure is 20, and from living in the vicinity of a nuclear plant, the figure is one. </PARA>
<PARA> From all the atom bomb explosions and tests since Hiroshima and Nagasaki right through to Muroroa, 2 millirems has been added to the atmosphere. I do not condone the addition of one. I want to make clear how the scare arises and how bad it is. I have said that cosmic rays average about 45 millirems, but let me show how it can be changed. Let us bear in mind that it is one millirem from being near an atomic plant. If one is in Perth it is 60. In London it is 100, in Paris it is 120, in Denver it is 125, and in Kerala in India it is about 400. So in the ordinary way of moving around the world, of flying around the world, the units we are exposed to are added to massively. We are talking about the risks inherent in these kinds of situations. I do not want to be in any way complacent about this matter. I have with me a chart which shows that 67.6 per cent of radiation is from natural background, 30.7 per cent is from medical irradiation, 0.6 per cent is from fall-out, 0.5 per cent is from miscellaneous causes, 0.45 per cent is from occupational exposure, and 0.15 per cent is due to releases from the nuclear industry. These are the scare tactics that people are trying to talk about on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> Now let us come to a comparison of the situation. I would welcome an honest debate in this place about the dangers to health, whether it be from radiation, coal, oil or anything else. I would regard it as being objectively more honest if we had that debate. Let me read from a booklet first published by the International Atomic Energy Agency which states:</PARA>
<PARA> For example, nuclear power stations emit radio-active materials; oil- and coal- fired power stations discharge sulphur dioxide (as much as 20,000 to 30,000 tonnes per year from a single large power plant). But in terms of the corresponding lethal doses of these radioactive materials and of sulphur dioxide , the emission limits for nuclear power stations are 100 times lower than they are for oil- or coal-fired stations. </PARA>
<PARA>In nuclear power stations the emission limits are 100 times lower than for oil- or coal-fired stations. </PARA>
<PARA> This is only one facet of air pollution and air pollution in turn is the only one factor to be considered in determining the relative merits of different energy sources. Furthermore, in the case of coal, it has been estimated that in Pennsylvania 30,000 miners died in the mines between 1870 and 1950-an average of about one man a day for 80 years. </PARA>
<PARA>That refers just to Pennsylvania. I refer also to acid rain and to the greenhouse effects. There has been not a word about the massive carcinogenic elements that are involved in coal-firing. If we are going to press on and scare the world, if we are to burn more and more coal, we are going to change the ecosystem of this world to an enormous degree and do very great damage to the health of people. It would be vastly more honest if this debate took place not selectively but in parallel with a debate on other sources of energy. It would be more honest if we could say: 'Look, we have a world in which oil is finite. We will run out of oil. We must have substitutes-coal, gas, nuclear energy and the renewables-the biomass, solar and wind power. How can we use these elements to protect the ecosystem? How can we do this to save coal for the hundreds of years ahead when we need it for a vital petrochemical system? Why are we not urging the saving of our resources?' Instead, there is concentration on one fear tactic. We are given the wrong evidence. We are talking about the nuclear power industry in Australia in relation to which we mine and we mill. The Fox committee report said that it is safe to do this with the appropriate safeguards . We are doing so. We have done this for 20 years. Those safeguards have worked. Hazards to health have not been proven at all. The Fox committee has said that it is proper to operate nuclear power stations. Several hundred or more are operating in this world with no proof of danger compared with the overwhelming deaths and injuries that have occurred in the coal and oil industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat to honourable senators that it is fundamental knowledge that every country in the Western world is unanimous that there will be no solution to the energy problem, the maintenance of living standards and the preservation of society unless we have an orderly nuclear process of peacetime generation. We have been given this massive source of energy, this low cost vehicle of energy. We heard a lot of nonsense from Senator Mason to the effect that the cost of nuclear power stations is such that they are not going ahead. Basically, a nuclear power station costs three times as much or more to build than a coal- fired or oil-fired power station. But, in fact the cost of the fuel is very much lower. Its transportability is enormously easier. As the price of coal rises year by year, so the cost of operation of a coal-fired station, combined with its capital costs, will pass that of the nuclear power station. The nuclear power station development will move ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I am second to none in wanting to limit in this world all avoidable or elective radiation. Australia is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. It is nonsense to say that if Australia had a uranium enrichment plant, it would have a weapons-grade enrichment capacity. To say that is to fail to understand the chemistry of the physics or to distort the position deliberately. In fact, weapons-grade fuel is so much richer than other fuel. Senator Mason knows, as everybody else knows, that the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Australian Safeguards Office will monitor at every step the grade of the uranium and where that uranium is sent. Every tonne of yellowcake that leaves Australia is monitored over the whole of its cycle. It is monitored when it is changed from yellowcake into uranium hexafluoride by chemical volume and weight. It is monitored as it is made into enriched uranium. It is monitored when it is made into fuel rods. It is monitored through the reprocessing of the spent fuel. At every stage, wherever the uranium moves, we have the capacity to say: 'You will not divert this fuel to weapons making. You will not divert it to make anything else'. We can stop the supply immediately to any country that breaches these rules. I will be discussing this with the IAEA next week or the week after. The IAEA is vigilant in this monitoring. I say, without any complacency at all, that it is a downright misrepresentation to the Australian people to put forward the kind of nonsense and the distorted propaganda that we have heard today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats reject absolutely the contention of the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) that the nuclear power industry is safe. We reject absolutely Senator Sir John Carrick's contention that there is no alternative to nuclear power. I propose during the course of my remarks to submit evidence to substantiate those two points of view. It is a rare occasion when the Democrats have the opportunity to have debated in this Senate a matter of national importance. It is very much in line with the basic thinking of the Democrats that they should choose to debate the nuclear power industry on the rare occasion that they have an opportunity to initiate debate on an important matter. The Democrats see nuclear power as the critical issue facing mankind today, as the single greatest overriding issue that has arisen in the twentieth century. It is an enormous challenge, as we see it, facing our generation. It makes everything else pale into insignificance. The preservation of our planet, the preservation of spaceship earth, is the issue that has arisen in the twentieth century. It has not arisen before in the history of mankind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Mason pointed to the fact that the nuclear power industry in the United States of America is tending now to become uneconomic. That is very true. I believe we are living in a fool's paradise if we hope that because the nuclear power industry in the United States is uneconomic this will lead to the nuclear power industry fading away. There will never be any shortage of Third World countries prepared to mortgage their whole economies in an attempt to get nuclear power. Why? It is for a very fundamental reason. It is through nuclear power that dictatorships can get access to nuclear weapons. That is the reason that there will be a market for nuclear power for as long as the developed Western world is prepared to sell nuclear power plants to countries like India and the Argentine. It was only recently that we were amazed that a country such as India, which one would have thought had greater priorities like feeding its population, exploded a nuclear bomb. Where did it get the material to make the nuclear bomb? It got it as the byproduct of its nuclear power reactor which it bought, I think, from West Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who saw the Four Corners program on the Australian Broadcasting Commission network just a few weeks ago now realise that the Argentine has the capability of producing nuclear weapons-if, in fact, it does not already possess them. One wonders what Great Britain's reaction would be if it faced defeat in the Falkland Islands as a result of nuclear weapons being used in that war. There is no way that we can restrict the use of nuclear weapons around the world , in every tin pot dictatorship on earth, if we persist with the nuclear power industry. That is our overriding concern. The consequences of a nuclear war are too frightening to contemplate. That is the stark reality that we face right now as a result of the nuclear industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats' attitude regarding nuclear power is not new. From its formation, as a political force in this country, it fundamentally opposed nuclear power and the mining of uranium as a first step in the development of nuclear power. Well before that the Australia Party opposed nuclear power. As national convenor of the Australia Party in 1975 I challenged Mr Whitlam, who at that time was travelling the world selling Australia's uranium, to state the reasons why he was a party to the development of substances that are amongst the most dangerous in the world. In February 1975 a campaign against nuclear power was formed in this country for the first time. Unfortunately the conservative government-the Liberal Party-has persisted in pushing the mining of uranium and supporting the development of nuclear power around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Only recently President Reagan said that money would be made available for the development of the breeder reactor. The previous President of the United States opposed any further money being spent on the breeder reactor. Now the United States, West Germany and, we believe, France and the United Kingdom are developing breeder reactors. Why are they persisting in the development of breeder reactors? It is for the simple reason that supplies of uranium are very limited. They are certainly sufficiently limited to make the billions of dollars being expended at the moment unjustifiable. The nuclear industry needs a renewable energy source to fire its reactors. That renewable energy source is plutonium and it is the breeder reactor that produces plutonium. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fox report, from which Senator Sir John Carrick quoted at some length, stated that the problems of the plutonium society-I think that was the term it used-were too horrifying to contemplate. Yet that is the direction that the United States of America and other Western countries are now pursuing with all the resources that they can muster. It involves carting considerable quantities of plutonium around the world's shipping lanes. A handful of plutonium spread across Melbourne or Sydney would render those cities permanently uninhabitable. We are going to transport plutonium. I see that Senator Sir John Carrick does not agree. It takes 12 pounds of plutonium to make an atom bomb. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very easily spread. I refer to no less an authority than Dr Gofman of the United States. He submitted a report which as yet has not been refuted by the nuclear industry. He commented on the establishment of a reprocessing plant on the east coast of the United States and went into great detail about the stores of plutonium that would be held in that reprocessing plant. He concluded:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>a 1 per cent release of the radioactivity inventory at Barnwell would be a disaster unimagined for any peacetime situation. </PARA>
<PARA>He indicated that the heat from a terrorist bomb would be sufficient to turn the stored plutonium nitrate into plutonium oxide which would float into the atmosphere and, with satisfactory wind conditions, cover virtually the whole east coast of the United States causing millions of people to be evacuated. That was stated by an authority who is beyond dispute. The plutonium industry requires the storing of a substance which is arguably the most dangerous that has ever been produced by mankind. What right has our generation to plan to produce plutonium in breeder reactors in ton lots and then ship it around the world, from the breeder reactor to the reprocessing plant and from the reprocessing plant to the reactors in Third World countries such as Argentina and India? If planning to pursue a technology as dangerous as this is not the greatest indictment on our generation I do not know what is. We say this is the greatest challenge. It is an evil of unimaginable proportions and there are alternatives. Perhaps they will be capital intensive. Wind power has been studied with a great deal of attention and much detail. It has been proven, by professors of physics, to be a viable alternative and a renewable energy source provided that we are prepared to invest the capital to set it up. Enormous amounts of energy, particularly in the southern hemisphere, are available by harnessing the wind. Solar energy is, admittedly, a capital intensive form of energy but it is one that, if pursued, could be a very valuable addition to our total energy requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Hydrogen is the only renewable fuel for our engines and aeroplanes at this stage. Admittedly there are many problems but development could surely be pursued in these sorts of directions. Renewable energy is vital. If society, as we know it today, is to develop into the foreseeable future with a standard of living as we know it today, we must have renewable energy sources. As Senator Sir John Carrick pointed out, our fossil fuels are limited. After the year 2000 it will be very difficult to predict where we will get the energy to fuel our cities and transport. Surely now is the time to plan for that time ahead and to develop renewable energy sources, which admittedly will cost money. The investment in capital and manpower to develop renewable sources is the great challenge facing us. Unemployment would be solved overnight with the development of a renewable energy source. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by saying simply that in the perspective of geological ages our generation is insignificant but it carries an enormous responsibility to preserve intact our planet, spaceship earth, so that future generations-again in perspective of geological ages-can carry forward the fullness of the knowledge we have today which has been so hardly won. </PARA>

<PARA> A Document quoted from by a Senator not a Minister of the Crown may be ordered by the Senate to be laid upon the table; such Order may be made without Notice immediately upon the conclusion of the speech of the Senator who has quoted therefrom. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mason quoted from a document purporting to be confidential. Senator Sir John Carrick then quite properly moved, in conformity with Standing Order 364, that the document be tabled. The question was put by the Acting Deputy President who was then in the chair and the motion was carried on the voices. All I am saying is that whilst that is proper Senate procedure it is a standing order that is not used very often. It could well represent an embarrassment to certain people unless the procedure is known to honourable senators. Senator Mason has absolutely no objection to that document being made public.

I seek your ruling, Mr Acting Deputy President, as to whether Standing Order 364 does in fact require, on the motion of the Senate, the tabling of a document which is not in fact in the senator's physical possession at the time he is referring to the content of it in the chamber. I took the request being made of Senator Mason and his acquiescence to it and the Senate's resolution to be in the context of a requirement that Senator Mason table the particular piece of paper from which he was reading at that particular time. That has been my understanding of how standing orders of this kind in fact apply. If indeed it is to be the case that Standing Order 364 is to be construed as requiring the tabling of a document not in the chamber, not one from which the senator is reading and not one from which the senator is quoting in that sense, it seems to me something of an extraordinary precedent that is in fact being set on this occasion. If that is indeed the purport of the standing order and if that is the way it is to be applied, I suggest that there be a formal ruling to that effect. Equally, of course, at the same time I submit that that is not the way that Standing Order 364 should be construed but that it should be construed as applicable only to a document in the physical possession of the senator and from which he is quoting in a physical sense in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

Any honourable senator, by request-that has been the courtesy-can ask for the document from which an honourable senator is reading to be tabled. That is the document to which we are referring. If within that document there is a quotation from another document somewhere else, the motion or the request does not cover that other document.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Mr Acting Deputy President, it appears we can generate more radioactivity from the Standing Orders, or the misinterpretation of them, than we can from a nuclear reactor. For those honourable senators who are not quite aware of what is going on, we are discussing a matter of public importance, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Plans by the Commonwealth Government to encourage the early establishment in Australia of a nuclear industry, including enrichment of nuclear fuel and electric power through the use of nuclear reactors. </PARA>
<PARA>If ever we were in any doubt that this is an emotional subject that cannot seem to get its act together to be dealt with rationally we should not have any doubt now, having heard the Australian Democrats' introduction to that subject today. We heard Senator Mason. He has spoken on this subject without any facts. He has spoken rather irrational and emotional rubbish. Senator Mason was followed by Senator Siddons. The main part of Senator Siddons's speech referred to the problem of the possibility that plutonium might be used in nuclear weapons and that if somebody threw a handful of plutonium around we would have to evacuate Melbourne or whatever. I am not denying that certain problems are associated with plutonium. It is radioactive and it is an alpha emitter. Being an alpha emitter, cigarette paper can protect us from it. In other words, if I had a choice of being in a room with a taipan or a bit of plutonium I think I would stick to plutonium. </PARA>
<PARA> For Senator Siddons's information, there is also currently estimated to be about seven to nine tonnes of plutonium in the air-floating around the atmosphere-as a result of weapons tests of previous times. We do not need nuclear power generation to provide the fuel for nuclear bombs. As a matter of fact, none of this material comes from nuclear power generation. A very pure plutonium-plutonium 239-is needed to make a bomb. That material comes from defence or experimental reactors built specifically for that purpose. The plutonium that comes out of nuclear power generators is very impure. As well as plutonium 239 we have plutonium 240 and 241. I am not saying that this material could not make a bomb; it could. But it would be rather hazardous. It could be a fizzer and its qualities would be unknown. Nuclear power generation is not needed to make plutonium bombs. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this is an emotional subject. I imagine that a lot of that is because our introduction to nuclear power was through Horoshima and Nagasaki, where plutonium was used as a weapon. Had our introduction to electricity been through the electric chair we would have had the same hang-ups about it. Indeed, there were hang-ups when electricity was introduced. There were hang-ups about its being unsafe and the fact that people could be electrocuted. Of course, that has happened. Indeed, there is an element of risk which the community seems to accept, in order to get the benefits. That has happened with electricity. That is happening with nuclear power. I will say a little more about that later. Of course, it has happened with the motor car. There has never been a more devastating invention of mankind than the motor car, yet what legislature in the world would set up legislation to ban the motor car because of the number of people that it kills. </PARA>
<PARA> Most power is generated by the pressure of steam turning a turbine. That steam generally is generated by the burning of coal, oil, gas, or maybe by nuclear fission. All that nuclear fission takes place in a reactor. That brings us to the enrichment cycle. Uranium 235 is what is needed. It has been alluded to by all speakers on this subject. Currently, it is found in its natural state at a level of 0.7202 per cent. Most reactors require the uranium to be enriched to about 3 per cent before it can be used in a nuclear reactor. That is basically what enrichment is all about: We take the uranium out of the ground where it is found naturally in various parts of Australia and other parts of the world; we enrich it from 0.7202 per cent to 3 per cent; and it is then used in a reactor. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mason went on at great length about how this enrichment process means the uranium can be used for nuclear weapons. Senator Carrick touched on this matter. We need to enrich the uranium to at least 80 per cent to get it anywhere near nuclear weapons grade uranium. That is another furphy that is continually thrown about in this emotional argument. Nuclear reactors for power generation have been proved to be safe. It is interesting to note the the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, the Fox report-from which Senator Carrick quoted-in its second finding and recommendation said:</PARA>
<PARA> The hazards involved in the ordinary operations of nuclear power reactors if those operations are properly regulated and controlled are not such to justify a decision not to make and sell Australian uranium. </PARA>
<PARA>As has been mentioned, fossil fuel powered stations provide a far greater health hazard to those around them. They emit radioactivity. Indeed, they emit more radioactivity than does a nuclear power station. Radio isotopes are leeched through the coal, burnt and go up through the chimney stack. These power stations also emit sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, trace metals et cetera. It is estimated that, due to the pollutants that come out of those chimneys, for every 1,000 megawatt powered power station, between 20 and 100 people will die every year from cancer and other respiratory diseases. This is because of the burning of fossil fuel. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again I return to the argument that society seems to accept that there are acceptable risks. We apparently accept that 20 to 100 people will die from the burning of fossil fuels. Yet for some unknown reason people have hangups about nuclear reactors from which there has not been one recorded death. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is up to Senator Coleman to prove what she says. She appears to be the only person in society up to this point of time who knows about any deaths from nuclear reactors used for power generation. To operate for a year a 1,000 megawatt power station needs 2.1 million tonnes of coal or 10 million barrels of oil. I believe that oil should never be used for power generation. It is a non-renewable resource. It is the main source of energy for transport and I believe that oil should be used at all times for that purpose. It should never be used for power generation. We could also use 1.8 billion cubic metres of natural gas to operate a 1,000 megawatt power station for a year. Solar power has been mentioned. To generate that much power for a year we would need 10,125 hectares of completely cleared land with pathways so that people could move between the reflectors and polish them. I repeat that we would need 10,125 hectares of completely cleared land to generate 1,000 megawatts of power for a year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="C67">Senator COLLARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is solar cells; photovoltaic cells. Alternatively, we would use 30 tonnes of uranium to generate that much power. No wonder it is one of the best, cleanest and most efficient methods of generating power in this day and age. As well as the deaths which result from the emissions from the chimneys of fossil fuel power stations there are all the deaths that occur, unfortunately , in the mining of coal. We can hardly have a debate in this place without Three -Mile Island being brought into the argument. I might mention that not one death or injury resulted from the Three-Mile Island incident. Yet we can all remember the hysteria with which the Press of the world greeted the Three-Mile Island accident. At that same time coal miners were killed in a coal mine, and that rated a mention of one paragraph. Where are our priorities? Is the life of a person working in the nuclear industry worth a lot more than that of a miner killed underground while mining coal? That seems to be the value put on this matter by the international media at this time. That is one of the unfortunate parts about this whole emotional argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer now to future use. Senator Mason referred at length to the number of nuclear power reactors which will not be going ahead in the United States of America. Senator Carrick also rightfully said that this is due to the lack of the need for that energy in the foreseeable future. Many coal-fired power stations are also not going ahead. The last time I was overseas I talked to representatives of the United Kingdom Department of Energy and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Japan. Their figures are quite interesting. The United Kingdom is now using 12 per cent nuclear generation to provide its power. It anticipates that in 1992 it will be using 33 per cent nuclear power generation. Japan is now using 12 per cent nuclear power generation. It anticipates that it will be using 22 per cent in 1991 and 26.7 per cent in 1995. France, of course, is more committed to nuclear power. Some 40 per cent of its power is now generated by nuclear methods. It anticipates that it will be using 70 per cent nuclear power generation in 1990. So a lot of use certainly is being made and will be made of nuclear power, particularly in those countries which are flat out getting a clear sky because of the smog created by the burning of fossil fuels both for transport and power generation purposes. Nuclear power is by far the cleanest and safest source of power generation. Incidentally, France expects to be saving 73 million tonnes of oil through its nuclear program. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite interesting that whilst we hear arguments at great length-I must confess that it has been a while since we have had a good debate in the Senate on nuclear power-some years ago the French were finding that their uranium was not working in their reactors as predicted. I have referred to this instance in the Senate before. When they did their homework they found that the uranium they were using came from Gabon and that instead of U235 being present at the rate of 0.7202 per cent the rate was as low as 0.42 per cent. When they did their homework they realised that about 1.7 or 1.9 billion years ago U235 was found naturally in formations at the rate of about 3 per cent. Through radioactive decay the figure is now down to 0.7202 per cent. When one realises that one starts to get an idea of what it is all about; that long ago natural reactors were actually operating in the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, at that time U235 was found in the natural formations at the rate of about 3 per cent. It so happened that in these formations there was sufficient water in crystalline form to act as a moderator. So we had reactors operating naturally for as long as 150,000 years. Whatever man thinks he has done now mother nature has beaten him to it. Ever since that time there has been the waste from those reactors in the ground. There has been the plutonium and so forth. Nobody has worried about it and it has not worried anybody else. We have not had the governments to suggest that it is a good idea. We have not had the Democrats to suggest that it is not a good idea. It was a natural phenomenon, and all mankind is really doing is picking up a natural phenomenon and using it.</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of production of power has been mentioned. I will cite figures I was able to get from MITI in Japan in January 1980. The cost of production of power in Japan at that stage was 13 yen per kilowatt for hydro-electric power; 9.6 yen per kilowatt for oil generation; 12 yen per kilowatt for coal generation; 9.9 yen per kilowatt for liquid natural gas generation; and 6.4 yen per kilowatt for nuclear generation. That was the actual operating cost of nuclear power generation in Japan as compared with others at that time. Of course, Japan has very little of its own fossil fuel reserves and it has to use nuclear power. I would say that even though Australia is not currently looking at nuclear power generation, I for one would not have any objections whatsoever if it were. It would certainly mean that when we have disputes, disruptions or breakdowns in the coal mining industry we would have a means of power generation which could go on and on without refuelling. We could provide the power and we would not thus be as susceptible to all the hiccups which exist in the coal mining industry. I agree that this is a matter of public importance because we should be enriching the uranium in our own country and we should be looking seriously at the need for nuclear power generation for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps one of the most important statements to come out of the conference of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science held this year was that made by the Dean of the University of Western Australia Faculty of Law, Professor Richard Harding, which was reported in the West Australian on 11 May. Professor Harding said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Three Mile Island accident showed criminologists that no nuclear reactor system was safe or could ever be safe . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I believe more and more people throughout the world are beginning to see that as a reality for the very near future. It is not something that will perhaps occur in the twenty-first century. They see it as something that could happen right here and now. There are so-called experts-we have heard some of them today on the Government side-who differ on the issues relating to nuclear energy. Some see nuclear energy as the saviour of humanity; some see it as causing the destruction of humanity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to me that a physicist professor who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for chemistry publicly recognised the tie between nuclear power and nuclear weapons which the members on the Government side today failed to recognise. They keep on talking about the matter as though it involved two separate and distinct atoms. It is exactly the same atom. If one produces nuclear energy one produces nuclear weapons. It is the same and it does not matter what honourable senators say in this chamber about there being a difference. That is the situation. It was recognised by the Fox report. We have had selective quotations by the Minister for National Development and Energy ( Senator Sir John Carrick) and Senator Collard from the Fox report and what it said about nuclear energy. But they did not quote recommendation No. 3 of the Fox report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war. This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I did not hear the Minister say that during his speech. I did not hear Senator Collard make that statement. They quoted selectively from the Fox report. They did not quote from the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is time we had a look at the state of the Australian uranium industry at the moment. We have so little control over it. Honourable senators might recall that only two years ago, I think, a fairly large amount of radioactive material was missing from the Mary Kathleen uranium mine. The Government regulatory committee that is supposed to look after these things- Senator Sir John Carrick spoke earlier about how the Atomic Energy Commission could enforce restrictions on the production, the mining and everything else-did not even know that it was missing. The company itself did not know that it was missing. Where is the safeguard there? Senator Sir John Carrick talks about the uranium that we send overseas being safeguarded. When he presented papers on that I spoke to them and asked him a series of questions, including questions about how we would monitor the use of Australia's uranium strictly for domestic purposes. He was very blase about it then and he is very blase about it now. What are we going to do? Are we going to colour it bright purple so that we will know that it is Australian uranium and must be used only for our domestic energy supply? Are we going to have someone stationed in every nuclear energy plant and interfering in other countries' internal operations? Are we going to have someone there monitoring the use of Australian uranium? How are we going to safeguard that aspect? How is the Government going to ensure that Australia's uranium will be used only for the production of domestic energy?</PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Government that there is no way it can guarantee that the uranium will not be siphoned off. We have seen reports of large amounts of fissionable material having been stolen. A boatload of the damn stuff was missing and it still has not been found. Is Senator Sir John Carrick game enough to stand up in this place and say that it is not now in Argentina, Chile or Uruguay?</PARA>

<PARA> We are talking about responsibility. Let us look at the matter of responsibility. I do not trust most of the people who are involved in the Australian uranium industry any more than I trust those people who are involved in the uranium industry anywhere else. Let us look at the proposal referred to in an article under the heading 'Uranium enrichment plant plan' in the Australian Financial Review of 4 May 1982. The article is about a move to set up an Australian industry. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Concrete moves to establish a uranium enrichment industry in Australia were taken last week when the Federal Government convened a meeting of Commonwealth and State officials involved in nuclear regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>I question the phrase 'nuclear regulation'. It has been established that there is radioactivity from the mineral sands at Capel in Western Australia and the nuclear regulatory commission that Senator Sir John Carrick talks about has no power to do anything to safeguard the health of the people there. A similar situation has arisen in Byron Bay in New South Wales. Where is the power? The Commonwealth does not have it. We have given it to the States and said: 'Look after it yourselves'. The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The Governments of Queensland, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia--</PARA>
<PARA>They are all Liberal governments-</PARA>
<PARA>have all canvassed the possibility of setting up an enrichment plant in their home State. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mason made the comment earlier that Sir Charles Court, as Premier of Western Australia, was quite happy to have a nuclear power station go ahead there. But Mr O'Connor, the current Premier of Western Australia, has seen the light of day and the political reality. One of the first statements he made when he became Premier was to say: 'We will not go ahead with nuclear energy'. The article in the Australian Financial Review continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Two of the companies involved in the UEGA--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>study group, WMC--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Western Mining Corporation-</PARA>
<PARA>and Peko Wallsend, have a direct involvement in uranium mining in these States. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us get back to responsibility and talk about the responsibility of the Western Mining Corporation, which could not even control a radioactive measuring gauge. It lost it from its Kambalda site. Senator Chipp was with me at a public meeting on the Esplanade in Perth some years ago-on 8 December 1978, I think- when we drew it to the attention of the people of Australia that that company had lost a radioactive part. What happened to it? It went to Singapore, completely contaminated. An entire furnace had to be melted down and returned to Australia. That shows how responsible the Western Mining Corporation is. This is the company which wants to go ahead with the uranium enrichment plant. Lovely!</PARA>
<PARA> Let us talk now about deaths in the uranium industry. I will make only a brief comment about the military side of the nuclear industry as I am going through this matter. We have debated this matter in this chamber once before. I am sure Senator Sir John Carrick will recall the occasion when the third edition of the booklet entitled 'Safety Record of the Nuclear Power Industry. Accidents, Leaks, Failures and Incidents' was incorporated in Hansard. I proved to Senator Sir John Carrick then and I will prove to him now that when he stands up here and says there have been no deaths in the industry he tells a mistruth because there is no truth in what he says. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at this booklet. I might add that this booklet was compiled in my office from other people's reports. They are not my reports. They are on record here and are available for anybody to check. In 1958-24 years ago-the Boris Kidric Institute at Vinca, Yugoslavia, reported that a nuclear reactor overheated resulting in one death. Six scientists were irradiated and transported to France for treatment. In 1958 in Los Alamos, United States of America, one death was caused by radiation in the uranium enrichment plant. The incident in 1961 at Idaho Falls, United States of America, was reported as the first major reactor accident in the United States of America. An explosion occurred, the cause of which is still not known. Three men were killed instantly . Their bodies were so severely irradiated that their exposed hands and heads had to be severed from their bodies and buried in a dump for radioactive waste. Have there been no deaths in the nuclear industry, Senator Sir John Carrick?</PARA>
<PARA> The next one concerns the military side of the industry. In 1963 the nuclear submarine USS Thresher disappeared on a deep test dive with 112 navy men and 17 civilians on board. No one has yet been able to say what happened. No deaths in the nuclear industry! That is the military side of the nuclear industry we are talking about. Let us get back to the domestic side of the nuclear industry and talk about the nuclear tests held at the Nevada test site when people developed strange diseases from which they died. Let us talk about what happened in 1964 at the Wood River nuclear installation in the USA. One death occurred from radioactivity in the uranium enrichment plant. There was a report on this subject in 1965 by the United States Public Health Department. Is Senator Sir John Carrick questioning the report of the Public Health Department when it states there have been deaths in the nuclear industry? When he gets up in this place and says there have been no deaths he tells a mistruth. He has done it before. I contradicted him then and I will contradict him now. The United States Public Health Department states that evidence suggests that excessive leukaemia deaths occurred among Utah residents. The report was shelved but it later became a very vital part of the Nugget file, which is still not readily available to people but which has been made available under the Freedom of Information Act in the United States. The Public Health Department report states:</PARA>
<PARA> From 1950 to 1964, 28 leukaemia deaths in the South West Counties of the State of Utah. Only 19 cases would have been expected to occur among the 20,000 residents of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> 1959 and 1960-7 people with acute leukaemia, 5 of them children and teenagers. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1965 in Rocky Flats in Colorado in the United States of America fire exposed 400 workers to high levels of plutonium released in the atmosphere. Twenty-five got 17 times the permissible radiation dosage. Three hundred and twenty-five workers were contaminated, 56 developed cancer and 14 have since died. No deaths in the nuclear industry?</PARA>
<PARA> A report by Higson and Crancher of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, referring to deaths in the USA, not in Australia, states that between 1945 and 1968 ten workers died as a result of overexposure to radiation from experimental reactors or in laboratory work connected with the development of nuclear power. Let us talk about 1971 in Oklahoma, when an explosion killed a compressor worker as he was adjusting a compressor. At Windscale a man died of leukaemia after working for 13 years at a plant and being exposed to radiation dangers. The British Nuclear Power Co. admitted liability. We can talk about the situation that arises here in Australia. We had an admission of liability by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission when it accepted responsibility for the widow of a man who died after working at the Commission. There have been deaths. There have been deaths here in Australia. There will be untold deaths if we allow a uranium enrichment plant to operate in this country. In 1972 in Surrey in the United States two deaths were due to the failure of a valve. In 1973, two workers were killed while inspecting defective valves when a valve blew off at the Surrey reactor. A New Jersey truck dock worker accidentally spilt plutonium on himself while handling a leaking box of liquid waste in 1963. He died in 1973 aged 39. The company admitted liability but before he died had refused to pay compensation. Let us look once again at the report from Higson and Crancher of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. Until 1973, according to their report, not according to mine-I must stress that the collation only was done in my office-861 incidents had been reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States. Senator Sir John Carrick has misled this Parliament on a number of occasions when he has said that there have been no deaths in the nuclear energy industry. He has known about such deaths. The whole booklet I have referred to has been incorporated in Hansard and is available in every library, including the Parliamentary Library. It is also being made available in high schools because people need to know the facts and they need to know what this Government is letting us in for if it goes ahead with the planned uranium enrichment plant in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>Plans by the Commonwealth Government to encourage the early establishment in Australia of a nuclear industry, including enrichment of nuclear fuel and electric power through the use of nuclear reactors. </PARA>
<PARA>Some previous speeches gave the impression that Australia should give a lead by being one of the few countries which will not proceed with the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and, presumably, therefore will not be in a position to participate fully in the nuclear safeguards treaty and the nuclear safeguards policy which this Government has been at such pains to develop. The present Australian Government has developed a nuclear safeguards policy which I believe is one of the world's outstanding examples of such a policy. We have signed nuclear safeguards agreements with Canada, Finland, France, Sweden, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom and Euratom as well as negotiating recently with Japan and Switzerland. I think that shows at least the start of an extremely responsible attitude to the question being debated. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the whole Australian society, like the British society, could be seen to be adopting a responsible attitude to this question. Therefore I do not think the matter should be looked at as one in which any government in Australia has been irresponsible in its approach. Governments have been most careful and most thorough. Our attention should be directed to some of the other aspects, not to whether there has been good will towards the principle espoused by Senator Mason and others or whether there has been a genuine endeavour to achieve as much as possible in the appropriate control over nuclear energy in its various forms, but rather to whether we should proceed beyond that to utilise something which is being utilised by other countries at the moment. Almost 50 countries have nuclear power stations either in operation or under construction. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the problem with regard to the question of nuclear energy is that the matter is seen by many people, with very understandable emotions, in the context of the 1940s and what happened at the conclusion of the Second World War. I can well understand that people have a horror about the wartime use of nuclear power , but there are thousands and thousands of nuclear warheads around the world at the moment. Australia's engagement in the peaceful use of nuclear energy will not determine whether there will be a repetition of what happened in Japan in 1945. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me come to that point. So many people, unfortunately, talk in terms of the technology of the 1950s and not the 1980s. Therefore I think it is important to look at several of the matters which have not been discussed to any extent today. Let me make my position clear. I strongly supported the abandonment of the proposed nuclear reactor at Jervis Bay at the beginning of the 1970s. At that time I did not believe that nuclear technology was sufficiently well advanced or that we had any reasonable basis on which we could conclude that we had overcome the waste disposal problem in particular. My motivation in relation to nuclear energy is in many ways, I believe, not dissimilar to the motivation-I accept that it is genuine motivation-of those who raised this matter today as a matter of concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that Australia can be extremely proud of what has been achieved by Australians in relation to waste disposal. The development of the synroc process was one of the most important events in the world in relation to the world's energy problems. It is one of the most important developments in relation to the future of mankind, the future of the human race. This breakthrough was made by Professor Ted Ringwood and a team at the Australian National University and subsequently with the assistance of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. General belief is that the synroc process-the tests conducted by both the University and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and the preliminary tests undertaken by the United States in relation to the synroc process have supported this conclusion-is the answer. It was a synthetic rock to trap and immobilise nuclear waste. It provides an exceptionally stable substance with a tremendous capacity to withstand leaching. It will enable the very small amount of nuclear waste to be treated in a way which will make it not harmful to future generations. In fact the way in which Ted Ringwood explained the process to me is, I think, a good way to describe it to a layman. It was an approach by earth scientists to use earth science principles to return to the earth something which came out of the earth in a form which is not likely to be more harmful than it was when it was in the earth in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the process to any honourable senator who is interested in this question. I would be happy to act as an intermediary to arrange for Professor Ringwood to put on a display at the Australian National University to enable honourable senators to see how the process operates, if they have not seen it, and to get a better understanding of this type of substance. For those who do not know much about it, the physical substance in the end is a very dense, extremely heavy rock which can be made into a form of tube. It looks rather like ebony. It is very dense like ebony and it is a similar colour. It is made up of the materials which are most appropriate to take the nuclear waste and convert it into a substance which then can be put back into the ground. I hope that Australians, rather than talking about the dangers of nuclear energy, will at least pay some regard to this major breakthrough which has been obtained by Australians for the benefit of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to look not at the bad American experience of nuclear energy, which is a bad experience, but at the British experience. I believe it is far more appropriate for us to compare ourselves with British society than with American society. I refer particularly to the fact that aspects of the development of the nuclear energy industry in the United States have been a little like the development of the building industry in that country, where hotel walkways have collapsed and all sorts of other construction faults have created tremendous dangers and caused a tremendous loss of life. Apparently the negligence in the nuclear construction industry has not been as high as it has been in the construction of schools, public buildings, hotels and other buildings, where there have been huge losses of life. British experience over more than a quarter of a century has been that nuclear energy is cheaper, cleaner and far safer than any other form of energy production available to the British people. I would have thought that that is an experience which we ought to take into account, particularly having regard to the way in which the British have been able to develop from their experience, a proper working safeguards policy. They have the experience upon which we can draw in order to implement a working process of control and regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that any form of energy production has some inherent risk. Undoubtedly there will be accidents in the construction of solar energy production facilities and undoubtedly people will die. There is no doubt that accidents and deaths occur in any form of construction. However, we should compare the risks involved and the losses incurred as a result of nuclear energy generation and those involved in the production of other forms of energy. Even if we accept Senator Coleman's figures as being totally correct-their relationship to this matter is a little dubious but I do not pause to debate that-we should also bear in mind that in the great smog of 1952 in London, 3,900 people died as a result of poisoning by the sulphur dioxide emissions from the coal fired thermal power stations. That is a tremendous number of people. Hydro-electric dams in the United States have caused in excess of 2,500 deaths. </PARA>

Bearing in mind the experience of Sweden, the United Kingdom and France, in which there have been recent reviews and recent considered conclusions that nuclear energy is the safest and best form of energy to go on with, and bearing in mind the comparative damage that would be done to the environment by, for example, the construction of a dam in South-West Tasmania where we have the option of losing a huge wilderness area-which I think would be absolutely disastrous for the future of Tasmania, for the future of Australia and for the future of the world-then I cannot see that we should not at least be considering and developing properly the safeguards which will enable the nuclear alternative to be considered if the power is necessary and if there is not a breakthrough, which is unlikely at the moment, in some of the other alternatives which should be pursued. I refer to alternatives such as conservation and co-generation, as well as tidal, wind, solar and other forms of power generation. I believe that we need to consider further development in relation to nuclear energy and that should go ahead as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My answer to the concerns of Senator Siddons, Senator Coleman and others is that if, as Senator Coleman said, we have nuclear energy and therefore nuclear weapons, then we already have nuclear weapons either present or anticipated in 50 or more countries and the sooner we get the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty implemented actively with satellite surveillance, on the ground inspection and everything else that follows, then the better we are likely to be able to prevent the sort of holocaust which every reasonable person considers to be of great danger to the world. I cannot see that Australia, as the one country of all comparable countries not going ahead with the development of nuclear energy, is likely to do anything more than cut off its nose to spite its face. I believe that in many ways it would be much better for our own society to look at getting this clean and cheaper form of energy than to go ahead with something which is both dangerous to the health of the public and to the health of those employed in industries such as the coal industry, which creates problems of pollution with carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and waste materials of various sorts. I find it very hard to understand how reasonable people concerned about the environment, concerned about the future of the human race, cannot say that looking rationally at nuclear energy it is far safer and far cleaner than the alternatives. I hope that this debate has advanced the consideration of the nuclear alternative in Australia, and that Australia and the Australian Government will continue to move along the right path.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On 4 December 1980 Senator Lewis gave notice of a motion that all Bills and amendments to Bills brought into the Senate should be supported by a financial impact statement that provides estimates of gains or losses of government revenue and the cost and recurring annual costs to the Government, industry and other sections of the community in implementing the legislation. We discussed the matter and he later wrote to me proposing instead that a Minister's second reading speech should provide estimates for the balance of the financial year and the next and succeeding financial years in respect of any costs, revenue and savings to the Government and of financial burdens and savings for industry or other sections of the community. I agree, as a general principle, that disclosure of information concerning government costs, revenue and savings expected to arise from proposed legislation leads to more informed parliamentary debate. Where proposed legislation is expected to have significant effects on the Government, it is already common practice for Ministers to disclose that fact and to provide any estimates that can be reliably made. There are, however, good reasons for not making public comprehensive financial estimates for a series of years. These reasons were set out in detail in a statement made to the House of Representatives on 4 March 1980 by the former Minister for Finance, Mr Eric Robinson, in response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure entitled 'Parliament and Public Expenditure'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Briefly, the Government's forward estimates are necessarily based on current knowledge and are subject to substantial uncertainties. If disclosed they could lead to rigidity in expenditures because of the implicit commitments particular interest groups tend to read into such figures no matter how they are qualified. As a result, the Government's budgetary flexibility could be severely curtailed to the detriment of the responsible conduct of economic policy. In some cases, there could be objections to disclosing even first year estimates, for example where a measure has sensitive foreign relations implications. In other cases, such as omnibus legislation, first year estimates may be impossible to calculate with any accuracy or only with an unwarranted allocation of scarce departmental resources to the task. Nor would it generally be possible to provide information about the financial costs and savings for industry or other sections of the community. Many government measures involve costs to some sections of the community and benefits to others, often of an indirect kind, but the net impact, whether in the aggregate or for particular sections, cannot usually be measured with any precision. To attempt to make such estimates could be a costly and complex process necessarily involving consultation with bodies outside the Government. Even then the result would be doubtful estimates that could not be readily interpreted or put to good use. This, of course, does not absolve the Government from the need, when formulating legislation, to take account of the impact on industry and other sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, after consideration of the matter, the Government has decided that in future, to indicate the financial impact of proposed legislation, a Minister' s second reading speech on a Bill will include, where it is practicable and appropriate to do so, estimates that can readily and reliably be calculated in respect of any significant costs, revenue and savings to the Government arising directly from that legislation. The estimates usually will be the amounts expected for the remainder of the current financial year and the estimated amount for a full financial year when the legislation is fully operative; but, where appropriate, Ministers may provide further information. I am sure that honourable senators will welcome this decision by the Government as a contribution to informed parliamentary debate and public discussion. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pressure is coming from various sources to impose fiscal responsibility on the Fraser Government, in contrast with the ad hockery and opportunism which saturate its record. The statement just given by the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, was apparently prompted by a notice of motion from Senator Lewis on 4 December 1980 which was debated on 11 March 1982. The Lewis motion sought to secure financial impact statements on the fiscal effects of all legislation to be incorporated in second reading speeches. What we have just heard from the Minister purports to be a response from the Government to that suggestion. It is in fact an apologia for inertia designed to facilitate the perpetuation of the existing system. The Government and Senator Guilfoyle purport to respond positively to the suggestion of fiscal impact statements or greater fiscal responsibility with these words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Government has decided that in future, to indicate the financial impact of proposed legislation, a Minister's second reading speech will include . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The statement then adds enough qualifications and exclusions to make that commitment meaningless. For example it states that this will be done 'where it is practicable and appropriate' and where the information or the estimates 'can readily and reliably be calculated'. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement from Senator Guilfoyle is evasive in a more fundamental and important way. It says nothing about control of what have become known as tax expenditures; that is, tax concessions. Indeed, it fails to acknowledge the concept of tax expenditures or mention tax concessions. A dollar of revenue forgone through a tax concession has at least as much impact on tax levels, government deficits, government borrowing requirements and so on as has a dollar actually spent by the Government. I say at least because in most circumstances it has more effect; in fact it costs more. Most payments distributed by governments are to some degree taxable and therefore the net cost to government revenue of a dollar spent by government is something less than a dollar. The net cost to revenue, to the Budget deficit, to government borrowing requirements or whatever of a dollar of revenue forgone through a tax dodge, a tax concession or tax expenditure is a dollar. Tax concessions or tax expenditures are also much more likely to escape scrutiny by parliament or by anyone else and even to escape detection. On the other hand, overt expenditure by governments must be appropriated. When new legislation is introduced almost invariably estimates of the cost of that new legislation, the direct expenditure incurred by it are given. Every year the cost of direct expenditures can be determined in the Appropriation Bills and other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of the way in which tax expenditure escapes not only scrutiny but also detection was provided by the 64 questions on notice about the cost of revenue of tax concessions. These were put on notice in June last year by Ralph Willis and answered in part in February this year. Of the 64 questions, the cost to revenue of 42 of the concessions could not be costed. The 22 that were costed in the answer supplied by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) incurred a total cost in excess of $1,000m. The cost of the other 42 remains the subject of wide-eyed conjecture. The 22 which were costed, including some outrageous rorts which I will detail, cost more than $1,000m in revenue forgone, equivalent to anything up to $1,500m in direct expenditure by the Government. For the reason that I stated earlier, most or a great deal of payments from government are subject to a tax drawback and therefore the net cost to revenue is somewhat less than 100 per cent. The net cost to revenue of a tax expenditure is 100 per cent. It is no wonder, given the fact that 22 concessions alone have cost revenue more than $1, 000m and 42 could not be costed, that Professor Mathews said at the Australian Institute of Political Science Summer School a few months ago:</PARA>
<PARA>the . . . financing system and the disintegrating taxation system which lies at its heart have led to policies directed almost wholly towards the control of government spending, when the real problem which has emerged in Australia is one of restoring control over government revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no suprise that this Government avoids a tax expenditure debate. It has so much to hide. No previous government and no previous Prime Minister can match Mr Fraser's profligate record in this respect. Some of the personal contributions of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to fiscal irresponsibility include the announcement that he made on 14 April 1980, straight off the top of his head, that all expenditure on irrigation development, water conservation and water distribution would be immediately deductible from taxable income, some of it at a rate of 120 per cent-a rate which has now been reduced to 118 per cent. When the effect of averaging that concession is taken into account a taxpayer on the maximum marginal rate of 60 per cent gets a 93 per cent government subsidy on non-depreciating capital investment which then incidentally, if the taxpayer cares to cash in the capital gain, is also tax exempt. It is this sort of thing which prompted the advertisement in yesterday's Australian Financial Review headed 'Investment Opportunity-$1,000,000 Tax Deduction'. The advertisement refers to the Mongyer Lagoon property in the Moree district of New South Wales. The advertisment states:</PARA>
<PARA>Under current legislation, capital expenditure on irrigation works is tax deductible at a rate of 118 per cent in the year of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> This property offers first class capital security and potential for substantial capital gains. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of the anti-social advertisement which has been prompted, initially by the Prime Minister and of course subsequently by the Government, condoning and perpetuating what the Prime Minister has done. No explanation has been given for such a massive subsidy for a particular form of capital investment; that is, a subsidy of 93 per cent--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I wish to respond to the point of order. The matter to which I am referring was the subject of legislation. When that legislation was passed-I think in the autumn session of 1980-no estimate of the cost to revenue was provided to the Parliament when the legislation was presented to it and passed by it. This was exactly the subject of Senator Lewis' s complaint. No explanation was given then and no explanation has been given in other circumstances. No explanation has ever been offered for that 93 per cent hidden public subsidy for a particular form of capital investment. The Prime Minister's own rationale at the time was that it was a relief measure for farmers then stricken by drought. The Prime Minister postulated that a tax dodge for irrigation development would solve the liquidity problems of farmers who had neither water nor money. It was admitted at the time that the proposal was not costed and was not put before Cabinet and that no departmental advice had been sought. It has since been costed by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the Treasury in submissions to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure at $38m in the current financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In October 1980 we received another instalment of fiscal irresponsibility straight off the prime ministerial head with the film tax rort which was either incompetently or dishonestly costed at the time at $2m. It is now admitted that the cost is in the vicinity of $24m-a 1,200 per cent increase. The rort is that expenditure on film production is immediately deductible from taxable income at a rate of 150 per cent and that the first 50 per cent of income derived from that film will be free of income tax. In its original form the write off-the 150 per cent tax deduction-was available as soon as the money was paid into 'a production account'. That of course was a blueprint for the indefinite deferral of taxation without ever making a film; a fact which I have no doubt was soon perceived by John Stone and other watchdogs of the public purse in the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office and, therefore, modified as from May of last year. But even in its modified form the surviving scheme provides tax expenditure, that is, expenditure of taxpayers' funds, of up to 120 per cent of the cost of producing a film. It would obviously be cheaper for the Government to make the films with money directly appropriated and identified as government expenditure, and then to give the films away. The author and architect of the two schemes that I have outlined is now on a world ego trip to unveil his blueprint for economic recovery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Government and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) on this statement. I thank the Minister for it. I am delighted that the Government appears to have accepted about 70 per cent of my proposal. However, before I go any further, I briefly make some reference to the matters which Senator Walsh has just raised. As usual Senator Walsh has been away on a frolic of his own and has totally failed to understand that the purpose of this proposal which I put to the Senate is not control by direct means but simply control by public exposure. In my view, if Ministers are required to make known to the public what the cost of their legislation will be so that the public is able to see that it is not just a matter of whether it sounds as though it might be a good idea or whether it sounds reasonable but that it will cost the community certain millions and millions of dollars, then the public is able to analyse whether it is a good idea in the light of the cost to the taxpayers of the nation. I hope that the public disclosure of the cost of what frequently appear to be simple items of legislation will lead to some restraint.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I instance, for example, metrication. In the late 1960s and the 1970s this nation was full of reform. People were wanting to reform things. They could not get around to reforming things quickly enough. In the process they frequently failed to analyse the cost of the reform. As usual, when reform is in the air wisdom goes out the window. The result was that a Senate committee brought down a report about metrication and after some huffing and puffing the Government introduced a metric conversion Bill which went through both of these Houses with every person speaking in favour of it. With due respect to the legislation, there was a total failure to make any estimate of the costs to this nation. Let there be no doubt that the costs to this nation could be measured in hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, frequently for no value whatsoever. It makes no difference to mum whether she buys a pound of peas or a kilogram of peas. It makes no difference to one's motor vehicle whether one buys a gallon of fuel or a litre of fuel. But just imagine what it has cost the petrol industry to convert gallons to litres throughout the nation. It is an absolute waste of money. No one had really applied his mind to what would be the cost to this nation of such legislation. I am rather hopeful that as a result of this proposal some sort of analysis of legislation will be made. It is disappointing to me that the Government has said that it can provide estimates of its own expenditure and its own revenue in relation to legislation, yet it states-I will quote the words of the Minister for Finance:</PARA>
<PARA> Many Government measures involve costs to some sections of the community . . . and benefits to others, often of an indirect kind, but the net impact, whether in the aggregate or for particular sections, cannot usually be measured with any precision. </PARA>
<PARA>It concerns me that the Government is not prepared to bite that bullet. The Minister goes on to say that although that estimate is costly, perhaps the results will be doubtful. She then states:</PARA>
<PARA> This, of course, does not absolve the Government from the need, when formulating legislation, to take account of the impact on industry and other sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government is saying: 'We cannot work all this out. It is a bit difficult for us to work out and make public. In fact, when we introduce the legislation we have to work it out anyway, but we want to keep that to ourselves '. I believe that as a result of the Government's steps, which the Minister has explained to us today, what will happen is that within her Department some people will start to develop some expertise at estimating. In due course, somewhere further down the track, the Government will decide to take steps to make that information on estimates which it must make available to the legislators so that we will be able to understand what will be the cost to the community. </PARA>

I am not saying that the Government or the Parliament would not have adopted the metric conversion legislation, but I believe that the Parliament was deprived of a vital piece of information by not having before it a reasonable estimate of what would be the cost to the nation. Industry around this nation has spent on metrication hundreds of millions of dollars which could easily have been spent on increased wages and improved working conditions for the people working in those industries . The industries had to meet these expenses and the result has inevitably been increased prices to the consumer. The consumer had to meet the $150m or $20m, or whatever has been the cost of metrication to this nation. I believe that the legislators, the Parliament, ought to be aware of the cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am interested to note that President Reagan in the United States of America has introduced a system called 'regulatory impact analysis' whereby all regulations which are to be brought before him for a signature must have an impact analysis attached to them. I understand that the first thing that has happened is that there has been a slow-down in the regulations of the United States. That must be a good thing. We see so many regulations pouring through our Parliament that one can imagine how many regulations pour through the United States Parliament. Further, the costs of regulations to the nation are required to be analysed in some way. I assure the Parliament that not only will I proceed to keep pressure on the Government in due course to disclose to us the impact on the nation of the legislation brought before the Parliament, but also I give notice now that I intend to continue to press for the cost of regulations to be made public at the time regulations are proclaimed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Australian Democrats in complimenting very sincerely Senator Lewis in bringing this matter before the Senate. I hope my compliment and support of him do not bring the same response it brought last time, when he misunderstood my compliments and made some rather unkind remarks about me. Quite sincerely, I think he has performed a service for this Parliament in bringing this matter on for debate in this chamber and to the attention of the Government. He moved:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all Bills and amendments to Bills introduced into the Senate from the commencement of the Budget Session 1982 should be accompanied by a financial impact statement--</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words 'financial impact statement'-</PARA>
<PARA>which shall contain the following information for each of:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the balance of the financial year; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the following two financial years-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the estimated costs to Government (if any)</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the estimated revenue of Government (if any)</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the estimated savings of Government (if any)</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the estimated financial burden . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (e) the estimated savings (if any) which will be of benefit to industry or other sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that unassailable logic is contained in that proposition. Senator Lewis gave the startling example of metrication. I wonder whether this Parliament would have agreed to the excesses of metrication when we did, had we known the true social cost, the true financial impact. I remember that once during the metrication cycle we went through the insanity of making a criminal or other offence-I think it would be a criminal offence-of bringing in a ruler marked in inches. It was an offence against the Crown. I am not saying necessarily that would have been prevented had Senator Lewis's wishes been adopted and in operation at that stage. But certainly we would have had a rethink about the so-called virtues, the manic desire, the fanaticism to pursue metrication, had the Parliament had such financial impact statements before it. After complimenting Senator Lewis, I also want to compliment the Government. Unlike the spokesman for the Labor Party, I believe that credit should be given where it is due. It is clear, as the spokesman for the Labor Party said, that the Government has not gone nearly as far as Senator Lewis wishes, but certainly it has gone a fair way down the track. On 11 March, which was not too long ago, when Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle promised to undertake some action on this matter, it was agreed that the Government-I quote from the Minister's speech--</PARA>
<PARA>has decided that in future, to indicate the financial impact of proposed legislation, a Minister's second reading speech on a Bill will include, where it is practicable and appropriate to do so--</PARA>
<PARA>That sentence frightens the hell out of me, as it does to anyone, but I suppose it has to be in there-</PARA>
<PARA>estimates that can readily and reliably be calculated in respect of any significant costs, revenue and savings to the Government arising directly from that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a significant step forward in the information given to senators before they vote on a Bill, and it is a tribute to Senator Lewis and to Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, and indeed, to the Government for acquiescing. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I conclude by expressing the hope that the Senate in its wisdom in future years will go further than simply financial impact statements and come to social impact statements on legislation. There is an area here where this Parliament thinks too often and too restrictedly about questions of money. We adopt a balance sheet mentality on legislation that comes before us. We say: 'It is going to cost this or save that; therefore it is a good thing'. I believe that in much legislation, while it might well be useful, and it is useful for Senator Lewis's proposal to be adopted so that senators know what the financial cost of something should be, we ought also to be informed of what the social cost and the social plusses of legislation might be. </PARA>
<PARA> I give two or three brief examples. On education, how absurd it is to mention or to have our minds directed only to the dollar cost of education when debating it. That is all that we do. Having sat in Cabinet, I know the unenviable job of the Minister for Education. When he comes in to make his submission at Budget time or comes into Cabinet with a submission on a matter of education, he is regarded as an irritation. People say: 'God, you want some more millions from us for education.' Instead of regarding education as a vital necessity and an investment, because of the psychology of this place the Minister for Education is now regarded as a menace who is going to produce an unanswerable argument for spending on something millions of dollars that we wish we could save. Unless we have a turn-around and look at the social impact of what we are doing, that balance sheet mentality will remain. </PARA>
<PARA> I give two brief examples of private members' Bills brought in by the Australian Democrats. I have one Bill now before the Senate-I hope it will be debated and passed by all parties this week-which removes from the Sales Tax Assessment Act that part of the cost represented by freight which represents a component of cost for the purpose of assessing sales tax. In other words, when the 12 1/2 per cent sales tax goes on to an item, the Democrats believe very strongly that it should go on the cost of that item and that freight should not be included in the unit cost of the item before the sales tax is applied, because if it is-and it is now under present legislation-people living in rural areas are being discriminated against. They are being penalised for living in the country. Not only are they paying for the freight itself to bring both raw materials and finished goods from city to country, but also they are paying additional sales tax on the goods because freight is included in the unit cost of the goods upon which the sales tax is levied. That is a double payment for people living in rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a relatively simple matter, to follow Senator Lewis's proposition, for the Minister to say that the financial impact of legislation will be X dollars, the savings in the cost to the revenue will be X dollars. That might be several million dollars. But I believe that the Senate would be in a far better position to assess the value of the Bill to be debated here, I hope, next Thursday, if it had a social impact statement with it as well. Perhaps some group in the Government can assess and bring to the Senate a statement showing the beneficial effects which will accrue from decentralisation and the social impact of this world-wide exodus of people from rural areas to city areas: The increase in pollution, crime, drug addiction, prostitution, and family breakdowns, and of all those social factors which a move away from decentrali- sation to centralisation is causing. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is now, the Senate, when the Bill is debated next Thursday, will be tempted to look at this question-I am sure that the Government will look at it- and to say: 'The deficit in the Budget has blown over; it is more than we thought; this Bill of the Australian Democrats, although it will help country people, will make the deficit blow out further; therefore we shall oppose it'. Honourable senators will not even consider or contemplate the social advantages that would accrue to country people, and the social advantages to the whole nation, if we could use this and other measures of attracting people from the cities back to country areas. That is why I say that the excellent suggestion of Senator Lewis should be built on by having statements on social implications as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The last example I give is that of the other private member's Bill that I have before the Senate, on which I shall not be pushing for a vote before the Senate rises because I suspect that it would not yet have the approval of the majority of the members of the Senate. I refer to the imposition of a tax on the advertising of alcohol. The liquor industry has been very active among members of the House of Representatives and senators since I introduced the Bill. If ever there was a unanswerable case to be presented for a massive advertising campaign to people in Australia not necessarily not to drink but, if they drink, to not drive, it is here. I think that 55 people died on Australia's roads over the brief Easter period. Something like 200 to 300 people became permanently maimed over that period because they drove motor vehicles after abusing alcohol.</PARA>
<PARA> I think an unanswerable case in logic can be built up for placing a tax on advertising under the user pays principle and using that that money for counter- advertising and saying to people: 'If you are going to drink for God's sake don' t drive a car and kill someone or maim someone who is innocent'. If Senator Lewis's excellent suggestion is adopted a financial impact statement can accompany that Bill and honourable senators will know what is the cost to revenue and what is the cost to the breweries or whatever. But they will have no idea of the social savings and the social impact of that legislation. I would have thought that if that statement could accompany a Bill such as mine to introduce a tax on the advertising of alcohol it would present logic that would be totally unassailable. We will probably look at that-as the breweries and the liquor interests are now asking honourable senators to look at it-simply with a balance sheet mentality. I conclude by complimenting Senator Lewis for an initiative that has been successful. I compliment the Government for reacting positively to a good initiative. </PARA>

However, since then the debate has been very wide-ranging, particularly with regard to the comments of Senator Chipp. I look forward to Senator Chipp's introduction of a Bill on the advertising of alcohol and to the financial impact statement which he will put down with the Bill to see what this measure will cost the Government in revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has said that. I accept that at the present time. We will see about that. That is not the reason why I rose to speak to this financial statement put down by the Minister for Finance. I congratulate Senator Lewis on having achieved some small success. He has his foot in the door with this matter. I hope that as time goes by this statement will go much further and that some definite figures will be given by the Government not only insofar as legislation and amendments to legislation are concerned but also in relation to government expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was attracted to an article yesterday in the National Times by Geoffrey Kitney dealing with the enormous cost to the taxpayer of the Government Information Unit. When the GIU was first set up we were led to believe that it would cost no more than $100,000. Of course, the Government is having a great deal of difficulty in getting its message across to the people. The Government is now spending, according to Mr Kitney, nearly $4.1m on the GIU operation. If every Budget time a statement could be put down in this Parliament of what the Government intends to spend in the future-the Government might bring down only one more Budget-over and above what it told us it was going to spend when it first set up the GIU the taxpayer would be more enlightened. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other methods of government expenditure which we could look at also. That would be very enlightening. We heard the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) give notice today of all the overseas jaunts that will be taken by Ministers during the recess. We all recall very well the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in 1975 when he said that he would not be a tourist Prime Minister and that his Ministers would stay at home and not waste public money in the way he accused the previous Government of doing. Yet, we had a long list of Ministers' names given to us today. There was no mention of the amount the taxpayers will have to foot while these people are overseas or of the cost of the visits of all of the people who have gone before them and those who will go after them while this Government remains in office. I completely reject the criticism which was levelled at Senator Walsh and the strictures which were placed upon him following a point of order so that he could not develop his argument to the extent that Senator Chipp was allowed. However Senator Walsh is capable of taking care of himself and he will do that at some future time, no doubt during the financial debate. I say again that I hope that this is a forerunner and an opening of the door much wider so that we in this Parliament will be able to debate at length the costs of much of the legislation which is being brought down by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill to amend the income tax law covers two important subjects. </PARA>
<PARA> It will give effect to the Government's decision, announced by the Treasurer on 14 April 1982, to amend the secrecy provisions of the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will permit the Commissioner of Taxation-in very special and limited circumstances-to disclose to certain royal commissions information obtained from official income tax records. </PARA>
<PARA> The second main feature of the Bill is the legislation necessary to give effect to one of the housing assistance measures announced by the Government, namely the scheme of home loan interest tax rebates that was foreshadowed by the Treasurer on 18 March 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Associated with this group of measures is another amendment which will permit the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Construction to be given information from income tax records for the purposes of administration of the Government's new scheme of home deposit assistance to families on low incomes.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the details of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Disclosure of taxation information to certain royal commissions</PARA>
<PARA> The secrecy provisions of the income tax law generally require that the Commissioner of Taxation and his officers maintain absolute confidentiality about information on taxpayers' affairs that comes into the possession of the Commissioner in the course of administration of the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is in the law authority for the Commissioner to supply taxation information to specified authorities, mainly those having responsibility for the administration of laws under which benefits of one kind or another are paid by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> In this situation, Mr President, the Government recognises that the amendments now proposed do break new ground. The measures are in response to recommendations contained in interim report No. 3 of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and follow a strong plea by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions in the Bill will specifically permit the Commissioner of Taxation to make information from income tax records available to these two ongoing royal commissions. It will allow such information to be passed to other royal commissions that are given terms of reference that authorise such a course. </PARA>
<PARA> A royal commission that receives information obtained from taxation records will be able to disclose it in any report to the Governor-General, or in its proceedings, so long as this is done in a way that does not disclose the identity of the person or persons concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition as a result of amendments made to the Bill in another place, the Bill in the form before the Senate will facilitate examination in camera of a person appearing before a royal commission, by permitting disclosure of taxation information to that person or to counsel representing that person if the information concerns the affairs of the person or was furnished to the Commissioner of Taxation by that person. </PARA>
<PARA> A royal commission will also be permitted to divulge tax information, including identification of persons, to the Attorney-General if it holds the view that the information indicates that there may have been a breach of a Commonwealth Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In turn the Attorney-General may, if he considers it appropriate to do so, pass on the information reported to him by a royal commission to the Australian Federal Police, which will be able to use it for internal purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Government has not lightly taken the decision to permit these royal commissions to be provided with confidential tax information. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an old and well established principle in this country that taxation information should be kept confidential and the effectiveness of the taxation system owes a lot to that very important principle. </PARA>
<PARA> In coming to this decision, therefore, the Government had to weigh very carefully two competing areas of public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand there was the need to maintain taxation confidentiality and, on the other, there was the necessity for action to be taken to support enquiries in particular areas of special public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, in reaching the decision we have come to, we have felt it appropriate to ensure that the highest possible level of confidentiality, compatible with the decision, should be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the proposed legislation will impose very strict secrecy restraints on persons to whom taxation information is conveyed under the new provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> These restraints will be of the same general kind as those that already apply to taxation officers and others who receive taxation information and will extend to the royal commissions, the Attorney-General and the Australian Federal Police , as well as to the respective staffs of those bodies or persons to whom tax information may necessarily be communicated. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the proposed amendments are so structured that persons to whom confidential tax information is conveyed under them will be precluded from using it in an action to prosecute any person. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, it bears repeating that these amendments do not evidence any policy of generally easing the strict confidentiality applying to tax records.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer said when he was foreshadowing these amendments, their effect will be watched very closely and they are not to be taken as a precedent for any other relaxation of tax secrecy. </PARA>
<PARA>Home Loan Interest Rebate</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, honourable senators may recall that, on 18 March 1982, the Treasurer made a ministerial statement in another place following a detailed review by the Government of housing policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In his statement the Treasurer reinforced the Government's commitment to preserving the highest practicable level of private home ownership in Australia and identified four main problem areas in the field of housing finance. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give effect to the Government's decision to alleviate one of those problems-the burden of mortgage payments. </PARA>
<PARA> These tend to be highest in real terms, of course, in the early years of a housing loan. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes the provision of a rebate of tax for home loan interest payments made on or after 1 July 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic features of the rebate were referred to in the Treasurer's statement, and he also released a detailed supporting statement at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, I trust that I can be brief in my references now to the rebate, particularly as it is explained fully in the explanatory memorandum that is being made available to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The rebate of tax to be authorised by this Bill will be available to an individual taxpayer resident in Australia in respect of the first five years of occupancy of the person's sole or principal residence here. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to certain upper limits, the basic rebate will be 32 cents for each dollar of interest paid on or after 1 July 1982 and during the relevant income year, provided the interest has accrued while the taxpayer occupied the dwelling . </PARA>
<PARA> A feature of the rebate is that existing home-owners may qualify. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be available to home-owners who first occupied a sole or principal residence on or after 1 July 1977, and will extend to those who first occupy a sole or principal residence no later than 30 June 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> For a married person-and this will apply also to a person in a de facto marriage relationship-the five year occupancy period will run from the date on which either of the partners first become an owner-occupier of such a residence.</PARA>
<PARA> As regards the limits on the rebate, the basic upper limit will be $500 per dwelling in the first year of owner-occupancy, to be reduced by $100 per year for each subsequent year. </PARA>
<PARA> Rules covering people who took up occupancy prior to 1 July 1982 will mean, for example, that if the occupancy occurred in 1981-82 the person will be eligible for the full first year limit of $500 in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> The limit otherwise applicable in any year will, however, be increased by an additional amount of $200 where the dwelling is also home for a dependent child or dependent student. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a taxpayer changes his or her place of residence within the five year period, he or she will be entitled to the rebate in respect of interest attributable to the acquisition of the second dwelling, but the upper limit will be determined having regard to the date on which he or she occupied the original dwelling. </PARA>
<PARA> Special arrangements will apply where two or more persons have interests in a dwelling which is occupied by them as their sole or principal residence and where a dwelling is also used by a taxpayer for purposes other than as a sole or principal residence. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of a matrimonial home the interest rebate will be transferable between spouses irrespective of which one incurred and paid the interest. </PARA>
<PARA> This will help to ameliorate the effect of another basic rule, which is that the rebate cannot exceed the tax otherwise payable by the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> With those introductory remarks, I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is twofold. Firstly, it extends the Government's assistance schemes relating to phosphate and nitrogenous fertilizers for a further three year period until 30 June 1985. Secondly, it widens the scope of the phosphate fertilizer scheme to provide for the payment of a subsidy on both locally produced and imported fertilizers. </PARA>
<PARA> The original fertilizer schemes were introduced in the mid- 1960's to stimulate increased use of fertilizers as a means of expanding agricultural production. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) recently submitted to the Government its report on the question of whether assistance should continue to be provided for the consumption of nitrogenous and phosphate fertilizers after 30 June 1982 when current assistance arrangements are due to expire. </PARA>
<PARA> Following examination of this report, the Government decided to accept the IAC' s recommendation that the current schemes be extended for a further three years. However, it has been decided to defer a decision on a further recommendation of the IAC that the assistance should be terminated after 30 June 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to widen the scope of the phosphate fertilizer scheme were made in the other place on 5 May 1982. This extension to cover imports will ensure that farmers have adequate access to fertilizers at competitive prices.</PARA>
<PARA> The subsidy on imported phosphate fertilizers will be payable on those fertilizers which are imported between 1 July 1982 and 30 June 1985 and sold for use, or used by the importer, in Australia as a fertilizer or are used by the importer in the production of a fertilizer mixture for use in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has considered the situation of Australian fertilizer manufacturers who receive a measure of protection from the current arrangements. In this regard, the Government accepted the IAC's view that the payment of a subsidy on imported phosphatic fertilizers would not be likely to lead to a significant reduction in the local manufacture of these fertilizers.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian manufacturers at present produce virtually all of Australia's phosphatic fertilizer requirements. The IAC found that domestic production is efficient in that output is generally competitive at world prices. The IAC also considered that single strength superphosphate produced in Australia has a significant price advantage over potential imports. </PARA>
<PARA> For the next three years, assistance will continue to be paid at current rates These are $20 per tonne of contained nitrogen for nitrogenous fertilizers and $ 12 per tonne of single strength superphosphate or $138 per tonne on the available phosphorous content of other phosphatic fertilizers. </PARA>
<PARA> The subsidy schemes are estimated to involve a relatively constant annual budgetary outlay of from $60m to $65m. </PARA>

<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a further payment of $A8,965,000.00 to be paid initially in the form of promissory notes, to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). As honourable senators will know Australia was one of the founding members of the Fund, which commenced operations in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary objective of the Fund is to help increase agricultural production in developing countries. In addition, its activities are focussed on the poorest nations and the poorest sections of rural populations. The initial capital resources of the Fund totalled $US1 billion to which Category I members, the OECD countries, and Category II members, the OPEC countries, contributed, with nominal amounts being contributed by Category III members, the developing countries. These initial resources have been fully committed in the Fund's first four years of operation. A replenishment of the Fund is therefore necessary to enable IFAD to continue its lending program. Although commitments from donors are urgently required to enable the Fund to approve existing and new loan proposals through to 1984, no draw-down of the new resources will occur for some time. Australia will not in fact incur any expenditure under this replenishment in the 1981-82 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Negotiations as to the overall replenishment level, to be recommended to concerned governments, commenced early in 1980. After prolonged inter-category and extra-category discussions a target of $US1.1 bilion was finally agreed on at the fifth Governing Council session in January 1982. Of this target Category I countries agreed to contribute up to $US620m and Category II countries up to $ US450m. In order for Category I countries to move beyond the earlier category target of $US595m, five countries have pledged additional contributions. Australia is technically regarded as one of these countries by virtue of the Government's decision to contribute its share of 1.74 per cent of up to $US600m, which is $US10.44m, equivalent at the ruling exchange rate to a contribution of $A8,965,000.00. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the International Fund for Agricultural Development plays an important role in the promotion of increased food production in developing countries. The Fund accords with one of our chief aid priorities in providing the impetus and wherewithal for developing countries to help themselves achieve self-reliance in food production. IFAD plays an important role in promoting long-term food security in developing countries through its focus on projects in the agricultural sector. These projects cover not only increasing production but also give specific attention to the poorest groups, taking into account distribution and availability which are key aspects of developing countries' overall food security. The countries and regions in which IFAD is concentrating its assistance are precisely those in which the major problems of food insecurity are most acute. Australia sees the concentration of effort on food security matters as a particularly productive avenue for achieving progress in the North-South dialogue at present. As a major primary producing country with considerable agricultural expertise it is especially appropriate that Australia should play an active role in an organisation such as IFAD. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is both in Australia's national interest and in the interest of the international community as a whole that we should continue to support the International Fund for Agricultural Development by contributing $A8,965,000.00 to the replenishment of the Fund. This amount represents essentially continuation of Australia's overall share in the Fund. I hope that other countries especially the larger donors, will act promptly to lodge their agreed contributions, to enable IFAD to continue its important work in improving the lives of millions of poor people. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the income tax law in two respects. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the Bill will make further amendments to the secrecy provisions of the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are supplementary to those proposed in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 by which certain royal commissions, the Attorney-General and the Australian Federal Police will be permitted to be supplied with taxation information in special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The second feature of the Bill is the provision of an exemption from tax for income derived by a company-to be called the Australian Wool Testing Authority Limited-that is being formed to take over the Australian Wool Testing Authority as a going concern and to continue the functions of the authority. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the details of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Disclosure of Taxation Information to Certain Royal Commissions</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the amendments proposed by this Bill to section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act are designed to limit further the circumstances in which a royal commission may communicate confidential taxation information to the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators know, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 proposes that a royal commission which receives information from the Commissioner of Taxation may disclose that information to the Attorney-General where it appears from the information that a law of the Commonwealth has been breached. </PARA>
<PARA> By the amendments proposed in the present Bill a royal commission will not be permitted to communicate taxation information to the Attorney-General unless it is of the opinion that the information indicates that a person may have committed an offence against a Commonwealth Act which carries a penalty of 6 months or more imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> This qualification to the measures follows the raising of certain matters during the course of debate in another place on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 and is made in recognition of acceptance by the Government of a view put forward by the Opposition that only in cases of some gravity should confidential tax information be capable of being passed to the Attorney-General and the police. </PARA>
<PARA> As this tighter restriction modifies measures contained in the Income Tax Assessment Bill (No. 2), the proposed new commencement provisions will mean that the change will take effect coincidentally with the taking effect of those measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Wool Testing Authority Limited</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators would be aware that the existing wool testing authority is a body corporate established under the Wool Industry Act and that its income is exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the review of Commonwealth functions carried out last year, the Government decided to transfer the authority to the private sector and legislation authorising the transfer was subsequently passed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the legislation now proposed is to provide an exemption from income tax for the new private sector company-the Australian Wool Testing Authority Limited-the members of which will be drawn mainly from bodies representative of the various sectors of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the exemption from income tax provided by the Bill will be limited to income derived by the company from carrying out functions of the kind that the Wool Testing Authority is authorised to carry out. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the exemption will apply to income derived on or after 1 July 1982 from the testing of wool and other fibres and their products, and from the issuing of certificates and the making of reports on such tests. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption will correspondingly apply to income derived by the company from the investment of surplus income from its testing activities or of funds that are to be used in or in connection with its testing operations. </PARA>
<PARA> An explanatory memorandum on the Bill is being made available to honourable senators, and I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this legislation is to give effect to the Government's decisions on two significant recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Parliaments Appropriations and Staffing and, related to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration regarding the promotions and transfer procedures in the Public Service, amendments concerning the requirement to give reports to officers who are aggrieved by decisions made in relation to promotions, transfers and temporary performance of higher duties. The Bill also includes certain other amendments to the Public Service Act 1922 and other legislation, to which I refer later in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 the Royal Commission made a number of recommendations to improve the promotion and transfer processes within the Public Service. The recommendations were examined extensively by the Public Service Board, following consultations with the Joint Council, a statutory consultative body chaired by the Public Service Board, and including representatives of departments and peak union councils. This Bill gives effect to the Government's decisions on those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed new promotion arrangements will revise procedures which were introduced in 1946. The Government believes that it is time for the introduction of new promotion procedures which are designed to meet the contempary needs of the Service, but will continue to uphold, and indeed strengthen, the tradition of a Public Service based on merit for appointment and promotion. The Bill establishes relative efficiency as the sole criterion for promotion in the Australian Public Service by repealing all references to seniority. Honourable senators will appreciate that, besides providing an equitable basis for the advancement of officers, this change is an important manifestation of the primary purpose of the promotion process, namely, to advance the efficient operation of the service. It will remove the last vestige of credibility from the mistaken view that advancement of officers under the Public Service Act is determined by length of service. The Bill introduces revised arrangements which will enhance the efficiency of the Public Service. In this connection I draw the attention of honourable senators to the provisions relating to the advertising of vacancies and the appointment by the Governor-General of chairmen and promotions appeal committees for fixed terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The promotion process is an important factor in the efficiency and economy of the Public Service. Procedures for the promotion of officers therefore must be devised to make the most effective practicable contribution to the efficient functioning of the Service. The Bill seeks to foster that objective. The proposed section 50B defines the sole criterion for promotion as the relative efficiency of officers available for promotion. That section requires regard to be paid to the capacity, work performance, experience, qualifications and personal qualities of the officer. In some cases it is desirable that greater weight be given to one or another of these factors and sub-section 50B (3) authorises the Board to so direct. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-section 33 (2) is directed to timeliness in the filling of vacant positions . This provision allows the procedures to be initiated as soon as a vacancy is forseen and for the completion of all formal steps-that is advertising, selection and appeal processes-to be taken in anticipation of the vacancy arising from, say, the age retirement of an officer. The amendment provisions, of course, bring that staffing action into effect only when the vacancy actually arises. Section 50L provides the permanent head with more flexibility in allocating his resources within his department. The section authorises the permanent head to rotate officers between positions. It is important that the authority of the permanent head should be clear in order that he can best utilise the skills and abilities of officers available within the department to meet the changing needs and shifts of emphasis in the activities of the department. </PARA>
<PARA> The promotion appeals system is an integral part of the promotion process. It is inevitable that such a system is a source of delay in filling positions by promotion and it has been much criticised for that reason. Nonetheless, the Government believes that, in the interests of strengthening the efficiency of the Public Service an appeal system is necessary. The Government believes the present system, as it has operated in the past, with promotions appeal committees comprising an independent chairman, a departmental nominee and a staff association nominee is appropriate. It may not be generally realised that some 70,000 appeals were lodged in 1979 and approximately 35,000 were lodged in 1980, and the promotions appeal committee arrangements have on the whole dealt with that volume expeditiously. This has been possible through established procedures not being overburdened by formality and by the committees avoiding procedures which place appellants in the unwanted role of adversaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent court decisions appear to indicate that, as the Public Service Act is presently worded, the promotions appeal system should be conducted within an adversary framework and require a greater degree of legal formality than has in practice applied, or is necessary or desirable, to see that an appellant's case is fairly and fully heard and determined. The Government's view is that the objective of the appeals system-giving to public servants the opportunity to state their case for promotion in competition with others, whilst facilitating the promotion of the most efficient officers in the interests of overall Public Service efficiency-will be best served by amending the Public Service Act to establish beyond doubt that promotions appeal committees can deal with the appeals coming before them on a basis which gives to appellants a full and fair opportunity to put their own cases for promotion and to answer any matter adverse to their interests before the committee without an undue emphasis on legal formalities or the creation of an adversary framework. Section 50D of the Bill seeks to achieve this. It will permit promotions appeal committees to develop procedures to ensure fairness in determining appeals while paying regard to desirable personnel practice, and to the practicalities and costs of handling the very large volume of appeals made annually. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for officers who are aggrieved by decisions made in relation to promotions, transfers and temporary performance of higher duties to be given reports about those decisions. These amendments are contained in the proposed sections 53L to 53N and the transitional provisions in the proposed sections 79 to 81. These provisions reflect the Government's recognition of the recent developments in administrative law; however, they are quite distinct from the proposed amendments to the promotions appeal arrangements in proposed section 50D. The provisions of that section deal with the procedures which are to apply to the hearing of an appeal by a promotions appeal committee. The provisions to be introduced by sections 53L to 53N, deal with the requirement to give an explanation, on request, of decisions by promotions appeal committees. Each provision is the complement of the other but they apply to different aspects of the decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a clearly stated policy that persons affected by decisions made under statute should have the right to seek a statement of reasons. The proposed sections 53L to 53N introduce provisions to give effect to this policy in terms which are specifically tailored to the needs and requirements of the Public Service promotions process. They permit a person aggrieved by a promotion decision, being decisions to transfer, promote or direct an oficer to perform temporarily the duties of an office and the associated decisions of appeal committees, to request a statement which explains the basis for that decision. This statement will enable the officer to understand why the decision was made and will provide a proper basis for him to consider whether that decision should be further challenged. The provision will require that the statement in relation to a decision to promote another officer must contain a copy of the relevant duty statement, the criteria that were used in selecting the successful person, the procedures which followed and an assessment of the officer seeking the statement against the criteria which were used. These specific requirements will be in substitution for the more general requirements of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed provisions are intended to strike a balance between conflicting elements which arise in the promotion process. There is a need to consider the privacy of those who were applicants for promotion. It is an important element of personnel management that individual staff members should have information on themselves protected from unwarranted disclosure. On the other hand, there is the right of an officer to know and understand decisions which have been made about him or her. The proposed amendments provide, however, for the continuation of the application of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act in all other respects and, in addition, provide that statements under these provisions will be handled in the same manner as statements under section 13 of that Act so that, firstly, reports can be the basis of legal action under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, secondly, reports can be reviewed by a Federal Court as to their adequacy, and, thirdly, an officer refused a report on the basis that he or she is not entitled to it can seek a review by a Federal Court. Time limits on the making of requests and the supplying of reports are similar to those in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act as are other technical provisions relating to the exercise of decisions by delegates. In the light of the special provisions that will be made in the Public Service Act, the relevant decisions defined in the proposed section 53L will be exempted from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 79 to 81 are transitional provisions which will apply similar requirements to those in the proposed section 53L to decisions made under the Principal Act before the amendments made by this Bill are proclaimed to come into operation. There have been consultations on the proposals for reporting on reasons for decisions with representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Council of Professional Associations. The amended provisions now to be introduced include some of the proposals made by these representatives although the Government was unable to accept all the proposals made. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important change made by the Bill is to remove the divisional structure of the Public Service, as was recommended by the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. Since 1901 positions and officers have been grouped into four divisions. Significantly, the present structure requires different levels of educational qualification and skills for admission to the Third Division and Fourth Division. The original design envisaged a small number of separate salary structures: the First Division for permanent heads and like officers; the Second Division for senior executives; the Third Division for clerical and professional positions; and the Fourth Divisions for the remaining officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the occupational groups which have been introduced in the structure of the Service in recent years do not sit well within the divisional framework and it has been necessary to develop complicated dual divisional arrangements. Further, whereas all Third Division officers were once paid in accordance with a uniform scale of salaries, there are now more than 60 separate pay groupings, many of them based on special training or qualifications. Consequently, the divisional structure has become increasingly anachronistic. Clause 15 repeals those sections of the Act providing for the divisional structure. The proposed arrangements will enable the design of occupational groupings to be tailored more readily to the operational requirements of the Public Service. They will help to achieve better utilisation of the manpower resources of the Service. Staff in the Public Service will continue to be employed within separate occupational groups, each with its own salary structure and appropriate qualification requirements, but the label of Fourth, Third or Second Division will no longer apply. Movement within or between occupational groups will, as now, depend on efficiency and, where relevant, qualifications. Consequent upon the removal of the divisional structure the provisions of the Act relating to recruitment have been amended. The new provision retains the central role of the Public Service Board to ensure that the Commonwealth continues to be served by public servants who are selected according to merit in open competition and not by processes based on patronage or nepotism. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments to the Public Service Act are more limited in their effect . The first relates to the amendment to that part of the Public Service Act covering the staffing of the parliamentary departments. These amendments reflect the Government's decisions on the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing. Briefly, the changes will enhance the autonomy of the parliamentary departments by empowering the Presiding Officers to create or abolish offices and to promote officers. The present provisions of the Public Service Act require these matters to be submitted to the Governor-General in Council for approval. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 44 of the Bill inserts a new section 64, which updates the debt recovery scheme which enables creditors to obtain payments from debtors employed by the Australian Public Service by means of attachment of their salaries. The revised scheme introduces an administration fee payable by the creditor to offset the costs incurred by the Commonwealth in arranging collection of the debt. The amendments will bring arrangements for the recovery of debts from public servants more closely in line with normal practices in the community. Clauses 53 and 58 of the Bill include amendments which will provide that the agreement of the State Premier must be obtained where it is proposed to invoke the mobility provisions of Part IV of the Public Service Act in relation to State employment. Part IV of the Act specifies the rights of staff of the Service who transfer to other public employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments are also made to the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976. In the normal course, severance payments upon retrenchment are more favourable than those made upon resignation. The effect of these amendments will, upon certification of the Board, debar from entitlement to retrenchment benefits which would otherwise accrue, an employee of the Commonwealth covered by these Acts who is retrenched after declining an offer of suitable alternative Commonwealth employment. The Government does no consider that in this situation the person should be entitled to retrenchment benefits when it is in fact his or her own decison to sever his or her employment relationship with the Commonwealth when suitable employment within the Public Service is available. </PARA>
<PARA> The third group of amendments insert a new section 39 into the Act which will enable dual appointments of permanent heads. By virtue of this provision a person who is already a permanent head can be appointed to hold simultaneously another office of permanent head. A person holding two offices of permanent head will be paid only salary and allowances appropriate to the original office. Clause 82 is a transitional provision which will enable dual appointment to occur prior to the revised arrangements for the appointment of permanent heads being proclaimed to come into operation. The Government considers that such flexibility is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining provisions in the Act are of three types. The first deals with changes to the technical arrangements for appointment of acting permanent heads and other changes of a similar kind which experience indicates will lead to improvements in the administration of the Service. The second, including the changes made to the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act, is consequential on the changes made to the promotion process and the abolition of divisions within the Service. The rest are formal amendments to adjust references in other legislation. The Government believes that the changes introduced in this Bill have significant benefits for the efficiency of the Service. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AIR ACCIDENTS (COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT LIABILITY) AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill complements the Civil Aviation (Carriers Liability) Amendment Bill 1982 which I have just introduced into the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Act 1963 is a companion statute to the Civil Aviation (Carriers Liability) Act 1959. It applies to persons travelling as passengers in aircraft operated by the Commonwealth and to passengers on aircraft not so operated who are travelling as Commonwealth employees, or other persons whose cost of travel is met by the Commonwealth or who are travelling for the purposes of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill increases from $45,000 to $100,000 the limit of liability of the Commonwealth in respect of personal injury or death arising from an air accident . This is consistent with the limits proposed in the Civil Aviation (Carriers Liability) Amendment Bill 1982 which I have just introduced. By this Bill, the Commonwealth will meet the same conditions of liability in respect of air accidents as it imposes on commercial airline and charter operators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also extends the application of the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Act 1963 to certain classes of persons currently without a cause of action under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of 'passenger' has been broadened to cover aircrew and airborne workers such as aerial photographers, instrument fitters etc. This extension of coverage is based on the Governments view that there is normally a commonality of employment between aircrew airborne workers and passengers carried in aircraft on Commonwealth sponsored flights to which the legislation applies. Under the new criteria all Commonwealth employees killed or injured in aircraft accidents on such flights will have a similar cause of action against the Commonwealth for damages. The provision does not however apply to aircrew of an authority or corporation undertaking commercial transport operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a provision whereby persons with concurrent repatriation pension rights arising from an air accident during peace-time service will no longer be debarred from claiming damages under the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Act 1963. In 1973, repatriation entitlement was extended to cover peace-time defence service and the exclusion provisions of the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Act 1963 thereupon debarred a cause of action against the Commonwealth for damages. The modification of the exclusion provisions now proposed will mean that where concurrent entitlement to a Repatriation pension arises during peace-time service, a member of the Defence Force or his dependants will now also have a cause of action under the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Act 1963. Any damages awarded as the result of a claim will be taken into account to reduce the concurrent Repatriation pension so as to avoid any ''double benefit'' accruing in respect of the one accident. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, liability under the Principal Act is proposed to be adjusted in future by reference to the limit of liability applicable under section 31 (1) of the Civil Aviation (Carriers Liability) Act 1959 as proposed to be amended by the Civil Aviation (Carriers Liability) Amendments Bill 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>CIVIL AVIATION (CARRIERS' LIABILITY) AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend part four of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act to accord with the Government's decision to increase the liability limits applying to domestic and non-convention international air carriage and to make provision for the Act to cover the new air service licence classifications that are to be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act gives force of law in Australia to the Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol which limit the extent of airlines' liabilities in respect of damages arising from carriage on international flights . More specifically, Part IV of the Act applies similiar conditions to domestic airline and charter operations in Australia and to non-convention international carriage. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Part IV of the Act the liability of domestic and non-convention international carriers for death or injury to passengers, or damage to baggage, is limited. Passengers or their relatives do not need to prove negligence on the part of the operator. The injured party is required to prove the amount of damages being claimed and the amount awarded is then limited by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been concerned particularly at the adequacy of domestic liability levels which were last reviewed in 1976. The 1976 amendments reflected the levels that generally applied to international operations. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the liability limits provided by the Warsaw Convention and associated instruments are expressed in terms of gold francs, the value of which has fluctuated considerably in recent years with movements in the price of gold. To rectify this situation, an international conference in Montreal in 1975 sought to introduce new protocols which express the limits in IMF special drawing rights. However, these protocols have yet to come into force and the government is currently examining possible interim arrangements regarding limits on airline liability for international carriage until such time as the protocols take effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also concerned with the broader question of compulsory insurance for the domestic carriers liability to passengers. This matter is presently under consideration in joint Commonwealth/State government forums. The question of an even broader third party compulsory insurance scheme is also of concern and is however a much more complex issue for which consideration will be required by both the Commonwealth and the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the specific provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 2 of the Bill makes provision for the act to commence operation on a date to be proclaimed. In order that the operators may be given sufficient notice to effect any necessary insurance arrangements the proclamation date will be a short while after the Bill's passage through Parliament. Provision also exists to make a separate proclamation for Clause 3 to coincide with the commencment of new air service licensing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Later this year, it is proposed to introduce regulations under the Air Navigation Act to provide for new air service licence categories. In particular, commuter and cargo operations will receive clear acknowledgement of their increasingly important role in the provision of aviation services by introducing new licence categories-the supplementary airline licence and licences for cargo only operators. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3 extends the definitions of airline licence and charter licence in section 26 of the principal Act so that carriage by operators under the proposed new air service licence classifications will continue to be covered by the provisions of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill amends part four of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 to increase the level of liability for death or injury to passengers from $45,000 to $100,000. Similar increases apply for the liability limits for damage to baggage. For registered baggage the limit will be increased from $300 to $900. For baggage in the passengers' own care the increase will be from $30 to $90. Provision is also made for these limits to be amended by regulation in future. This will facilitate introduction of what are essentially machinery amendments and allow a more regular review of the liability limits that apply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I am advised that, under section 53 of the Constitution, Bills imposing fees for licences are not Bills imposing taxation and are therefore amendable by the Senate and not subject to debate on the first reading. The Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill defines the fees to be imposed as taxes and is drafted in the form of a Bill imposing taxation with the collection and assessment provisions in a separate Bill. It is presumed that this has been done to avoid the possibility that, because the fees are relatively high, they could be held by the High Court to be a form of taxation. Because of that possibility we have decided that it should be assumed they are a form of taxation. The Attorney- General's Department has advised that the Bill gives effect to the Government's decision to impose the fees as taxes and confirmation has been received from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that the Bill is in fact a taxing measure. It is clear from the second reading speech that this is a taxing measure. In view of those facts it seems appropriate that the Bill be dealt with in this way .</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak to this motion and ask a question of the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume). All he has done is move that the Senate meet at 10 a.m. He has not said for how long it will meet or whether we are going to have a lunch break. This matter was the subject of a very long and protracted debate in this chamber recently when the Standing Orders were amended so that the Senate could sit on Thursdays without any lunch break. I was told then when I objected that consultations had been held with the Hansard staff and particularly with those people who prepare the meals and serve them in the dining room. I have since learned that those people have been put to some inconvenience. I want to know now from the Minister whether, before moving this motion, consultation in fact took place, and whether embodied in this motion is the fact that the Senate will not rise for a luncheon break tomorrow or whether we will sit straight through from 10 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock at night. If that is the case I want to place on the record my objection to the proposal that we do not have a lunch break.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During my working life I have fought tooth and nail for the conditions of working people, that is, for them to have a lunch break. If we are going to set a precedent in this Parliament like that which we set several weeks ago whereby we deny the people who work in this place a proper lunch break and if we are going to compound that argument tomorrow by again denying them a lunch break, I think that is the thin edge of the wedge. The next thing we will find is governments going into the arbitration court and suggesting that as members of parliament are prepared to forgo their lunch break and dinner break so should the people in the work force. Governments will be suggesting that the people on the factory floor, the people working in agriculture and people in shearing sheds can get by without having a lunch break and that they can start at, say, 10 o'clock in the morning on a Thursday and work through until 11 o'clock at night with no break at all. If that is the proposal the Minister is putting before the chamber I want to place on record my complete disagreement with it. As I said earlier, I think it is the thin edge of the wedge. We are breaking down conditions. We on this side of this chamber should not be a party to it. </PARA>

I remember visiting the House of Commons and finding this to be a standard procedure. In addition, tomorrow we are in the situation in which, because the House of Representatives is not sitting, there will be no meeting of the Australian Labor Party Caucus, which normally occurs on Wednesday mornings, and there will be no meeting of the joint Government parties, which normally occurs on Wednesday mornings. It is possible, therefore, to envisage an earlier start without interfering with what are otherwise set arrangements.

However, in discussions with the Government in which it sought additional time, we agreed that probably the best way that could be achieved would be by working on Wednesday morning. Therefore, to accommodate the Government, I think the general agreement was that we should seek that additional time on the Wednesday, which is the least inconvenient time that the Senate is able to meet. I think those arrangements were made in good faith so that that additional time could be made available for the Government to bring on its legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last time we were debating these Bills I made a range of points detailing the opposition of the Australian Democrats to the imposition of fees on second and higher degrees. I do not propose to repeat all of those tonight, although it seems that unfortunately time will again prevent us from going to a vote on this issue. I briefly recap: The major point I made last time was in relation to the Government's proposition that the funding of higher education may become more the responsibility of students and others in the community, than just that of the Government. I suggested that it was not possible for the Government to take such a stance unless it could table either in the Senate or in the House of Representatives some guarantee from others that they would be willing to pick up that cost which the Government planned to vacate. If this cannot be done I believe that, given our history of the support of tertiary education coming almost totally from government, any government in Australia would be in dereliction of its responsibilities not only to the present but also to the future of this country in jeopardising our tertiary education institutions and students. I have also said elsewhere that it is our belief that the Government is opting for future without shock. That is easily done by ignoring the future and by being shocked only by the present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Until today I thought I had a fairly detailed understanding of the problems of a range of institutions. However, upon representations from a chief administrator of an institution in Victoria I discovered that at that institution a person is teaching a course in metal work without having access to any of the machinery used in private industry. The machinery used in private industry is fully computerised and the machinery which people in that institution have to deal with is not computerised. We get to the point of believing that if we put money into a drag line in a mining enterprise, that is investment; if we build a railway line, that is investment; but if we educate the people to have the skills necessary to operate within those areas, it is a cost. That is absolutely absurd. Indeed we believe that funding for education should be seen totally within the framework of an investment in our own citizens and in their future and in the future of the country. Therefore let us cease talking, as we do so often, about the high cost of education. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government in not proposing to increase or decrease the actual amount of money spent on education but to impose a fee on students who have already been the products of an education system in this country which, at the primary, secondary and indeed tertiary level, has cost them a great deal of money. The funds provided by the Government to those institutions have also been fairly substantial. What we are seeking to do now is to introduce a disincentive for students who have got to the top of that education system to achieve second and higher degrees. That is to fly in the face of all predictions about what we need in this country. We need every bit of top skilled labour we can get. We need every one of our citizens who in any way shows any aptitude to take advantage of second and higher degrees. That is what we need in every case, and yet it is suggested that we should introduce a disincentive. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed the Democrats go further and suggest that in a sense we should look in the opposite direction and should even look at paying people to do those second and higher degrees, because that is how desperately we need them, in the same way we pay for the introduction of certain goods in this country-for example motor cars and certain goods such as clothing and footwear-because the Government maintains the need to do so. In that way we also ought to pay people to produce certain types of skills. There is a direct analogy and yet the Government is again suggesting some rather penny pinching proposition. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Part of the document was written by the Honourable Mr Justice Michael Kirby. It is entitled 'Towards the Third Millennium' and is a response to three other distinguished Australians who set out a challenge to Australia. In the paragraph entitled 'Higher Education' Mr Justice Kirby states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> OECD figures show that Australia's levels of education are amongst the lowest in the Western world. Whereas at the age of 17 years more than 90 per cent of Japanese are still at school and more that 80 per cent of the United States, in Australia, we can barely muster 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that rather than bring into the Senate Bills which seek to introduce disincentives, the Government ought to bring forward some far-reaching , innovative educational policies which suggest how we might come to grips with the obvious problems, some of which I detailed before. I refer again to the problem of increasing the involvement of lower income groups in our tertiary institutions; the problem of increasing the total amount of involvement-in other words, the type of proposition to which I referred in the quotation of Mr Justice Kirby; and the problem of attempting to look at the manpower requirements of this country well after the year 2000 and at what type of contribution our tertiary institutions will make to that, as well as what range of top class skills we will need at that time. We have problems in regard to a whole range of minority groups involved in tertiary education and even in regard to one of the majority groups, that of women. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the most needed policy innovation that the Federal Government ought to be bringing forward concerns what particular skills we will need for the Government's projected new industries. I do not want to be so cynical as to suggest that the Government has not even thought about the projected new industries for this country. Let us take it that it has thought about the projected new industries for this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, even including nuclear power. What policies does the Government have in terms of fostering those skills in order to have them in place in the time required? The reason I raise this question is that time and again major developments are touted around in this country but when they actually come on stream we have to go outside Australia to get the skills needed while our citizens remain unemployed. That happens time and again in this country. Our own citizens are in the dole queues while we scour the rest of the world for skills we need for these developments. These developments do not just happen; in some cases they have a 15-year time lag. But even if the time lag is as close as four years, we could still have these skills in place.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is an example in my State of Queensland. I refer to the aluminium industry development outside Bundaberg. I was told that this would create a whole lot of employment in the area. However, I found out that this employment was to be in the unskilled labour force. When I asked where the skilled labour force would come from I was told that it would come from the same place as the rest of the skilled labour force comes from-overseas. Our failure to put into place policies that enable us to give the citizens of Australia the chance to operate their own industries at the top level is an indictment not only of this Government but also of previous governments. Because I am talking about second and higher degrees, I am talking about that level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Lastly, I refer to new industries. New industries do not come from the technical area, no matter how much needs to be done in that area. Certainly I do not decry what the Government has done in this field; indeed, I am on record as supporting wholeheartedly the Government's innovations in the field of technical education. But technical education will provide us with the top innovators for new industries. In the communications field and in the technology and biotechnology areas the innovators, the people at the forefront, are the highest educated people in the land. We are not talking about an attempt to establish an elitist situation. We are talking about the very guts of an economic policy. We have to get in place our people and our industries or else we will be looking down the barrel of a gun. That time will come when our current industries run out of steam. They are doing so. Everybody must admit-indeed, the Government admits it because it is constantly propping up our manufacturing industries-that our manufacturing industries are running into the end of their useful life in terms of the economy. We have to put in place new ones. They must be on the drawing boards and we must have people to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats see this Bill as an incredibly short-sighted Bill-an attempt to put into place a disincentive at the very time that we should be putting in place an incentive. We do not see it in terms of whether it is good for people's souls or in terms of any other types of proposition floating around , including the user-pay philosophy. It is consistent with the user-pay philosophy that the community ultimately uses people in higher education. The Minister for Education, who is at the table, must know from his own situation that the skills for which he worked hard and which were provided to him in part by the Government were used for the benefit of the community. Such people receive a reimbursement for their labours. As a free enterprise government I am quite sure that the Government does not wish that such people not receive a reimbursement commensurate with the level of effort and the level of their skills. </PARA>
<PARA> But, ultimately, it comes down to the fact that such people pay in their taxes for their education. They are the people who everybody in this country will have to rely on in future years for their incomes and for their pensions. Those people will provide the backbone for Australia well into the year 2000. Let us support them now and do away with this penny pinching and what Senator Chipp would call balance sheet mentality and look at the educational, social and economic consequence of such a move. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it three Bills which seek to introduce for a minority of tertiary students fees payable by them for a proportion of the cost of their education. The pessimistic outlook that has been described by the Australian Democrats spokesman, Senator Macklin, is not one that I share. I believe that the perspective out of which these Bills arose in the review of Commonwealth functions, a task carried out by senior Ministers of this Government in every area of government activity, has a quite different explanation. The first question that arises concerns access. It was almost entirely on this matter that these Bills were opposed by the Opposition. The question of access was debated fully last October when these Bills were first introduced and were passed by the House of Representatives but failed narrowly here in the Senate. The debate this month has added very little to the question of access.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Essentially the question is in two parts. Are low income students denied access by this partial reintroduction of fees? I believe that the answer is no. For a start, the fees will apply to only a small proportion of tertiary students, the proportion who have already gained a degree and who are going on to some kind of postgraduate study. Of those postgraduate students, the fees will apply only to a proportion-those in I would call the fourth category. The first category comprises those who have shown most talent in their earlier studies and are successful in gaining Commonwealth postgraduate awards, the second category comprises those students successful in gaining university research grants, and the third category comprises those who are successful in gaining research grants from industry and other private benefaction. It is only the fourth category- those who have missed out already on the grounds of academic merit in the three earlier categories, including some persons close to being perpetual postgraduate students-who will be required to pay a fee, which will be less than one-fifth of the recurrent cost of the fees. I believe that it is not a matter of denying students access to study. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I ventilate what I regard as the inadequate operations of the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra who are responsible for making decisions relating to permanent residents who need to have recourse to a certificate of identity in lieu of an Australian passport. The story which I am about to relate commenced on Monday of this week when a Mrs Virginia Evanian came to my office with her 16-year-old daughter. Mrs Evanian has Australian citizenship and, of course, an Australian passport. She has two young children who were born in Australia and who are going with her to the United States of America for one month. The father is not going. He is a permanent resident. The daughter of 16 years was in the difficult position of having come to Australia from the Middle Eastern country of Iraq when she was one year old. I took the view that this 16-year old girl obviously had to have some travel documentation. I certainly was not unmindful of the fact that there might be difficulties in this regard because she was a former Iraqi national. Although there are no difficulties in the 16-year-old girl obtaining a re-entry visa from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Iraqi Government took the point of view that as the girl had left the country 15 years previously and on every indication she would ultimately become an Australian citizen, it was not interested in the matter. That is the decision of that Government and I do not cavil at it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I immediately conferred with the passport office of the Department in the Commonwealth Government Centre in Chifley Square, Sydney. I wish to place on record that I found the staff of that section, from the most senior officer to the most junior, to be extremely competent. Obviously this was a situation where a decision had to be made in Canberra. The whole thrust of my argument relates to the ineptitude of the people with whom I had to deal. I say at the outset that the staff dealing with passports in Sydney and Melbourne have a constant daily clamour from people for Australian passports. These people work under extreme pressures. I admire their self-control. They are always courteous to me and I always receive prompt attention. When senior officers in Sydney said that this was a decision to be made in Canberra, I agreed. I knew without being told by certain people in Canberra that when a person seeks asylum in Australia and he or she might have to go overseas for some reason we issue that person with some documentation. </PARA>
<PARA> What completely appalled me when I spoke to people whom I regard as being in the middle echelon of the section of the Department dealing with passport control in Canberra was that I got what I considered could at the least be called studied indifference. They gave me a long story about how this girl had lived in Australia for 15 years and, therefore, technically she was not somebody who was seeking political asylum. I knew that. At the end of a five minute fruitless telephone conversation, which was not helped when the person to whom I was talking appeared to be talking to someone else in the room and saying, 'Tell him this', or 'Tell him that', all I got was a lot of negatives. I am a member of Estimates Committee D. I think I and my colleagues on that Committee have a fair idea of how passport control operates. The thing which I resented-I said so very forcibly at the end of my telephone conversation-was that I did not want arguments as to why I could not get this visa. I wanted reasons why I should be able to get it. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee, made a statement last week in the House of Representatives. We now have six months within which to digest the information contained in that statement and we can assess the changes that have been made to the obtaining of Australian citizenship. In passing the Minister made reference to the numbers of people who have not exercised their rights to obtain Australian citizenship. We could have arguments to the effect that it was not the time to do it or that those people who have waited year after year and have never obtained citizenship panic and want citizenship as a prelude to the possession of an Australian passport.The girl is 16. In fact, she is still a high school student. I suppose when she is 18 she will make up her own mind what she will do. I resent the inability of the people in Canberra to give me a clearcut decision and say: 'We will issue the document.' If the girl wanted to go to the Middle East with the present turbulent conditions between Iran and Iraq, she could unwittingly be a pawn in a dispute. But she only wanted to go to the United States of America for a month. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle that the passport people in Sydney have said that no application has been made on behalf of the girl, Rita Evanian. There has not been any application because her family came to me for guidance. They realised she could not get an Australian passport. My criticism-I maintain the rage tonight-is that the people I spoke to in Canberra were completely indifferent to offering a solution. In fortification of my argument I have a telegram which I showed to Senator Baume before he left the chamber. It has been sent by the extremely competent State secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, Merv Malcolm. The union, of which the girl' s father is a member, demands immediate action. I do so because these people want to leave Australia and go to the United States within a week. I seek leave to have the telegram incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> We would appreciate any assistance you can give in obtaining a certificate of identity for the daughter of our member Mr E. Evanian stop she required the certificate to enable her to visit USA on a short holiday with her mother</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In making this plea tonight I expect, within the next 24 hours, somebody at the central office of the Department of Foreign Affairs to authorise the passport office in Sydney to issue Rita Evanian with a certificate of identity or some other form of documentation. It seems to me that the Department of Foreign Affairs is unaware of the facts which were given to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. While I ventilate this case here tonight-I am sure that ministerial intervention tomorrow will settle it satisfactorily-there must be hosts of similar cases. Whilst I would be the last to deny somebody with genuine credentials political asylum, if we have the facilities to issue certificates to such people we should be able to do so promptly in the case of a family whose members have been law abiding taxpayers for the whole 17 years that they have been in Australia. I raise this matter with some regret because I know you, Mr Deputy President, as a Minister in the Government in the years 1972 to 1975 will be aware that a man that you and I admired and a very effective Minister for Immigration, the Honourable Clyde Cameron and I, in my humble position as Chairman of the Immigration Advisory Council, resisted offers from the Department of Foreign Affairs to take over passport control. We lost the battle. The former member for Hindmarsh, if he is listening tonight, will know that his own sagacity was vindicated. The Department of Foreign Affairs should not have control of this matter; it should be given back to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I leave the matter on that note, confident that in 24 hours a signal will go to Sydney and justice will be given to these people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find myself in a very difficult position tonight, one that I have never been in before. I want to talk about what I believe to be a scandal within the Victorian branch of a Federal union. I have papers available to me which name names and which, I believe, verify the misappropriation of almost $10,000 from the union. I am well aware that proceedings in the Senate are privileged. I find it very difficult to know how I can make clear to the Senate the information which has been passed to me without naming names, although that is what I intend to try to do. I might add that it will become clear that members of the union concerned will be able to work out, and I suppose any journalist or any other people who wish to apply their minds to the matter would probably be able to work out, in due course, who the people are. But at least, by endeavouring to avoid naming names, those names will not be emblazoned across the daily media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Victorian branch of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union of Australia-the union which is commonly known as the liquor trades union- is another State branch of a Federal union in which the apathy of the rank and file unionist has allowed the socialist left and the communists to take control, to the detriment of the rank and file members. At least 10 of the 15 members of the committee of management of the Victorian branch are Communist Party or Socialist Left union officials, who appear to me to have conspired to cover up a scandal by one of their faction. But it is now too late, because the dogs are barking it around the John Curtin Hotel in Melbourne. As I have said, the scandal is the misappropriation of almost $10,000 from the Victorian branch of that union by a union staff member, and it is also the failure of the committee of management or any of its officers to refer the matter to the police, their failure to take adequate action to recover union funds, and their failure to take steps to ensure that the official concerned cannot get reappointed to a similar position-which in fact is what has now happened; in other words, he has been reappointed to a similar position in another union. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to verification of the misappropriation. The story concerns a person whom I will have to call Mr X, who seems to have a way with union officials as well as a way with union funds. He was involved in an earlier problem, back in 1976. An extract of what I believe to be the minutes, from which I will quote, discloses that some time prior to February 1980, Mr X apparently misappropriated from the Victorian branch of the liquor trades union some thousands of dollars of union funds. It would appear that when this was discovered arrangements were made for him to resign, and clearly it was intended that the knowledge of the theft of these funds would be kept within the union management. His letter of resignation came before the committee of management at its meeting on 13 February 1980. I quote from extracts of the minutes of that meeting. I trust that senators will realise that I am trying to read these extracts without referring to names, so that may account for some of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter of resignation was read, and then a person whom I believe is the State Secretary of the union spoke on reasons for the letter of resignation. Another person spoke on the resignee's service to the union and expressed the hope that the matter would be handled within the union, which is, as I say, what I believe, that clearly the knowledge of this theft was going to be kept within union management. In due course it was resolved that the resignation be accepted . There was then resolved that the trustees, the Treasurer and the Secretary meet with this gentleman 'in order to obtain a suitable solution to the problem' . I might add that I am informed that the trustees, the Treasurer and the Secretary were all of the same faction as the gentleman concerned, and in fact the Secretary had appointed this gentleman to his position. It will be noticed that there is no police action. There is no suggestion of referring the matter to the police. The Treasurer was present. There is no statement by the Treasurer of what the amount of the misappropriation was. In fact, there is nothing within the minutes which really explains what it is all about other than that the matter was explained to the committee of management. It is quite clear, reading from those minutes, that at that stage it was intended to keep the matter totally enclosed within the committee of management and not to allow this information to become public in any way. What is important from those minutes is that a minority faction--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Button" NAMEID="4F4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will certainly do that. I make it clear that it is Senator Button who has required me to table these documents. The documents contain names . The tabling of the documents will make those names available to those who wish to have a look at the documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to what I believe to be an extract from the minutes of the committee of management for 6 May, nearly three months later. It is clear that by then some members of the committee of management had become concerned and a motion was carried stating:</PARA>
<PARA> That under rule 4A of the Federal and Branch Rules, ex organiser . . .--</PARA>
<PARA>The man has now resigned-</PARA>
<PARA>-be shown to have been disqualified from office and is also disqualified from holding future office in the Federation and this to be recorded in the minutes. Further, that the Secretary be instructed to take all actions necessary to recover all monies misappropriated and/or any other action deemed necessary to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that, in fact, the Treasurer whom I mentioned before spoke against the motion. I mention that because since then the Treasurer who took no action and who, in fact, spoke against the motion has now been appointed a trustee of this union. The motion was carried. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The next item on the agenda raised the matter of an unpaid account to the United Distillers Pty Ltd on behalf of the ex-member of the union. Apparently, he had got into the United Distillers for a sum of money. There was an interesting resolution:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the account from United Distillers on behalf of . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The ex-member--</PARA>
<PARA> be paid immediately--</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, union funds will be used now to pay his account-</PARA>
<PARA>and be added on to monies already owed. </PARA>
<PARA>In effect, what the union was deciding to do was to pay another of this bloke's bills and then say: 'Well, he already owes us so many thousands of dollars, what does it matter if we add a few hundred more?' I have no idea of what size the account was. Three months after the first time the matter was raised there had been no police action and no suggestion of the matter being referred to any authority. I have an extract of rule 4A-Disqualification for Office. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> No-one shall be eligible to nominate for or hold a Federal or State office:</PARA>
<PARA> who has admitted to, or has been found guilty in any court of law, of larceny, embezzlement or any other form of dishonesty in relation to the property or funds of this Union. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is a great pity that further action was not taken. It may very well have been that the current circumstances in relation to the employment of this person might have been avoided. That, of course, is another matter of great concern. The next day after that meeting of the committee of management there was a general meeting of the members of the Victorian branch of the union. I will again read from the minutes and delete the names. The minutes state:</PARA>
<PARA> Questions were asked about the misappropriation of money by . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Secretary reported that this figure was in deficit in the region of $9,565.00 and . . . was entitled to accruments of $7,000, unless otherwise decided as per Branch rule 41 (e) and 41A (f). </PARA>
<PARA>There is no explanation of how $7,000 was arrived at, but I presume it had something to do with long service leave or holiday entitlements. Clearly the implication is that there would be some sort of an offset unless the matter was otherwise decided. But it is also interesting to note that at that general meeting a financial report was presented. The financial report stated that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Balance Sheet for the 3 months ending February 29th, 1980 showed a deficit of $12,104.00. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words although the deficit by Mr X was alleged to be about $9,565 for some reason the balance sheet deficit was $12,104. After that, and notwithstanding the resolution that action be taken to endeavour to get back the union official's funds, there seems to be a deathly silence-until 2 September 1981-which is nearly 18 months later. Again I quote, with some variation, from an extract of the minutes of the Committee of Management on that day in which a question was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>if . . . is paying back the monies owed to the Union. The Secretary replied that he would be having discussions to ensure that this occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>Again there was no police action to bar Mr X. My information is that this gentleman has now become an officer of the Victorian branch of another union which is controlled by the left wing. I understand that he is now a delegate of that union to the Trades Hall Council. I would have thought that these matters would have been of great concern to Senator Button and any other Victorian senators, Liberal, Labor or Democrat. I have mentioned the factions that are involved. What has clearly happened is that this faction has endeavoured to cover up what is a major theft and hide if from the rank and file members of the branch of that union. </PARA>
<PARA> My purpose in exposing this matter this evening is quite frankly the hope that rank and file members of this union will begin to realise that apathy creates problems, and the committee of management of this union has problems. I hope that it sees its way clear to take action. I realise it is difficult to get to meetings at night when one would rather watch Don Lane or someone else but it is important for members of union movements to take an active interest in their union. I believe that the evidence which I have-I will table papers in the Senate tonight-fully justifies my raising the matter in the Senate. But I also say this: I intend to hand copies of what I believe to be copies of minutes of these meetings to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). I believe they are genuine. I welcome any investigation by the Australian Federal Police or, if the Attorney-General thinks it is a State matter, the State police or the Industrial Relations Bureau. </PARA>

I want to make only one or two comments. The first comment is that if criminal offences or other offences against the membership of a trade union have been committed and it is established that that is so, the Australian Labor Party does not condone or approve of it in any way and condemns it in much the same way as Senator Lewis has sought to condemn it, but not, I hope, by innuendo.

I am saying to Senator Lewis that I have sat here since he has been a senator-I do not know how long it is; three or four years-and heard him in full flight in support of Government legislation in relation to trade unions which Senator Lewis told us at the time would deal with all these problems.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters does not know what she is talking about. The justification for the action taken by Senator Lewis is that his heart is bleeding about the consequences of apathy in trade unionists. The fact of the matter is that someone went to him with a group of documents. Senator Lewis got very excited about them and rushed in here with them. In order to protect his little story from the Press he has called somebody Mr X instead of indicating who he really is. That is what Senator Lewis has done. The appropriate course for members of unions to follow in relation to this sort of thing quite clearly is to take the matter, if it is a police matter, to the police. If it is not a police matter or if a union member wants something investigated the matter should be taken to the Industrial Registrar. That is why those facilities are available. All I am saying is that if this establishes a precedent whereby, although tribunals are already provided for this purpose, the Senate-based, as the honourable senator said, on parliamentary privilege-is to become the tribunal for making these sorts of allegations, where will it all end?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that is the undesirable character of what Senator Lewis has said. We will look at the documents. I hope that Senator Lewis's constituent who took them to him will be guided by Senator Lewis to take his documents off to the proper place and have the matter determined by an appropriate tribunal-not the Senate-on the merits, because that is what ought to be done. I regret that Senator Lewis has seen fit to do this in this way. I am in no position to make any judgments about the facts which he alleges. Nor is anyone else in this chamber in the position to make any judgments other than the subjective decision -which Senator Walters, I have no doubt, will have made already-to hang Mr X or whoever is involved. There is no capacity in this chamber to make judgments about these issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kilgariff asked Question No. 222, upon notice, on 4 December 1980. In answer to part (5) of the question (Hansard, 24 February 1981, pages 69 and 70) I indicated that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs had sought details from the Northern Territory Government on the areas of stock route land included in land claims listed in part (2) of the answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The following information has now been received from the Northern Territory Department of Lands, the delay having been caused by the considerable difficulty in calculating the areas involved.</PARA>
<PARA> The area of stock routes claimed is approximately 1,543 square kilometres, or 0.11 per cent of the Northern Territory; quarantine areas and stock holding areas claimed total 3,546 square kilometres, or 0.26 per cent of the Northern Territory.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2070" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The total cost of CHOGM security was of the order of $9,750,000. Some accounts have yet to be finalised, and therefore some adjustment of this figure can be expected.</PARA>
<PARA> The total includes costs incurred by the Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police on their arrangements and by the CHOGM Task Force in providing equipment and facilities for the Police. It also includes the cost of the Defence contribution to security.</PARA>
<PARA> A very large number of police were engaged on CHOGM duties-in the case of the Victoria Police for example, I understand that about 3,500 police (or 44 per cent of the Force) were involved. The Police effort involved a major planning and management input and a huge commitment in such areas such as traffic control , venue security (hotels as well as the Meeting and other venues), personal escort and motorcade escort duties for the 41 delegations to name only some. Major cost areas included police overtime and allowances, accommodation, the provision of special facilities and equipment by the Commonwealth, and transport and communications costs.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Not all costs are known, but the estimated cost of flying the Queen in the RAAF 707 aircraft from London to Melbourne, including the cost of positioning the aircraft in London, was about $347,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) 11; (b) 10.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) $156,000 approximately. This included the cost of taking over the residential floors progressively before the Retreat commenced and compensation for the loss of revenue from the bars, restaurants and function areas resulting from the total closure of the Hotel to the public. The cost of security at the Lakeside has not been identified separately from other security costs.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The cost of official entertainment for CHOGM delegates was of the order of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) $164,000 in Melbourne; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) $21,000 in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the expenditure on CHOGM was considerable. This was always to be expected. But the benefits also are considerable. The Prime Minister of India ( who has offered her country as host for the next meeting) has indicated that expenditure of the order involved is small compared with expenditure for destructive purposes and worthwhile in the pursuit of more constructive objectives. That is in the wider context. In more immediate terms, Australia gained directly from the good will and understanding which a significant portion of the world's national leaders and media representatives were able to gain only by their presence here, and from the way we treated them and how they observed us.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (a) and (b) The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission (CTEC) was formally requested on 30 March 1981 to provide a report on a proposal made by the Northern Territory Government to establish a university in the Territory. On 30 April 1981, the Prime Minister announced, as part of the Government's decision following the Review of Commonwealth Functions, that the Commonwealth would not provide funding in the 1982-84 triennium for the establishment of a university in the Northern Territory. On 1 May 1981, the Chairman of the CTEC advised by letter, that a working party set up by the Commission had recommended , among other things, that the establishment of a university in the Northern Territory would be premature, and the Working Party did not support the Northern Territory Government's proposal to establish a university. Oral advice of the Working Party's conclusion was given to the Minister on 29 April.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir John Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. The honourable senator would appear to be referring to the following statement in the ERA Prospectus of 1 October 1980: 'Under the Government Agreement, Peko and EZ enjoyed a more favourable position than the Commonwealth and the AAEC as described later in the Prospectus'. It is clear from that later description that this statement refers to the financial obligations of the joint venturers regarding capital and operating costs contributions to the project. These arrangements reflected the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth and the Ranger partners entered into by the previous Government. In announcing, on 25 August 1977, the Government's decision to proceed with the further development of uranium, the Prime Minister made it clear that the Memorandum of Understanding 'would not have been the Government's preferred approach to mineral development' but that 'the Government would not wish to disturb arrangements entered into in good faith by the companies with the previous Government'. Under the Deed of Assignment and the associated Government Agreement as amended executed on 12 September 1980, under which the Government disposed of its interests in the project, ERA assumed all of the financial obligations of the Commonwealth and the AAEC. On the date of assignment ERA also reimbursed all direct expenditure relating to the Commonwealth's participation in the project.</PARA>
<PARA> (2)The ERA Prospectus states that '. . . the total consideration for each of Peko and EZ is:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The allotment to each of them, on the Assignment Date, of 124,999,997 fully paid $1 'A' Class shares.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The payment to each of them in cash on the Assignment Date of $35,939,495.70 (out of which Peko and EZ have each provided Vendor Loans of $30,000,000 to ERA (Canberra) Ltd.)</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, Peko and EZ are to be reimbursed for their proportions of Preliminary and Issue Expenses, the precise amount of which is to certified by ERA's auditors.'.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. The price which ERA paid to the Government (Commonwealth and the AAEC) for its interest in the project ($125,000,000 plus $104,306,767.70 being the AAEC's Project Costs including interest on Called Sums) was $229,306,767.70.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Government is currently not in favour of making a declaration under Article 14 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Government considers that Section 6 of the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which binds the Crown in right of both the Commonwealth and each of the States, provides adequate redress for complaints involving racial discrimination through its investigative, settlement and other procedures. Against this background, and taking account of the optional nature of Article 14 declarations, the Government does not intend at present to make such a declaration but is keeping the matter under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government is also keeping the question of Australia's reservation in respect of Article 4 (a) of the Convention under review.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's current view is that conciliation and mediation augmented by civil remedies, rather than the use of criminal sanctions, are the best means of dealing with racial discrimination and its associated tensions and prejudices. The Racial Discrimination Act does proscribe acts of incitement and assisting or promoting racial discrimination whether by financial assistance or otherwise, as well as providing a comprehensive range of civil remedies. This specific legislation reflects the Government's firm commitment to eliminate racial discrimination. Many acts involving violence or incitement to violence are also punishable under existing criminal law. Legislation strictly of the kind referred to in Article 4 (a) has thus not yet been passed and is not in immediate prospect. The Government therefore considers that the reservation lodged in relation to Article 4 (a) should be retained.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) One hundred and ten states have ratified, acceded to or deposited notifications of accession to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA> The following states have made reservations or declarations in relation to Article 4 (a):</PARA>
<PARA> Australia; Austria; Bahamas; Barbados; Belgium; Fiji; France; Italy; Malta; Nepal; Tonga; United Kingdom.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Housing and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Yes. The questions asked about housing tenure in the surveys and the 1976 Census were slightly different because of the different methods of collecting data.</PARA>
<PARA> Information from the 1980 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Survey of Housing Occupancy and Costs was obtained by trained interviewers, who asked households specific questions about their accommodation. The interviewers were able to provide clarification of questions where required. Information about housing tenure from the 1974-75 ABS Household Expenditure Survey was obtained by similar means.</PARA>
<PARA> Census forms are delivered and collected by trained ABS officers, but these officers are not generally present when the household fills in the questionnaire . The questions in the Census are thus designed to be simpler and more straightforward to avoid misinterpretation.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Data collected in ABS surveys is not strictly comparable with that collected in the 1976 Census because:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) in the 1976 Census, 2.5 per cent of all households provided answers to housing tenure questions which were incomplete or inconsistent. These answers were recorded in the 'not stated' tenure category.</PARA>
<PARA> In ABS surveys, the interview method is more able to ensure that an appropriate response to the tenure question is obtained from all households.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The 1974-75 Household Expenditure Survey did not include areas outside the six State capital cities and Canberra and may therefore have produced a different overall picture of housing tenure from that which would have been obtained from a survey with full geographic coverage. The 1980 ABS Survey of Housing Occupancy and Costs and the 1976 Census both covered the whole of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) A population census requires information to be collected from all households but the results of the 1976 Census were derived from processing a fifty per cent sample of households from all parts of Australia except the Northern Territory, where responses were completely processed. The 1980 ABS Survey of Housing Occupancy and Costs information is based on data collected from a sample of two-thirds of one percent of the population. The 1974-75 Household Expenditure Survey was based on a sample of approximately 9,000 households in the six State capital cities and Canberra. Thus sample variability is a factor affecting all three sources to some degree.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) In the 1976 Census some households who failed to answer the question on mortgage payments were recorded as outright owners rather than purchasers of their dwellings.</PARA>
<PARA> In the ABS Survey of Housing Occupancy and Costs and the Household Expenditure Survey the interviewer asked follow-up questions on mortgage payments to those households who identified themselves as home buyers, and errors due to omission of mortgage payment information would have been less likely.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2), (3) and (4) In the Treasurer's press release of 18 December 1981 it was announced that the Sales Tax Regulations were to be amended to broaden existing provisions which empower the Commissioner of Taxation to refund to specified organisations (public hospitals, public benevolent institutions, etc.) , the amount of any sales tax paid and included in the price of goods purchased by them in exempt circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the refund provisions would have been an additional option available to persons and organisations eligible to acquire goods tax-free so that ultimately they could, if the retailer with whom they dealt chose not to supply goods free of sales tax, have obtained a refund of the tax paid.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to provide an alternative arrangement for securing an exemption from sales tax was, of course, made in the context that sales tax would, as part of the Government's Budget strategy to place greater reliance in the tax system on sales tax and thus provide greater scope to reduce personal income tax, be levied at the rate of 2 1/2 per cent on a range of goods that are now exempt from tax. The rejection of the enabling legislation by this House has meant that this reason for extending the refund provisions no longer exists and accordingly the Government does not intend to proceed with the amendment to the Sales Tax Regulations foreshadowed on 18 December 1981.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am advised that Japan expects a ten-year research and development effort to be required for the fifth generation computer system. In recognition of the complexity of the pro- ject an International Conference on Fifth Generation Computer Systems was held in Tokyo in October 1981 to discuss the present state and future problems in computer development. Contrary to some published reports, advice received from the Australian Counsellor (Scientific) in Tokyo after discussions with the appropriate Japanese authority, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), indicates that no plans have yet been made for international participation in research and development. It is therefore not possible to determine if Australian participation is possible.</PARA>
<PARA> (2a) Government assistance to computer research is directed mainly through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Industrial Research and Development Incentives scheme. The IR&amp;D Incentives scheme has recently been reviewed by the IAC in its inquiry on Certain Budgetary Assistance . The IAC's report is currently under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of important and complex issues would have to be addressed before a policy of assistance directed specifically at the computer manufacturing industry could be considered. A full and public examination of the issues would be desirable. The Government has indicated its intention to send a reference in 1982 to the IAC on the question of assistance for the Australian computer industry. Computer software, an important element in developing fifth generation computers, may be included in the scope of the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> The issue of government assistance to computer research may alternatively be viewed in the context of support for a technology, rather than an industry. There is a trend in other countries towards greater selectivity in the support of those technologies which are fundamental to a wide range of industries. The Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia has already identified technologies which it expected to be important in this sense for Australia. The key role of computers in business and manufacturing activities is widely recognised as an important factor in international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> (2b) There are a number of generally available mechanisms by which Australian participation could be encouraged if Japan were to seek international involvement in research and development in relation to fifth generation computers:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Australia's Agreement with Japan on co-operation in Research and Development in Science and Technology provides a mechanism for co-operative activities such as the exchange of personnel in mutually agreed fields of scientific and technological research and development. Research and development in relation to fifth generation computers could form such a field. Co-operation under the Agreement is funded by the Government, and is co-ordinated in Australia by the Department of Science and Technology.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The Government's offsets policy requires successful overseas tenderers for Government contracts valued at $1 million or more to give a commitment to seek to place orders with Australian industry to a minimum level of 30 per cent of the value of the imported content of the contract. The program seeks to obtain high technology offsets wherever possible. For example, under this program, CSIRO has had for some years a research and development agreement with the Japanese computer manufacturer, Fujitsu.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Australian Trade Commissioners stationed in Osaka and Tokyo identify, and draw to the attention of Australian firms, areas in which there appear to be prospects for Australian expertise to be linked into commercial arrangements with Japanese organisations. The Trade Commissioners will provide appropriate assistance to any Australian company or authority which has an interest in exporting computer related technology to Japan or which is interested in seeking some co-operative arrangement with Japanese organisations or enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The comments on (1) and (2) above indicate that Australia is well placed to take up opportunities as appropriate to our development in this field.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) I have seen a report, which appeared in the New Zealand newspaper The Press on 15 April 1982, of an interview with the United States Ambassador to New Zealand covering a number of topics. On the subject of handling the refusal of some Pacific island states to allow port visits by United States warships unless it is confirmed that they are not carrying nuclear weapons, the Ambassador is quoted as saying 'I hope New Zealand and Australia will figure that one out.'</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The United States Government has made known to us its concern that policies recently adopted by some South Pacific island states could have the effect of preventing port visits there by United States warships.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware of and understands the concerns expressed by many South Pacific island states over nuclear issues. On issues such as nuclear testing and the dumping of nuclear wastes in the Pacific, Australia has played an active and public role. Australia is a party to and strong supporter of the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) under which we have the status of a Non-Nuclear- Weapons State.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government shares with island governments an interest in maintaining and enhancing the security of the South Pacific region. The Government believes that in pursuit of this interest it is important for the three ANZUS partners to be able to maintain an effective naval presence in the South Pacific. We have therefore made known to Island Governments on a continuing basis, both bilaterally and in multilateral forums, our view that our mutual security interests could be harmed by actions which might restrict Western naval activities in the area. However, policies on conditions for port visits by foreign warships are, of course, ultimately a matter for the sovereign island states of the South Pacific themselves to determine.</PARA>

<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the profit figures and results quoted by the honourable senator are consolidated ones for the banks' entire group operations . The profit performances of the savings banks, which provide the bulk of bank first mortgage finance for owner-occupied housing, have in the main been less buoyant than the consolidated results.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator will be aware that the Government has been giving careful attention to the problems facing home buyers in circumstances where large demands for capital funds from various sources have combined to push interest rates to high levels. Apart from pursuing general economic policies designed to reduce inflation and to constrain demands on capital markets, a package of measures designed to increase the availability of housing finance and to assist home buyers, particularly first home buyers, was announced to the Parliament on 18 March 1982. That package included an agreement between the Government and the nationally-operating banks, whereby the banks will provide an additional $400m for housing loans over the coming year.</PARA>
<PARA> The difficulties that savings banks and other traditional lenders for housing have been experiencing in attracting deposits in recent times were outlined in the statement of 18 March 1982. An important factor has been that, with controlled housing lending rates, the savings banks have also been constrained in the deposit rates they have been able to offer. That has had the effect of limiting the funds they have been able to attract and hence their capacity to lend for housing. The trading banks observe the same maximum as savings banks for their equivalent housing loans.</PARA>
<PARA> Housing loans of under $100,000 remain subject to control, with the maximum interest rate currently being 13.5 per cent. Higher rates may, of course, apply to other forms of financing not subject to control, such as short term bridging financing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 March 1982 (Hansard, page 924) Senator Button asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What action is the Government taking to reduce the enormous backlog of applications for new television translators and new radio services throughout Australia? I refer particularly to areas such as the Dandenongs region of Victoria where obviously falsely-based assurances were given just prior to the last Federal election by the then Liberal member for La Trobe and the then Minister that translators would be in service by early 1981. Is the Minister aware that pressures such as this in connection with the broadcasting system are building up throughout Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> Is it a fact that the current backlog of planning proposals for new translators and new radio services would now take 10 years to implement?</PARA>
<PARA> Further to the reply which I gave Senator Button on 18 March 1982, the Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> A draft planning proposal concerning the provision of television translator stations within parts of the Sherbrooke Shire, in the Dandenongs region in Victoria, was prepared by the Department of Communications in September 1980. This document was circulated to the industry for comment as part of the normal planning process.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of comments received it became clear that further investigatory work would be necessary before a final proposal could be prepared for the Minister's consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> Negotiations concerning the establishment of these stations have been continuing between the Department of Communications and the licensees of the Melbourne television stations. Further field work will be undertaken in this area within the next few months.</PARA>
<PARA> Due to the nature of the terrain in this area there is no simple solution which would overcome television reception problems. Therefore it is imperative that this proposal be considered fully before the final recommendation is made concerning the most appropriate method of improving television reception within the Sherbrooke Shire.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the backlog of planning propsals Senator Button may be aware that the administrative procedures for planning broadcasting and television services are presently under review by the Department of Communications, in consultation with broadcasting industry representatives. These new procedures are to be implemented in an effort to streamline the planning process and consequently enable the planning backlog to be cleared within the shortest possible space of time.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst detailed procedures are not yet finalised, consultation is well advanced. In particular it has been agreed in principle that future draft planning proposals for all broadcasting and television services will be based upon engineering and socio-economic data which will be supplied by interested parties on a proforma which will be available from the Department in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> In preparing for the introduction of the new procedures, the Department of Communications is presently writing to all individuals and groups who are registered with it as having expressed an interest in the provision of new services, or modifications to existing services, with a view to determining precisely the number of groups who may be interested in preparing planning proposals under the new procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> Once a response to these letters has been received by the Department, the Minister may be in a better position to indicate the period of time which may be required before the backlog could be fully cleared.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 March 1982 (Hansard, page 1091), Senator Townley asked me a question without notice on the effects of staff ceilings on research undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last six years, the level of CSIRO's staff ceiling has risen by 441 positions (7.6 per cent) even though 344 positions (5.9 per cent) have been surrendered over that time. This apparently anomalous position is brought about by the fact that CSIRO has been subjected to the Government's across-the-board staff cuts, while, at the same time, it has been asked to undertake additional activities and accept responsibility for establishments previously accounted for under the ceilings of other government bodies. The major increases to CSIRO 's staff ceiling were provided to cover the transfer to CSIRO of the Materials Research Laboratory of the Department of Defence, and the non-nuclear activities of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission; for the transfer of 380 staff previously funded from the Wool Research Trust Fund; for additional responsibilities such as the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory and research in the extended Australian Fishing Zone; and for the Government's apprenticeship scheme and projects funded by the National Energy Research Development and Demonstration Program.</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the overall ceiling rise, the need to surrender positions prompted the Executive of CSIRO to adopt a more determined policy of selectivity and concentration of research effort. Under this policy the number of research programs is being reduced and, in particular, no program of research is being continued where the level of resource allocation is so low as to make prospects for success unlikely. Apart from the initial review undertaken to initiate this policy, and the continuing review of their research programs by Chiefs of CSIRO Divisions, the Executive of CSIRO also commissions periodic Divisional and Subject Reviews with the aim of directing resources to produce more concentrated and effective research.</PARA>
<PARA> The policy of reduction and termination of programs in areas of lesser priority has been pursued to a greater extent than that required to meet the Organisation's commitment to surrender positions. This has been done to release resources, in terms of both staff and funds, for redeployment into other programs, especially those in research areas which have been identified by CSIRO as having high priority for expansion.

<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It was not possible to allow for the effects of the new series for average weekly earnings, first published by the Statistician on 1 April 1982, in the costing or design of the housing deposit assistance scheme. As the Minister for Housing and Construction announced on 8 April 1982, the income test limits for eligibility have since been adjusted to ensure that families are not disadvantaged by the change in series. The new income test limits are 135 per cent and 155 per cent of the new average weekly earnings series. The adjustment to these limits means that the estimated number of grant recipients and hence, the cost estimates, may increase slightly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 March 1982 (Hansard, page 1096), Senator Harradine asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations and deals with a so-called attempt by the Government to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act relating to compulsory unionism. Is the Minister not aware that it is impossible for the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to award compulsory unionism under the current provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act? Is the Minister aware that the Commission can award preference only, and then only after a full hearing, after all reasonable steps have been taken by the employee organisation to recruit, where there is evidence of employer resistance or where it is in the best interests of industrial relations for the Commission so to award? Is the Minister further aware that the human rights of individual employees are fully protected by the operation of the conscientious provisions enshrined in that legislation? If the Minister is aware of all those aspects will he not agree with me that the Government's attempt to portray this piece of legislation as an attack on compulsory unionism is a con trick on the Australian public and that it will in fact open the way to those unions which now have preference in their awards to do what the Government ought to oppose, that is, resort to forcing persons to become members on the job, which is the current policy with some more militant unions?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that it is a basic principle of human rights that individuals should be able to choose freely whether they wish to belong to a trade union. This has long been clear Government policy. The Government considers that the time has now come to provide for that right without qualification in the federal jurisdiction. For that purpose, amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 have been proposed to remove from the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission jurisdiction over the giving of preference in or in relation to employment to members of registered trade unions.</PARA>
<PARA> In introducing these amendments, the Government is well aware of the circumstances in which and the means whereby the Commission has exercised its jurisdiction in this area in the past and it is not suggested that the Commission has acted improperly in any way. The fundamental question is whether freedom of individual choice should continue to be so limited. The Government's view is that it should not.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be stressed that in taking this approach, the Government appreciates the danger that some unions and employers might be more disposed to employ various forms of discrimination to coerce individuals to become union members. To prevent this, provision will be made for a right to compensation for the person discriminated against from the offending union or employer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1572) Senator Sibraa asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs seen Press reports that tonnes of food supplied by foreign countries for refugees in Somalia are being sold openly in Mogadishu while people in refugee camps are complaining of starvation and that food aid from the European Economic Community to Ethiopia is also being sold? Does the Australian Government supply food aid to Somalia and Ethiopia? If so, can the Minister assure the Parliament that this aid is reaching the refugees rather than being sold or being used to feed Ethiopian and foreign troops fighting against the Eritreans?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that Press reports have been made along the lines referred to by the honourable senator. The Australian Government does supply food aid to Ethiopia and Somalia. However, care is taken to ensure that it reaches those most in need of it and that it is not diverted to other uses.</PARA>
<PARA> At the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa (ICARA) held in Geneva in April 1981, the Government pledged an additional $8m to be provided as food aid in 1981-82 to refugees in Africa. Our shipment of food aid to Ethiopia comprises 24,500 tonnes of wheat for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and an additional 900 tonnes to be distributed by World Vision. This aid is valued, including freight and other costs, at about $4.7m. In Ethiopia the food aid will be consigned to UNHCR who will ensure that it reaches intended beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA> 'UNHCR has agreed to support, with food aid, settlement projects and transit camps organised by the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission. The projects will help returnees, displaced persons and locals in need. Some of the wheat will be exchanged for maize, the preferred staple in the rural areas. A small amount will be sold to meet internal distribution costs which are very high.</PARA>
<PARA> The food aid for Somalia includes 10,400 tonnes of flour and 2,000 tonnes of rice valued, including freight, at about $4 million. Of this 4,000 tonnes of flour will shortly arrive in Mogadishu, with the balance of flour and the rice to be shipped in May. The food aid will be for the direct use of refugees.</PARA>
<PARA> All of the food aid being provided as part of our ICARA pledge is in fact being handled by UNHCR on our behalf. The World Food Program is also involved in monitoring and supervision and both organisations will report on its use.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 April 1982, Senator Lewis (Hansard, page 1575) asked me a question without notice about safety and security arrangements for protecting the Bass Strait petroleum production platforms. I should like to amplify my reply as it concerned the restrictions applying to vessels in the area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The internationally accepted 'safety zones' of 500 metres around each platform prohibit all vessels from unauthorised entry. These zones are declared under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The Restricted Area declared by the Department of Transport applies to all vessels over 200 tons. The boundary of the Restricted Area extends from the shoreline to approximately 50 nautical miles from the coast to surround the platforms and the offshore pipelines. The boundary lies approximately five nautical miles beyond the platforms. The Restricted Area is expected to be replaced at the end of 1982 by the 'Area to be Avoided' measure recently approved by the Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO). This area has the same dimensions as the existing Restricted Area. Amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act will be introduced to make the Area to be Avoided a prohibited area with respect to all Australian vessels over 200 tons. The IMCO recommendations for the Bass Strait area will be mandatory for international vessels registered in countries which implement specific legislation regarding the Bass Strait area. The recommendations will remain advisory for vessels registered in other countries. However, because of IMCO's standing, a high degree of compliance is expected.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government presently has under consideration the question of restricting the entry of vessels under 200 tons to a zone around the platforms which is greater than the 500 metre safety zone.</PARA>
