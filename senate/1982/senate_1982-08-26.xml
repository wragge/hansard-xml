<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I pointed out in the debate in the Senate yesterday, the findings of Mr Costigan are, of course, matters which are of grave concern. There is obviously need for action to be taken in relation to the matters. That action has been taken and very positive action is contemplated. As I have said, the President of the Law Council of Australia or someone nominated by him is going to undertake an examination, in the first place, of the Perth office and have regard to the professional competence and the quality of work in that office, the supervision of it from Canberra, and the diligence with which client departments have followed up their instructions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to Senator Chipp that on the evidence we have at this stage the officer concerned with that was not dealing with the particular file that was the subject of Mr Costigan's inquiry. He has been suspended and his future is now being examined under the Public Service Act. I do not think, from some comments that I have read and heard during this debate, that people appreciate that Ministers cannot just take action. Senator Chipp has been a Minister and would know that there is a Public Service Act which lays down the procedures to be followed, the rights of public servants and what charges and so on should be laid. Those are the steps that the Government has taken. As I have said, clearly what is called for when a matter of this kind is revealed is prompt, firm and effective action. I believe that that is being taken by me with the support of the Government and that, really, I and the Government would be judged on what we do and how we carry out the steps that we have now said we will take. In those circumstances, I again reject the suggestion in the question that I should resign.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, relates to Australia's overseas aid commitment and to Mr Somare's visit yesterday to the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, in Canberra. Is it true that this year Australia is providing a 10 per cent increase or an additional $72m in overseas aid, principally to neighbouring countries in our region of South East Asia and the Pacific? Is it also true that the country that is receiving by far the largest proportion of this development assistance is Papua New Guinea; that it is receiving an untied single payment this year of $ 253m, or one-third of the Papua New Guinea Government's expenditure? If there is merit in Mr Somare's request to stop the real decline in this level of Australian support for Papua New Guinea, bilaterally and sensibly agreed to in the past, will favourable consideration be given by the Government to requiring Papua New Guinea's overseas purchases of equipment and expertise to be directed to Australian industry, to our mutual benefit?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="523" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I believe that the figures quoted by the honourable senator with regard to overseas aid were broadly correct. Specifically with regard to Papua New Guinea, that country faces increasing economic problems and its Government has asked Australia to consider reviewing the existing arrangements in respect of the Budget support grants. These arrangements cover a five-year period ending in 1985-86. There is provision for an annual real reduction of 5 per cent in the grant. I understand that during the recent visit to Canberra of the Prime Minister, Mr Michael Somare, he discussed his country's needs with our Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In response to Mr Somare's request we have agreed to examine the possibility of bringing forward the mid-term review of the five-year aid arrangements, which in normal circumstances would be undertaken in the 1983-84 year. We have undertaken to provide firm advice to Mr Somare next month as to the proposed date of the review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the last part of the question, relating to assistance that might be directed to Australian industry, I must say that an integral part of Australia's arrangements with Papua New Guinea in regard to the Budget support grants is an agreement that they be untied, thereby giving that country flexibility to determine its own expenditure priorities. A feature of that aid throughout the term of the agreement is that it is an untied grant, not subject to direction in regard to purchasing or whatever. As I have said, we hope that shortly there will be a statement in regard to any change in the proposed review of the grant. If at that time I can provide information of interest to Senator Teague I will see that he is advised accordingly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Attorney-General to a statement made on 27 June by the Treasurer, commenting on the McCabe-Lafranchi report. The Treasurer said in his statement that he wanted to correct the false impression that there was anything new about bottom-of-the-harbour schemes of which the Government was unaware. I ask the Attorney: In view of the fact that it was clearly the Government's view in June of this year that there was nothing new about these schemes, what had he done as Attorney-General, the principal law officer of the Commonwealth, between his appointment in 1977 and the publication of the McCabe- Lafranchi report, in terms of making inquiries of his Department about what steps were being taken to deal with these schemes? Will he itemise any such inquiries that he made?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="524" SPEAKER="Durack Sen The Hon P.D." NAMEID="8G4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="ATTORNEY GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement of the Treasurer of 27 June referred to bottom-of- the-harbour schemes and straw companies, which were the subject of a great deal of debate yesterday both here and in another place. This problem was raised in about the middle of 1978. The decision of the Government was to take specific action and create a specific offence. The view of the Crown law authorities was not just based upon the view of an officer in Perth. It was the view of senior officers-the then Crown Solicitor, the present Crown Solicitor and others-that there were difficulties with the existing law, problems of proof and so forth, and that the matter should be addressed by a new specific law. That was the policy being followed by the Government in relation to other tax avoidance schemes that were being uncovered and brought to its attention. The Goverment was passing special legislation to deal with them. The Government decided that that was the way this matter should be tackled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is what the Treasurer was referring to in his statement. He was saying that the Government had become aware of this problem, that it had taken action and had passed the legislation, and that it was not revealed to the Government for the first time by the McCabe-Lafranchi report. Honourable senators will remember that the third Costigan report also mentioned the problem. The Treasurer was simply saying that the Government was aware of these matters and had decided to take action against them by direct methods; that is, by legislation which is now known as the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is matter of record that the problem was first raised in mid- 1978. The legislation was passed at the end of 1980. That is clearly a fact. The answer to the second question is that I was not aware of the opinions at that time. Some views were expressed in 1980, when the legislation was going through, that the existing law was adequate. I was aware of some of those views that were being expressed at the time against the passage of the legislation, but that was at the end of 1980 or thereabouts. I was certainly not aware of the Brinsden opinion, which had been obtained in relation to a specific case in Perth, until after the McCabe report was tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator ARCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. I understand that the wheat storage situation in Tasmania has become chronically run down, to a degree where it is possible for the bread industry and feed wheat users' supplies to run out completely. Is it a fact that several silos in Tasmania may not be fully serviced by the ships now carrying grain to Tasmania? Has this fact been drawn to the Minister's attention? Is he aware of the strain being placed on users of both feed and bread wheat by less regular shipping and diminished usable storage capacity? Has the Minister any information on these matters and, particularly, can he say how and when the problems may be rectified?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has advised me that he is aware of the matters raised by Senator Archer in this question, namely, that there is a wheat storage problem in Tasmania. Basically, the problem is that existing storage facilities can accommodate the wheat shipments brought in by Australian National Line Lake class carriers only by running down stocks to very low levels . There has been some correspondence between Ministers of the Commonwealth and Tasmanian governments. The point has been made that provision of storage facilities is essentially a State responsibility. It is also relevant to point out that users of wheat may feel some responsibility for solving the problem, as I understand that users of wheat in Tasmania place much heavier reliance on public or State provided facilities relative to their own facilities than do mainland users.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clearly in the interests of Tasmanian users and authorities as well as the producers of wheat destined for Tasmania that the problem be resolved. Honourable senators will appreciate that the matter is largely outside the responsibility of the Commonwealth. It is not possible for me to say when the problem will be rectified, but I understand that the Australian Wheat Board is continuing to pursue the matter with the relevant Tasmanian authorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the Minister aware of the strategic plan drawn up by the Reagan Administration and presented to the United States National Security Council which officially declares that the United States can conduct and win a protracted nuclear war with the Soviet Union? Has the Federal Government received notification of this document, and is the Government aware of its contents? What is the Federal Government's stance in relation to the concept of a winnable and protracted nuclear war? Has it made any representations to the United States about this matter? Is the Federal Government aware of the numerous opinions from people such as the former United States Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, that it would be absolute madness to believe that a country could fight and win, or even contemplate, a protracted nuclear war?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="525" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; On this matter the Minister for Foreign Affairs has seen Press reports that the United States Department of Defense recently submitted to the United States National Security Council a draft directive relating to United States nuclear policy. The Government has not received notification of any such document or of its purported contents. An essential part of the United States defence policy is to ensure that the United States has sufficient survivable strength in strategic nuclear forces to deter any Soviet nuclear attack. A consideration for United States policy is that Soviet military doctrine appears to contemplate the possibility of fighting a protracted nuclear war. This would include the possibility of the Soviet Union being the first to use nuclear weapons. For these reasons emphasis is placed within the United States strategic program on survivability and endurance of the United States strategic forces. The United States command communications and control systems- C3-are designed explicitly to strengthen deterrents of nuclear attack by making it clear to the Soviet Union that it would not be able to gain advantage from first use of nuclear weapons. The Government does not see the United States strategic program as implying a commitment to either the notion of limited nuclear war or protracted nuclear war. On the contrary, it is clearly designed to prevent nuclear war. The Australian Government's view is that any resort to nuclear weapons by the superpowers or, indeed, any other country could result in all-out nuclear war with inevitable disastrous consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. First, may I have the indulgence of the Senate to say that I am bitterly disappointed with the answer that the Department has furnished to the Minister. My supplementary question is based on a confirmation that this document does exist by an article in today's Sydney Morning Herald. In that article Mr Weinberger, the United States Defense Secretary, conceded the existence of this document; that the United States has a plan to do this. One is filled with horror. I ask the Minister to bring this updated information to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his Department and to bring an equally updated reply to the Senate. Mr Weinberger made an extraordinary response when asked whether it was really possible to control nuclear forces in the confusion of battle and to make the calculated decisions of protracted nuclear war; he shook his head and said: 'I don't have any idea'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer to the tabling of the interim reports of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I mentioned in very broad terms the allegations which were made in Interim Report No. 3 in the debate which took place in the Senate yesterday. I have the relevant section of the report here and just to remind honourable senators of the allegation I will read it:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Material already available to the Commission indicates that very large numbers of painters and dockers have been involved in imposition on the social security system. Such imposition involves the receipt of social security benefits whilst workers under false names are either in receipt of workers' compensation benefits or working at other employments. The Commission's ability to identify false names has enabled these investigations to be pursued and will result in the recovery by Government to a large extent of the amount illegally received. It is not possible at this stage of the investigation to state precisely the amount involved but it will be well over $1,000,000.</PARA>
<PARA>The statements contained in the Commission's report were based not only on information which makes it clear to the Commission that there is widespread use of false names among members of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union, with an intent to defraud the Government in respect of social security and workers' compensation payments, but also on cases of fraud which had been detected by the Department of Social Security and/or the Australian Federal Police investigations that actually started before the Royal Commission was commenced and indeed which may have had an influence on its establishment in 1980. In this latter connection, there were 105 cases of fraud investigated in Brisbane and 22 in Adelaide during the period January-December 1980. These 127 cases involved over-payments of $152,000 and in nearly every case unemployment beneficiaries who had been employed as painters and dockers. In 24 cases the fraud involved the receipt of full benefits under the beneficiary's true identity while working under a false identity.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of prosecutions have flowed from those investigations and a number of convictions have been obtained. The liaison between my Department and the Commission has continued. Extensive further work is being done which has already uncovered circumstances which will give rise to more detailed investigations. I would prefer not to give further detail to the Senate on the basis that I do not think there is any point in giving any further warning to those who are involved in what appears to be a very widespread defalcation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think Senator Evans was in the chamber earlier when I was asked a question about Senator Withers's comments. I did not hear Senator Withers. I have quickly read the transcript once. But I am aware that Senator Withers made comment along the lines that Senator Evans has just quoted. All that seems to reveal is that Senator Withers is supporting Senator Evans's views of the secrecy provisions against the views that Mr Costigan has formed and amplified at great length in his opinion about the extent to which section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act was impeding Ministers in having a full knowledge about affairs of the Australian Taxation Office or about tax files, whether they are in the Taxation Office or in the Attorney-General's Department. That is all that emerges from Senator Withers's comment. Senator Evans may gain comfort from having at least one other person agreeing with him. Up until then he seemed to be out on a limb with his view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that Mr Costigan made his finding after inquiring into the matter. Senator Evans and the Opposition seem to have been very impressed with all the work that Mr Costigan has done and with all the other findings he has made. But, because it does not suit them politically, they do not seem to want to accept this point. Apart from what Mr Costigan has said, the Crown Solicitor, to whom I have mentioned this matter, has told me that the view which he has taken and which his predecessors have taken is that they do not refer to the Attorney- General tax files in their office that have been referred to them by the Taxation Office. That is the view which they have taken. Whether this can be done in the sanitised way which Senator Evans is now suggesting is beside the point at the moment. Perhaps it can. The Crown Solicitor had not taken that view . The Crown Solicitor had taken the view over the years that his office did not refer specific files or matters-</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="527" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer made it quite clear in his Budget Speech that the Government will take particular care when implementing the new system to protect the separate status of sub-contractors. If that is the burden of the question, that matter was specifically addressed by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech. The other point that can be emphasised is that this proposed new system is to be competely separate from the PAYE system. The Treasurer advises that the term 'cash economy' has come to be used to refer to payments, whether they are made by cash or cheque. It refers really to payments that are not disclosed in income tax returns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that the professional housing industry makes payment for labour and services by cheque is no guarantee that the recipients of the payments will include them in their income tax returns. The Treasurer has clearly stated that the new system is seen as protecting contractors, the vast bulk of whom are regarded as being honest. The Government hopes that the system will protect them from unfair competition from those who are currently evading tax. It may be argued that there is little evidence of evasion of the cash economy kind in relation to payments made by home owners or owner-builders. But in a sense, the only direct evidence of evasion generally is obtained when it has been discovered as a result of an investigation. The Treasurer has also stated that there is scope for evasion by payees in relation to this kind of payment. Representatives of the professional building industry have expressed the view that significant evasion is occurring in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the question asked by Senator Bjelke-Petersen, it could be agreed that the proposed new system will come down heavily on tax evaders. It is not a case of coming down on avoiders as suggested in the question. The Treasurer does not agree that this will destroy the sub-contracting system in the housing industry. Perhaps it ought to be recalled that he said there will be considerable consultation before this proposed new system is introduced.</PARA>

If I can just speak as someone who has been removed from this place under the Standing Order, I point out that we are in the same situation as we were when I was ejected, and when others in this place have been ejected, in that Senator Sir John Carrick, the Leader, uses a device and uses the Standing Orders to blackguard collectively members of the Opposition in a manner which cannot be replied to except by interjection or by going against the Standing Orders with individual replies. This morning Senator Sir John Carrick made the accusation that members of the Australian Labor Party in this place were mute and condoned the murder and the mayhem which have gone on in the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. In the past he has made similar comments about our alleged associations with communists and others. That sort of collective blackguarding of the group on this side of the House cannot be expected to occur without provoking the response that it did this morning, not only from Senator Georges but from practically everyone on this side of the place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I was asked a question. In order to put the dimensions of the question into true perspective I remind the Senate that Mr Costigan's report does not relate to a large number of people. Indeed, although there has been a tendency by the Opposition to assume guilt he has no capacity to determine the guilt or innocence of any person at all. It is fundamental that we must try to preserve the rule of law. At the moment several officers of the Western Australian division of the Crown Law office are under suspension, not because they are guilty but because in the collection of information inferences have been drawn upon which the proper legal processes will now be brought to bear. It is utterly wrong for anyone to make allegations by way of decision, by finding guilt. That is a Moscow kind of trial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the dimension of the situation at the moment. No one is seeking to mitigate or lessen the fact that, if there is significant maladministration in a section of the Public Service, of course it should be cleaned up. But former Ministers in this place have had to face many different situations-from collisions involving Navy ships to all sorts of allegations. Nobody suggested then that they should stand aside. It would be incredible if, in a Public Service of several hundred thousand people, there were not significant aberrations from time to time. It was never intended under the Westminster system that a Minister should offer his resignation following every such aberration. Indeed, at this moment we are in no position to judge. According to the ordinary rule of law, which ought to be upheld in this place, we now have to wait and see what decisions and actions are taken with regard to these two people. Against that background I simply ask: Why not observe the rule of law for a change?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a system the size of the social security system there are, of course, some problems of abuse. About 2.3 million Australians currently receive income support payments from my Department. There are about 1.4 million age pensioners. Unfortunately, there are about 400,000 people receiving the unemployment benefit. Given such large numbers, it is not really surprising that there are areas of abuse. We acknowledge that the abuse occurs and have procedures designed to reduce it. In trying to prevent abuse of the benefits which are available from my Department, one has to tread a very fine line between having procedures which are reasonable for those who are entitled to benefits to operate and will give people ready access to those benefits and having procedures which are very open to abuse. I believe that in most cases we tread that line fairly carefully.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as benefits control in the Northern Territory is concerned, a number of cases were detected during 1981-82. There were 12 prosecutions in the Northern Territory and 12 convictions under the Crimes Act. Those 12 cases involved payments of some $14,000. In addition, in matters which fell short of requiring prosecution we found 125 cases of incorrect payments, representing a total of $ 100,000 in incorrect payments already made, and an estimate was made that that would have gone on to involve payments of an additional $400,000. Those cases are over and above the cases which involved the fraudulent negotiation of cheques, which is also a problem in the Northern Territory. The general approach of the Department is that it is concentrating on trying to develop means which will reduce the incidence of abuse in the Northern Territory and elsewhere. We are doing that by the development of selective reviews and we are expecting to implement some new schemes in this area during the current calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA> I can only say to Senator Kilgariff that all of the examinations I have seen confirm what I think honourable senators would expect, namely, that abuse occurs in very much the minority of cases. It is important not to produce a situation in which the innocent and justified claimants of social security benefits are in some way categorised with those who would abuse the system. That is a consideration which we bear very much in mind. There are particular difficulties in the Northern Territory-difficulties of a mobile population, of many people passing through who perhaps deal with a regional office of my Department on one occasion only. I am satisfied that the staff in those difficult offices do their best to minimise fraud and abuse. However, I believe that we do need to upgrade our systems in a number of ways to reduce the incidence of the problem that Senator Kilgariff raised in his question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General and follows a question asked by my colleague Senator Ryan and the unsatisfactory answer given by Senator Sir John Carrick. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement in the other place yesterday that he had told Senator Durack that had he offered to resign his ministry he, Malcolm Fraser, would have refused to accept the resignation. I ask the Minister: When did this conversation take place, did he in fact offer to resign, and was the Prime Minister responding to such an offer? In any case, is not any Minister able to tender the resignation of his commission without the consent or agreement of the Prime Minister or any other person?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and relates to the significant increases in work experience subsidies under the Special Youth Employment Training Program. How does the Government propose to ensure that employers are fully acquainted with the changes in the subsidy rate and the administrative guidelines, and how many of the estimated 74,200 work experience approvals in 1982-83 can be expected to help unemployed youth in Tasmania?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The program about which the honourable senator has asked is one which enables the Commonwealth to subsidise the employment of unemployed young people who have had difficulty competing in the labour market. The levels of assistance vary. There is a subsidy of $75 a week for 17 weeks of employment. An extended form of assistance provides $100 a week for the first 17 weeks and $75 a week for the second 17 weeks. As the honourable senator mentioned in her question, the provisions under the program have been expanded in the recent Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the first part of the question, it is obviously important that employers should be aware of the existence of this subsidy so that they will be encouraged to take advantage of it. The Government proposes to ensure that that is so-that is, that employers are fully acquainted with the changes in the subsidy rates and administrative guidelines-by some extensive media advertising, which will commence next week, and by the provision through the Commonwealth Employment Service of handout leaflets explaining in detail the new subsidies and changes to guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> There is not a specific allocation to Tasmania but, based on experience, 3,280 approvals are projected for Tasmania in 1982-83. So it would be the Government's expectation that something over 3,000 young Tasmanians who have had difficulty in finding a place in the labour force will, through this system of subsidising employers, gain valuable work experience and access to the work force.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General and follows his reply to Senator Button earlier, when the Attorney-General said that he was aware in a general way of a general view that some held the opinion that the existing law was adequate for the prosecution of some tax avoidance offences. At the time of the discussions concerning the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill in Cabinet, did the Attorney-General attempt to satisfy himself as to the necessity for the legislation by personally calling for, or seeking or reading, any opinions which argued the adequacy of the existing law if only it were to be enforced? If such a request were made of his Department to provide such opinions , did the Attorney-General's Department deny the existence of any such opinions from silk, or did the Attorney-General's Department play down the view held by the legal officers of the Australian Taxation Office that existing law was adequate? In other words, did the Attorney-General's Department mislead him? If no such requests were made, does the Attorney-General agree that his failure to advise the Government after a personal review of opinions available to Government reflects on his capacity as a Queen's Counsel but, more particularly, in the discharge of his duties as Attorney-General?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, let me clear up a matter of fact. I made it quite clear that I was not aware of the Brinsden opinion, which was on the file in the Crown Solicitor's Office, until after McCabe. I said that when the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was going through the Parliament views were being expressed by various people. I cannot remember whose opinions were being expressed or what they were. All I am saying is that that point was being made. It was made to the Parliament. It was the subject of public debate. I was aware of what was being said. What I was saying, though, is that the senior officers of my Department had advised and strongly maintained the view that that Bill was needed and that the law was not adequate. That was the view they had held from the time the matter was first brought to the senior officers' attention by the Commissioner of Taxation. Unfortunately, there is no written opinion of those officers that can be referred to, but that was certainly the view they had always held and which they expressed.</PARA></TALK.START>

I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the affiliation of that organisation with the New South Wales branch, and it is the biggest branch of the Labor Party , is 500 members. Those 500 members, according to the rules of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party, do not allow that organisation even to have a delegate in its own right because we have a collegiate system in which the small unions have to come together for the purpose of electing their delegates. I take affront at the suggestion that because that organisation in a collegiate sort of way has a very minor representation-we have some 820 delegates at our State conference, and that organisation does not even have a delegate in its own right-that in some way associates the Labor Party with some of the misdeeds and happenings that have been taking place in respect of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>

The union is also registered with the Industrial Commission of Queensland.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Orders Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> The conduct of Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it must surely be conceded that we are in a situation which is most unsatisfactory for the effective functioning of the Senate. It arises because of the cut and thrust of politics. That is fair enough; that is what we are here for. But surely it must also be conceded that questions can be answered in such a way as to provoke and get a response from senators on both sides of the House which brings about a state in the Senate which is unsatisfactory from the point of view of the objectives of Question Time. There is a feeling in the Opposition -surely it must be understood by you, sir-that Senator Sir John Carrick in particular, when answering questions, provokes a response which leads to what some people may call unseemly conduct and to a situtation whereby there is constant interjection. Questions asked of Senator Sir John Carrick as Leader of the Government in the Senate are not properly answered because of the wide range of the reply. Mr President, you have referred to the fact that Government Ministers have the opportunity to say what they like, literally, in response to questions. In that umbrella way that you have suggested, ideas are canvassed which are outside the realm of the question and outside the realm of the answer. Whenever that tactic is resorted to, in particular by Senator Sir John Carrick, of course uproar and responses do take place. That sort of situation happens consistently-almost every day-at Question Time. For example, yesterday Senator Martyr asked a question of Senator Sir John Carrick which he took seven minutes to answer. This prohibited asking my question which I have been trying to put to a Minister since Tuesday. He took seven minutes in which he associated murder and corruption in a particular union with the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is true that in the cut and thrust of politics allegations will be made about corruption in respect of the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party, nobody on this side of the chamber is suggesting that every member of the Liberal Party is involved in that sense. There may be some sections where honest criticism is levelled at particular sections of the organisation. Senator McLaren and Senator Georges are quite justified in responding as they did to the generalisations that Senator Sir John Carrick so often makes in relation to the Australian Labor Party. There is a difference between a suggestion of corruption in a political party or a section of a political party and a suggestion of widespread murder, extortion and other forms of massive corruption referred to, in particular, in the Costigan report. That is not fair comment. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the interests of the Senate would best be served if in fact some understanding was reached without limiting the right of Ministers to reply. After all, I concede that on many occasions the Ministers have a pretty good slash at the Labor Party, Mr Hayden and other Opposition spokesmen and that is fair enough. But I think the general thrust in which we find ourselves continually-Senator Sir John Carrick continually throws a bucket over the Opposition-leads to continual disruption of the effective functioning of Question Time. That leads to the sort of problem that we have had consistently in this place. I agree with Senator Georges that responses and interjections are colourful and add to the atmosphere and the environment of the Senate. No one would want to stop that. The sorts of responses that we are getting continually are the result of what, to honourable senators on this side of the chamber, seem to be deliberate attempts by Senator Sir John Carrick to provoke and create an atmosphere that puts Question Time in turmoil. That, in itself, is a matter which concerns us because for the quarter of an hour or ten minutes that it takes to get some peace and tranquillity back into the Senate several senators on both side of the House are denied the opportunity to ask questions legitimately. I think that is a matter which the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders ought to examine in the interests of everybody concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, political pendulums are such that there will be changes. We believe a change will occur within the next year. There are some principles involved concerning the way in which the Senate should operate without taking away any of the cut and thrust which is part of the process. We do not want to do that. Nevertheless, we want to improve the guidelines and procedures in a way that will make Question Time an effective part of the functions of this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had intended to ask you, Mr President, a question but I can raise the point equally well in the debate on this motion. I noted your statement, Mr President, that you felt that Ministers should be able to answer questions in any way they see fit. I take it that you made that statement, Mr President, very much with the thought in mind that there is, of course, a Standing Order of the Senate which does apply to this matter. I refer to Standing Order 100, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answering any such Question, a Senator shall not debate the matter to which the same refers. </PARA>
<PARA>I am wondering whether the answer to this problem is a closer observance of that Standing Order, which presumably is there for a reason. After all, it is a Standing Order of the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Senate should seek a response from the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders in relation to provocative questions. We cannot simply suggest to the Committee that it examine provocative answers. Provocative answers usually are instigated by provocative questions. When provocative questions are asked surely it should be expected that the answers also can raise some provocation. Senator Gietzelt has said that the feeling on the other side of the House is that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator (Sir John Carrick) is deliberately provocative. I can assure Senator Gietzelt that the feeling on this side of the House is that the conduct of Senator Walsh is unseemly and also provocative. Not only should provocative answers be looked at by the Committee but also in the interests of the smooth running of Question Time to which Senator Gietzelt referred, provocative questions should be struck out.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by Senator Gietzelt that the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders has another look at the way in which Ministers answer questions. I want to refer to the matter raised by Senator Mason. In part of your ruling, Mr President, you said that Ministers may answer questions in any way they see fit. That gives Ministers a very wide scope, particularly the Leader of the Government (Senator Sir John Carrick) when answering questions, again to accuse honourable senators on this side of the chamber of being involved in activities in which we are not involved . That is what has triggered the whole problem here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I attempted to say when I raised my point of order-of course I was made to sit down-this action is typical of Senator Carrick. He has a long history of accusing members of the Australian Labor Party of being corrupt, dishonest, deceitful and all sorts of other things. I have a list of extracts from the Hansard record which go back for seven years. They show the occasions when Senator Carrick has done this not only in substantive motions but also in debate . I refer in particular to the 1975 debate on a loan Bill when a censure motion was moved against the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Willesee. I will not take up the time of the Senate by quoting Senator Carrick chapter and verse. He has repeatedly accused members of the Australian Labor Party of being corrupt, dishonest and deceitful. Of course, he carries on in that way and that is what causes problems in this Parliament. If Senator Carrick were a sensible Leader of the Government he would get his business through the Senate much quicker. </PARA>
<PARA> As you have said, Mr President, Ministers may answer questions in any way they wish. If they do not want to get involved in an argument they do not have to answer the question. They can ask that it be put on notice. If Ministers had any sense they would probably do that. Senator Carrick cannot control himself. He likes to try to stir up honourable senators on this side of the House. Then, of course, he cannot cop it when we give it back. I suggest to you, Mr President, that if this motion moved by Senator Gietzelt is carried the Standing Orders Committee should give careful consideration to the way in which the forms of the House are being abused, particularly by Senator Carrick, who baits honourable senators on this side of the House and accuses us of doing things which we, in all honesty, believe that we do not do. That is what stirs up honourable senators on this side of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some doubts as to whether the matter ought to be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders. On a number of occasions such matters have gone before the Committee and following the Committee's recommendations Question Time has not been improved one whit. I suggest to you, Mr President, that the matter is in your hands to apply the Standing Orders as they exist. You should not be affected by the intimidation which the Leader of the Government (Senator Sir John Carrick) attempts from time to time. Senator Sir John Carrick might take objection to what I am saying now. I can feel him starting to rise to it. I could use a softer term than ' intimidate'. I could use the word 'impress'. Senator Sir John Carrick from time to time likes to impress the President. Nevertheless, there is an inclination on the part of the Leader of the Government, in order to get the business of the Government through the Senate, to take some shortcuts which cut across the rights of senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am suggesting is that you, Mr President, should perhaps look again at the Standing Orders and in particular at a matter to which I have objected time and again. I refer to the right of the Leader of the Government to ask that all further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. I have objected to that consistently and have raised it not only with you, Mr President, but also with previous Presidents of the Senate. It is not a right that the Leader of the Government should have taken unto himself. A Leader of a Labor Government in the Senate might have instigated this procedure in the first place but that does not make it right. If that problem were faced correctly and if the Leader of the Government had to seek leave to have further questions placed on the Notice Paper the Senate itself could determine whether Question Time should be extended until all questions were answered. If that is done--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The Minister still has the right to place a question on the Notice Paper. I say to Senator Baume that sometimes it is important to ask a question even if an answer is not immediately given. The fact that the question is raised is important in the public interest. I suggest that too many questions are cut off by the device which the Leader of the Government in the Senate uses. I suggest that if the Leader has to ask for leave to terminate Question Time, there will be occasions when the Senate will refuse it. That means that Question Time may extend to an hour and a half. How will the Government correct that situation? It can do so by shortening its answers to get Question Time over with or, if a question demands too long an answer, by asking that the question be placed on the Notice Paper. At present, because the limit is one hour, Government Ministers-perhaps rightfully in their own defence-are extending their answers in order to take up as much time as possible. If honourable senators examine the record, they will see that exactly such a situation does occur-that Minister after Minister will bat out Question Time. They will not be able to do that if leave to place further questions on notice is refused and Question Time continues until all questions have been asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ministers can still take the matter into their own hands and put questions on the Notice Paper immediately they are asked. In such circumstances members of the Opposition have at least an opportunity to ask a given question. I reiterate that that is important even if the answer cannot be given immediately. I suggest that, rather than support the proposition that we again refer a matter to the Standing Orders Committee, we merely apply the Standing Orders as they are worded. I hope that I will not receive the reply that a precedent that the Leader of the Government can ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper has been set. Let us change the precedent. We can do so at any time. By your ruling, Mr President, we can return to the situation in which the Leader of the Government must seek leave. A new precedent, which I consider to be worthwhile, will then have been created. It will chop out all of this nonsense of lengthy answers to questions. If a question is overly long, a Minister has the opportunity to put it straight on the Notice Paper. If he finds a question provocative he can do likewise. Devices which enable Ministers to protect themselves against provocative questions are available. At certain times, if they had any sense, they would put questions on the Notice Paper instead of lengthily batting out a reply-as Senator Mason has indicated-not really answering but debating the subject generally. I ask, Mr President, that you consider the matter that I have raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The suspension of the Standing Orders has given honourable senators the opportunity to clear the air. That may well be the best benefit that we can derive from this debate. I have not seen the proposal in writing but, as I understand it, it is to refer to the Standing Orders Committee the matter of provocative answers to questions. I would not have thought that the Government would go along with that course of action, which virtually asks it to condemn itself.

One has to be practical and put oneself into the position of the Standing Orders Committee. What could it do about the suggested reference, no matter in what terms it was phrased?

Senator McIntosh asked for my comments on whether, by such a refusal, the Minister and his Department might be in breach of privilege. I remind the Senate that the question arose from an earlier question by Senator Sibraa to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, in which he sought information on whether any such application had been made, whether the Minister's Department had recommended the refusal of a visa and whether, if so, the Government would reconsider the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

In any event, I remind the Senate that the resolution of any such question is a matter for the Senate itself and that the role of the Presiding Officer is confined to determining whether, when a question of privilege has been raised, precedence should be given to a privilege motion over other business. Consistent with that role, it would not be proper for me to speculate or comment in any way upon whether any action referred to at Question Time might or might not constitute a breach of privilege. I do not propose, therefore, to comment upon the substance of the question put to me by Senator McIntosh.</PARA>

<PARA>Some concern has been expressed in the poultry industry, particularly in South Australia, that the Department of Health or the Bureau of Animal Health-I am not sure which-is to set up a project at Torrens Island in South Australia for the import of live poultry. There has been quite some writing about this, particularly in the South Australian Egg Bulletin of June, in which Mr Warren Starick, who is a very large poultry farmer in South Australia and a person who is very minutely engaged in the politics of poultry, is reported. His article is headed 'Danger to SA Industry'. The article begins:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's plan to import fertile eggs into Australia via quarantine facilities on Torrens Island is being strongly challenged by the Australian Council of Egg Producers because of the potential danger of Newcastle disease. </PARA>
<PARA>I have made some inquiries about this to the Department. I have found that a committee has been set up to look at this. A special facility has to be built to breed the chickens when the fertile eggs are brought in. I am told that this committee can report only upwards to its superiors and cannot make any report downwards to the people directly engaged in the industry. The reason I mention this today is that the Estimates committee hearings for the Department of Primary Industry and the Department of Health are coming up very shortly and I want to forewarn the people who will be attending those committees that if I can get along to the meetings I will be asking a series of questions. I hope that we can be provided with answers which will satisfy the people engaged in the poultry industry in South Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report, entitled 'Australian Telecommunications Commission Service and Business Outlook for 1982-83', outlines plans, funding and anticipated revenue for Telecom Australia for this financial year. In doing this the report draws attention to many of the policy problem areas and longer term matters affecting the whole of telecommunications development in Australia. It is important to bear in mind that Telecom became a separate business-oriented authority only in 1975. Since that time it has made tremendous strides as an organisation. Telecom is frequently criticised, sometimes correctly, for slowness, backlogs and lack of flexibility in its policies. There is no doubt that it does have some of those problems. It is important to recognise that it is not realistic to expect a body of this size-it is the largest enterprise in Australia-to change overnight. I believe the response which Telecom has made to some of the criticisms which have been put upon it has been well worth while and important. Pressure should be kept on an organisation such as Telecom to adapt to changing conditions. But there are correct conditions-better than those which this Government allows-under which it should be done. I will come to that in a moment . </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is worthy of congratulation in relation to the new services discussed in its business outlook for 1982-83. I mention particularly improved inwats services, new types of telephones, new small business systems, mobile telephone services, better telex services and digital radio concentrator systems. These innovations and services coming in great numbers from Telecom increasingly refute the assertion that Telecom cannot or does not provide the services which consumers and particularly business require. It is also making great efforts as an organisation to reduce backlogs and to update antiquated services. I congratulate the new Minister for Communications, Mr Brown, for drawing attention to this matter and asking Telecom specifically to concentrate on particular areas where backlogs occur. Telecom expects this year a reduction in the number of manual services from 43,000 to 34,000-a very significant reduction in one year. Telecom expects to instal some 540,000 new telephone services in the coming year, somewhat greater than the demand for this year, thus allowing an attack on the backlog which has built up. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make the point that all this is being done by Telecom as an organisation against a background of an unco-operative Government policy. There are several ways in which the Government has failed to co-operate with the best interests of the development of the telecommunications system in Australia. There is the question of capital available to Telecom. Telecom is expected to provide all these services to which I have referred. However, it is not able to act like normal private sector big business in doing this. This year its internal funding percentage will be 86 per cent from trading surplus, depreciation and long service leave retained funds. That is to say, all new capital works embarked on by Telecom will be financed by the organisation itself up to 86 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This compares with 1981 figures for other telecommunications organisations overseas in the following ratios: Bell Canada finances 53 per cent of its expansion from internal revenue; in Japan the figure for the National Telecommunications Company is 68 per cent; for the Bell Company in the United States the figure is 67 per cent, and the Deutsches Bundespost finances 44 per cent of its expansion from internal revenue. For Telecom the figure is 85 per cent. Looking at comparative figures of internal financing for private business or other large statutory undertakings, one finds, for example, 56 per cent for Australian Consolidated Industries Ltd, 21 per cent for the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, and 67 per cent for CSR Ltd. So, enormous a corporation as Telecom is, it is required to finance 85 per cent as distinct from those comparative figures to which I have referred for other countries and other businesses. This happens because of Commonwealth Government control over borrowing, which comes directly from this Government's policies. To add to the additional burden Telecom has, it is required in respect of pre-1975 advances paid to Telecom to pay for those at a greatly increased interest rate over the original rate. This is the main reason, the report notes, for the 26 per cent increase in Telecom's interest bill this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair enough, as I have said, to press Telecom for efficiency and good use of capital. No one should resist that obvious need. But it is not fair to impose on it restrictions which no other telecommunications organisation or business has, and which are much harsher than is normal for big private business enterprises. The outcome of Government policies in relation to Telecom has been seen recently in steep and frequent tariff increases. For example, the 4 per cent to 7 per cent increase in short-haul STD announced around Budget day and approved by the Minister for Communications represents yet another burden imposed on rural users in respect of telephone services. The report of McKinsey and Co. Inc. on the Capital and Policy Requirements for the 1980s, which was commissioned by this Government, recommended easier borrowing for Telecom. The Government sat on that report for a year and released it only after it had been leaked by me. </PARA>
<PARA> The second handicap of Telecom is refusal to admit it to new technology. I mention two things. As a result of decisions of this Government, Telecom has been precluded from the basic videotex service, where there should be a natural partnership between a public instrumentality such as Telecom and private information providers, a partnership between private and public enterprise working in the best interests of the consumer. I do not know what the ideological basis of that decision was; I can only guess, but the result of the Government's decision in relation to videotex is that users in Australia will be deprived of a service which they could already have had. That is a tragedy in terms of the development of communications policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's second omission is the omission of Telecom from the board of Aussat Pty Ltd, the company responsible for the ownership and management of the domestic satellite. If it is good enough for the expected private sector users to be on the Board of that company-all the major television networks, for example-why is Telecom, a large potential user and possibly the largest user, not represented on the board. Why, for that matter, is the Australian Broadcasting Commission, another potentially big user, not represented on the board?</PARA>
<PARA> In the Opposition's view, it is essential that Telecom be modern and efficient, but it is also necessary to have an orderly and fair national telecommunications policy which is freed from ideological stupidity. For instance, Telecom mentions in the document moves towards a national integrated digital network. That is sensible, but it has implications for planning and policy in many areas-data networks, news services, cable television and the like. Under this Government it seems unlikely that such mature consideration will occur. I lament this fact and I appeal to the Government to read this report and to act on it in an intelligent and constructive way in the development of a rational communications structure in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report, whilst it deals with the salaries and allowances of members of parliament, will be the subject of a special piece of legislation which is already projected to be in the House of Representatives. Therefore, in the 10 minutes available to me, I shall obviously not canvass all the questions that will be discussed during the passage of that legislation. There are, nevertheless, a couple of points that ought to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister intervened during the latter stages of the consideration of parliamentary salaries and allowances by the Remuneration Tribunal and sought to suggest that wages are the main contributing factor to the economic problems facing this country, a matter which is not accepted by the Australian Labor Party. We do not accept that ideological position. We believe that it is a class acceptance by the Prime Minister and one that is not borne out in any proper analysis of the problems facing the Western world in respect to the current recession. Attempting to suggest that a cut in wages and salaries is the panacea to the sort of problems facing our country and the Western world is much too simplistic. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Remuneration Tribunal has said, it does not believe that members of parliament should be placed in any position that puts them at a disadvantage as compared with other sections of the community. I remind the Senate that the Remuneration Tribunal's earlier recommendations, which we dealt with in the last session of Parliament, awarded wage increases that took the 2,000 members of the Public Service Second Division to a salary level of $43,000, in round figures, which was a 14 per cent increase, without one reference by the Prime Minister or the Liberal Government to the degree of increase in that determination. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy for the Prime Minister and members of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party, the great majority of whom have other incomes, to talk about wage and salary restraint, when they are in receipt of not only parliamentary salaries but, in most cases, also other forms of income. That is particularly so in respect of the Cabinet. So many graziers with large properties, solicitors and other professional people make up the great bulk of the Cabinet. It is very easy for them to sit in their ivory castle and suggest that other members of parliament and, for that matter, all other members of the community, should practise wage restraint when they apply it to themselves only in respect of the salaries they receive as members of the national Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Remuneration Tribunal's report, which will be the subject of legislation , the increases granted to the judges of the various courts ranged from about $7 ,000 or $8,000. There has been no suggestion that there should be some wage restraint by that select group of people. I would remind the Senate that there are 185 members of parliament and 2,000 Second Division members of the Public Service. There is an increasing number of judges who come under the review of the Remuneration Tribunal. So a one-sided approach is being taken. I make that brief reference to what I believe to be the hypocritical position taken by the Prime Minister, an opportunist position and one which, of course, seeks to demean the whole role of parliament and its members who perform their function in that respect. </PARA>

<PARA> However, some other changes were made. This brings me to the Tribunal's decision to recommend the recognition of the extra work load involved in electorates which contain excessive numbers, a recommendation which I understand is to be accepted by the Government. This is a departure from previous categories and classifications. Up until now, such recognition has been afforded only to those electorates of greatest size, that is over 5,000 square kilometres . On this occasion, the tribunal has provided a third dimension and has taken this significant and important step. We have been arguing, of course, that extra pressures are imposed upon members of parliament with large electorates to contend with. We do have this absurd position where we have electorates in Tasmania approximating 52,000 to 53,000 voters and we have electorates in Queensland and New South Wales where there are in excess of 90,000 people on the electoral roll. The latest figures indicate that there are now 30 seats in the Australian Commonwealth Parliament, 30 electorates, which have either above or below the 10 per cent tolerance which is the legislation upon which the electorates of Australia should operate. It is anticipated that by 31 October that figure will apply to considerably more than 25 per cent of the electorates.</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal, in recognising this imbalance which this Government has failed to deal with in terms of any effective redistribution, has recognised the fact that electorates with large populations face particular difficulties and has therefore adjudged that they should be deserving of a special allowance. So the Tribunal has taken into consideration not only a size but also a population category. We are concerned, as an Opposition, at the distortion of the democratic principles that exist in the failure to draw boundaries in such a way as to bring about the obvious democratic principle of every vote cast in an election having one value. The fact that the Tribunal has taken the step of establishing a third category is an innovation which the Opposition welcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Tribunal has effected another change in the conditions of the travel allowance to the staff of members of parliament. I refer to clause 9.5 of the report. This year there is an additional clause which appears to have the effect of imposing a further restriction on the movement of staff members from the electorate to Canberra for parliamentary duties. We all recognise the onerous tasks that now fall upon members of parliament in regard to the greater complexities of a modern and developed society. The motive for this change seems to be to protect staff members from some unfair pressure that may have been applied by some members and senators to spend more time in Canberra on parliamentary duties than the allowance covers. While we appreciate the Tribunal 's attempt to protect staff in this way from the demands of their employer who happens to be a member of parliament, at the same time this clause also has the effect of punishing those members of parliament and their staff who use the flexibility of the current system to their general advantage and satisfaction. We believe it would have been reasonable for the Tribunal to recognise the fact that the staff of members of parliament are required in Canberra for parliamentary duties and to grant an adequate allowance for the fulfilment of those duties. When we have regard to the amount of work that our research staff is required to undertake from time to time, rather than reduce the flexibility of staff travel we would like to see some attempt made to eliminate the anomalies that exist. We consider that the Tribunal could better have given recognition to the need for the staff of members of parliament to make perhaps 20 trips to, and spend up to 100 days in, Canberra on parliamentary duties, whereas at the moment they are allowed only 12 trips and 72 days, which is clearly not in line with the parliamentary timetable. It seems to me that we are reaching a stage where the Tribunal and the Government ought to be recognising the value and the improvement in the debates that take place in the Parliament as a result of providing members of parliament with adequate resources to carry out their parliamentary duties. I hope that next year we will see some improvement and flexibility with regard to the question of the movement of our staff in and out of Canberra. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to make the point that I do not think an annual report like this ought to go through this chamber without some comment as to why the Department has been set up and some comment on the operation of the Department. The Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council was set up on 7 May 1982 because of a crisis in which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) then found himself. It was a crisis which arose because the then Minister for Defence was to be shifted , demoted or removed one way or the other. It was generally recognised by the Prime Minister and by commentators at the time that a move had to be made. Having made that decision, the Prime Minister then had to find some way to shelve the then Minister for Defence. The idea that he and his advisers came up with was one of creating the Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council and appointing a full time Minister. It was an $80,000 per annum answer to a problem that the Prime Minister was not strong enough to contend with and as a consequence we now have a Minister essentially without a job to do, without portfolio, and, as this annual report shows, without any purpose or function. </PARA>

<PARA> When we look at this report we find that it does not answer questions which annual reports normally answer. In fact, it raises more questions than it answers. If we go through it section by section, on page 1, under the heading ' Responsibilities and Functions' we are told that one of the functions of the Department is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Formal and ceremonial matters including in relation to the Parliament and the States. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a rather general statement. It does not give details of what formal ceremonial matters are involved, how many are involved, what number per week, and what in fact are the character of the functions. Are they more than tea parties? Are they organising matters of importance or otherwise? If we go on further in this section we are told that the Minister is responsible for:</PARA>
<PARA>summoning meetings of the Executive Council and presiding over meetings which the Governor-General is unable to attend. </PARA>
<PARA>One could be uncharitable enough to say that in this respect this current Minister may have been a better stopgap for a previous Governor-General than the present one. That statement once again leaves many questions open. It does not tell us whether the Minister is acting as anything more than a typist or a clerk in sending out notices and summoning meetings of the Executive Council. It does not tell us how many meetings are held. It does not tell us the degree to which the Minister is involved. We are told that he chairs the Legislative Committee of Cabinet. Once again we are not told how often the Committee meets. We are not told how often the Minister has had to chair that Committee. The Minister has to give advice on parliamentary matters generally. That probably explains why he spends so much time in the House of Representatives. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has also announced his intention to call on the Vice- President frequently to act in place of or represent other Ministers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He seems to be the twentieth man of the Cabinet. Once again, we do not have any details as to the actual functions performed. The next section raises questions and leaves them unanswered. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> By arrangement, advice and additional administrative support for the Vice- President are provided by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA>We are not told to what degree and to what extent, both financially and otherwise, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is involved in propping up this Department. However, we are told that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet advises the Vice-President on parliamentary matters and has provided for him the assistance of a parliamentary liaison officer. What this section shows is that the system of government, the Cabinet system, can continue quite well without this $80,000 indulgence. It shows that the mechanism is already there. The advice already goes to the leaders of the Government in the Parliament. We do not need this $80,000 diversion. </PARA>
<PARA> The final unanswered question which I have about this report concerns the actual cost of the report itself. When one looks at the finance section of the report one finds that an amount of $1,475 has been paid by way of salaries and $ 612 by way of administrative expenses. That seems a very small sum to be paid for salaries. We do not know whose salaries are involved. We do not know which officer is involved or his level. We do not know what the administrative expenses are. We do not know the cost of this report. It may well be that the cost of the report will be more than the actual finance provided from the Minister for Finance for the period of operation of this Department. As I said earlier, a number of questions arise out of this report which it does not answer . I think it is scurrilous that a government should set up such a mechanism to solve a ticklish problem for the Prime Minister. I give notice at this stage that when this Department is examined before Senate Estimates Committee A my colleagues and I will expect answers to the questions. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

The Board, at the end of its 1980-81 report, referred to the fact that it needed incentives to attract industry and business to Canberra because it was having difficulty in competing with other States and regions in this regard. The Board has had a considerable amount of success since it came into operation in attracting interest in Canberra as a place to develop private enterprise, both in the tourist area and in other areas. The Board has attracted to Canberra a number of national associations and corporate offices which are setting up their headquarters here and its has contracts with a number of people who have shown interest. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties the Board has found, which was referred to in its report to the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), is that frequently a company or a firm expresses interest in expanding but because of the incentives that are given by other States and regions the Board has not been able to conclude the deal. The submission that the Canberra Association for Regional Development put forward to the Government earlier this year was accepted in the Budget. Money has been made available to enable the Board to offer incentives-not just incentives to bring new business to Canberra but also incentives in a situation where a firm is thinking of going somewhere-to make Canberra at least equally attractive with other places. I refer to that part of the Budget which was to the advantage of Canberra and of benefit to the Board, the Board having raised the matter of incentives. It is something that will be very worthwhile for the development of the private sector in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to raise a few matters which come under this general title. A situation seems to be arising on a number of occasions. For instance, the Senate began its sitting at 10 o'clock this morning. I found on my desk a list of some 18 papers which it was proposed would be presented today. Knowing that I had not received a copy of the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council report, I asked one of the attendants to obtain a copy for me. He came back and advised me that the report was not yet available. About 10 minutes prior to the end of Question Time I went to the records section of the Senate to request a copy. I was told that it was under embargo until such time as the Minister tabled the list of papers. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we have to stop for a moment and look at what this means. If it is the intention of the Government, by this action, to stifle debate on these papers, then it has certainly been successful. I suggest that no one could properly debate a report that is not presented to him or her until minutes before the matter is raised in the chamber. But that is by the by. It is time the Senate had a look at the situation and determined that all the papers that are to be presented on a Thursday should at least be circulated to members of the Senate at some stage during the week so that we have time to look at them. The majority of them are circulated. I understand that six papers were held under embargo until after the Minister reported to the Senate this morning that he intended tabling these papers. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Council is an extremely interesting one. It does not say very much; it is not very large. It does at least concur with other thoughts that have been put forward by much more learned people than I about radiation induced genetic abnormalities and radioactivity generally. Under the heading 'biological effects of ionising radiation' on page 1 a statement is made, I believe, for the first time in a government report. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Large doses of radiation are also known to produce delayed effects, usually after periods of several years. Much the most important of these are an increased incidence of malignant disease in exposed individuals and of genetic change, manifested in their offspring. Increased numbers of human cancers have occurred, particularly in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as a consequence of the atomic explosions in 1945. Radiation-induced genetic abnormalities have been studied in experimental animals but have not yet been observed in man. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to make the point that certain levels of background radiation in industry should be contained to particular levels. This raises a very important issue which I have mentioned in this chamber on a number of occasions. It concerns the mineral sands operation in Capel. Honourable senators will appreciate that, whilst the question that I raised on those occasions concerned what the Federal Government intended to do about radioactive monazite in Capel, I was informed by the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) that this was strictly a State matter. The situation now with Capel is that, of course, it cannot any longer be viewed as simply a State matter because the attitude of the Minister for Health in that State is one of complete and utter ignorance. There is a saying that a little knowledge is dangerous. I have to agree with that. The Minister for Health in Western Australia has little knowledge about radioactive substances and he is therefore a very dangerous person. He is dangerous to the community. The attitudes that he adopts are not confirmed by leading people working in the field of radioactivity nor by those people who have been concerned for many years in that area. For instance, I quote briefly from an article in the Daily News of Wednesday, 7 June 1982, by Frazer Guild. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> A scientist who helped to develop the atom bomb is alarmed at radiation levels in the mineral sands town of Capel. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australia Government has insisted there is no health risk. But Professor Joseph Rotbalt, now emeritus professor of physics at the University of London, says urgent action should be taken to clean up the town. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not intend to read the whole article because I do not have time to do so in the debate on this report. I will raise it at another time. Another article by the same newspaper on Wednesday, 2 June, states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is time for the Western Australia government to face the truth about Capel. </PARA>
<PARA> There are serious risks living and working with radioactive mineral sands. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia's Minister for Health, Mr Young, continues to insist that there are not, but Professor John Gofman, a scientist of world stature, has answered government and industry assurances in the strongest possible terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The government's complacent attitude astonishes him. </PARA>
<PARA>I must admit that it astonishes me too. I have a report to the Australian Workers Union on radiation hazards in the mineral sands industry compiled by Dr Philip Jennings, who is Associate Professor of Physics at the Murdoch University in Western Australia. One of the points that he makes in his report is:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . management should take measures to ensure that radiation dose rates are less than 2.5 millirem per hour in specially designated radiation areas and less than 0.1 millirem per hour elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>The report details a number of areas where this level is exceeded. For instance, in the monazite store the dose rate goes from 0.5 millerem to 50 millerem per hour. Indeed one has to question what the Western Australia Department of Health is doing. If we really want to know we need only look at a series of questions that were asked in the State Parliament concerning this radioactive substance. The questions were posed by Mr Barry Hodge, the shadow Minister for Health, and were answered by the Minister for Health, the same Mr Young, who is quoted in the newspaper reports. For instance, one of the questions asks:</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the high radiation levels adjacent to stored monazite which he reported in his reply to question 37 of 1982, is his department concerned about the doses received by drivers transporting this material?</PARA>
<PARA>He replied:</PARA>
<PARA> No, the drivers are not adjacent to the packaged monazite. </PARA>
<PARA>Another question is:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it a fact that the regulations of the Radiation Safety Act specify a maximum radiation dose rate of 2.5 millerem per hour in the cabin of a truck transporting radioactive materials?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's response was:</PARA>
<PARA> This is another misquotation or misrepresentation of the regulations. The regulations do not mention the cabin of the truck. However, the maximum of 2.3 millirem per hour is specified for drivers. </PARA>
<PARA>I have to ask this Minister for Health where he thinks the men are manipulating the truck from. Are they sitting out in the back and driving it or are they perhaps sitting on the bonnet? Let me assure the Minister that the majority of truck drivers that I know sit in the cabin of the truck to drive it. The questions go on:</PARA>
<PARA> Are drivers transporting monazite monitored for radiation dose?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is:</PARA>
<PARA> No. </PARA>
<PARA>The next question is:</PARA>
<PARA> If not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer is:</PARA>
<PARA> Knowledge of radiation dose rates from monazite duration and frequency of transport renders monitoring unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA>I raised this issue in this chamber in February of this year because of my concern for the health of the people in Capel. All of the things I said then and the request that I made to the Federal Government at that time are now being substantiated not only by newspaper journalists but also by world authorities- experts recognised for the contributions they have made in the radiation field. Yet we have a situation where the Federal Government is still sitting on its tail and doing very little because of the State-Federal government degree of responsibility. I was rather horrified not to see any mention in this report of monazite, xenotime or any of these other things that are being found in Capel. I hope that now the matter has been brought to the attention of the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council it may see fit, before the next report is presented to this Parliament, to ensure that it at least visits Capel and looks at the monazite industry there. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that the reference to the Senate House Committee of the organisation, operation, functions and financial administration of the Joint House Department resulted from the Estimates Committee A examination of that Department's proposed expenditure for 1981-82. Estimates Committee A reported that, in the context of the savage reduction in funds for books for the Parliamentary Library, it was puzzled by the extraordinary priorities which led the Joint House Department to propose expenditure on such items as sporting equipment and uniforms for security attendants. In addition, rueful comparisons were made by Estimates Committee A between the ample funds provided to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and the relatively minimal amounts made available to the Senate standing committees and select committees. Estimates Committee A considered that further examination of the Joint House Department was required and recommended to the Senate that the matter be referred to the Senate House Committee for inquiry and report. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the House Committee's invitation to senators and members for submissions, some members of the House of Representatives suggested that, whilst they agreed there was a need for an inquiry into the Joint House Department, the matter would be more appropriately examined by a joint committee. The Senate Committee pointed out in reply that each House has a duty to take such steps as it thinks necessary to inform itself on matters coming before it. </PARA>
<PARA> To meet this objective, the Senate had developed the practice whereby Estimates committees recommended to the Senate that certain matters which appeared to warrant further detailed consideration should be referred to the appropriate Senate standing committee for investigation and report. The reference to the Senate House Committee is therefore an example of the follow-up process adopted by the Senate when considering its attitude to matters arising from Appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> In all, the Committee received seven formal submissions, and eight organisations represented by 18 persons gave further evidence during seven public hearings and one in camera hearing. In addition, two senators and three members of the House of Representatives had dicussions with the Committee and the views of other interested organisations were presented. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain of the submissions directed the Committee's attention to the review by Urwick International Pty Ltd of the Joint House Department, the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Reporting Staff which, according to evidence given by the Speaker to the House of Representatives Estimates Committee A on 28 August 1980, recommended the amalgamation of those three departments. The House Committee was also informed that there was considerable disquiet among certain of the parliamentary staff that such an amalgamation might be agreed to and the Committee was urged to call for a copy of the management consultant's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee determined that, since part of the reference from the Senate directed its inquiry into the organisation and functions of the Joint House Department, a thorough examination would have to embrace any proposals for new functions or the taking over of existing functions from other parliamentary departments. The Committee formed the opinion that it would be of considerable benefit to its deliberations if a copy of the report were made available by the President as an in camera document. The Committee subsequently commenced its program of public hearings and found that validity of its opinion confirmed by the evidence given at the hearings. In addition, the officers of the Joint House Department, when giving evidence to the Committee, referred on a number of occasions to recommendations of the Urwick report. </PARA>
<PARA> After an exchange of correspondence with the Presiding Officers, the Committee as a last resort raised the matter in the Senate, and the President, at the direction of the Senate, transmitted to the Committee a copy of the Urwick report as an in camera document. Honourable senators will recall that I gave a full account of this matter to the Senate on 19 May 1982. During its examination , the Committee considered the specific recommendations of Urwick International Pty Ltd. However, these have not been listed in the Committee's report. The Committee, nevertheless, felt it necessary to draw on certain information in the Urwick report in the compilation of this report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee approached the inquiry on the basis that its task was to inform the Senate of any inadequacies and deficiencies in the Joint House Department and to recommend how such problems might best be overcome. It did not see as its role the review and check of detailed administrative procedures, but rather the identification of matters for decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was most disturbed by what the inquiry into the Joint House Department revealed. Despite a number of inquiries and reviews of the Department over the years, significant change seems to have passed by the Joint House Department. The Secretary of the Department told the Committee that the Joint House Department was badly structured and that it had been inefficient simply because of the organisational structure. However, the overall evidence suggests to the Committee a lack of leadership, and management inaction or inability to respond to changed circumstances and resultant problems. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the Committee's inquiries reveal that the lack of action in response to recommendations for modernisation of the refreshment rooms accounting systems has denied information essential for good management. This finding is underlined by the realisation that the members' bar has made a profit on only two occasions in the last quarter of a century. </PARA>
<PARA> In another area, after a period of two years virtually nothing has been done to assess the desirability of contract cleaning for the Parliament, despite the probability that substantial savings of public funds-up to $200,000 per annum- may have been effected. In another area, the Committee found that an attempt to have a public relations position created was an example of unsatisfactory administrative practice, disappointing and misleading management, and a performance far less than that expected of a parliamentary department. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Urwick report, what emerged from the Committee's inquiry is that there is considerable disquiet among certain of the parliamentary staff that its recommendations will be implemented without sufficient opportunity to comment. Rumour has fed upon rumour because the report has been treated as secret and has been dealt with in such a way that all sorts of fears and alarms have been aroused. The Committee now asks the Presiding Officers, one or both, to table the Urwick report to put an end to the unhealthy and damaging speculation that has been created. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that in recent years the number of meetings of the Joint House Committee has been reduced to a mere handful, thus reducing the opportunities that senators and members have for at least some input into matters that closely concern them. The Committee noted that although the Presiding Officers have statutory powers in relation to the staff of parliamentary departments, nothing has been done by the Senate and House of Representatives to delegate responsibility for policy in relation to the functions of the Joint House Department. Thus, by default and usage, the situation has developed whereby the Presiding Officers have taken the responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes, therefore, that each House should resolve to empower their respective House Committees, when sitting together as the Joint House Committee, with the executive responsibility for policy in relation to the functions of the Joint House Department. For too long senators and members have been denied effective participation in decision-making in Parliament's domestic matters, perhaps to the cost of all concerned as aspects of the Committee's report indicates. I understand that the debate on this report will resume later today, and for this reason, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is in response to the motion the Senate passed on 25 March 1982 that :</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Senate refer to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, as a matter of urgency, the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the relevance of an aircraft carrier to Australia's current and perceived strategic environment;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the role of an aircraft carrier in the defence force structure of Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the effects of the purchase of an aircraft carrier on the future defence procurement program; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Committee be requested to report not later than 1 September 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> On 20 April 1982, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence passed a motion requesting its Sub-Committee 'C', the Sub-Committee on Defence Matters, chaired by my colleague in another place, the Honourable R. C. Katter, M.P., to conduct an inquiry leading to the preparation of this report. The reference has attracted considerable public interest, and a wide range of submissions was received. The Committee wishes to thank those people who, in many cases, took considerable trouble to assist it with this inquiry. Many conflicting claims were included in the written submissions and evidence gathered at the Sub- Committee hearings. The Committee has sifted that evidence carefully and, in the report, discusses the major issues which need to be considered to reach conclusions relating to the reference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government's offer to permit the British Government to withdraw from the sale of the HMS Invincible, which has been accepted, provides a fresh opportunity to review the value of an aircraft carrier to Australia's Defence Force structure, and the priority such a purchase should be accorded. Discussion on the purchase of the Invincible, has increased public awareness of the issues involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has noted statements by the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) that all options, including a decision not to purchase a carrier, will be considered. The Committee acknowledges that an aircraft carrier can provide many functions which would be valuable in the Australian Defence Force. At the price at which HMS Invincible was to be made available, a credible case could be made for its purchase. However, at the full project cost which would be involved in the acquisition of a specially designed ship, in the context of present defence spending levels, it is harder to justify such a purchase. Other desirable acquisitions would have to be curtailed or delayed unacceptably for the Australian Government to purchase such an aircraft carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1982-83 Budget, 16.5 per cent of defence expenditure is allocated to capital equipment. This is still far short of the Government's target of 25 per cent in 1984-85, which was announced on 25 March 1980. Last year the proportion of defence expenditure on capital equipment was only 12.5 per cent, and the year before that it was 16 per cent. HMS Invincible, was to be acquired primarily for anti-submarine warfare. The Committee reached the conclusion, based on evidence received, that the most substantial requirement for anti-submarine warfare operations would be associated with the consequences of global war. However, the Committee received evidence that the contingency of anti-submarine warfare during prolonged global war, which is seen as remote, has not been a factor in recent or current planning of Australian Defence Force structure. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the assessment that the contingency of general nuclear war is highly unlikely on all rational calculations, priority is not accorded to developing the capability of the Australian Defence Force in relation to nuclear conflagration. Current defence planning is based on the premise that, in circumstances of general conventional war, the objective would be to employ our forces in a complementary role with allied forces, especially in our own region. The contingency of global conventional war is not, therefore, seen as a specific factor determining the characteristics of the forces. An aircraft carrier could also be effective in the lower level contingency situations which are identified in the report. It is then a matter of judgment what priority should be accorded to the various situations in which it would be effective, and the extent to which it would be effective in those situations. It is a matter of fact, however , that, except in its command and control function, an aircraft carrier is a platform, rather than a weapons system. The weapons systems are its aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was presented with varying project costs for the aircraft complement of a carrier. It seems likely that this will cost in the range of $ 500m, if a STOVL capability and additional ASW helicopters are provided. The project cost of a platform required to make these weapons systems effective would range, now that Invincible is no longer available, up to $1,000m or more. It is this very high platform cost which caused the Committee considerable concern. In the discussion on disruption to our sea lanes, argument was presented to the Committee that the carrier could be useful in escorting important cargoes in prolonged global war, or in regional conflicts involving a notional enemy with a strong submarine capability. Scenarios for these threats were necessarily vague. The Committee noted the existence of other elements of our naval forces capable of performing an escort function. </PARA>
<PARA> In a regional context, we are confident that Australia would be able to internationalise a situation in which an enemy disrupted our sea lines of communication. We accepted that it could be done for a short period, but we did not accept that the enemy could sustain its action without attracting sharp responses from the owner states of affected ships. Moreover, the Australian response to such a situation need not be directly related to the enemy activity: for example, we could retaliate with attacks against the enemy bases. The Committee also considered the role of an aircraft carrier in relation to external aggression against a regional country, particularly in the Indonesian- Melanesian archipelago, and to New Zealand. This vast area, extending out to beyond 7,000 nautical miles from the Australian mainland, is of abiding and fundamental concern to Australia, and New Zealand, and of considerable strategic interest to the United States. The Soviet Union could be interested in improving its influence in and access to the area if this could be done without provoking too strong a reaction from Australia, New Zealand and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be said, however, that this consideration would not be of the same order of priority as that assigned to deterring an intermediate level of threat to Australian territory. The extent of concern, and Australia's ability to influence such events, would be determined by proximity-developments in New Guinea would be of more concern than those in Samoa or Tahiti-and by prevailing political circumstances. There ought to be no assumptions of any direct Australian involvement in difficult domestic political circumstances in the south west Pacific islands. The Santo rebellion, when Vanuatu became independent , is sometimes mentioned as an example of the kind of South Pacific situation in which an aircraft carrier could be useful. One should remember, however, that the Department of Defence and the Australian Government were very reluctant about Australian military involvement in that instance and, furthermore, that kind of situation is most unlikely to arise again in the South Pacific. There are problems as New Caledonia approaches independence, but it is unlikely that the French Government and people would tolerate a repetition of their North African or Indo-Chinese decolonisation experiences. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the capability for power projection into the south west Pacific islands should not be regarded as having a higher priority than capabilities designed to deter or meet threats to Australian territory. During its inquiry, the Committee identified deficiencies in other elements of our Defence Force which, it believes, should have a higher priority in the Defence Force development program. For example, the existing F111 force, and the projected FA18 force have a potent strike, including maritime strike, potential. That potential would be considerably enhanced if they could carry out strikes to greater ranges than can be achieved with their present fuel capacities. This could be attained by the acquisition of an in-flight refueling capability. Converted Boeing 707 aircraft would be quite suitable for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> A further capability which would considerably enhance the existing capability of elements of the Defence Force, would be an airborne early warning system against aircraft and surface targets. Used in conjunction with the Jindalee over -the-horizon radar system, such a capability, provided for example by Grumman E2C aircraft, would greatly enhance the effectiveness of other land and sea based units of the Defence Force. Airborne early warning aircraft, such as the E2C, are expensive and four to six of them would be required but the multiplier effect they provide to other capabilities would far outweigh their costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted large gaps in military capable airfields in the northern arc of Australia. The airfield under construction at Derby will improve the situation in the north-west, particularly if its development is advanced rather than retarded. A significant gap will remain in the north between Darwin-Tindal and Townsville. The Committee received evidence that Gove and Weipa are under consideration as military capable airfield sites. The Committee supports the construction of an airfield at one of these sites, from which land based operations in the Arafura Sea and Gulf of Carpentaria would be facilitated. In association with Jindalee and an airborne early warning capability, there is a further urgent need to provide land based microwave radars. In respect of air defence, a microwave radar system is required to provide the necessary information relevant for the command and control of air defence. It is the Committee's view that this capability should extend across the sensitive northern arc of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence planning in recent years has assumed that the defence budget would approach 3 per cent of gross domestic product per year. Such a level of spending can be expected to continue while the current relatively favourable strategic environment obtains. If no aircraft carrier purchase is made, other measures to retain fixed wing flying skills of the fleet air arm are available. The Committee has expressed concern in the report about the viability of the fleet air arm if it operates only ASW helicopters. It believes that the fleet air arm has special capabilities in maritime operations which would be important to maintain. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should consider the possibility of some or all of the Orion PC3 long range maritime patrol aircraft being transferred to the fleet air arm, as part of a maritime command structure. It should also consider utilising the Trackers, for their remaining life, in coastal surveillance tasks as they have a special capability in this regard and would be operated by dedicated, highly skilled professionals. At present, this valuable capability is not being used because 13 of the existing 19 Tracker aircraft are in storage. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the A4 Skyhawks will remain for the rest of their operational life , invaluable in providing a ground attack and maritime strike capability. In these roles, they have useful training and combat functions. They should therefore be retained in service as land based strike aircraft. In this way, experience in operating in a surveillance and combat role with the fleet will not be lost. Also, arrangements should be made to ensure that some fleet air arm pilots are familiarised with other aircraft in service with the Australian armed forces, so that broad experience in all aspects of maritime strike tasks is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to being given the reference to inquire into acquisition of an aircraft carrier, the Sub-Committee on Defence Matters was conducting an inquiry into the total Defence Force structure. This force structure inquiry followed on from the inqiury last year which resulted in the report which I tabled on 24 November 1981, 'Threats to Australia's Security: their nature and probability'. The Sub- Committee will now return to the inquiry into force structure, and will pay particular attention to the problems of naval force structure which have been revealed by its aircraft carrier inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I was criticised by some Government members when I moved the original motion that this matter go to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Some Government members pointed out to me that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence operates in a bipartisan way and that the matter should have been discussed with it first, particularly as it did involve an important Government policy decision. I take that criticism on board. If this situation arises in the future perhaps I will take that course of action. I must say, however, that I am particularly glad that I did move the reference and that it led to this excellent report. I should not conclude my statement without thanking the staff who assisted the Committee, particularly its secretary, Robert King, and also John Needham. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the first thing to be said about this Budget is that even the words of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) this time hold out little hope for the population of this country. Over the years we have become used to rosy predictions in Budget Speeches. However, in the opening words of the Budget Speech this year the Treasurer said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The international recession is now hitting us hard. Our overseas markets have shrunk. Economic growth has faltered. Unemployment is rising. Inflation remains far too high. Interest rates are hurting many of us. </PARA>
<PARA>That is surely one of the most gloomy openings to a Budget Speech that we have heard for a long time. The Treasurer went on in his Budget Speech to talk about, amongst other things, the place of the world recession and the fault, as he sees it, of the trade union movement in this country, in leading us to our present situation. In relation to the world recession, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Our economic policies and relative energy endowments created a more favourable investment climate in Australia than in most other countries. This sustained our economic growth beyond that of others. </PARA>
<PARA>The implication was that now, because of the international recession, we cannot sustain that growth. I would like to point out that this statement in the Budget Speech is not true. First of all, we really should look at what has happened to our country so far as economic growth is concerned in recent times. From 1972 to 1975 gross domestic product per head in Australia rose at an average annual rate of 1.9 per cent. This was higher than for the average of all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, which was then 1.2 per cent per annum. Since 1975 this situation has in fact reversed. In the five years from 1976 to 1980, the latest years for which OECD figures are available, per capita growth in Australia averaged only 1.2 per cent compared with 2.7 per cent per annum for the OECD area as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> This, I suggest, is a disastrous performance for Australia and one which underlines the lamentable failures of the economic policies of this Government. Australia now ranks eighteenth amongst OECD countries in terms of per capita output, compared with fifth in 1950. So much for the claim of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in 1975 that only a Liberal Government could properly run the economy and produce economic growth. In a period in which we have had conservative governments for all but three years we have in fact gone downhill. We have gone down the scales of these OECD countries. What policies does the Government now offer? What solutions to its failures of the past seven years has it offered? What lessons has it learnt from its past mistakes? From this Budget, it seems that it has in fact learnt nothing. It has offered more of the same old , ineffective medicine-screw down the money supply, keep demand low and keep up employment. I suggest that that is no solution at all. This Budget in fact holds out the abysmal prospect of no real growth in 1982-1983 and unemployment rising above 8 per cent, on the Treasurer's own predictions. Those measures in social security are aimed at relief for some of the disadvantaged, which we welcome, are too little in some cases and in all cases in fact are too late. </PARA>
<PARA> But the medicine this year is dressed up in a new bottle. The trade unions are to be offered a dose of Dr Fraser's elixir and asked to be good boys. They are asked not to worry that when the promised benefits will be taken away next year, which is what has happened regularly in the past. They are asked not to worry that Mr Fraser is notoriously incapable of keeping his promises in any case. They are asked not to worry that the living standards for families have fallen for all, except those on the highest incomes, over the last seven years. The Prime Minister now suggests that this year's Budget is an appropriate basis for co-operation with the union movement in achieving pay restraint, after seven years of trying to wield the big stick. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, the Australian Labor Party, has consistently advocated an equitable prices and incomes policy as the basis for re-establishing a sustained progress toward real growth. If one makes international comparisons one notices that those countries which have in fact used this sort of approach rather than a monetarist approach have done better than we have. I think it is fair to say that most economic commentators now concede that such a policy offers really the only chance of avoiding the excesses of recent years, whereby the only policy for reducing inflation has been higher unemployment. Any easing of monetary and fiscal policy which usually occurs just before an election, has led to a resurgence of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Government offer as a solution to this sort of impasse. While Mr Fraser and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) make overtures to the union movement, the Budget Papers are in fact telling a quite different story. I ask honourable senators to consider Part II of Statement No. 2 in the Budget. This is where we find Mr Fraser's and Mr Howard's real approach-the approach being urged by their Treasury advisers. That view is a simple and simplistic one. Essentially, restrictive demand policy will suppress wage fixation process. There can be no role for the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, for industry or even craft-based unions. In fact when one reads the statements one wonders whether there is any role for unions at all . Page 53 of Budget Statement No. 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA> While trade unions originally, established to serve social purposes, their ability within a highly industrialised economy to negotiate wage rates across whole sectors of industry and to seek to have them adopted as legally enforceable minima poses basic difficulties for the efficient functioning of labour markets and hence for the restoration of price stability and full employment. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that such a comment reflects a rather naive notion about how labour markets might work in the absence of centralised wage fixation and about the likelihood of the union movement in Australia being willing to tolerate the wage inequalities between people doing similar jobs that would inevitably be exacerbated by a policy of industrial devolution like this. The editor of the Australian Financial Review on Monday, 23 August, noted:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a concerted attack on unions is simply not compatible with a democratic society. The weakness of monetarist approaches to the control of inflation and wages is that they abstract from the political complexities of a democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Financial Review is not known for its radical views, nor is it particularly known for its support of Labor's economic policies. We have a situation in which the Prime Minister and his Industrial Relations Minister are in fact making placatory noises to the unions. The Budget Papers tell us a different story. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the Treasury has some doubts about its own prescription for wage restraint because, at page 52 of Budget Paper No. 1, the following statement is made:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . if . . . weakening in activity brought greater restraint in wage claims . . . it is more likely merely to be a recipe for stagflation. </PARA>
<PARA>This is apparently to be resolved by 'economic policies that consistently bear down on inflationary expectations', whatever that means in this context. However , it seems clear that the economic screws are to be kept on irrespective of the economic and social cost, in order to pander to some half-baked rational expectations theory being used by the Treasury in its latest rationalisation for a policy of doing nothing about unemployment. So much for the Prime Minister's talk about co-operation with the union movement. The fact is that Australia must find a solution to the evils of inflation and unemployment. It must ease the onerous burden, on the welfare dollar and the economy in general, of high unemployment and re-direct expenditures to improving rates and conditions. But punishing the unemployed is no solution. In fact, the unemployed must be put into jobs if one is to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> A measure of the Government's seven years of neglect in the social welfare area , which is my particular interest, and its continuing economic failures, is that even an 18 per cent rise in welfare expenditure-more than 7 per cent in real terms-in the Budget fails by a wide margin to restore real rates and conditions to those which prevailed when the Government took office. The Government does too little too late and, in the words of the Treasurer, the prospects are bleak. More than 30 per cent of the increase in spending will be attributable directly to the payment of unemployment benefits, due to the parlous state of the national economy. That is based on the estimates provided in the Budget Papers of an average of 395,000 beneficiaries in 1982-83. But, of course, there will be more than that. Already the figure, this July, stands at 405,000. Who can believe that the number will actually decline over the next 12 months? Certainly not the Treasurer. A more realistic estimate, based on projected growth in the labour force and labour shedding is that in 1983 unemployment will peak at 8 per cent or 9 per cent of the labour force so the number of beneficiaries is likely to exceed 500,000 and to average about 470,000 over the year. On that basis, expenditure will rise by $300m over that predicted in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA> The largest part of the increase in spending on welfare, or some 40 per cent, will flow from automatic adjustments to pensions and some benefit rates. That, too, is a measure of the Government's economic failure and inability to restrain inflation. These adjustments will not make pensioners any better off. They will only compensate them belatedly for price rises that have occurred some four to ten months previously. They will not restore pensioners to the parity with wage earners that they achieved in 1975. At present the single pension stands at less than 22 per cent of average weekly earnings, compared with 24.5 per cent in 1975 . Additional increases of $7 a week for a single person and $11 a week for a married couple would be needed to restore that relativity-even more if the Australian Labor Party's objective of raising pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings is to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we come to the areas of expenditure in regard to which there have been at least some real attempts to restore previous standards. Family allowances for first and second children are to rise by 50 per cent. Pension and benefit-free limits are to rise, as are fringe benefit income levels. We certainly do not oppose-rather, we welcome-that belated action. Supplementary assistance for those who are lucky enough to get the full rate will be up slightly. The single unemployed benefit for those who are 18 and over is to enjoy quasi-indexation, and be restored to half the married rate before again falling behind for another year. Even the young unemployed are at last to be thrown a bone-a $4 a week increase. Of course, we do not oppose those measures either. We merely wish that they would go much further. But even these measures in no way adequately compensate for past neglect. The apparent impression of overall generosity is soon dispelled once one realises that it is only a reaction to past meanness. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators to consider these facts: The increase in the family allowances has failed to restore their real values, to those which prevailed in 1976. A shortfall of 18 per cent remains-a significant cost, some $10 a month, for a two-child family. The increases in pension free areas to $30 and $50 still fall well short of the actual parity with pension rates achieved in 1972- implying amounts in November 1982 of $77.25 and $128.80. The new fringe benefit income limits of $56 and $90 still fail to catch up with their real value 10 years ago when they were set at a rate equal to the then pension plus the free area. The $10 a week free area for adult sickness and unemployment beneficiaries is still only half the real value of the $6 which was first set as long ago as 1969. The new rates of unemployment benefit for single beneficiaries, $40 and $ 64.40, go nowhere near the parity with pension rates originally set in March 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also introduced two new provisions, a family income supplement for low income families and a special rebate to remove from the tax net pensioners with small incomes. The latter is a reflection of the way the Government has allowed the tax threshold to decline in real terms since 1975-76 by its policy of non or partial indexation. In that year the single pensioner could earn $11 a week before tax was payable. In real terms that would now be $ 21. Since the proposed increase in the general tax threshold and the special pensioner rebate will operate for only two-thirds of the year, in 1982-83 a single pensioner earning more than about $16 a week will be taxed. This amount represents only half of the new free area for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads us to the deceptive and misleading nature of the tables which were put out by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in his statement on Budget night. Ostensibly, they were tables to show increases in the disposable income flowing form the new tax and spending measures announced. Tax assessments are based on income earned during the financial year, that is, from 1 July 1982 to 30 June 1983 in this case. The impact on disposable income of a tax change has meaning only in relation to its full year effect. If the change operates for less than a full year it must be apportioned over a full year to enable us to calculate meaningfully the effective disposable incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget Papers themselves the tax scales for 1982-83 are a composite of new and old. This means that Senator Chaney's tables are meaningless. Worse, they are deceitful because they are not properly qualified. All of the tax impacts are calculated as if they applied for a full year, whereas they apply for only two-thirds of the year. By the time they do have full effect in 1983-84 , inflation will again have raised the real tax burden on families so that they are likely to be worse off rather than better off. It is also worth noting that the increase in family allowances will apply for only two-thirds of 1982-83. Certainly, disposable incomes will rise in November but on an annual basis, which is the appropriate basis on which to consider family allowances as a form of tax cuts for families, which they are, the benefits are rather less. By 1983- 84 inflation will again have severely eroded the net gain. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the new family income supplement which is also included in the tables will apply for only two months of 1982-83. I suggest that if the Government and the Minister for Social Security were honest they would ask the Department to recalculate the disposable income tables in a meaningful manner. The tables should show tax, social security benefits and net benefits as a proportion of income for both 1981-82 and 1982-83. The income levels chosen should be adjusted so that they represent the same proportion of average weekly earnings in each year. Then we would see how much is really going to families and pensioners. We would also see how much pensioners are losing as their pensions continue to decline in relation to average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has described the increases in welfare expenditure in this Budget as representing 'particularly good value for money' since the initiatives included 'are designed as incentives to welfare recipients to improve their own positions and so become less dependent on government for direct assistance'. This just has to be a sick joke. When on the Government's own admissions unemployment will top 8 per cent or worse in 1983, when wholesale layoffs are occurring throughout the country, what chance for pensioners and beneficiaries, or anyone else, to improve their own positions? The Opposition supports these measures to help those with modest non-pension incomes but to dress them up in this spurious rationale is rather unconvincing, to say the least. It is particularly objectionable if it is used as an excuse not to help those whose needs are greatest, those entirely dependent upon pensions and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> What do these people entirely dependent on such assistance get? They get no family income supplement; pensioners and beneficiaries are excluded from that. There is to be no increase in the additional pension or benefit for children. That has not risen since November 1980 and will again fall in real terms. There is to be no increase in the mothers/guardians allowance for single parents. That is also unchanged since November 1980. The overall effect is virtually to cancel out the impact of the rise in family allowances. A sole parent with one child gains $1.75 a week from the increase, but will lose $3.78 a week on the other children's benefits by the time the higher rates of family allowances are introduced. A beneficiary with two children will suffer a net loss of $1.60 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The only real benefit for base rate pensioners is an extra $2 a week for those private renters eligible for the higher rate of supplementary assistance. On the Budget estimates only half of those now receiving supplementary assistance, or one in eight of all pensioners, will benefit from this measure. This $2 a week compares with a new tax rebate of up to $35 a week for those buying houses, irrespective of income or need. Widows and those on the unemployment benefit who are in the process of buying houses, having entered into mortages before they became disadvantaged, get no benefit because they pay no tax. So much for Senator Chaney's oft-stated commitment to help those most in need. Apparently different criteria of need are to apply to those not numbered amongst the undeserving poor. </PARA>
<PARA> The sole manifestation of the need-based welfare philosophy so long and proudly proclaimed by the Minister is the new family income supplement. But of course these families are very different from the wealthy home owners in the community. Their test of need is to be rather more strict; so strict, in fact, that many families below the poverty line will receive only a partial benefit and only something like one in 40 of all families potentially eligible will receive any benefit at all. The total cost of the family income supplement, estimated at $3. 5m this year and $30m in a full year, is only 1.5 per cent of the cost of an equivalent benefit payable free of an income test. That is a measure of how tight the family income supplement guidelines are. Restricting a benefit to those in need is one thing but making it so restrictive that almost no one gets it is another. </PARA>
<PARA> The full rate of family incomes supplement will be payable only to families with joint parental incomes below $184 a week, irrespective of their family size . Beyond that income level the supplement will be reduced by $1 for every $2 of income. By the end of 1982 the poverty line for a married couple with a head in the work force and two children will be about $195 a week. This line rises by roughly $28 for each additional child. It follows that families with two or more children and incomes below the poverty line will receive a family income supplement sufficient to narrow only half that gap, if that much. </PARA>
<PARA> Many low income families with a head in the full time work force will receive no family income supplement at all. Average weekly earnings for males stood at about $330 a week in June 1982. That they will be about $370 a week by the time the family income supplement is introduced in May 1983. Only about 5 per cent of full time male employees currently earn less than $220 a week. In no industry is the average minimum award wage less than $200 a week. To suggest that the family income supplement is for the working poor is clearly ludicrous. Only a government whose concept of need is quite out of touch with the reality of living conditions for ordinary Australians could introduce such a rigid needs test. Only a government steeped in hypocrisy could accompany it with indiscriminate handouts to wealthy businessmen and others in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Government and the Minister in particular have an easy and frequent response to criticism of the Government's welfare system. We hear that each dollar rise in the pension costs $100m. They ask where the money is to come from and how anyone else can do better. Never mind that the Government has now miraculously found $700m over and above inflation for welfare expenditure this year; something which, if I had suggested it two months ago, would have been severely criticised by those on the opposite side of the chamber. Never mind that the Government has suddenly found another $800m from the anticipated success of its anti-avoidance and anti-evasion measures. Apparently these revenues are available only to Liberal governments, not to governments of any other persuasion. </PARA>
<PARA> But of course revenues are available to finance welfare spending to look after those who cannot help themselves; revenues which even now the Government is forgoing to placate its business friends. Of course wasted expenditure could be diverted into welfare expenditure for those who really need help; of course the annual growth in taxation receipts allows the real value of pensions and benefits to be maintained; and, of course, economic growth, when it occurs-it should occur with sensible economic policies-allows rising real incomes to be redistributed to pensioners, beneficiaries and families without any diminution of the real incomes of those in the work force. It is the failure to achieve meaningful economic growth which is perhaps the greatest failure of this Government and a major reason that the welfare sector has been so savagely pruned over the last seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic ineptitude of the Government has hurt social welfare in several ways. It has directly contributed to the rising numbers on the unemployment benefit, from 184,500 in November 1975 to a disastrous 405,000 in July 1982. That figure is still rising and probably will rise to 500,000, not on my calculations but on the calculations of the Treasurer himself. This factor alone can be shown to have reduced by $850m, on the official figures, moneys available for other areas of welfare expenditure. Rising unemployment has had another less publicised effect on the welfare budget. It has caused many women and older workers to drop out of the labour force and join the ranks of the hidden unemployed. Many have been forced by lack of work to take up invalid pensions, service pensions and other benefits apart from the unemployment benefit. In a recent study entitled Hidden Unemployment: The Australian Experience, Stricker and Sheehan conclude that the official Australian Bureau of Statistics figures conceal nearly half the total unemployed; people who have dropped out of the labour force because they simply have no hope of finding a job. They also note:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the unemployment problem among older males has been almost entirely disguised by their withdrawal from the workforce, but especially in view of the bleak job prospects which many of these men have, this is a problem of the most serious dimensions. </PARA>
<PARA>Stricker and Sheehan estimate that of 112,000 hidden unemployed amongst males 45 years of age and over, two-thirds were drawing some form of pension and would not have been doing so if it were not for the state of the labour market. Including other groups affected, the overall cost of the welfare budget is estimated to be about $400m. That was in 1979-80 figures; it would be much higher now. A third avenue by which this slow economic growth affects moneys available for welfare is via its impact on taxation revenue. Economic growth raises real incomes, profits and expenditure. It automatically raises revenue from the income tax and other taxes. I am not referring to inflationary effects; I am talking about the real rises in tax revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have come the full cycle. The Government which promised to increase growth, reduce inflation, increase employment and reduce interest rates in 1975 with the slogan 'Turn on the Lights', presides over a Budget in 1982 in which the reverse of all these things has happened and, on the predictions of the Treasurer, will continue to happen. Economic growth is lower than it was in 1975 . By all the parameters the Government set in 1975, it has failed. Having failed so comprehensively, it has lost its right to govern. After seven years of this Government, no prediction the Prime Minister made, no prediction made for the Government in those heady days of 1975, has come to fruition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this Budget will come to be seen as an economically responsible Budget which has had particular regard for low income families and low income earners, a caring Budget that has particular regard for families. The help that has been given for families will be welcomed by them, especially those most in need and on the lower incomes. The family allowance for the first child has been increased to $22.80 a month, and for the second child to $32.55 a month. A family with two children gains $18.45 a month. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) indicated in his Budget Speech that about two million families in Australia would benefit from this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, that is not the only benefit. The family income supplement is to come into effect later in the financial year. It is an extremely unsatisfactory situation when people in employment choose to give up that employment because they see that they would be better off on the social welfare benefits they could then attract. Any system which allows that must be condemned. The allowance which is to be provided in this situation is very much a step which ought to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, I think that a situation in which pensions are taxed is a waste of resources. We need to see that the supplements and benefits paid do not then have to be paid back to the Government, so that the expense of paying money out, on the one hand, and collecting it again, on the other, is avoided. To assist those whose income is about $9,500, the rate of $10 per week per child tax free will give people in that situation who have a job the ability to remain in the job and retain their self-respect, rather than feeling that they are forced to go into the welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA> Families will also benefit by the personal tax cuts, and the tax free threshold is raised now to $4,595. As a result, about 300,000 Australians who it is estimated now are paying tax will no longer be paying tax. With the standard rate cut from 32c to 30c, for those on average weekly earnings this means an extra $7.65 a week. From those three things alone, on average weekly earnings a family with two children will be better off by about $19 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> There are benefits to families in the mortgage deductions for home loan interest rates. The proposal effectively cuts interest rates by about 2 per cent by giving a standard rate tax rebate on interest over 10 per cent on mortgages up to $60,000. A person with a $30,000 mortgage at 15 per cent benefits by about $8.65 per week. I welcomed the announcement that no tax will be payable on dividends up to $1,000. This is a significant step in the direction of abolishing double taxation on dividends and is a significant amount. It represents quite some savings for a number of people, not only families but also pensioners. It is particularly relevant in the area of the old age pension, where people have saved to have something for their old age. It is quite reasonable that such money should not be taxed and that they should be able to get the benefit of their thriftiness earlier in their lives.</PARA>
<PARA> There are benefits in the education budget to low income families through the increase in payments under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and secondary allowances. The means test will be liberalised for 1983, and the income on which the test will now be made has been increased by 11 per cent to $ 12,248. The amounts payable to the students who then qualify for the loans have also been increased, both in regard to TEAS and to the secondary allowance. The details, of course, have been given, but again it is a significant benefit to families on low incomes who wish their children to remain at school or go to university or college. There are benefits for the single income family through the increase in the dependent spouse rebate to the sum of $1,030 per annum, and benefits to families with only one parent, the sole parent, are raised by nearly 75 per cent, as far as the rebate is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many instances in the Budget where the Government has clearly demonstrated its concern for families and the place they hold in the community and the fact that they are regarded as being the basic social unit which provides the best environment for children to grow up in. At the same time, the children's services program has benefited. The Opposition has engaged in scare tactics from the beginning of this year about the children's services program. When it was announced that the program would be reviewed, the Opposition took that to mean that it would be cut out or cut back. There was a demonstration on the lawns outside Parliament House at which the Opposition did nothing to attempt to allay this fear, and in fact encouraged it. As recently as the week before the Budget, again the same sort of scare tactics were engaged in to try to make people think that we did not care about the standard of care for children that is provided so well by so many of the family day care programs. There are increases in several areas-I shall not go into them in detail-designed to provide quality care for children and to benefit the families who need it. There has been an increase in the rate of subsidy for either low income families or single parent families who rely on the family day care service to enable them to go to work and be a part of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The November and May pension indexations will continue, there have been extensions to the eligibility for fringe benefits, and there is the $1,000 tax free dividend benefit to which I have already referred. There has been an increase in supplementary rental assistance. The income that can be earned without reduction is increased, something that many people have been advocating. It has not been increased for some time, and it is an area in which there was room for improvement. I welcome the increase to $30 a week for single pensioners and $50 for couples, and more if they have children. </PARA>
<PARA> The limit for fringe benefits for medical and hospital treatment, pharmaceutical benefits and telephone rental concessions, has been increased, and a pensioner can earn $27.50 tax free on top of the pension without losing those benefits. It is without doubt in the area of losing benefits that so many pensioners have serious worries and concerns. I guess there has to be a cut-off point somewhere, unless one is able to provide a universal scheme, and of course there are always grey areas. Considerable hardship can be caused when someone goes over the limit by as little as a couple of dollars but is then faced with the enormous costs that follow. Perhaps there needs to be a sliding scale by which pensioners, if over the limit, can purchase the pensioner card at some rate. This would enable them to have the slightly higher income, which otherwise would have precluded them from the benefit, but still have adequate health care cover at a rate they can properly afford. I certainly hope that that is a scheme we will be able to work towards. Of course, many of the 300,000 people who will no longer be paying tax as a result of the increase in the threshhold to $4,595 per annum are in the pensioner group. As I said, it seems absurd, for the amount involved, for pensioners to have to be paying tax on pensions that they have received. </PARA>
<PARA> Those comments refer to a few of the items that relate to families. Of course, the people in the national capital benefit from this Budget in the same way as people in the rest of Australia benefit. But there are some matters in the Budget which relate specifically to the national capital to which I wish to refer in order to show that the Government does care for this place and does have some regard for the place it has in Australia. The national capital symbolises Federation, the coming together of the States. It is a place which belongs not just to the people who live here but to the whole of Australia. I think, as I have said previously, that those of us who live here certainly enjoy doing so. But I think all of us realise that although we have our homes here it is a place that belongs to the whole of Australia and should be regarded as such . I regard the new Parliament House very much as one of the symbols of that Federation. I was certainly disappointed to hear the Australian Democrats attacking it as they did recently. As I understand it, it is on target as far as cost is concerned and on time as far as construction is concerned. I hope it will stay that way as far as both are concerned. It is providing significant employment in this town and I regard the attack upon it by the Australian Democrats as showing a complete lack of concern for employment in the national capital. Any suggestion that its progress should be stopped would interfere seriously with employment in the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has responsibilities in Canberra not only as the federal Government but also as the State Government and municipal Government. The House of Assembly has no legislative powers and is, to a very large extent, an advisory body. I think the Government has shown that it accepts its responsibilities of a State and municipal nature by what it has done in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another aspect of Canberra which needs to be pointed out. We are regarded generally as an affluent community. It is a new community and being new , it looks clean and spotless, and it is. But that tends to be confused with affluence. I would concede that the figures show that 24.6 per cent of the population have salaries over $26,000 per annum. But at the same time 12.7 per cent of the population are on incomes below $6,000, as was shown in the last census. So the benefits to families and students to which I have referred are of particular relevance to a number of families in this community. I think it is necessary to repeat these facts so that the general attitude of regarding Canberra as an affluent and pampered community can be put into its proper perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Budget this year with respect to the national capital reflects the effort that the private sector has put into preparing papers for the Government to read and to understand, and to learn about the position of the private sector here. There are no natural industry or natural resources here and it is difficult to attract any industry to Canberra that needs to bring raw material here and take them away again. So the areas of technology and tourism are particularly important and as the city grows, of course, so is the building industry. The private sector is quite small and has suffered from a number of government cut backs over the last couple of years. The Canberra Association for Regional Development has been formed. This Association has put a number of papers to the Government, in particular the one that has been accepted and presented in this Budget. It was prepared at the initiative of the association and relates to the matter of incentives to enable the Canberra Development Board to compete with other States and regions to attract to Canberra the sorts of tourist industries and technological industries which can provide jobs in this community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is jobs that we need in this community. The Public Service provides jobs, but those of us who live here and have children here, are all concerned to have a more diverse range of jobs available that children can enter into and embark upon as careers. I would like to see the situation where no young person would have to leave Canberra to find the sort of employment that he or she would wish. It is by developing the private sector that we will create a more interesting community for public servants and their children and for those in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget the Commissioner for Housing has been allocated $27.8m to provide housing. I have no doubt that that allocation will be taken up during the year. It will provide jobs in the construction of houses and it will enable a number of people to go into their own homes. In addition, there is a program for the construction of 300 government houses during the next financial year. On a smaller note, but significant, and in order to provide some immediate housing, the Minister for Housing and Construction will be able to purchase 20 houses for the welfare housing scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget the tourist area has been looked after in a way that I regard as satisfactory, given the importance of tourism to Canberra. We are not in any sense competing with the sort of money that Singapore spends on tourism and, given our population, perhaps we cannot. But I think the success of Singapore as a tourist centre indicates what can be done when money is put into tourism. An amount of $504,000 has been allocated for promotion of tourism and $214,000 has been allocated for the opening of the Melbourne office of the Australian Capital Territory Tourist Commission. This is something that we have been looking for for some time and I certainly hope that the money will be available soon so that the office may be opened and operating as soon as possible. About 70 per cent of Australian tourists to Canberra come from New South Wales and there is undoubtedly a job to be done in attracting Victorians here as well. Another $30, 000 has been allocated on a dollar for dollar basis to the Canberra Visitor and Convention Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to the public works program. The budget for the National Capital Development Commission has been maintained and even increased a little. The Australian Defence Force Academy has the allocation to enable it to continue . An amount of $47m has been allocated for the new Parliament House, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation headquarters and a number of smaller extensions and alterations, mainly to the national monuments that make up the national capital. I certainly welcome the size of that allocation because of the need to keep a balanced building program going. It is important that the building program be consistent, that it does not continue on a stop and start basis, so that we can have a stable work force living here and so that jobs are available which will enable skilled tradesmen to move from one job to the next and not find themselves in and out of work. I think the Budget for 1982 indicates that this position can be restored. I refer in this regard to the establishment of the Cabinet committee for the Australian Capital Territory. Many ministries are involved in the running of the Australian Capital Territory, the Department of the Capital Territory being just one of them, but certainly a larger one. I think the setting up of this committee is important so that Ministers can evaluate the whole of the Budget for the Australian Capital Territory and not merely look at it-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer now to the municipal Budget papers. Perhaps for continuity I should have done so earlier. The figures on page 5 of that paper indicate something which I believe many people do not always understand. It is frequently said that we do not pay rates in Canberra. Page 5 of this document cites figures for 1981-82 and 1982-83 and compares the Canberra average with the six State capital cities. It shows that Canberrans pay an average total of $528. In the States the figure ranges from $470 to $540. It is reasonable to place that on record so that people will appreciate that we do pay our way. In looking at that document one will also see that most fees and charges have gone up during this year. It is unfortunate-I guess we would prefer it otherwise-that most of them have gone up merely by the inflation rate. Some others have been adjusted. They are ones which have not been adjusted in the last few years. Now they will be looked at annually. Certainly it is not true to say that Canberra does not pay its way. I believe the Commonwealth Grants Commission report, which I hope will be available soon, will prove that that is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the field of education, the money available for government schools has been maintained to see that the services will continue. New primary schools are to be built at Richardson and Gowrie. Funds have been made available for capital development for non-government schools. There is also a program, which I welcome , to fix the ventilation systems in government schools. I will not go into the details of the story here, but it is certainly an allocation which was necessary . There is an additional benefit locally, which perhaps comes under the State or municipal category. Concessions at the rate of 15 per cent have been made available to all pensioners for both the licence and vehicle registration. </PARA>
<PARA> An adjustment to payroll tax took place on 2 August, which was a bit ahead of the Budget. This occurred much latter than I would have liked, but at least the adjustment has been made retrospective to the date in September of last year when New South Wales last adjusted its payroll tax. The Treasurer has indicated that the procedures for adjusting the Australian Capital Territory payroll tax into line with New South Wales will be streamlined. I certainly welcome that. </PARA>

Most States allow that scheme to operate without the payment of payroll tax. That is not yet the case in the Australian Capital Territory. I hope that it will come into being. In this year's Budget, as in last year's Budget, the Treasurer indicated that these matters and other adjustments were being made to bring the Australian Capital Territory into line with the States. The Budget shows that the Government does care for the people who need and have needed assistance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; When the Budget was brought down just nine days ago it was hailed by those opposite as a family Budget. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) set the stage early in his Budget Speech by virtually describing it as a 'family Budget'. The Australian Labor Party has no argument with measures that improve the lot of Australian families. In fact, in our 1980 policy speech we mentioned this in quite some detail. The matter of families and relief for families was emphasised. I wish to illustrate this by quoting from the 1980 policy speech by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Hayden, in relation to two statements-there were many more-that he made about families. In the very early part of his speech he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we have to ensure is the economic security of Australian families . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Later on he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I make no apology whatever for the fact that our basic economic strategy is a policy of six broad programs to reverse the decline in family living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> These programs concern taxes, housing, jobs, petrol and energy prices, family health care, and family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>Just two years ago that was emphasised in the policy speech of the ALP. We certainly support any measures which would improve the lot of Australian families. Apparently our remarks and policies have made this Government come to a realisation that Australian families must be helped. We have now had almost seven years of a harsh Fraser government. During that time the Government's policies have left many families struggling. To illustrate this point I outline some of the economic statistics which were issued on the eve of the Budget. I quote from a document entitled 'Round-up of Economic Statistics' prepared by the Treasury which, among other things, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Preliminary national accounts estimates . . . suggest that, in seasonally adjusted terms, real gross non-farm product declined by 0.7 per cent in the December quarter 1981 followed by a further decline of 0.3 per cent in the March quarter 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, when the Government prepared the Budget it had to work with an economy that was moving backwards. There was no expansion in the economy. There was an actual decline. This was suggested in statistics suplied by the Treasury. Later on the document stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Retail sales, seasonally adjusted, declined in value by 0.9 per cent in May . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Australian economy had moved backwards. The document also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . new motor vehicle registrations remain buoyant. </PARA>
<PARA>Because they remain buoyant, I suppose extra sales taxes were placed on them to put the motor vehicle industry into a decline, as has occurred in other areas of the economy. The document of the Treasury further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In May, the number of building approvals for new dwellings fell by 7.0 per cent ; for the March quarter new dwelling commencements declined in number by 20.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>With the rises in interest rates over which this Government has presided, and for which it is totally responsible, these trends are understand- able. The document showed that housing was on a decline when we went into the Budget. The Treasury document also mentioned employment. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Employment, seasonally adjusted, appears to have peaked in March 1982 and has declined by 0.4 per cent between March and May. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that we are in August we have subsequent figures to show that that decline has been a steady decline and is getting worse. In relation to unemployment the paper stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate increased in June 1982 to 6.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently, unemployment is now a massive problem in the Australian economy. It is with this type of economy that we came into the Budget that was announced just nine days ago. On reading that document it seems to me a shocking record for a Government that has been in power for seven years. I have been a member of parliament for those seven years. In fact, I came here when this Government came to power. Every year since then we have had a Budget in which we have been promised that things will get right. But the economy has become so bad that in this Budget the Treasurer has had to admit that things are not good at all and they will probably not get better for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government came to office with promises of lower inflation, lower interest rates and lower levels of unemployment. What we have had in 1982 is high inflation, record interest rates and disastrous levels of unemployment. Against this background of abject failures after about seven years in power the Treasurer brought down what the Government regarded as a family Budget. But is it really a Budget for Australian families or is it a sugar-coated document which the Government will use later this year if it loses its nerve and goes to the polls? I suspect it was designed for the latter. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to examine some of the ostensibly more palatable aspects of the Budget before moving to that part which is laced with castor oil or lemon juice or both . First I deal with personal income tax. We are told that there will be reductions in personal income tax. Of course any reductions in personal income tax would be welcomed. But are the proposed reductions as attractive as they initially appear in the Budget? The short answer to that question is no. In fact , the section on personal income tax in the Treasurer's Budget Speech is disgustingly misleading. I would have expected a Treasurer to tell the truth in his Budget Speech. Unfortunately, in this section of his Speech on personal income tax the truth is glossed over. An attempt is made to make the Budget appear better than it actually is. I will illustrate that point. When the Budget Speech was delivered we were told that the threshold of $4,195, before which tax is payable for pensioners and low income earners, would be increased by $400 to $4,595. For those people who may read Hansard later, I would like to mention that by using 'threshold' in this context, we mean the level of income which must be earned before tax becomes payable. I quote the section of the Budget Speech which outlined this aspect of raising the threshold. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> This means that no tax will be payable until a taxpayer's annual income exceeds $4,595. As a result of this change alone about 300,000 pensioners and low income earners who would otherwise pay tax in 1982-83 will not now do so. </PARA>
<PARA>If we turn to Budget Paper No. 1 we see that a different story is revealed. Again, for those who may read Hansard, I mention that a series of Budget Papers are produced and Budget Paper No. 1 contains detailed information on the Budget and expands on the broad announcements of the Treasurer. An examination of Budget Paper No. 1 reveals that those who will not pay income tax in the 1982-83 financial year are not those with incomes of $4,595 or less but rather those whose incomes are $4,462 or less. In fact, those earning $4,595-which the Treasurer said would be the threshold at which tax would become payable-in 1982- 83 will pay $40.79 tax; not zero as mentioned by the Treasurer. As honourable senators may recall, I have just quoted the Treasurer as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . about 300,000 pensioners and low income earners who would otherwise pay tax in 1982-83 will not now do so. </PARA>
<PARA>If, on looking at the detailed figures in Budget Paper No. 1, the threshold is brought into question, it probably means that we must query the position of the 300,000 pensioners and low income earners who, according to the Treasurer, would have had to pay tax if it had not been for the increase in the threshold. I attempted to find out some information to check this figure of 300,000 but it seems that sufficient information is not available to do that. It is most likely that it was a figure plucked out of the air. It might be correct, but once one starts to find figures in Budget Paper No. 1 which contradict the bland figures given by the Treasurer in the Budget Speech, one starts to question whether other figures are accurate as well. The Treasurer goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the standard rate of tax is to be reduced from 32 per cent to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>The clear implication in that is that taxpayers this year who are paying the standard rate of tax will be paying at the rate of 30 per cent rather than 32 per cent. But if we refer to Budget Paper No. 1 we see that for this year the standard rate is not 30 per cent. Because reductions will not occur until 1 November, the standard rate of tax for this financial year will be 30.67 per cent. Admittedly it is only 0.67 per cent greater than the 30 per cent the Treasurer mentioned, but it is an extra amount that taxpayers will have to find.</PARA>
<PARA> I could make similiar comments in relation to the Treasurer's statement about the increase in the tax threshold for the 46 per cent rate. The figures in Budget Paper No. 1 just do not gell with the Treasurer's statement. If I may be blunt, that part of his Speech which dealt with income tax is quite misleading. If I were less charitable I would use much more harsh words about the accuracy of this section of the Treasurer's Speech. However, I ask this: Why did the Treasurer not let his Budget stand on its merits rather than try to represent it as something better than it is? Obviously he was not too pleased with it. He did not want the workers, who are already paying more for beer and cigarettes, to think that they were receiving tax cuts when they really were not. Did he not want the housewives, who are already paying additional sales tax on a wide variety of items, to think too badly of the Government? Did he not want motorists, who are now paying 3c a litre more for petrol in Brisbane this week than they were last week-one cent of that is due to the additional tax and the other 2c was added because there was an opportunity to add something when the one cent tax was added-to think that they were receiving some relief elsewhere? The fact is that Mr Howard's tax cuts are almost as illusory as that fistful of fivers which featured in the Liberal Party's 1977 election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> Having had a look at what happens to the actual figures when the thresholds are moved, it is pertinent to examine them in more detail. Mr Howard stated that the tax-free threshold increased by $400; that is, it went from $4,195 to $4,595. This is an increase of 9.5 per cent. Earlier in his Speech he mentioned that inflation was running at a rate of 10.7 per cent and average weekly earnings over the same period had increased by 14 per cent. Therefore, even if this new threshold that he mentioned is correct, taxpayers have not been afforded full indexation in respect of income tax. As it is, the real threshold-that which is in Budget Paper No. 1 for this financial year-shows an increase of about only 6 per cent, which is far less than the inflation rate. Thus taxpayers are now worse off than they were 12 months ago. Similar comments could be made of the threshold mentioned by the Treasurer for the 46c in the dollar tax payment. A close examination indicates that his comments do not reveal the full picture. </PARA>
<PARA> I will summarise some of the points I have mentioned regarding personal income tax. Mr Howard said that the tax-free threshold would be $4,595. For the 1982-83 financial year that is not true. The actual figure will be $4,462. Mr Howard said that no tax will be payable until a taxpayer's income exceeds $4,595. For 1982-83, that is not true. An income of $4,595 will attract $40.79 tax. The Australian Treasurer told the nation that the standard rate of tax would be reduced from 32 per cent to 30 per cent. In reality, the standard rate will be 30.67 per cent for this financial year. Mr Howard implied-I concede that he did not say so directly, but he certainly implied-that the 46 per cent tax rate would be payable only after earnings reached $19,500. In other words, he implied that until a taxpayer earns $19,500 he will be paying the standard rate of tax. That is not the case. Those whose incomes are between $17,894 and $19,500 will in the 1982-83 year pay tax at the rate of 35.33 cents in the dollar not the standard rate of tax at the old rate of 32 cents in the dollar, or 30c in the dollar, as Mr Howard suggested, or the 30.67c which will really be the case. The more we dig into the Budget Papers the more we find that the Budget will disadvantage the taxpayer. Various rebates will no longer be at a rate of 32 per cent but rather at 30.67 per cent for the current financal year. Amongst those rebates are rebates for health insurance, for concessional expenditure, and for housing loans. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like at this stage to turn to sales tax. In the context of the label given to this Budget of a family Budget-the more I look at it the more I believe it is an erroneous label-I must mention the sales tax measures. In last year's Budget Speech Mr Howard spoke of 'small adjustments' to the sales tax structure. On that occasion two and a half percentage points were added to all rates of tax . Two and a half percentage points sounds a small amount but it effectively increased some sales taxes by 100 per cent. Now the family man and woman must wonder where Mr Howard's 'small adjustments' will end. We are again having a two and a half percentage point increase applied to the various rate. Will there be another 2 1/2 per cent increase next year and the next and so on?</PARA>
<PARA> The story does not end there. Last year the Government decided for the first time to tax a wide range of goods at 2 1/2 per cent. That move failed. Now it is proposed that some of those items will be taxed, not at 2 1/2 per cent but at 7 1/2 per cent. What will the family man who wants to do some odd jobs about the place think about a Budget that taxes hand tools at 7 1/2 per cent? What will the housewife say about a 7 1/2 per cent tax on drapery, soft furnishings, manchester and even cleaning cloths? These people are hardly likely to endorse the Budget as a family Budget; nor will the person whose drink of beer has risen by 4c a glass endorse it as a family Budget. A glass of beer has risen by that much because we now have an incredible excise of 60c a litre on beer. It is not often realised how much excise there is on beer, but the excise on a litre of beer is more than the price of a litre of petrol.</PARA>
<PARA> A family Budget will not be the term given to this Budget by a one-packet a day smoker, who will have to pay an additional $50 a year because of a 20 per cent increase in excise. It may be thought that I am exaggerating by saying a one- packet a day smoker will pay an extra $50 a year, but if we work it out at 14c a packet per day for 365 days we will find that the cost comes to about $51. This is the extra amount a smoker will have to pay. He will hardly call it a family Budget. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour this day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier I was talking about sales taxes and I had just about finished my comments on them. But I just mention that a value added tax has the same bad features as sales tax. At least with value added tax one knows how much tax one is paying. Sales taxes are more sneaky and often people do not realise that they are paying them. However, I believe that Australians are becoming more aware of this Government's actions, and the presence of these new and increased sales taxes in this Budget will be recognised by Australian taxpayers and consumers. While mentioning taxes which increase the cost of goods, I mention a particular increase in excise which will have a major effect on the railways of the State that I represent. No doubt it will have similar effects in other States. Until Budget night there was no excise duty on diesel fuel which was used off public roads. This meant that diesel fuel used by the Queensland railways was free of excise. However, in this Budget a change was made to make all diesel fuel bear part of the full rate of excise. Of course, there are some exceptions where certain groups can apply for rebates, but that does not pertain to the Queensland railways. What it means is that an additional cost of $12m a year will be payable by the Queensland railways. Obviously this will be passed on in increased fares and increased rates and, I dare say, may even have some effect on our export earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to social security. In comparison with the past six Fraser Budgets, this Budget has been more generous to pensioners and beneficiaries, but the past actions of the Fraser Government are probably not a good base on which a comparison should be made. For example, I remember that shortly after I came to this place-I had probably been here about four months-the Government showed it was all heart by attempting to abolish pensioners' funeral benefits. The major thrust of the increase in social security expenditure is in two general areas. The first is the automatic six monthly indexaton. This merely allows pensioners to catch up with past increases in the cost of living. They are certainly not getting ahead; they are just catching up. The second factor is the enormous rise in the number of unemployment beneficiaries caused by the Fraser Government's economic mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention just a few social security areas where I consider greater effort could have been made. First, despite regular increases, the standard pension rate has decreased as a percentage of average weekly earnings from just over 24 per cent in 1975 to about 22 per cent now. This decline in real terms should be redressed. Secondly, I mention supplementary assistance which is paid to the poorest pensioners, pensioners with no other income and who are paying rent in the private accommodation market. Although the Budget will allow up to $10 to be payable from 1 March, $10 a week will not go far towards paying rent. Obviously we need more welfare housing and higher rates of supplementary assistance. Unemployment beneficiaries paying private rent are still ineligible for supplementary assistance even though they face the same costs as pensioners in private rental accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the increase of $4 a week to the under 18-year-old unemployed is a paltry amount. It is the first increase in seven years for this age group. Just how far will a total of $40 a week go for an unemployed young person, especially if that young person has to live away from home? Many must live away from home, especially those from country areas who know that work is not available locally and who therefore move to more settled areas to seek work. I remember seeing the Treasurer (Mr Howard) address the National Press Club. In his address even he said that perhaps an increase should have been made to the amount long before now. That extra $4 a week will do little to ease the plight of many of these young people. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be remiss if I did not make some comments on the Government's proposed new tax on bank transactions. We do not have the legislation for this before us yet but it was noted in the Budget Speech that it would be introduced. This new tax is likely to prove to be extremely unpopular. Of course, few taxes are popular, but some are more unpopular than others. Whilst the Government uses its bank tax to increase its tax take by $200m a year, which is about $13 or $14 a year for each man, woman and child in Australia, the anger of the depositors will rise. There is likely to be a greater reliance on cash transactions with all the associated dangers of loss of money. This tax is likely to get the Government into more trouble than it has anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government was elected on promises to lower inflation, lower interest rates and provide employment opportunities for all who want to work. Despite those promises, and despite almost seven years of this Government's being in power, inflation has shown no significant movement over the past three years, unemployment has soared to record levels and our interest rates are higher than those of our major trading partners. A recent survey showed that consumer confidence has dropped to its lowest level in nine years. I mentioned that unemployment has soared to record levels. We might think it is at a record level at the moment but, unfortunately, there is every prospect of its becoming worse. When he addressed the National Press Club luncheon the day after the Budget was brought down in this Parliament, Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA> In my own view, the total level of unemployment by the early part of next year will probably approach about 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a shocking record to think that we have had seven years of this Government and now we are approaching a record level of unemployment-a record since the Great Depression of 8 per cent. Talking about the Great Depression, I remember how when I was a young lad my father used to tell me stories about the Great Depression. He was one of the ones right in the midst of it. On one occasion I remarked that I hoped that such a depression would not occur again in Australia. He said that it was unlikely because governments nowdays know far more about economic management than they did in the 1920s and 1930s. Unfortunately, he did not make allowances for a dismal government such as the one that we have now. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to see this Budget as an instrument which will bring sanity back to the Australian economy. If it does not, the days of the Fraser Government are surely numbered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to be given the liberty of explaining why I was caught unexpectedly by Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4) coming on. It was not listed on the original business paper for today, which I had looked at. The original business paper stated that after 2.15 p.m. a supplementary paper would be issued. I did not see a supplementary paper until, I think, about sixteen minutes past two o'clock, by which time the Bill was to be called on immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are seven areas of the Income Tax Assessment Act which are being amended by this Bill. They cover a wide variety of amendments previously forecast by the Government. They relate to the continuing tax-free status of the Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island, donations to charities, Division 7 operations and, probably most importantly, some loosening of the restrictions under section 16 of the Act on the disclosure of information-a question which, of course, is now recognised as being far more important following Tuesday's tabling of the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, as Mr Costigan has noted and argued in that report, to distinguish between privacy and secrecy. Individual taxpayers should have the right to have privacy from prying neighbours, journalists or whoever about their taxation matters but there is not and ought not to be an unlimited right of secrecy, of the withholding information from law officers of either State or Commonwealth government who require that information for the enforcement of the law. The only additional comment the Australian Labor Party has to make is that the amendments made so far have not gone far enough. It is something to which the Government ought to give quick consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The final question to which I would like to devote a few minutes is the exemption for most of the last financial year from assessment as taxable income of the capital gain on maturing government securities. Ralph Willis made the point in the House of Representatives that this has not been a particularly important matter in the past because the actual yield on government securities and the contemporary market rates were not far removed from each other. In the last five years or thereabouts a large and still widening gap has developed between the rate payable on long term government securities and the prevailing market rate. There appeared to be some confusion within the Australian Taxation Office and the accounting profession as to whether such gains were taxable. It appears that some accountants at least and perhaps some people in the Taxation Office gave advice which indicated that such gains were not assessable as income . That was not the case, of course. They always had been assessable but until quite recently the question was not one of great importance. As a result of that confusion-perhaps one might even say 'misinformation'-the Government decided that for last year it would amend the Acts so as to exempt those capital gains. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued on behalf of those who were seeking such an exemption that the expectation that the capital gain picked up when the securities matured would not be taxable and that allowance was made by those purchasers for that expectation when the securities were purchased. If that were correct-the yield, of course, is the rate of interest in combination with the market price and the face value; it is a product of those three factors-and if the capital appreciation were anticipated as being tax free, the yield on those old, relatively low interest securities ought to be higher than on current new government paper being issued to mature on the same date. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fairly complex question. I hope I have made it clear. I should like to hypothesise in this way: Suppose that in March of this year government securities issued 10 years ago with a 12-year maturity and an interest rate of 7 per cent were being traded on the secondary market those securities would mature in March 1984, two years hence. Suppose that also in March new government paper, tap issue, was being sold with a yield of 16 per cent to mature in March 1984. Indeed, that is approximately what the situation was. In those circumstances, if it were anticipated that the capital gain, which partly determines the yield on the security, would be tax free, the market yield for the long term securities which would mature two years hence ought to be higher than for the new securities which would mature two years hence. If that is not the case, the argument put in favour of the people who sought exemption of the capital gain from assessable income falls to the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not had time to dig up a great deal of information on yields. But in May of this year tap issues which mature in February 1984-it has been difficult to find securities that mature on exactly the same date-were yielding 16.4 per cent , which was a combination of a coupon rate and a very slight discount on issue. Long term securities bearing interest at rates between 4.625 per cent and 9.5 per cent which mature in May 1984-that is not exactly the same date but I do not think that matters for my purposes-were yielding between 14.73 per cent and 15. 65 per cent. In fact, this was below the yield on new tap issue securities which matured on approximately the same date. The point I make is that although the time of maturity does not exactly coincide, I do not think one can assert unequivocally that no yield premium was being paid by the market for the old securities which were being sold on the secondary market. One can go so far as to say that it would be wrong to conclude that the long term low interest paper was actually being sold at a yield discount. There is certainly no evidence to support the belief that a yield premium was being paid by the market in anticipation of part of the yield being taken as tax-free capital gain instead of taxable interest. </PARA>
<PARA> So it seems to me that the rationale put forward to the public by those who sought the exemption given in this Bill falls to the ground. In any event, it is an exemption which is to apply for this year only. It is unfortunate that the situation arose. It would seem logical to oppose that clause of the Bill, but in view of the fact that it appears that inadequate, if not inaccurate, advice was given to some people by officers of the Australian Taxation Office the Opposition has decided not to oppose that or any other clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to discuss the plight of small business. The Government, in its recently announced package to industry, has undertaken some very meaningful measures which will assist business, especially business investment, in this country. However, because of the importance of the small business sector-those companies which employ fewer than 100 people-I believe that the Government has a strong obligation to do more, especially in the prevailing economic circumstances. There are in Australia 747,000 businesses which employ between one and 99 people . They account for 61 per cent of total employment in the Australian community. Some 700,000 of these business establishments employ between one and nine people . Collectively, they account for 37.7 per cent of all employment in Australia. They are concentrated mainly, I might say, in the areas of agriculture, the wholesale and retail trades and the construction sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia today many small businesses stand on the edge of a precipice. In 1979-80 more than 2,500 small businesses became insolvent-some 25 per cent more than the previous year. Unfortunately, this was due in part to circumstances beyond Australia's control-contracting world markets for Australian goods, global inflationary pressures and increasingly competitive imported products. Also small business is partly the victim of circumstances which should be within the control of Australians-rising wages, shorter hours and industrial disputes. In fact, if there were to be a change of government small business would also be subjected to a punitive increase in tax. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden ) the then Treasurer, made that point abuntantly clear in his 1975-76 Budget Speech when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to provide more and more government services . . . without ultimately having to pay for them through cutting back after tax earnings via increased taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fundamental truth that I believe even the Australian Labor Party recognised when it was in Government. Australians will be very wary if suddenly the Opposition claims that those circumstances no longer apply. In the present economic circumstances especially, it is apparent that the Government should make further moves to assist small businesses whenever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer briefly to Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which requires that private companies distribute 20 per cent of their after-tax trading profits in order to avoid the imposition of undistributed profits tax amounting to 50 per cent of the undistributed profits. That provision directly affects the ability of small business to retain internally generated funds. At a time when interest rates are at a high level, small businesses can ill afford such arbitrary control of their capital. Where the provisions of Division 7 do not apply, a company can retain 54 per cent of its after-tax earnings at the current company tax rate of 46 per cent, but where those provisions are brought into play the proportion falls to 43.2 per cent. In effect, an additional 10.8 per cent of pre-tax profits is lost to the company when Division 7 applies. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of this are graphically illustrated by a survey conducted by the University of Newcastle of 1,071 small manufacturing companies and 548 small non -manufacturing companies. Interestingly enough, 62.1 per cent of the manufacturing companies and 59.9 per cent of the non-manufacturing companies responded that the Division 7 requirement did not permit them to retain sufficient profits to finance their growth adequately. In the present economic circumstances I believe, irrespective of fears that companies may be able to use tax shelters, that it is essential for the Government to act to encourage investment by small businesses which will generate productive capacity and employment. I believe that it is not beyond the wit of governments then to legislate to ensure effectively that these concessions are not misinterpreted but are directed towards the purposes for which they are basically intended. Moreover, while I am on the subject of taxation I point out that the Government' s assistance package to industry, which I mentioned earlier, was well received in business circles inasfar as it went. But a survey by the Australian Industries Development Association made what is for the small businessman the following fundamental point:</PARA>
<PARA> Companies would not undertake major investment projects solely on the basis of taxation incentives unless they were fundamentally sound from other points of view. </PARA>
<PARA>The gross operating surplus of Australian companies during the March quarter of this year was only 12.3 per cent of non-farm gross domestic product-well below normal levels. In the last year wages, as measured by average weekly earnings, have outpaced prices. In 1981-82 average weekly earnings for males increased by 14.8 per cent while the consumer price index, which reflects not only prices but also the effects of government measures such as the recent health rearrangements , increased by 10.4 per cent. Clearly, the present economic recession is being borne by profits and not by wages. Therefore to expand, businesses, especially small businesses which have less capacity to generage investment capital, are forced into the capital market as funds dry up because of the profits squeeze. Of course once small businesses are forced on to the capital market they must face higher interest rates which act as a disincentive to borrow for expansion purposes. To that extent the Government must pursue for the sake of small businesses a policy aimed at curbing trade union demands for more wages and shorter hours and thus reverse the trend in declining profitability which producers in this country are currently experiencing. </PARA>
<PARA> One other aspect of taxation policy in respect of investment requires comment at this point, and that is the investment allowance. The investment allowance is due to terminate in 1986, following an inquiry into the matter. Of course its value has already been reduced. I do not suggest that we should go so far as following the example of the United Kingdom, where the entire cost of capital equipment can be deducted from taxable profits in the first year of purchase but I argue very strongly that some type of realistic investment allowance, as distinct from depreciation provisions, is essential to small business in Australia. It is one thing to allow depreciation over five years but in terms of encouraging small businesses with limited investment capital to make the initial purchase of new equipment, the investment allowance must be retained. </PARA>
<PARA> The last comment I want to make about taxation relates to provisional tax. I understand and accept the need for provisional tax and I would not go so far as to argue for its abolition in any way. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the present system makes heavy demands on small businesses, especially those in their first year of life. In that first year it really amounts to double taxation. In order to lessen the crippling effect which this has on developing businesses and to reduce the effects of removing potential investment funds from established businesses which have a successful year, the Government should immediately examine the idea of paying provisional tax in instalments during the year. That would reduce the debilitating sessional effects of provisional tax. It would reduce the need for small businesses to go into the capital market to meet their tax liabilities, thus releasing resources for investment in plant and equipment. In the final outcome government revenue would not be affected. Indeed , it could even act to even out the current flow of taxation into the Federal Treasury. I have no doubt that such taxation measures as I have outlined would be welcomed by small businesses throughout Australia. I have also no doubt that positive action by the Government to curb the new wages boom would be of vital encouragement to business. In the long run, action by the Government in both these areas would act decisively on unemployment and for those reasons it deserves real consideration by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area in which the Government can render substantial assistance to small businesses is in providing training and management courses which would be suitable for small businesses of various types. According to a report by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) on small business bankruptcies, of the 2,408 cases of business failure in 1981, in 664 cases lack of business ability, acumen , training or experience was cited as the major cause. In other words, in more than 27 per cent of the business failures in 1980-81 it might have been possible for the Government to render assistance had it co-ordinated a national education program for small businessmen which was responsive to their needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will no doubt be aware that many of Australia's tertiary institutions do offer small business courses but they are in a generalised form and are not adequate or responsive to the needs of individual industry groups. It has been plausibly argued by Professor Meredith of the Financial Management Research Centre at the University of New England that such programs have little impact on small businessmen because they are generalities aimed at composite audiences of retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, and primary producers, each of whom has quite distinct problems as well as general concerns which might affect them all. Part of the problem is that the Australian Government, unlike several other governments around the world, does not have the necessary mechanisms available to it to appreciate fully the problems of the small business sector. Japan, for example, has an annual review-an equivalent to the Australian Government's White Paper-of small enterprise development. The Small Business Administration in the United States of America performs a very similar function. The effect of that sort of arrangement is to formalise and regularise the works of committees of inquiry such as the Wiltshire and Ralph committees which occasionally inquire into aspects affecting small business. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst not wishing to denigrate in any way the valuable work which these committees have done and will continue to do, I believe that there is a very strong case to argue that an area so important to the economy should receive inputs which are updated at least annually and can thereby enable more effective responses to small business problems. To revert to the example of education, which I mentioned earlier, it is reasonable to believe that such an annual review would have analysed the degree to which business failures are attributable to a lack of acumen and training, and could have recommended appropriate corrective measures. Using the research facilities which such a review group would necessarily have available to it, it could operate in an advisory capacity to small businesses, relating information on appropriate targets, performance figures and margins for the type of business being undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government might consider one other matter directly in relation to small business. It recently announced a strengthening of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme-a move which I commend wholeheartedly-to give greater encouragement to Australian industry to seek overseas markets. Naturally the scheme is highly beneficial for those small businesses which have a product appropriate for export since it encourages companies to consider exporting in the knowledge that some assistance towards defraying costs will be forthcoming. However, it must be acknowledged that a large number of Australian firms either do not have appropriate products for export or, for considerations of management or capacity, they are just not geared to export. In other words, these firms are locked exclusively into the domestic market. In this case the Government could well give some consideration to more definition in its procurement policies and practices, again in consultation with small business research groups of the type I mentioned earlier. At one level this could lead to a commitment by the Government to seek out suppliers from amongst small businesses wherever possible . At another level it may be possible actually to define a proportion of the overall amount of goods and services which the Government draws from the private sector and stipulate, in general terms or in more formalised terms, that Commonwealth departments should meet that figure, perhaps partly from small businesses, in their procurement programs. Small businesses would then stand to benefit by increased sales. I believe it would be especially significant for businesses which are located outside the major cities of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A final area of concern to small businesses throughout Australia involves those in areas outside major cities and ports. The problem involves sales tax on freight. Because of its sheer size, Western Australia is particularly disadvantaged in this respect and in the developing Pilbara and Kimberley regions it is a clear impediment to the development of warehousing businesses. The fact is that under the present sales tax legislation tax is calculated on the value of the article at the point at which it leaves the warehouse. Therefore, there is a difference in the price of an article leaving a warehouse in Perth and one in, say, Port Hedland. The difference is equal to freight and the tax on freight combined. Even assuming that the article is shipped from Perth to Port Hedland, the difference remains the tax on the freight component because tax is not charged on the freight involved in shipping after it leaves the warehouse. The operation of the Sales Tax Assessment Acts in this way reduces the ability of small businesses involved in warehousing in isolated areas to compete by creating an artificial price differential between goods shipped from Perth and those warehoused elsewhere. It can often be a very significant amount, especially given the high freight costs which are prevalent in remote areas. I therefore urge the Government to give this matter its most urgent consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business is a major issue today in the sense that it is a most significant employer of labour and resources and must therefore be fostered. In some instances, in a sense, it can be fostered by government inaction, but not by pursuing policies in respect of public spending which will impinge on small businesses by necessitating increases in tax collections. However, I have outlined areas in which I believe the Government can make a meaningful contribution by its action, and I urge that these areas be given careful consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1982-83 Budget shows that the Fraser Government is on the run, scared, confused and seeking a somewhat cheap and easy way to try to win back some support amongst Australian voters. It must be said, a little over a week after the Budget was announced with a great fanfare, that the Budget has received a very unfavourable reaction. Some persons in a position to make judgments have said that it is too good to be true, subsequently saying that the Budget is not able to do what is needed in the Australian economy. Others have described it as rudderless, leaderless, disgraceful. I think the most famous statement that has been made in respect to the Budget was by Mr Risstrom: Whatever Canberra giveth, Canberra taketh away. That is clearly what this Budget does. It is a Budget that does nothing to assist the Australian people or the Australian economy to get back to a decent growth pattern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At a time when the Federal Government needs to confront the ever-worsening economy on the brink of both a national and an international recession, when it needs to promote balanced and broad economic growth, and when it needs to develop a co-operative and productive relationship with the trade union movement and the employers, Government has failed on all fronts. Furthermore, it has neglected the main victims of the Australian economic malaise-the poor, the young, and the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at this so-called parcel of goodies, let us see what the reaction has been. The business community has made it clear that it is not impressed. The wage and salary earners, through the national leadership of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, are not impressed. The pensioners have indicated that they are not impressed. Certainly those on the poverty line and those who speak on their behalf have said that they are not impressed. The media, almost universally, have said that they are not impressed. The economists have said that they are not impressed. The banks are not impressed with the latest attempt to impose indirect taxes via the banking system. Certainly the State governments are not impressed, because they are not receiving adequate funds to carry out their public works responsibilities. Yet this Government has had seven years in which to take the essential steps to maintain living standards and a pattern of economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear, from the Budget and from the discussions that have taken place, that this Government is on the run from the current economic situation. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) cries that he and his Government can do nothing about it, blaming it all on international circumstances-a factor that they were not prepared to acknowledge in 1973 when the first portents of the economic downturn on an international scale were visible. The Government is scared by the prospect that voters, the Australian people, will reject it. It is doubly scared by the coherent and committed alternative that the Labor Party offers. The Government is therefore confused. All it can offer is this mishmash of handouts and deception, while having no economic strategy whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that the Fraser Government has no economic strategy. Even Mr Fraser's mentors in the Treasury disapprove of his current approach, as a reading of the Treasury's statement in Budget Paper No. 1 shows. Its carping, critical tone makes clear the Treasury view that the Government has abandoned hard-bitten monetarism for confusion and, perhaps, electioneering. We must remember that when the Budget was framed there is no doubt that the Government had in mind a September election, but that has faded not only because of the Budget's unacceptability but also because of the grave crisis in which this Government has found itself as a result of the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, the Costigan report . Worse is to come for the Government when reports Nos 2 and 3, dealing with gun -running, the Nugan Hand Bank and organised white-collar crime, hit the light of day. The ACTU, which Mr Fraser has sought to buy off with this Budget, has summed up the situation well. When it met last week, its Executive stated:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Budget is mainly designed as a bribe to electors with a view to an early election then it is not just economically bankrupt but morally bankrupt.</PARA>
<PARA>Looking at the Budget in detail, we find that Budget outlays have increased by 13.9 per cent over those of 1981-82, which represents about 3 per cent in real terms; but Budget receipts show an increase of 11.3 per cent, or 0.55 per cent in real terms. If the outlay figures for 1981-82 are adjusted to remove the costs of the additional pay day last year, the rate of growth of outlays in 1982 -83 rises to some 15 per cent, and that for 1981-82 becomes 12.8 per cent. So in real terms the increases on this basis are 3.6 per cent in 1982-83 and 1.1 per cent in 1981-82. As a proportion of gross domestic product, the Budget outlays are projected to increase from 27.9 per cent in 1981-82 to 28.7 per cent in 1982 -83, reflecting the real growth in outlays combined with the expectation of no real growth in GDP. Receipts, as a proportion of GDP, are up too-to 27.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder we find this confusion in the community and this criticism and non-acceptability of the Budget by an ever-widening group of people. The economy is on a downturn. Over the last month or six weeks we find retrenchments of a nature that one would not have believed possible. Interest rates in Australia are among the highest in the Western world. Consumer confidence is at its lowest point for many years. There are two million people in poverty. There is a crisis in housing. Generally, there is a lack of business confidence throughout the whole community, whether in the corporate sector or the small business sector. Even Senator Crichton-Browne has to concede that the small business sector is concerned about its future. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer notes, the deficit, while well above the 1981-82 figure of $ 549m, is still quite low by international standards. The Government's fetish with the deficit has fooled many. Many could easily be tricked into believing that this new Budget is stimulatory. It is not, as a look at the expectations for growth, employment and the distribution of extra funds quickly shows. For example, income tax receipts are up. Quite contrary to what the Government has tried to sell to the electorate, PAYE receipts are higher than they have ever been in Australia's history. As to sales tax, there has been an increase in the whole range of goods which are produced and sold to the average citizen. We now find that sales tax on some items is up to 32.5 per cent, 30 per cent, 27.5 per cent and 25 per cent, an increase that will bring in to the Government something in excess of $400m. While this is happening, company tax is expected, according to the Budget documents, to drop by one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government, which claims to be a low tax government, taxation revenue as a whole will rise by 10.7 per cent. Whilst this may be considered to be the smallest rise in four years, again one must be careful in analysing this, for it is principally as a result of economic stagnation and not the Government' s generosity that this position is arrived at. Let us look at the so-called hand -outs that we were led to believe on Budget night represented generosity. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have attempted to paint the 1982-83 Budget as a generous and indeed compassionate one. In the words of Mr Howard:</PARA>
<PARA> It was necessary to recognise that present economic conditions cause real hardship to many Australians . . . we have done all we can to provide relief, assistance and incentive within the confines of a responsible economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that he tell that to the two million people living on or below the poverty line, to the pensioners, to the unemployed, and to those people who find , when they go to work on Friday, that they receive a retrenchment notice dismissing them from a job that they have held in many cases for 20 or 30 years. The Government's figureheads have promoted the Budget as one of tax cuts, housing assistance, family welfare asistance and help to pensioners. If in fact the Government were really concerned about these matters it would have been prepared to accept what we have been saying about housing, which has been robbed of something like $1.5 billion in the seven years that this Government has been in office in respect of housing assistance to those on low incomes. So while the Government may have given a few more dollars to the States in respect of low income housing, look at the years of neglect and what that means in terms of providing for the needs of the Australian people. It has forced up rents, it has forced a housing crisis and it has forced even this Government, this measley- minded Government, to accept that something needs to be done in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget has the sort of promotion that can only be described as deceptive and dishonest. Observers out in the field have seen this; they have been quickly on the scene. They have noted that the hand outs are principally designed to win votes and that they are cancelled out by the increases in sales tax and extra charges and the effects of inflation. It is no good the Federal Government saying it is doing this in such a way as to give more money to the average citizen if in fact the very policies it is pursuing are forcing not only State governments but also semi-government authorities to increase charges, thereby depressing the living standards of the average person. Many of the so called hand-outs are inequitable in their effect. They benefit the middle to high income groups while doing precious little for the poor, and allow the tried and true formula of the Fraser Government's redistribution away from those in need to continue. As Senator Button pointed out yesterday, the Government's own adviser, Professor Mathews, has pointed consistently to the failure of this Government to understand and appreciate the need to distribute from the rich to the poor and not from the poor to the rich. This Budget of course continues exactly the same strategy in that respect, something which has been a feature of this Government's Budgets over the last seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> What is worse, underlining all of this, is the acceptance in this Budget of a no-growth economy and a no-growth concept. I cannot stress this too greatly. No growth in the economy will benefit no one, least of all the poor and unemployed, because no growth means no jobs. That is what it means, in practice and in theory. Yet it is not growth, stagnation, that is accepted as the very basis of this Budget for the year ahead. As the Australian Financial Review stated, it is a Budget of 'handouts, but no real aid for the economy' and that means no real aid at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to the income tax changes. Welcome as they may be in some respects, and we do not criticise the fact that there have been some income tax changes, in many respects they are inadequate. Those who benefit most are those earning between $340 and $460 per week. But is that the real group which needs assistance? Whilst we do not criticise that they are getting assistance, it is clear that those on average weekly earnings of about $330 per week and the 60 per cent of the people who get less than the average, are the ones who need this sort of assistance. They are the people that this Budget does not give any consideration to. Just in case people might think they are getting off easy this year, let us remember that income tax receipts from individuals now amount to 14 .3 per cent of gross domestic product, which is up nearly 5 per cent on the 1972 -73 Budget figure. In that same period, company tax as a proportion of GDP has declined. As we have seen over these last few days, as we look at the major tax avoidance industry, the growth industry in this country, largely aided and abetted by the indefference of this Government, company taxation, as a percentage of both GDP and federal revenue, has declined, whereas pay-as-you- earn tax, which taxes the average person, has increased considerably. Income tax from individuals now amounts to about 52 per cent of all receipts, while in the last Labor Budget of 1975-76, that figure was 45 per cent. So let us not have any illusions at all that the Liberal Party is not the high tax party, Under the Liberals it is the ordinary individual who has been forced to tighten his or her belt and contribute, whereas corporations have got off much more lightly. When we add to that the increase in indirect taxation, the fuel tax, the tax from beer and cigarettes and the sales tax to which I have already referred, we can see that there will be an absolute confirmation of the survey carried out over the last few months into why consumer demand is at an all time low. The general 2 1/2 per cent sales tax rise will increase the cost of thousands of items, most of which are used in every day life and consumers therefore will be paying in addition to the higher proportion of PAYE tax an extra $400m in sales tax charges. </PARA>
<PARA> New taxes have been introduced by this Government. There is a new tax on bank transactions which will hit cheque account users and small businesses in particular. One can imagine what that will do to small business and the ever increasing number of ordinary citizens who have the use of cheque accounts through their trading banks. In addition the big changes in excise rates for beer, tobacco and petrol will add many dollars a week to household costs. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said by the spokesman for the Government that the 1982 Budget will help the housing sector. We say that it fails to provide the housing sector with the stability it requires to achieve an adequate supply of housing to meet social needs, to contribute to employment growth and to assist economic recovery . Housing inequalities obviously will be widened. Housing finance will be dearer and more volatile, rents will rise, housing insecurity will increase and suffering will increase accordingly. Labor has grave concerns about the equity and effectiveness of the rebate. Any person buying a home to live in can now obtain a rebate of 30c in the dollar on his or her interest payments over a rate of 10 per cent of loans to $60,000, no matter what the income or the source of loan. The rebate will be a hand out to many who do not necessarily need the sort of assistance which has been given at the expense of taxpayers in general. The rebate will encourage the growth of fringe lending institutions charging exorbitant rates of interest to people desperate for a home, and who have been rejected by banks and buiding societies. More people will be put at risk, we believe, because there is no way in which the Government can monitor those organisations and the rates of interest charged by them to those seeking a loan. Housing initiatives in this Budget are a good example of the ad hoc and electorally opportunist way in which the Government has approached things. The problems of interest rates is not addressed seriously and in fact the Government has no policy to contain interest rates. Just a one per cent increase in interest rates can easily wipe out the benefit of the rebate to most of those who would recieve it. Of course, the Budget ignores completely the problem of the renters. Renting costs are a major problem in our capital cities and in my own city of Sydney. Rentals, which are currently rising at an annual rate of about $10 per week at the lower end of the market, will continue to rise and continue to cause hardship. The crisis of homelessness which is now recognised by everybody associated with welfare and the housing industry will remain with us and sub-standard housing will continue to be one of the alternatives. Advances to the States for housing are estimated to be $290m-less than one-third of the amount provided in the 1974-75 Labor Budget when we sought to redress the grave difficulties of housing that faced us then. Today, eight or nine years later, the situation is many times worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at family allowances, which are supposed to be one of the goodies in this package. The raising of the family allowance for the first and second child is welcome. The last change was in 1976, which is six years ago. However, the failure to alter these allowances adequately through indexation means that since 1976 the Government has withdrawn from the family $396m. The Government is only paying back in one short year a small part of the great amount of money that has been withdrawn from the families which need it. Furthermore, the special family income supplement for low income families is to be extended to only a very few, unfortunately, also on a very restrictive basis. This compares unfavourably with the handouts that are clearly in the Budget for the more well off. </PARA>
<PARA> Those on the unemployment benefit will receive increases, but the most helpful assistance they could get would be a job. There is absolutely no hope in this Budget for those who want to work. The Government has indicated that it does not see any possibility of any improvement in the employment position. The Treasurer expects that well over half a million people will be unemployed in the coming year. The Department of the Treasury has said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is unlikely to be any growth in employment. </PARA>
<PARA>The future of those people looks bleak. That is a state of affairs which the Opposition finds completely unacceptable. The health budget is up by some 16 per cent. This disguises the marked reduction in health advances by the Commonwealth to the States. Advances to the States for health are down by $153m, or 20 per cent, in real terms. What are the States being forced to do? They are being forced to increase their charges in the whole area of hospital care. As a result the hospital contribution funds, such as Medibank, are being forced to increase their fees. It was reported in the newspapers either yesterday or today that they will have to increase their fees by something in excess of $2 to $3 a week. Mr Howard suggested that this was a family improvement Budget, but when one examines the figures, one discovers that nobody will be any better off. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other areas the allocation story is much the same-steady allocations with marginal benefit and some redistribution away from those in need. For example, there will be greater funds for private schools in that the Commonwealth Government allocation per private school pupil equals $596 a year and per government school pupil $261 a year. This Government defends that inequality. </PARA>
<PARA> Beneath the surface of the few goodies which are dished out in the Budget there is a confused and essentially abstentionist approach to economic policy. The approach is abstentionist because it avoids the major problem facing the Australian economy. It seeks to place the blame and the responsibility elsewhere -on the international economy and the wage and salary earners-while doing nothing about the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget is based upon the assumption that unemployment will increase in the coming year, that there will be a major slowdown in the economy and that inflation will continue to run at least in double figures. Yet nothing is proposed to redress these problems. In the Treasurer's Budget Speech one will find nothing except a call for wage restraint which is repeated ad nauseam. That is what Government speakers say whenever they talk about the Budget. Beneath the vacancy of Mr Howard's contribution, the Treasury, no doubt through the agency of its boss, Mr Stone, keeps peddling the same old nonsense. Yet now even its contractionary monetarism is wearing thin. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasury offers a formula, once again, of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies combined with wage reductions. The Treasury praises the contractionary policies of the United States of America and United Kingdom governments, yet at the same time blames the international recession, which is evident in these countries, for our domestic problems. It does not make sense. If the restrictive policies being employed in the United States and United Kingdom are working, why are their economies not emerging from recession? Of course, the Treasury as always, stumbles past this lapse in logic. Neither does the Treasury provide any evidence to support its assertion that our wage levels, labour costs and prices are making our exports unacceptable. It states this as a bald fact in the Budget Papers. Yet it produces no evidence at all to support the claim that this is the reason for the downturn in export prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts of the matter are that the restrictive policies being employed abroad are choking off growth, thus prolonging and deepening the recession. To pursue a similar approach here, as the Treasury would want, in our view would be pure disaster. For the moment, as we have seen, the Government has backed off from harshly restricted policies. It has made some handouts to ease the burden for some. Yet it has done this in such an ad hoc way that the overall benefit to the economy will be minimal. Further, when its period of electoral flirtation has passed, and we believe it has passed, the Liberal-National Country Party Government-if it is still in office-will be forced to take back what it has offered, as it has done in other pre-election and post-election periods. Whatever remains of the tax cuts, the rebates and the concessions will be swept away. I am convinced that the Treasury line will prevail. We get a glimpse of this with the Government's current wages policy. When the smokescreen of the small '1' liberal approach of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Ian Macphee, clears away, one will see the Treasury line through and through. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is any strategy at all in this Budget it is an industrial strategy. This strategy is a direct response to the very positive and responsible initiative of Labor's prices and incomes agreement with the trade union movement . The Liberal Budget strategy revolves around wages. Here the Government and the Treasury agree. They believe that so-called wages growth is the key problem of the economy; therefore, in their estimation, cutting wages is essential. The Treasurer, Mr Howard, makes this point over and over again in his Budget Speech. The basis of the Government's position was summed up early in the Budget Speech made last Tuesday week as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Adverse international influences were compounded by a significant worsening on the domestic wages front. The need for maximum wage restraint has therefore been much in the Government's mind in framing this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Treasury's contribution adds to this in detail with a long diatribe about labour costs and the need for decentralised wage determination. The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, fleshed out of the Government's approach still further in the days following the Budget. He explained that he believed the Budget contained very substantial assistance to families. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is reasonable to expect that these things will be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA>Further he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It would be reasonable to expect a degree of wage restraint. </PARA>
<PARA>The approach of the Government is confused and contradictory, but in essence the Budget seems to be to limit Budget handouts, especially in the form of income tax cuts and increased family allowances in return for union agreement for wage restraint. Secondly, underlying that 'sweets from a stranger' approach is the view that record unemployment will force the trade unions into a corner. Thirdly , there is a fragmenting and breaking down of Australian industrial relations to the point where, in John Howard's words 'there is a more market responsive system of wage determination which could help produce wage outcomes closer to that of individual firms'. </PARA>
<PARA> In short the Government wants created a situation in which it can cut wages and reduce the living standards of the bulk of the people. That is not what is required in the context of the Australian economy. We want to boost growth and consumer demand. We want to see increasing living standards. I believe the Budget fails dismally to produce that sort of economic environment in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I spoke on this report on Tuesday I pointed out that I thought the events that were occurring in Namibia were linked with those in Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. I said that all of the countries in that region were involved in a power play between the super- powers -the United States of America on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other hand-and also that the policies of South Africa itself were playing a very important role in that area. It is unfortunate that when we, in Australia, get reports of southern Africa they tend to be bad news; whether they are from people like Peter Younghusband in Cape Town, who reports in the Sydney Morning Herald, I think, Newsweek and other magazines or whether they are like the recent article in the Sydney Daily Telegraph on Zimbabwe. The Press reporting in Australia of events in southern Africa tends to be very bad indeed. I certainly do not want to play down the situation of some Australian tourists in Zimbabwe. Unfortunately, these tourists are still missing and I certainly hope that the army and the police there are able to secure their release in the near future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear Senator Missen say that some newspapers here will not even print articles on Zimbabwe if they contain good news. That does not surprise me at all, because one has only to look through the Australian Press any day of the week to see stories about riots in Bombay-where thousands of people have been injured-about the 200 killed the other day in riots in Lima or about tourists in trouble everywhere. Yet if anything happens in southern Africa or to any Australians in that area, the reports appear on the front pages day after day. We even had the situation here recently where one honourable senator by way of a question, said in this place that there was a North Korean brigade in Zimbabwe and that it was about to move on the capital Harare. In fact , a number of members of parliament who have recently been in Zimbabwe were able to check this out. The truth is that North Korean military instructors were instructing the fifth brigade in the Zimbabwean Army. The country is non-aligned . I do not think there is anything wrong with it inviting North Korean military instructors because it in fact invited Australian and British military instructors too. We were told there recently that in fact there are about 12 North Korean military instructors left in the whole country. There would be equally that many Australians and, in fact, there are 90 British military instructors still taking part in the integration of the armed forces in Zimbabwe . I think it is extremely unfortunate that none of the countries in southern Africa, with the exception of South Africa, have high commissions in Australia. Because countries like Kenya, Zimbabwe and Zambia do not have high commissions or diplomatic representatives here, I think the information that we get is very sketchy and very poor indeed. I hope that this will be remedied in the near future. Apparently Zimbabwe will open at least a Press office in Australia and the Zambians have said that they will have a high commission here within the next 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are worrying signs in Zimbabwe at present. Curfews have been imposed. Banditry has increased in some sections of the country. Very worrying claims have been made by Prime Minister Mugabe to members of this Parliament that South African military subversion has taken place in his country. It did not suprise me at all to learn this week that he claimed that three South African troops had been killed about 40 kilometres inside Zimbabwe. There has certainly been subversion in his own security forces and in his own air force with the recent blowing up of four aeroplanes near the capital, Harare. Also 1,200 to 2,000 of Nkomo's troops, who were integrated into the army, have left with their arms. Quite obviously they are involved in some of the civil disturbances and unrest that is taking place in that country today. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we in the West have no option at the moment but to continue our aid and assistance. I think that given the problems that that country has faced since independence, Mr Mugabe has done a marvellous job. One does not have to be there very long to realise the tremendous problems that he has faced. The people 's expectations, for a start, were tremendously high. Like all of us, Mr Mugabe is a politician. He realised that the people expected schools to be built, roads to be made and the standard of living to increase dramatically. Of course, that is not always easy. The white community in Zimbabwe expected the very worst to happen, and that has not happened either. As I said, I am concerned about the future because I believe that before things get better in that country, Mr Mugabe will have to crack down harder, especially on Nkomo and his people, than has already taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the country with the most important role to play in the whole area is South Africa. Some helpful signs have come out of that country. President Kaunda has held talks with South African Prime Minister Botha recently. Obviously they were discussing Namibia and a settlement there. I believe there will be a peaceful settlement in Namibia. It could lead to better economic conditions in Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. If we can get a peaceful settlement in Namibia it will go a long way to solving the economic problems of those countries and a long way to solving the transport problems of the area. This will be just a start. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic conditions that these countries find themselves in at the moment are very worrying indeed. The price of fuel is horrendous. A lot of the countries do not have any oil reserves at all. A country like Kenya, for example , last year spent 65 per cent of its foreign currency earnings on buying oil and oil-related products. The price of copper is down. It is now costing a country like Zambia more to produce the copper than the copper is worth on the world market. The countries in the area are facing horrendous economic problems. They can be helped only by a peaceful settlement in Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have used up practically all my time on this debate. I did not want to pre- empt the debate of the parliamentary delegation that has recently been in southern Africa, so I confined my remarks to Namibia and countries that have a bearing on it. Australia does have a large involvement in the area. We played a leading role in bringing about a peaceful settlement in Zimbabwe. We stand prepared to play a similar role in Namibia and I would hope that in the near future, within this chamber, we will be able to have a full debate not only on our parliamentary delegation's report on southern Africa but also on the problems of southern Africa generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a short contribution to this debate in the time available, partly as a member of the Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs and Defence which produced the report on Namibia and also as a member of the parliamentary delegation to which Senator Sibraa referred, it having just recently visited some of the front line states and held some discussions there on the subject of Namibia. The report traces the history of South West Africa, or Namibia, from pre-World War I to today and traces its tortuous path towards independence-what some might call liberation. The report brings those who read it up to date on such developments. It also traces the role that Australia has played and details our current position and policies on Namibia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee's role was to monitor and report, and this is what it has done. It does not reach profound conclusions; rather it finds itself generally confirming the Australian Government's policy and our contribution in the region . It is important to appreciate that we are not the principal player on this particular stage. It would be impossible for us to play a mediating role in view of our relationship with South Africa. The principal players are rather the Republic of South Africa, the South West Africa People's Organisation, the Group of Five, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, and the frontline states. Nevertheless, we do have a significant responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> We were pleased in Africa, when speaking to people such as Prime Minister Mugabe, President Kaunda, and President Moi of Kenya, to hear the laudatory terms in which Australia is spoken of and particularly the high praise that is given to our Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). How has this come about? It has come about, firstly, because of the role we have been prepared to play in seeking independence for colonised peoples throughout the world, particularly in Africa, evidenced by the contribution of our Prime Minister at the 1979 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Lusaka in relation to the Rhodesian problem. Secondly, it has come about because of our attitude in relation to the North-South dialogue, the transfer of resources from rich to poor countries, that is, from the developed to the developing and undeveloped. That has given us a particular responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> How does that apply to the particular problem of Namibia? It means that we have a role to play, firstly, in bringing Namibia to independence. That is now inevitable and has been accepted by all countries, even by South Africa since about 1977. This acceptance has come about, and I think has escalated in recent times, partly, as Senator Sibraa mentioned, because of the economic consequences to the frontline states of a continuation of the dispute and fighting, and partly because South Africa is now finally counting the cost of its involvement in Namibia. So we have that role to play in bringing the country to independence . Even more importantly, we have a role when Namibia is brought to independence of assisting it in its formative years. I suspect this will be a period of great strain, particularly in view of the general economic strife, evidenced by record low commodity prices, with which the whole of southern Africa is presently faced . </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal briefly with those two points. Firstly, let me deal with our role in the independence process. Our policy, which has been applied consistently, supports efforts to achieve a peaceful transition to independence. In May 1978 Mr Peacock, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We support all attempts to find peaceful solutions based on the principle of majority rule and human rights for all. </PARA>
<PARA>Basically, that remains our policy today. Although we were a party to General Assembly Resolution 31/146 of December 1976, we have since then not supported United Nations statements which accept SWAPO as the sole and authentic representation of the Namibian people. We have, and I would submit realistically , accepted SWAPO as a major and authentic representation of Namibian opinion. I think this highlights the fact that there has been some intransigence by South Africa, but the intransigence of the United Nations has not helped in some areas . Clearly, SWAPO is not the sole representative of the views of the Namibian people. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also not been prepared to agree to United Nations resolutions which have supported the armed struggle of the Namibian people. I applaud that. We are opposed to the use of force in resolving international conflicts. Again, it does the United Nations no credit when it advocates forceful resolution of internatioanl situations. We, of course, are not prepared to contribute militarily to liberation organisations. We have accepted the opinions of the International Court of Justice and therefore see South Africa's occupation of Namibia as illegal. At the same time, we support the United Nations settlement proposals that are contained in Resolution 435 and the work being done by the body described as the Group of Five, or the Western Contract Group. As such we have indicated that we would be willing to contribute to UNTAG, the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group, and I applaud that statement. I have said before in the Senate that I believe Australia must be prepared to meet its international responsibilities and play a part in United Nations monitoring, peacekeeping or transition forces, as we did in Zimbabwe and for which we received considerable credit, and as we are prepared to do in Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> There remain several other hurdles in achieving independence. Walvis Bay is one . It is unrealistic to treat the one deep port in Namibia, 600 miles from South Africa, as remaining part of the Republic of South Africa. Australia should stand by the statement it made in the past, and I believe repeated, that because of moral and pragmatic considerations Walvis Bay should form part of a united and independent Namibia. It will otherwise simply remain a festering sore that, after independence, must lead to further destabilisation.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also the hurdle of the method of election. Although I can understand South Africa and the USA looking at ways to attempt to protect minority interests within Namibia, it is nevertheless impossible to attempt to do that by methods of voting and methods of election which as the one man-two votes or the one vote counted twice methods, which simply are going to be beyond the comprehension of the people of Namibia. Therefore, I cannot see that security can be offered by any more than that which SWAPO is prepared to accept, and that is a proportional system of voting. The other matter that is of so much importance is the problem of Cuban troops in Angola. I believe that, to be consistent with the principle for which we strive with respect to independent countries, that is, their complete sovereignty, we cannot maintain that troops in one independent country can be a limiting factor to the independence of a third country. Therefore, I support the Committee's view that this should not be a prerequisite to independence of Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal very briefly with the second area, and I refer to our responsibility for post-independence in Namibia. It is interesting that Marxist states such as Angola and Mozambique are finally making overtures to the West. They are being let down by the Soviets in the area of economic development, which they regard as critically important, I think this gives a tremendous opportunity to the West to develop these countries in a way that will lead to the stabilisation of the whole region. The economic position in southern Africa is going to be most difficult. It is going to be a time of great trauma for Namibia when it finally becomes independent. Therefore, I believe that Australia must accept its responsibility to give aid, which will result in greater stabilisation of the whole area and therefore be a further small contribution towards world peace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this afternoon I tabled the report of the Senate House Committee in relation to the Joint House Department and gave a tabling statement on behalf of the Committee. At that time I sought leave to continue my remarks. The remarks I now wish to address to the Senate are opinions of my own. I indicate that they are not necessarily the opinions of other members of the Committee. I seek the opportunity to give my own individual opinion on the matters raised in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to say first of all that there was some controversy relating to whether a Senate committee ought to undertake this inquiry, and suggestions have been made that there is somehow some lack of legitimacy to the inquiry because only a Senate committee was looking at this matter and not a House of Representatives committee. I totally reject that point of view. In the tabling statement and in the report the Committee gives its view in relation to its right to undertake an inquiry which is of interest to members of the House of Representatives and to senators. In that regard I point out very briefly that a House of Representatives committee is currently looking at the issue of whether Ministers from one chamber ought to appear before the other chamber in order to answer questions at Question Time. That House of Representatives committee invited submissions from senators as well as members of the House of Representatives because that is an issue which would interest members of both chambers. I believe that at least one senator has made a submission to that House of Representatives committee on that matter of common interest. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason that one chamber cannot carry out inquiries which are relevant to the interests of members of both chambers. Nevertheless, I am disappointed that a number of members of the House of Representatives took this point of view and were encouraged to take this point of view. I do not think that the inquiry of the Senate House Committee was diminished. A number of members of the House of Representatives, as well as individual senators, sought to meet with the Committee and to express an opinion in relation to the Joint House Department. Nevertheless it would have been useful if those members who wrote to me as Chairman of the Committee indicating that they had points of view , that they would put to a joint committee, had in fact put them to the Senate Committee. I hope that the fact that their points of view were not put, will not in any way diminish the conclusions of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> An issue to which I would particularly like to refer is the question of the role of the Presiding Officers. The Committee recommends that the Joint House Committee ought to be given some executive power in relation to policy. I am aware that that is an opinion which will be rather strongly disputed by some people. I think it relevant that I point out some sections of the report that might clarify matters which have already been confused. It has been already claimed that to give executive power to a body such as the Joint House Committee is in some way a challenge to Westminster traditions in relation to Presiding Officers. Certain powers are conferred on the Presiding Officers of this Parliament, the Speaker of the House of Represenatives and the President of the Senate, under the Public Service Act 1922. The relevant section is section 9 and the appropriate sub-sections, in relation to the Joint House Department, are sub -sections (1) (c), (2) and (2AB) (e). This Act describes matters in relation to the Presiding Officers' rights for the appointment of staff. That is the only prescription of rights that Parliament has ever given.</PARA>
<PARA> Presiding officers are, of course, part of the Parliament and, in a sense, the creation of the Parliament. Any powers they have are either powers that have been specifically ascribed to them by parliament through an Act, as in the case of the Public Service Act, or powers that parliament has allowed them to have. It is always open to parliament to indicate otherwise to the Presiding Officers. The Presiding Officers are elected by the members of the chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate, and are subject to their direction. Therefore, I do not think there can be any doubt that parliament has the power to direct certain things to take place in relation to the present powers of the Presiding Officers. If the House of Representatives and the Senate chose by resolution to give executive power to the Joint House Committee, without doubt the principle behind that choice is intact. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators and members might like to debate how far that conferring of power to a parliamentary committee ought to go; whether it should be detailed or whether it should happen at all. To my mind there is no doubt that it has to happen. One of the things that this Senate inquiry has indicated, to me at least, is that there are areas of responsibility which this Parliament ought to take a little more seriously than it does. Money that is spent at Parliament House, whether it is in relation the the Parliamentary Library, the Joint House Department or any other parliamentary department, derives from the public purse and we have no less responsibility, as representatives of the people, to oversight the actual expenditure of that money and to make sure that we keep a check on how decision- making processes in relation to those departments operate and what the effects of them are. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this inquiry arose out of the questions and frustrations that arose in an Estimates committee which was attempting to exercise that oversight. Estimates committees try to give effect to the principle of parliamentary oversight of public funds. Estimates Committee A attempted that in relation to the Joint House Department, was frustrated in its questions, was not very pleased with the answers it was given in relation to some priorities, and decided that a special investigation should be carried out. One of the things that were mentioned was the fact that the Parliamentary Library, whose funds had been quite dramaticaly cut, was apparently accorded less priority than the subject of the purchase of some sporting equipment. The question of who makes a decision as to whether there should be sufficient materials in the Library, which are very important to members of parliament in the conduct of their duties and in carrying out their responsibilities, as against the purchase of sporting equipment for I know not whom-probably it is available to members of parliament; I do not know because I do not use these sporting facilities-and what priorities are exercised in such decisions are matters that ought to concern us. They should concern us in the first instance because it is expenditure of public money and, in the second instance because it is parliament that is being affected and we ought to have some expertise in that, and I believe we ought to have some input. </PARA>
<PARA> The present situation in relation to the Joint House Committee and its powerlessness is one that has evolved through custom. The control of policy in those areas as it ascribes to the Presiding Officers is a control that has been allowed to happen; it is not statutorily conferred. There is no law of this land that confers that power. The Houses of Parliament, both the House of Representatives and the Senate, have laid down that these committees in relation to the Joint House Department will exist. The Houses have never indicated what powers those individual committees, or those sitting together as a joint committee, ought to have. I suggest that it is open to the Houses to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is probably also open to the Joint House Committee to be a little more assertive than it is at the moment. If it is claimed that because the Joint House Committee has operated in this way in the past without ever an indication from parliament on whether that is the way parliament wanted it to operate, I suggest that by a line of logic it is therefore open to the Joint House Committee to change its practice. If the present authority is claimed to be based on the practice of the Joint House Committee then authority can change through changed practice of the Joint House Committee. But it probably would be preferable that the Houses of Parliament address themselves specifically to it. Odgers refers to the position of the Joint House Committee in Australian Senate Practice. Pettifer refers to it in the House of Representatives Practice. Pettifer refers to it rather more absolutely than does Odgers and I would question really whether a statement made by Pettifer such as 'Executive responsibility lies with the Speaker and the President, who are not bound by the decisions of the Committees' is really a statement of fact. It may be a statement of usage but it may not necessarily be a statement of absolute fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to some evidence that was given in this regard to the Committee by the Secretary of the Joint House Department when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there have been a number of practices that have arisen which could give Members and Senators a different approach according to who the authorities were. For example, it depends very much on the Presiding Officers at the time, and particularly the Chairman, just what attitude is adopted. The current Speaker has indicated, I think categorically, that the Presiding Officers have the authority in relation to matters that come up before the Joint House Committee. He regards the Committee as an advisory body and decisions will be made by the Presiding Officers. Looking over the history of the Joint House Committee, we see that quite obviously from time to time the Joint House Committee has itself made decisions and has given directions for things to be done . . . But at present, as I understand it, the Presiding Officers and particularly the Chairman of the Joint House Committee believe that that Joint House Committee is an advisory body and that all decisions are made by the Presiding Officers. </PARA>
<PARA>The current Speaker's attitude contrasts with that of one of his predecessors, the Honourable Sir Littleton Groom, who said in the House of Representatives in 1927:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the President and the Speaker, in the matter of appointments and promotions, are bound by definite provision in the Public Service Act . . . parliament itself is responsible for the determination of the functions and duties of its committees. </PARA>
<PARA>That includes the Joint House Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a brief contribution to this debate to add to some of the comments that have been made by the Chairman of the Senate House Committee, Senator Martin. I was a member of the Committee for the bulk of the inquiry, joining it a little after it started. I commend the Secretary of the Committee for the contribution he made, and also the Secretariat and the Committee staff. I would like also to thank those who came before us and indicate that most of those who came before us attempted to provide a good deal of material to us and to answer frankly and openly the questions put to them. There was some reticence on the part of one or two witnesses which, while understandable, was regrettable, I feel-a sort of sense of misplaced loyalty perhaps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was interesting that during the currency of this inquiry I was also sitting on the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing. It was interesting to notice that both committees were looking basically at the same thing. Both were attempting to find ways and means of giving more responsibility to the senators who sit in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is quite clear, if one gives it a moment's thought, that the senators who sit here see their needs most clearly, whether it be in the way of services provided to them, staff provided to them or ways in which money might be spent. Senators are the ones who are able to indicate clearly how the money might best be spent. The Senate House Committee put forward strongly in its report the recommendation that senators should have a greater involvement in the decision-making on conditions at all levels. Surely this is not much to ask. This feeling amongst members of the Committee led to our first two recommendations. Since the Chairman of the Committee did not read them I will read them to the Senate. The first recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that each House resolve to empower their respective House Committees, when sitting together as the Joint House Committee, with the executive responsibility for policy in relation to the functions of the Joint House Department . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The second recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that there be a determination of policy by the Joint House Committee covering the nature and level of services to be provided by the Refreshment Rooms . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is completely inappropriate, as the Chairman mentioned, that the Joint House Committee should be only an advisory body. Members of the Committee give their time usually when they have other things to do but they have been told that the Committee is only an advisory body and the advice which it gives can be rejected . We have the farcical situation in which senators in this place and members of the other place are entrusted with the mangement of the affairs of the country. Yet, there is some suggestion that they are not able to manage the minor affairs , shall we say, of their own conditions. I found this-I know that all members of the Committee did-to be a deplorable paternalistic attitude and one which we certainly could not accept. Simply to say that this is the way in which things have been done or that this is the way in which the practice has arisen is not enough. We need to challenge it at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendations 3 and 4 recommend the desirability of certain investigations. Let me stress that point. The two matters mentioned were the contracting out of all or part of the refreshment room services and all or part of the cleaning functions. I make the point again that the Committee asks that this matter be looked into. There may well be some reason why we should not let out the cleaning function, perhaps reasons of security. There may be some reasons why we should not let out some aspects of the services offered by the refreshment rooms . The Committee wishes to be informed of any such reasons. It seems to me ridiculous to have people and committees giving advice-I refer to the report of Urwick International Pty Ltd, Estimates Committee A and other groups that have given advice in this matter-if it is going to be ignored. I suggest that the members of the committee which we propose would not reject that advice and would give it some consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to make another very strong point. Members of the Senate House Committee were very conscious of the need to protect the livelihood of the present staff in both the cleaning area and in the refreshment rooms area. Let no one think that the Committee suggested that there should be wholesale sackings from those areas. Let no one suggest that in its considerations the Committee did not have the livelihood of the present employees in the front of its mind. As a matter of fact during the hearings of the Committee one of the witnesses was asked whether the present cleaning staff would be retained if the cleaning was let out to contract. The suggestion was made that this was very likely-that this is the sort of practice that probably would be followed and that there would not be wholesale sackings and an entirely new group moved in. The Committee stresses that it is only asking that this matter be properly considered, not ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> I find this situation rather similar to the Commonwealth car situation. There are many on this side of the chamber-Senator McLaren in particular-who believe that Commonwealth cars should not be replaced by hire cars or taxis. I will not canvass the arguments here because Senator McLaren has put them very well on previous occasions. Nevertheless, this is a situation in which, on economic grounds-I am not saying that it would be so-we might consider using taxis or hire cars but we might reject it and retain the Commonwealth cars on other very valid grounds. The same situation might apply to the current technical staff. This is dealt with in recommendation 11. It might be better to retain the present staff than to move over to the staff of the Department of Transport and Construction. It ought to be looked at. It ought to be considered not by one person or by a bureaucrat but by the Joint House Committee or a committee especially set up to do the job. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to take up too much time of the Senate. I believe there are some vital issues in this report. It is a matter of attitude in many cases rather than just the facts of the case. We do not want a paternalistic attitude. We do not want to be told what is best for us. We want to see a committee composed of senators decide on the conditions that we see as most appropriate. We would highlight our particular needs and have some part in making the decision on how the resources should be allocated. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Senate for any length of time because I know a number of other members of the Senate House Committee wish to speak to the report of that Committee. I am also conscious that if time had permitted the Chairman of the Committee would have wanted to raise a matter that was drawn to our attention during the whole of the inquiry. I am referring to the report of Urwick International Pty Ltd. This report, as honourable senators are aware, has been raised in this chamber on a number of occasions. We were particularly conscious of the remarks directing our attention towards it during the Committee's inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the first question which has to be asked because we had such difficulty obtaining a copy of the report is: Whose report is it? My response to that is that it is the Parliament's report. It is not a Presiding Officer's report. It is not the Presiding Officers' report. Public money was spent on a management consultancy organisation to bring about a particular situation or to make a number of suggestions and proposals. The report was made available to us after a good deal of hassle. Honourable senators will recall that eventually the Senate House Committee had to take the unusual step of applying to the Senate itself to have the President instructed to release the report to us. The Committee did not take that decision lightly. The Committee was aware that that course of action was available to it but it felt that it was not a practice which should be adopted as a general procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the Committee had considered that report the question which arose was: Why could it not be released? Members of the Committee could not find anything of such a controversial nature in the report that it was not possible to have it released for general consumption. It would provide, for instance, the opportunity for worker participation. Those people who could be affected by the results of that report would have the opportunity to put forward to their respective heads of departments ideas that may be cost constructive or time constructive. The release of that report would give consumers the opportunity to participate. After all is said and done, we, as members of the Parliament, are people who consume the services of the Joint House Department. Whatever happens to the Joint House Department has an effect on members of this Parliament. Whilst we may not always agree with some of the decisions that are made by the majority, if a majority decision were made then I am sure most members would agree with it. For instance, there are the problems Senator Robertson has already raised relating to an assessment of whether we should have contract cleaning in this Parliament. A number of honourable senators on this side of the House in particular-I am sure this applies also to a number of honourable senators on the other side of the House-would look first and foremost at job security for those people who are already employed in the Parliament doing a specific job of work. Nevertheless, it would have to be admitted that in some instances and in a number of areas perhaps the job is not being done as efficiently as it could be if it were done by a contractor. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies to the services of the refreshment rooms. I have visited a number of parliaments since the time I came into this place over eight years ago . One situation that particularly comes to mind is that which applies in New Zealand, where the refreshment rooms are run under a total contract service. I do not know what the situation was like before that. I do not know why the decision was made to enter into a contractual arrangement. Nevertheless, the service was good and the range of service available was extremely good. I must admit that I was very impressed with the service that I received while I was there. Of course, it is very difficult for a visitor to go to another country and say that everything is exactly as she would wish it to be in her own country . The visitor does not know the prior circumstances or whether she is, perhaps, receiving particular attention because she is a visitor, especially a visiting member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Those four points have to be made; they were raised continuously before the Committee. I have given my response to the question: 'Whose report is it?' Some $75,000 of public money was spent in compiling the report. I believe that the public has a right to know how that money was spent. We could see no valid reason for its not being released. We were told constantly that the report contained controversial sections-that is might not be wise to spread it more broadly than had already been the case. I certainly could not find those controversial sections. I have referred to the areas of worker participation and consumer participation. I believe that, all in all, the Parliament must now make the decision that perhaps the report should be released generally as soon as practicable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join other speakers in congratulating the staff upon the wonderful assistance they gave the members of the Senate House Committee during its inquiry. We all know that a great many hours were devoted by the staff to producing this report, which I hope in due course will be accepted by the Senate. Except for a short break, I have served on the Senate House Committee for a period of about nine years. That break occurred because of frustrations encountered on that Committee and being accused by other members of parliament of not doing one's job. I saw fit to resign for a short period to allow one complainant to take my place on the Committee, but he did not do so. Our former colleague, ex-Senator Melzer, had to fill in. When Senator Melzer left Parliament I accepted a nomination to return to the Committee. Thus, I am well aware of the frustrations felt by members of both Houses, when we sit as a joint committee, in being classified as members of an advisory body only. I have mentioned that fact in the Senate many times and have sought by various ways and means to have some authority given to the members of parliament who serve on the Committee. Of course, that is embodied in recommendation No. 1 which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that each House resolve to empower their respective House committees, when sitting together as the Joint House Committee, with the executive responsibility for policy in relation to the functions of the Joint House Department. </PARA>
<PARA>If that course is accepted the Committee will have the power to decide how to meet and carry out its duties. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things about which I am very concerned-I have previously expressed this opinion in the Parliament-is that the records of proceedings of the Joint House Committee should be made available to all members of parliament on request so that they can see what their representatives are doing in their elected capacity as members of the Committee. I hope that if recommendation No. 1 is agreed to we can do something along those lines. Recommendation No. 3-I will be very brief about these matters-states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that there be a thorough examination as soon as possible of the alternatives for operating all or part of the Refreshment Rooms on a contract or concession basis. </PARA>
<PARA>I have some private concern about that recommendation. The Committee has recommended a thorough examination of the possibility that the work should be done on a contract or concession basis, but I emphasise that I have no complaint about the service that is provided by the parliamentary dining room staff. I believe, considering what we pay, that it is quite adequate. If the Parliament, in its wisdom, decides that the Refreshment Rooms should be operated on a contract or concession basis, serious thought will have to be given to the sitting hours of the Parliament. Personally, I believe at the moment we are in utter chaos. The sitting hours of the Senate, on Thursdays in particular, are not fair to the parliamentary dining room staff or to the people who work in the kitchen. I am very disturbed to note that when the Parliament made its decision on sitting hours due consultation did not take place with those who were to be so severely affected by it. If a decision is taken to hand over the operation of the dining room to a contractor, I am sure that no contractor would put up with the conditions which operate at present-not knowing how many people will come into the dining room or at what time, particularly on Thursdays. </PARA>
<PARA> I would make the same comments in regard to recommendation No. 4 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that immediate consideration be given to contracting out all or part of the cleaning function. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that the recommendation is merely that the matter be given immediate consideration. I would not like the cleaning staff to think that we are recommending that in the near future they should be removed from Parliament House and the cleaning handed over to contractors. I would not like to see that happen. I hope that the cleaning staff will look at our recommendation in the light that the matter is merely to be considered. If the recommendation is acted upon they or their representatives will be able to come forward and put their point of view to whoever is to make the decision. Also, recommendation No. 11 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the proposal of the Department of Transport and Construction concerning repairs and maintenance be further considered by way of a study aimed at establishing costs, benefits and the effects on Parliament's present technical staff. </PARA>
<PARA>In my 11 years in this place I have had fairly close contact with the technical staff. I have always found them to be courteous and capable of doing a very good job. I will give one illustration which concerns a win achieved by the Joint House Committee, acting in an advisory capacity. The Speaker seemed intent on disposing of the chairs in the parliamentary dining room. I am very pleased that the members of the Joint House Committee banded together and were able to prevent him from so doing. We were able to have those chairs re-covered. Much of the re-dowelling and other necessary repair work was done in the Parliament House carpentry shop. I do not believe that anyone who uses those chairs in the dining room-they have been here since the opening of the first Parliament-would have any complaints about them. That is one victory that we achieved, even though we acted in an advisory capacity only. We dug our heels in. I pay tribute to the work of the technical staff of this Parliament. They are all dedicated, be they carpenters, painters or electricians. If honourable senators go to them with a request to do a job, it is done, and done well, without quibbling or growling. I hope that they, with the cleaners, will not read into this recommendation a complaint about their ability or the way in which they have served the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to say a few brief words about the matter raised by Senator Coleman-the recommendation of the Committee that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Presiding Officers, one or both, give urgent consideration to the tabling of the Urwick Report in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I have always said that if public money is spent in commissioning consultants to undertake reports such reports should be made available to the Parliament. It is often claimed that a report is interdepartmental in nature. Similarly, a lot of money was spent on the Marks report but we have no access to it and do not know what its recommendations are. My colleague, Senator Robertson, touched on that subject briefly when he dealt with the matter of Commonwealth cars. I feel that once public money is expended on any inquiry which has been commissioned by the Parliament, the officers of the Parliament or Ministers, the resulting report should be made available to the Parliament. We must find ways and means to see that that is done in the future. I hope that some action is taken to make the Urwick report available to every member of Parliament, so that we can see whether we got value for money expended. I am not at liberty to make any comment on that report now because it was given to the Committee on a privileged basis. We are thus prevented from quoting it or saying whether its recommendations are to our satisfaction. It should be tabled in the Parliament so that every member has access to it and can make up his or her own mind as to whether the amount of money that it cost was justified and the expenditure worth while. Finally, I again express my thanks to the staff who were associated with this report. I hope their work is rewarded in the proper manner. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.21)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are glad that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has come forward with such a sane and practical viewpoint, as read out to the Senate earlier today by Senator Sibraa. We, as a group, maintain our long held opposition to the purchase of a short deck aircraft carrier for the Royal Australian Navy. We hope the Government will now put that idea into permanent cold storage. I think the Government would make a sensible contribution towards the defence debate in Australia from now on if it said one way or another whether it has decided that the force of evidence brought forward to it, including this unanimous decision from one of its own committees, is to the effect that now the Invincible is not available, to purchase a new aircraft carrier would be prohibitive even from the point of view of the cost of the platform, to say nothing of the cost of the aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point that arises from that, and to which I would like to address myself briefly, is whether we should seek any alternative naval strength. The view has been put that we should not do so, that we should simply increase our reliance on aircraft as the most effective and fastest missile platforms. I would like to take mild issue with that view. I do not agree with it because I think a stationary platform or a seaborne platform is essential in certain circumstances . When one recalls that the Israeli destroyer Elath was sunk by Styx missiles fired by Egytian patrol boats, quite small ships which actually were at anchor in Port Said Harbour, one can see that a seaborne vessel, even if it is completely quiescent, playing a lying-in-wait role, can be of considerable value . </PARA>
<PARA> I am impelled to put in a word to honourable senators at this stage for one of the more modern missile ships of small size, high strike power and relatively small manning. I am not particularly pushing any particular one although I have personal experience of the Boeing Marine company's patrol hydrofoil vessel, a modern weapon available at relatively low cost and requiring relatively low crewing levels. The United states Navy already has a squadron in operation and it will probably also build for the navies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. With the co-operation of the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair)-I thank him for that-I was able to be present on the sea trials of USS Taurus, the last of the Pegasus class of hydrofoil to be delivered to the United States Navy in Seattle in June. I must say I was impressed with the obvious capability of this class of ship, especially as a missile launcher. The Pegasus class of vessel is quite small, being of only 243 tonnes displacement. However, each mounts no fewer than eight Harpoon missiles on lightweight launchers and all eight missiles can be delivered in 13 to 20 seconds. Boeing Marine told me that this was a better performance than that of our much more expensive and larger FFG frigates, which can launch four Harpoon missiles in 40 seconds. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence we have a small and inexpensive ship which, because of modern technology and development, can mount this enormous clout, probably the most of any small warship in history. The PHMs also mount on the foredeck a completely computerised self-laying 76mm Oto Melara gun which can fire at a rate of 80 rounds a minute. The ship is also very effectively fitted with defensive radar and six electronic chaff launchers as missile decoys. The top speed of the ships is classified information but I tried to use my eyes and ears while I was aboard the Taurus during her trials and, without saying anything wrong, an informed guess would be that the ship can actually attack and cruise at speeds in excess of 50 knots. That is a very considerable speed when the manoeuvrability of this type of hydrofoil is considered. Range is 1,000 kilometres, although that can be increased with extra tankage. The ship can refuel at sea, even in high weather. It requires a crew of only 21 men. </PARA>
<PARA> Boeing Marine told me that for a reasonable production run of six to 10 ships-I gather the US Navy is interested in more-the all-up cost including weapons and the eight Harpoon missiles, which are important, would be some $75m a ship. I believe that this type of weapon ought to be considered by our country because of its suitability for our defence in certain situations. Certainly the value of modern missile strike was demonstrated in the Falklands war. Is the PHM an effective missile platform? It seems to me to be better than most because it is not a hydrofoil in the usual sense; the feeling aboard it is more like flying than being in a ship because it virtually flies on a submerged wing with an aerofoil section. The significance of this is that the hull is held well out of the water with the foil under water so that even in large waves-under tests as high as 22 feet, remembering that this is only a 250-tonne ship-it remains quite steady and level and can launch missiles effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Its speed and manoeuvreability are obvious pluses and I was also very impressed with the great rapidity at which the ship could approach its top speed while foil-borne and with its immense manoeuvreability. There was none of the overrun or stern-swinging effect such as with an ordinary displacement hull. Rather, the ship responds immediately to command. A less obvious plus is its low profile. I gather from the makers that torpedo attack on these ships is rather pointless when they are foil-borne since there is only a very small target in the water to attack. USS Taurus was fitted with six electronic foil launchers. These throw a cloud of metallic foil into the air to confuse approaching missiles. The significance of the hydrofoil is, however, that, because of its great speed it can be away from the scene before the missile reaches the foil and explodes. Other ships with smaller displacement hulls inevitably would incur damage, even under those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> On present costing, 10 of these highly potent weapons carrying a total of 80 Harpoon missiles, which of course are very much compatible with our own Service needs, could be deployed in Australia for half the cost of a single aircraft carrier and its aircraft. I believe that in combination with our F18 aircraft the hydrofoil attack craft would make an invasion attempt of Australia quite unlikely to succeed because of the damage to the enemy's surface vessels, including troopships, that would quite inevitably ensue. I do believe we should take this step, as all countries in the world have done, towards the fast missile attack ship. We have here the advantage of modern technology in that the hydrofoil is a very modern concept. It has been developed at the expense of another country and is available for us at least to consider. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am concerned about one of the sections in the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I will not go through the whole report because members of this Parliament have done that quite adequately. This section makes me wonder whether, in coming to this conclusion, the Committee was fully and adequately informed, recognising the time constraints under which it operated. Paragraph 2.23 on page 25 refers to the Harrier aircraft. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Characteristics of the Harrier which are not in dispute are that it is a subsonic aircraft, with a relatively short range radius of action, a poor radar, capable only of day time or clear weather operations, poor 'look-down' capability, incompatible with modern weapons systems, and alleged to have lesser agility than contemporary aircraft . . . Because of the absence of any large- scale demand for the aircraft . . . it is unlikely that there will be any significant development of the aircraft in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA>I know we have had many debates in this chamber on many types of aircraft, as is the case in the other place, but from my knowledge of the industry-I try to keep abreast of it as much as I can within the constraints of doing all the other work involved with the Senate-there is really no such thing as a bad aircraft. Some aircraft are made for particular jobs and some suit particular jobs or particular countries better than others but I say again that there is no such thing as a bad aircraft. The report refers to a relatively short range radius. How does one describe the relatively short range radius of an aircraft? It depends basically on how much fuel is carried, the fuel tanks fitted, and how much ordnance is carried on the underwing stations. It is easy to say that this aircraft or any other aircraft has a relatively short-range radius, but I repeat that it depends on the operational requirements for the aircraft at any particular time. The document goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the poor radar, capable of only daytime or clear weather operations. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a pulse radar, everyone knows that, but it is one of the best there is given the state of the art. It certainly gave the lie to being 'capable of only daytime or clear weather operations' in the Falklands operation. We have been talking to the people who operated it down there. We have had a couple of pilots here who took part in that operation, and we know that it was operating in every sort of weather, in fogs-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate directs that except in respect to second reading speeches introducing Bills, statements made by senators when tabling reports, statements by chairmen on behalf of committees, and other speeches, explanations or statements where leave of the Senate is specifically given, the Presiding Officer in the Senate hereafter shall strictly enforce Standing Order 406 to ensure that no senator shall read his speech, so that proper and effective debate will be maintained in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>I move the motion because I think it is high time that we took this matter in hand. I regret that I shall not be here in the course of this debate because of long standing commitments, nor shall I be here to vote on my own motion or to reply to it; but I trust that other senators will handle the matter effectively. Standing Order 406 is very simple. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> No Senator shall read his speech. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not go as far as to say that it is honoured more in the breach than in the observance. However, it is very often dishonoured, and I have noted it on many occasions in recent months. I understand the situation when honourable senators come first into this place and do not find it easy to take part in debate, or are put off by interjections. It is a matter of obtaining skill in this area. But after 18 months in this Parliament, it is high time that the rising number of honourable senators who are reading their speeches, and reading them very obviously, should not be permitted to continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is, of course, that this Senate has for years been noted for the debate that takes place here, unlike the House of Representatives, which for some time has abandoned this practice and allowed the reading of speeches. The result is that so many people come in, make their speeches and leave. They do not wait to hear what is said. Unfortunately, that is what I shall be doing today, so that may be taken as a particularly bad example. This is what happens constantly in the House of Representatives. Therefore, there is not the interchange of someone being present before he starts his speech, questioning the other speaker, trying to flush out the argument that is developing and likewise being prepared to answer when he has sat down. That has been the difference between debate in the House of Representatives and debate in this chamber. I believe there is great danger if we do not enforce Standing Order 406 . </PARA>
<PARA> We well know that persons who from time to time are in the chair have had complaints made to them about the reading of speeches. One remembers so many occasions when there was a grin on the face of the presiding officer, who said: 'You are perhaps using too copious notes, senator'. We all know that what is being read is word for word the speech that appears in Hansard the next day. We know this also because of the tabling of those speeches which has occurred from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is there the problem that we do not have an interchange in debate, which was the glory of this Senate, but also there is the opportunity for staff to engage themselves in preparing speeches which perhaps represent their ideas rather than the senator's. Though the speech may be well directed and well prepared, it is not therefore the argument which the senator would himself or herself put before the chamber. I remind the Senate that in the better Parliaments overseas there is no doubt about the reading of speeches. I quote from page 413 of the nineteenth edition of Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice in regard to the United Kingdom:</PARA>
<PARA> In the House of Lords the reading of speeches is alien to the custom of the House. It is recognised, however, that in certain circumstances, such as when a Ministerial Statement is being made, it is necessary for a Lord to read from a prepared text. In practice speakers often have recourse to 'extended notes', but it is considered contrary to the interests of good debate that they should follow them too closely. </PARA>
<PARA> In the House of Commons a Member is not permitted to read his speech, but may refresh his memory by reference to notes. A Member may read extracts from documents, but his own language must be delivered bona fide in the form of an unwritten composition. The purpose of this rule is primarily to maintain the cut and thrust of debate, which depends upon successive speakers meeting in their speeches to some extent the arguments of earlier speeches; debate decays under a regime of set speeches prepared beforehand without reference to each other. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very significant factor in this debate. Likewise, in Canada one finds that the same rules apply. In both chambers it is required that there should not be reading of speeches. Indeed, Sir John Bourinot, who has written the authoritative book on the parliamentary procedure and practice, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Written speeches not permissible-It is a rule in both Houses of Parliament that a member must address the House orally, and not read from a written, previously prepared speech; for the reasons stated by Mr Fox in 1806 that 'if the practice of reading written speeches-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Missen. I do so, perhaps, on a different basis. We all come to this chamber from various occupations; in my own case, it was from the workshop floor . In shop committees one had five minutes to put an argument. Perhaps a longer period is available for people to put their arguments in legal circles, or for councillors and such people. But the character of a speech is destroyed when it is a written speech. On many occasions it is the character of the research officer that comes through and not that of the individual making the speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without giving away any secrets, I remember one Tasmanian colleague who, when we were in power, had a speech prepared by a research officer. He advocated a policy which would have been detrimental to the apple crops of Tasmania. I do not think my colleague took much notice of his written speeches thereafter. Let me tell a story which epitomises the way in which people's characters go overboard when they have too many speech writers. There was a prominent Sydney footballer who subsequently became a fairly good commentator. The chap in question had all the briefings available on how to conduct himself. When somebody fumbled a ball he would say: 'Oh, butter fingers'. Anyone knowing that man would know that he would not have used the words 'butter fingers' if a ball was dropped. At a later stage Senator Douglas McClelland could probably tell the Senate who I am thinking about. That person is not calling sport now. To me that indicated the futility of being too conditioned with instructions. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be true that not everybody in the Senate can emulate the oratory of John Wheeldon. Anybody who heard John Wheeldon at his best heard a super performer. But I think when we get up to say our piece we should not be tied down too much. Of course if we have a quotation or a list of figures, as Senator Missen said, we can have it incorporated in Hansard, and we can have it incorporated in normal size type-we can do a host of things. But I think our normal fluency is stilted and jarred when we read a speech which does not express our own thoughts or reactions. </PARA>
<PARA> I think what Senator Missen said is true. For the first 12 months in this place people have a running in period. But I think most of us would find, accepting the idea of copious notes, that the important thing is that we express our own views. Whether one is full of fire or cynical does not matter, as long as one is expressing one's own thoughts. I think far too often we hear these sombre sorts of phrases and when we meet the senator outside in the corridor, he never uses those expressions. They are simply not him. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the point that Senator Missen has made, many of us who serve in the position of Acting Deputy President are always afraid that someone will take a point of order on the matter that has now been raised. We all know that, to say the least, the words 'copious notes' have been prostituted. I think what Senator Missen is getting at is that if we speed up the play and get a fiery speech from the belly and not a speech from someone outside who has written it in a cold fashion, it would put more vigour into the debate, although I know that in the last 48 hours that characteristic has been present in abundance. I agree with Senator Missen. I think this matter should be looked at. It is something about which a senator could boast in this chamber-that when he spoke, they were his own thoughts, not the grafted on thoughts of someone else who had spent hours in the Library getting his thoughts. </PARA>

<PARA>Leave out all words after 'That', insert 'the matter of reading of speeches and the application of Standing Order 406 be referred to the Standing Orders Committee'</PARA>
<PARA>I do this because as I have said in my opening comments, Senator Missen in his motion seems to suggest some variation to what the actual Standing Order says. I am not talking about practices, I am talking about the Standing Order. It would seem, according to the reading, unless I am wrong in this, that Ministers and the chairmen of committees and some others are being delinquent also. But there are many factors involved here and certainly I think that this is a matter which ought rightly to be referred to the Standing Orders Committee. That is the group set up by the Senate to do this job, to look at the present Standing Orders to see whether they are applicable. It may well be that the Committee will decide that a number of people ought to be allowed to read their speeches. It may well be that the Committee will come back to the Senate with a recommendation that certain people, such as Ministers and chairmen of committees and so on, do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I do raise one point, though. Who will challenge when a person is alleged to be reading his speech? I can envisage a situation where this would devolve on one or two people in the chamber. It may well be the Whips who have to make the decision. I can see a lot of bad feeling being developed if a Whip has to stand up every so often and say, 'I claim that Senator so and so is reading his speech ' and then we get an indulgent smile and someone says he is reading from copious notes. The copious notes that I have noted as I have walked around the chamber include comments such as 'pause'. I would suggest that a lot of time could be wasted if we try to debate this particular matter here. We have a propensity for spending a lot of time on matters which perhaps could be dealt with more expeditiously by being referred to the appropriate committee. I would hope that we would refrain from debate on the original motion and go to a vote on this motion immediately and refer this matter to the Standing Orders Committee, see what it has to recommend and perhaps have a debate when that recommendation from the Standing Orders Committee comes back.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This is the second time, to my knowledge, in my 11 years here, that this matter has been debated. On the last occasion I spoke strongly against the type of thing that my colleague Senator Missen is trying to do now. A while ago, the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) I think it was, said that some of the speeches which are read are boring and people in this chamber should not be subjected to them. I would say that for many speeches that people make off the top of their heads. I have been bored stiff with them too. So I think it cuts both ways. I think we should have consideration for people who perhaps cannot do something off the top of their heads. They need to prepare something. They prepare it and they read it. There are many people who can read a speech. I have watched people around this chamber who read a speech but unless one was watching them one would never know that they were reading it. Now what is the difference between someone doing that and someone deliberately and openly reading a speech in this chamber? I see nothing wrong with it. I think it is important that allowances be made for those of us who feel that we just cannot stand up here and speak for 25 or 30 minutes on a subject just off the top of our heads. I think that we have to make allowances for people who cannot do that. It is all very well for those honourable senators here who are competent enough to stand up and do it. But let us have some compassion and understanding for those people who may not have that capacity. They are the people that we will victimise.

It is a lot of nonsense to say that they are all someone else's words, that someone else is writing their speeches and they are only mouthing what someone else has written. That is not true. It could happen, of course it could happen. When a Minister stands at the table and puts down his second reading speech, I am pretty certain that he does not write that speech. His staff does it for him and he comes into the chamber and delivers it. All Ministers have that opportunity. Shadow Ministers have that opportunity. It is the poor old backbencher who is the one who has to suffer all the time. He cannot have any consideration at all. I think that we are taking a bad step as we did on the last occasion when we debated this particular Standing Order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There may be no definitive point of order but, with respect, it demonstrates the point I was making. I conclude by saying that the majority of honourable senators coming into this chamber come in with a fixed view. I do not want to be critical of one or other political party's style of conduct, but the Australian Labor Party is committed by caucus and when members of the ALP enter this chamber they know how they will vote. I believe one can reasonably assume and presume that on most occasions one will know how the Liberals intend to vote. Very rarely is one persuaded by an articulate speaker on the other side. One might be a bit more concerned and have some apprehension about one's course of direction, but invariably when someone comes into the chamber he knows how he will vote. I do not think it is a bad thing for honourable senators to be able to articulate and to reflect in the written word precisely what they think. If any honourable senator has a research officer who writes speeches that do not accord with what he would want reflected in a speech , obviously he has the wrong man on his staff. I would have thought that the average research officer would be philosophically compatible with his senator. I do not think there is any concern about that unless the research officer's communication with his senator is a bit out of touch or he is trying to slot in a speech which would either sabotage him or set him in the wrong direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not fair and it is grossly unkind to those who do not have a capacity to be able to reflect their views in a precise fashion to not be allowed no longer to refer to notes and speeches. I am much more interested in hearing what a man has to say-whether it be the written word or not-if it is accurate, precise and a reflection of his thinking, than I am in hearing him bumbling and stumbling, nervous and apprehensive, and unable to say what he is thinking. I get a great deal more satisfaction, knowledge and occasionally wisdom from hearing people read speeches which they have deliberated over for some time and which reflect what they are trying to say. For those people who are unable to articulate what they would like to say and for all of us who, on occasions, want to say something in a very tight, precise fashion, we ought to be able to read our speeches. </PARA>

<PARA> I am concerned that Senator Missen's motion asks the Presiding Officer to enforce Standing Order 406; that is, the Standing Order that provides that no senator may read his speech. That Standing Order should be amended to read that no back bencher may read his speech. Every Minister, every Opposition shadow Minister and honourable senators presenting reports are entitled, under Standing Order 406, to read a prepared speech. So the only people which Standing Order 406 affects are back benchers. Back benchers have very limited staff to write speeches for them. But if they have the capability to write a speech for themselves, in my view-as Senator Crichton-Browne has said-they should be able to read it. Of course, we may then find senators coming in here with written speeches, as Ministers do, and seeking leave to have them incorporated. Then we would not have to listen to them. Nobody listens to our speeches on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The only time honourable senators would read the speeches would be on Wednesdays. This would save a lot of time in this Parliament. Senators could come in with a written speech, as the Ministers do, and seek leave to have it incorporated. No doubt on some occasions they would be refused leave. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to recount a little episode. It happened in this Parliament some years ago when former Senator Kane was here. He repeatedly read speeches until my colleague, Senator Cavanagh, realised that those speeches were written by a person by the name of Santamaria, the head man of the National Civic Council. One night Senator Cavanagh asked that the speech be tabled. Of course, as soon as it was tabled, he was able to get hold of it and later during the night he read the speech. If honourable senators look at the Hansard they will see the two identical speeches. Senator Gair, who was at the time Leader of the Democratric Labor Party, went to Senator Cavanagh and said: 'You have destroyed Kane. He will never make another speech'. While he was here he never did make a speech consisting of anything more than two or three paragraphs. </PARA>

But then he would fall back on the observation that perhaps the honourable senator was using copious notes. They were copious. They were all over the place. When an honourable senator gets into a bit of a flurry, as Senator Crichton-Browne says some honourable senators do, if there are interjections, and if an honourable senator does not have a prepared speech, that honourable senator probably does not say the things that he or she wanted to or give the true meaning in the speech being delivered.</PARA></TALK.START>

They would not have to try to make sense out of a lot of speeches by putting them together in a coherent fashion. There is no objection to honourable members in the other place reading speeches. When I came here and inquired why we were not allowed to do the same in the Senate, I was told that this Standing Order was brought into being because lazy honourable senators were just getting hold of the House of Representatives Hansard and re-reading speeches that someone had made in the other place.

<PARA> My friend Senator Missen is not here. He is probably listening to the debate and he will prob- ably rush back into the chamber to deal with me before he has to leave. He used words like 'flush out the argument' and 'exchange of ideas'. What a starry conception of this chamber. We all know that sometimes this does happen, but it is a rarity. As Senators McLaren, Crichton-Browne and Bonner say, this is a chamber mainly of political argument. But occasionally there will be that spontaneous reaction to an honourable senator's very good argument. Sometimes those very good arguments have been read from a piece of paper, but they are somebody's thoughts. I am interested in the character and experience of honourable senators opposite and on this side of the chamber. Sometimes, as Senator Crichton-Browne said, that can come out only when they put down their thoughts carefully, distil them and read the speech; and if they read their speeches with feeling, they will be better than if they do not. It seems to me that Senator Missen is living in the age of ancient Rome or Greece. This is what he has in mind-a time before pencils and paper were invented. It is a wonderful and a starry idea but it is not practical. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Robertson raised another point concerned with the enforcement of this Standing Order, and he canvassed the possibility that the Whips may have to carry out this function. I do not think that is necessary. It can be dealt with as it is dealt with now. Any honourable senator in this place may take a point of order drawing the attention of the Chair to what is happening. On balance, I support the motion. I have a great deal of sympathy for the points of view of Senator Bonner and Senator Crichton-Browne. I have heard and observed in the time I have been here many honourable senators new to this place responding in a very lucid and fluent way during debate to points that have been put. However, when they have returned to their 'copious notes' their speeches have become boring and almost impossible to listen to. </PARA>
<PARA> This chamber is a far more entertaining chamber than the other place, mainly because very few speeches in this place are read.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment put forward by the Opposition Whip, Senator Robertson. The reason we are debating this motion this afternoon is that the Standing Order has come completely into disrepute. Senator Missen spoke about the number of reasons for which people already are allowed to read their speeches in this place. In addition, Ministers and shadow Ministers can read their speeches, as well as the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats. I think it is quite right that as the leaders of a third party they should be able to read their speeches when they are responding to a major measure such as the Budget. So under the present practices at any time on any one day at least one-third of the senators can read their speeches. I think that is the reason why we are talking about Standing Order 406 at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A particular member of the Senate, who is not on the Government side, on many occasions in my opinon reads his speeches. He happens to be one of the best speed readers I have ever heard, but that does not take anything at all away from the speeches he delivers. Senator MacGibbon amazes me. I would not accuse him of reading his speeches, but he makes some very entertaining speeches on highly technical defence matters. He has page after page of figures. While it could not be said that he reads his whole speech-he does not-when he makes a speech such as the one he made here on the F18A aircraft somebody on this side could get up and take a point of order. If the President took Standing Order 406 as it is written at the moment he would have to say that Senator MacGibbon was reading his speech. At any one time Senator MacGibbon would probably read three or four minutes of matter concerning technical details. That does not mean that he will not then speak without notes for four or five minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> Standing Order 406 has become virtually unenforceable in that one-third of the members of the Senate are able to get away with the fact that they are reading their speeches. For that reason I think some good arguments have been put up this afternoon on both sides of the Senate. As Senator Robertson said, this matter should be sent back to the Standing Orders Committee. It could examine what we have said-the sort of things that I have mentioned here this afternoon, including the role of the Democrats. The Democrats have shadow portfolios. If our shadow ministers are allowed to read their speeches does this mean that all the Democrats, if they are discussing an important matter, can read their speeches? I think those are the things the Standing Orders Committee has to consider and on which it should make recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose both the amendment and the motion. I do not know whether I am able to foreshadow a motion that Standing Order 406 be deleted completely. It seems to me that that would be by far the best arrangement. Whilst I can appreciate the sentiments of Senator Sibraa, and I support substantially what he is saying, if this matter goes back to the Standing Orders Committee, having debated it today it will come back to us in a month or so and we will have a rehash of the whole debate. If the majority view is that the motion will be defeated, it seems to me we are taking a back route way of getting the matter back to the Standing Orders Committee. The practice has developed, whether we like it or not, of honourable senators being obliged to talk on a wide variety of issues which are becoming more and more complex. Speeches on these issues require not only spontaneity but also a great deal of detail. In the 11 years I have been in this place I have seen how difficult it has become for ordinary members of the Senate to debate the complex subjects that have become part of the legislative process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ministers in this place who have to present a case for the Government often represent another Minister and therefore they are forced to rely upon a prepared text. Similarly, as Senator Sibraa said, honourable senators on the Opposition front bench have to rely on a great deal of prepared material. It is conceded that the more one can make a spontaneous contribution the better it is. To suggest that every honourable senator should be put in the position of having to be completely spontaneous when making a speech makes a mockery of the whole principle of rational debate. And surely what we are all about is rational debate. We have to make sure that the contributions by honourable senators show an understanding of the issues under consideration. We have to make sure that a speech which is read by other people or listened to by honourable senators on the other side of the chamber makes sense and is relevant to the issues being debated. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sibraa very correctly pointed to the fact that about one-third of honourable senators are already able to rely upon a prepared text, or copious notes, as they used to be called when points of order were taken five, six, seven or eight years ago. I think society has become a lot more complex in that period. One only has to look at the type of legislation with which we are dealing to see how difficult it is for the average member of parliament to be completely au fait with the complexities of all the matters debated within the Parliament. I think we can make a more important and rational contribution if we are able to rely upon some assistance. After all, that is our purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I was one of those in my party who fought for the principle the Labor Government introduced in those terribly infamous years from 1972 to 1975 that every member of parliament should have a research officer. We did not have that assistance then. It was essential to have this assistance if we were to be able to make a contribution within the Parliament. Having got that assistance, honourable senators cannot tell me that their helpers, their assistants, their researchers can impart to them orally all that they need to know to enable them to make a speech. One needs that additive to set out one's party or personal or philosophical or ideological position when making a contribution to a debate. I believe that this makes for better government and for a better Parliament. After all, our friends in the Press Gallery base their decisions on whether to publish a speech on what one is able to say. </PARA>

I think we should get to the position where we are assisted-to use a phrase which was used in my early days in this place-by the use of copious notes. I think the standard of debate has improved immeasurably as a result of the use of copious notes and assistance through the extra resources that have been given to members of parliament. Rather than keeping Standing Order 406-that is where I have a minor disagreement with Senator Sibraa; I am sure he agrees substantially with what I am saying-I am sure the time has arrived when we can make a mature decision and take it out completely.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question I want to raise is really the status of the motion moved by Senator Missen in relation to the Standing Orders. It seems to me that it is for the Presiding Officer to maintain order in the chamber and it is up to him to exercise that authority, even though I agree that Standing Order 406 is in absolute terms. I suppose it is up to the Presiding Officer from time to time to exercise some discretion. Indeed, it is incumbent on the senator who is challenged to indicate to the chamber whether he or she is indeed reading a speech. Normally the reply of the senator is taken to be definitive. If it is not taken to be definitive, and if the Chair wishes to enforce Standing Order 406 against the senator, I guess that is up to the Presiding Officer. It seems to me that, if order is to be maintained by the President, it is hardly proper for the Senate in this motion to direct the President as to how he shall enforce the Standing Order from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I am not seeking any special privilege of the Senate this afternoon but some honourable senators will be aware that Senator Missen had to leave the Parliament early and therefore was not able to be here, apart from to move the motion. He asked me if I would perform a function in relation to reply. I think all honourable senators know the reason that Senator Missen was unable to be here this afternoon. Those reasons were genuine and legitimate and no aspersions should be cast upon him because he is not here to reply on the subject of his motion. He has asked me to perform the function of reply. I would have spoken on this motion in any event. I realise I cannot claim the privilege of closing the debate but I indicate to honourable senators that Senator Missen hoped that I might be able to do that on his behalf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, I would like to reply to the extraordinary proposition just put by Senator Tate, that there is some impertinence involved in the Senate's directing the Presiding Officer in some way. This is an issue which has recently come to the Senate, the issue of whether the Presiding Officer is the servant or the master of the chamber. There is absolutely no doubt that the Presiding Officer is the servant of the chamber. In that context I should like to refer briefly to Odgers's Australian Senate Practice in that section on rules and orders where he discusses the nature of Standing Orders, and the statement that a President's ruling which has not been dissented from is equivalent to a resolution of the Senate. So the President can give a ruling. If the Senate does not dissent it is then equivalent to a ruling of the Senate. However, it is always within the Senate's power to overturn that ruling, to come back to it and say: 'The Senate now wishes to proceed in a different way'. That is the position . </PARA>
<PARA> I should like also to respond very briefly to an extraordinary proposition put to the Senate by Senator Gietzelt. As I understood what Senator Gietzelt was saying, he said that a research assistant could prepare a document for us on a subject. Therefore, because the research assistant had done a very good job, or understood it well, or perhaps understood it better than the honourable senator, that was some sort of justification for a senator coming in and reading that document as though it was the senator's own. That is a very dangerous proposition. It is also an extraordinary one. The obvious question comes to mind immediately: If that is so, the research assistant should be sitting in the chamber, not the senator. If a senator is not capable of reading some sort of briefing material prepared for him by a member of staff or some other person, understanding it and then coming in and expressing perhaps the identical point of view-it does not really matter whether it is identical; but expressing it himself and showing a comprehension of it-he has no place in this chamber. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ministers have to abide by every part of it. It is a separate proposition altogether. People hold strong views on this. The reason they hold strong views is that they either object to what happens to debate when it is allowable for speeches to be read or else they are frightened of not being able to read their speeches in the future. We have all been through that last syndrome and nobody suggests that it is easy. I still think that probably my most traumatic experience in this chamber was my maiden speech-which I did not read-but nevertheless it is something which lives very vividly in my mind as something that I do not want to go through again. There is a certain amount of nervousness and, in some cases, even trauma in settling down to this forum. I had a great deal of experience as a public speaker before I came into the Senate but I had had no experience which equated with speaking in this chamber. It was as though I had not spoken publicly before, to come in here, to fit in with the forms of the chamber and so on. As a consequence, the Senate has traditionally been fairly lenient on new senators. It has allowed them a lot of leeway until they settle down, find their feet and find what the chamber is all about. What the chamber is not at all about, as was pointed out very well I thought by Senator Missen, is reading set pieces at one another. It is about debate of issues. It is about an interchange of ideas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very sad that some honourable senators-and relatively new senators-have this afternoon taken it upon themselves to say that debate here does not matter, that it contributes not to the development of ideas or, indeed, the persuasion of other senators. Some of those very senators have gone so far as to suggest that debate somehow is enhanced by reading set pieces. I find that a sad proposition because there are a number of issues which have been debated in the Senate which have been what we could call running debates over a period of months or years. Senators have taken an opportunity on certain sets of Bills-the education Bills are one set of Bills that Senator Teague would agree with me on- to pick up a theme about, for example, what we should expect from education in Australia. There is a certain amount of party politics in any debate. There has been a certain amount of party politics in that education debate. But a great part of that education debate has been a genuine contribution of ideas from senators who cared about the issue, who have put it on the record, who have put forward an idea for debate-debate by their colleagues, by senators on the opposite side and by people outside this chamber who have fed back their ideas on those issues. I instance education as just one such issue. I think defence is probably another debate which has progressed very satisfactorily in those terms in this chamber. It will not progress at all if, when sitting here, we have some sort of set piece read at us which we know has been handed to the Press Gallery- handed to the Press Gallery for the reason of reporting, not for the reason of any sort of interchange or exchange of ideas or advancement of the actual issue.</PARA>
<PARA> There is real debate in this chamber and I will go so far as to say that one of the reasons there is more real debate of that nature in this chamber than in the House of Representatives is that there they read their speeches and the whole business of giving speeches there is just a matter of standing one's feet, talking to an allotted Bill for an allotted length of time and reciting what the member or someone else has written on this subject at some other time. It has its effect. Senator Haines does not have any colleagues in the House of Representatives. I do not say that in an insulting way, but our colleagues have been discussing this issue with us in the past few days and everybody who has discussed it with me has said: 'I wish we did not read speeches in our House. But it is a case of one in, all in'. Apart from the exceptions that Senator Missen has given, if honourable senators generally can read their speeches then everyone will do it because, first, it is the only way they are going to be reported correctly and, secondly, it becomes a superior way or gives people an edge in terms of circulating their points of view because others do not have to find the page in Hansard to read what they said. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate but it is true. Human nature is weak, which brings me to the issue of the motion and the issue of Senator Robertson's amendment. I am going to vote against the amendment and for the motion. I want to say to Senator Robertson that there is nothing inconsistent between Senator Missen's motion and what Senator Robertson would like to achieve. Aspersions have been cast on whether this should be regarded as a genuine motion because it seems somehow to be at variance with the Standing Orders. In fact Presidents and honourable senators who have been in the chair have ruled in relation to points of order being raised under Standing Order 406, or, alternatively the Senate has allowed a certain practice to develop here. A practice we have allowed to develop is that Ministers read their second reading speeches and that a shadow Minister may read a response--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will finish dealing with those who read speeches. Honourable senators who are presenting reports and tabling statements on behalf of a committee and in the case of some personal explanations we have accepted that it is reasonable to allow speeches to be read, for very good reasons. We have never accepted that it is reasonable to allow other speeches to be read. Senator Robertson's objective could indeed be achieved by his moving, subsequent to a vote on Senator Missen's motion, a motion that the Standing Orders be looked at to see whether they should be redrafted specifically as Senator Missen's motion would have the Senate behave, which is a summary of how the Senate does behave.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate that through practice the Senate has allowed this situation to exist under Standing Order 406. Senator Missen, by drawing attention to the non- enforcement of Standing Order 406 was not aiming at these sorts of conditions which the Senate has accepted as reasonable practices. Senator Missen was saying that apart from those instances, however, the debate in this chamber has been downgraded by what has become a virtual ignoring of Standing Order 406. Senator Gietzelt put a case that Standing Order 406 should go. I am sure there are other honourable senators who agree with him. If the amendment moved by Senator Robertson is not successful-I hope it is not successful for a reason I will outline in a moment-and if he were to move his amendment as a motion some time in the future then I think the Senate probably would happily send that to the Standing Orders Committee to allow his point of view to be considered, to allow Senator Gietzelt's point of view to be considered and to allow a whole lot of other points of view that have been canvassed here this afternoon to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying to the Senate that there is no conflict in that sense. However, I think it is important that since the amendment has been moved as such it should be defeated. The effect of not defeating it would be this: A situation has evolved here, to which no one has taken exception except for the occasional raising of Standing Order 406, of many honourable senators reading their speeches under circumstances which one would not consider to be acceptable. If Senator Robertson's amendment is carried all we are going to do is send the issue raised by Senator Missen to the Standing Orders Committee. We all know that we do not get speedy results from the Standing Orders Committee. It could well be, on experience, up to 12 months before we hear--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry; I was being too charitable. Senator Robert Ray points out that it could be longer than that. For instance, it could well be 12 months before the Committee reported to the Senate. The effect of that would be that the Chair would have to consider that the Senate had rejected what Senator Missen wanted us to do and that the Senate did not want this ruling. Senator Robertson shakes his head but that would be the effect because if we pass his amendment we then delete an instruction to the Presiding Officer that this Standing Order be enforced in a particular way. I reiterate what Odgers said: In the absence of that resolution the President's rulings will stand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mean no offence to the incumbent of the chair but in recent months some extraordinary situations have arisen in this chamber in relation to the reading of speeches. There was an occasion when a number of honourable senators raised points of order against an honourable senator for blatant reading of a speech. The reason it was raised was that he was mispronouncing words in the speech. Under those circumstances, one could reasonably conclude that he did not write the speech, that they were not his words. That is offensive. That particular honourable senator came in here and read somebody's speech, presenting it as his own ideas and expected us to debate seriously what he was putting forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLaren has had his turn and he does go on forever. There are certain things that I would like to say to do justice to Senator Missen's case. One of the things I would like to do is quote from Odgers's Australian Senate Practice because I think it is something the Senate should be taking into consideration in its deliberation on this important issue. On the subject of reading speeches and quotations, Odgers states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While holding that it is not in order for a Senator to read his speech without leave of the Senate, President Brown ruled that copious notes may be referred to . </PARA>
<PARA>It is that initial ruling that is responsible for our being able to use copious notes when they are genuinely copious notes. Odgers continues:</PARA>
<PARA> On 21 August 1969 . . . President Sir Alister McMullin ruled:</PARA>
<PARA> Senate practice is to allow a Minister to read his second reading speech. But it is recognised that, where an honourable senator is dealing with an intricate matter and where he wishes to be-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reading Odgers. Nothing could be more intelligent on the subject than that. I was quoting from the Australian Senate Practice and what Sir Alister McMullin, a former President of the Senate, who ruled:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senate practice is to allow a Minister to read his second reading speech. But it is recognised that, when an honourable senator is dealing with an intricate matter and where he wishes to be quite sure of his facts and wishes to pay reasonable attention to the subject, he may use what can be referred to as copious notes. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the basis on which the use of copious notes is supposed to apply. I referred earlier to an example of an honourable senator clearly reading a speech prepared by someone else. The person in the chair ruled that the honourable senator concerned was reading from copious notes. That led to a situation in which the senator in question was asked to table the copious notes. It turned out to be a written speech. That was clear to the Senate. Further on this subject, Odgers states:</PARA>
<PARA> On 10 March 1943, the Standing Orders Committee considered the application of S .O. 406 dealing with the reading of speeches in the Senate, and the Committee decided that it was not advisable to amend the standing order, but agreed that if a senator desired, for special reasons, to read his speech, he should be able to do so by leave (i.e. unanimous leave) of the Senate. The President ruled accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crichton-Browne saw fit to draw me up when I suggested that leave could be used while he was speaking. He made the assertion that it is hardly ever granted, I wish to point out that that is not so. Only last Thursday night I was given leave to read a statement to the Senate. Odgers continues:</PARA>
<PARA>When this standing order was considered and adopted in 1903 the Chairman of Committees . . . stated that the true reason for the existence-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason that I am about to give is just as valid today, and relates to what Senator Gietzelt was saying. I repeat:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When this standing order was considered and adopted in 1903, the Chairman of Committees (Senator Best) stated that the true reason for the existence of the standing order was that the Senate should have some guarantee that the speech delivered by an honourable Senator had been prepared by himself. The President ( Senator Sir Richard Baker), speaking in Committee, related the following anecdote in support of the standing order:</PARA>
<PARA> In America, at one time, Congress had no such standing order as this. The consequence was that there grew up in Washington a class of gentlemen who lived by writing speeches for members of both Houses. While this practice prevailed, a practical joker, who had been offended in some way, wrote the same speech for no less than three honourable Senators, who delivered or attempted to deliver it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like the honourable senator to point it out. That was a little bit of entertainment on which I missed out. There is the risk that people will present as their own ideas the ideas of someone else. I wish to refer briefly to some of the arguments used. Senator Martyr said that Standing Order 406 was an absolute prohibition on the reading of speeches. In fact, Odgers points out that the Senate has allowed some relaxation of that in very particular ways. Senator Missen's motion merely seeks to reaffirm a relaxation that has been allowed through practice of the Senate, one which, as Odgers points out, has as a result of rulings of the President the force of a resolution of the Senate itself. In the same context, Senator Sibraa said that the Standing Order had fallen into complete disrepute. I refer him also to Odgers and say that the Standing Order has not fallen into disrepute. Reasonable practices-the practices outlined in Senator Missen's motion-have evolved in this place and become part of the practice of the Senate. They could become part of the Standing Order, if Senator Robertson chose to move a motion to that effect after Senator Missen's motion had been dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, people have strong feelings about whether speeches should or should not be read. We all have our views. I would not want it suggested that those who have voted in the past, as I have, for the retention of Standing Order 406-the retention of the practice of not reading speeches-are in any way inconsiderate or heartless in regard to their colleagues. We have had some excellent speeches in the debate this afternoon. It has been one of the most entertaining debates that I can recall. None of those speeches has been read. Certain quotations have been made but the speeches have not been read. Senator Bonner gave an outstanding speech, albeit an impassioned plea, for being able to read his speech-</PARA>

We have seen all honourable senators speak one way or another, be it in committee, during second reading debates, the Committee of the Whole or Estimates committees. All senators are capable of doing so; there can be no question that they cannot. They should not be here if they cannot. The purpose of debate is to present an argument. The purpose of sitting and listening to a debate is to analyse the validity of that argument, to understand it and, through understanding it, to be able to communicate a contrary point of view in reply. If we are not capable of that, we should not be here.

I have attended a large number of pre-selection councils of the Liberal Party. I have yet to see anyone who read his speech endorsed in a contest of any merit. Of course, it was also Senator Crichton-Browne who said that we come into the Senate with a fixed idea and the debate is really not persuasive. On that point I conclude by saying that debate in this place is persuasive and important. We ought to be able to give our own points of view.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment is, of course, the precise opposite of the motion proposed by Senator Missen. I want honourable senators to comprehend that. What concerns me is that I do not believe this is the appropriate way by which the Senate should change the Standing Orders in a significant way. I do not believe this is the appropriate way to delete a Standing Order. I believe, at the very least, that if honourable senators wish to delete Standing Order 406 they should proceed by giving notice to the Senate of their intention so to do, or should follow the course of action suggested by Senator Martin a few moments ago and take the opportunity later to have the question referred to the Standing Orders Committee. We voted against Senator Robertson's motion because to have agreed to it would have prevented Senator Missen's motion being put to a vote. We want Senator Missen's motion to be put. I believe it would be very unfortunate if we proceeded now to strike out a Standing Order, as it were, on the run. If Senator Gietzelt wants the Senate seriously to give consideration to the abolition of Standing Order 406, that is fine, but I suggest to him that this is not the most appropriate way by which that should be done. I would invite him to do it either by giving notice for consideration at a later date or preferably by a separate reference to the Standing Orders Committee after this debate has concluded.</PARA></TALK.START>

As the direct negative is defined, it is not so, the reason being that the direct negative is one where the same effect could be achieved by voting against the motion. In this case that is not so. Senator Gietzelt has moved both an amendment in regard to Senator Missen's motion and also a supplementary amendment amending Standing Orders. I should draw it to the attention of the Senate that although this is in order, it is a very unusual way of amending Standing Orders. The Senate should think very carefully about whether it wishes to amend Standing Orders in this somewhat cavalier fashion. Nevertheless, the amendment is in order.</PARA></TALK.START>

In my view the amendment is a good amendment which will overcome many of the problems which we now face in this place. It saves the problems which we would face if Senator Missen's motion were carried. I therefore ask the Senate to agree to the amendment moved by Senator Gietzelt. </PARA>

It is important for the Senate to accept Senator Gietzelt's amendment because it will eliminate the sort of drivel that has been going on in this chamber since I have been a senator. When honourable senators have a bit of a pet on, they tend to say that somebody is reading his speech, and then there is a great argument and row about it. If people want to read their speeches, let them do it. We are getting their thoughts. I entirely disagree with what was said by Senator Martin. She implied that all of our thoughts are entirely our own. We are influenced by everything that happens in here, by what happens outside and by what we read in the newspapers. Our minds are composites of everything that affects us, which touches and rubs off on us. That is what we articulate in the Senate. If there are views and thoughts in a research officer' s suggestions or even a speech, we make up our own minds as to whether we use them or not.

My view of the matter is that I will vote against both propositions and leave things as they are until we come up with a better proposition than Senator Missen's motion and Senator Gietzelt's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I just want to say to Senator Georges that I do not think anyone could accuse Senator Missen of pushing this matter in haste. He did ask for it to be given some precedence in terms of listing on the Notice Paper so that it could be settled. It has been on the Notice Paper for three months and it is not a new subject to us. I think it is something that we have had time to look at and think about and certainly debate at length. However, I do object to being ambushed by another amendment such as that moved by Senator Gietzelt. The comments I made on Senator Robertson's amendment earlier I would have meant equally to apply to Senator Gietzelt's foreshadowed amendment, that is, that we can vote for Senator Missen's motion to indicate that in the interim, while we are awaiting a report from the Standing Orders Committee or whatever, we want certain procedures to be followed from the Chair. I think Senator Gietzelt has been here long enough to know that we do not move for the deletion of Standing Orders in this way, on the run. Senator Missen gave the proper notice on 25 May 1982 and we have had time to think about it, having been given that notice. I suggest that Senator Gietzelt ought to withdraw his amendment, and, at some subsequent time, go through the motions that we are all expected to go through if we want to vary the procedures of the Senate, that is, give notice of the motion and move it. It may well be a motion to request the Standing Orders Committee to look at the possible deletion of Standing Order 406. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not speak at length when I initially raised this matter. I rather hoped that by being brief perhaps we might have got on with the subject set down for today, which is fairly important . We have had a fair range of debate today. It seems that the precept I put forward is just as effective as most precepts and examples. Nobody took any notice of it whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it very difficult here to speak against a colleague, but I would have to speak against Sentor Gietzelt on this occasion. I am encouraged a little by the fact that Senator Georges has done so. I hope the Press has not noticed this and there is not any sort of flurry in the newspapers tomorrow. But if he can do it, then so can I. I support what has been said around the chamber, that it is most unwise to change Standing Orders on the run. I am not very encouraged by the fact that in 1903 certain decisions were made and we have looked at them ever since. I am sure that we ought to be giving this matter a lot more serious consideration than some honourable senators are giving it at the moment. I will heed the advice of the Acting Deputy President who was sitting in your place at the time, Sir, and who cautioned us that changing Standing Orders on the run is a very dangerous proposition. At present we have the extraordinary situation before us that if we accept the Missen proposition and vote for it, virtually the status quo will remain. If we reject the Missen proposition, the status quo will remain also, because that is what we are doing at present. I cannot see any great changes there. Odgers said-and I rasied this in my initial discussions- that the Standing Order says that no senator shall read his speech. Senator Martin has quoted Odgers, who is perhaps not as well accepted on some sides of the chamber as others, to say that certain practices have been established, therefore it is all right if we carry on like this. </PARA>
<PARA> May I make the point that the committee system is effective. It is one of the things that we ought to be proud of in the Senate. The many committees of the Senate operate very effectively and I am suggesting that the Standing Orders Committee operates just as effectively. I reject the proposition made by Senator Martin that we might get something back in 12 months. We are speaking of the Standing Orders Committee that is operating at the present time and I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that there have been a number of innovations in the last 12 months. They have not been completely accepted. We have had two people speak this afternoon at some length on how they do not accept certain of the propositions that have been put forward by the Standing Orders Commitee. But it cannot be said that the Standing Orders Committee has not been working and has not brought forward some suggestions for the better running of the Senate. We made the point when we brought forward a suggestion about the change in times that they had existed for quite a long time and they related back to a British system which did not seem appropriate. It is nonsense to talk about there being the right hours for the Senate to sit. We set our own hours and we operate under them. If we find that they are not effective then, of course, because it was a sessional order, we will try something else. That may well be a reversal of what we did before. I mention that only in passing in order to show that the Committee has been effective. </PARA>
<PARA> I had rather hoped, when I moved the original amendment that we would see the need to refer back to the Standing Orders Committee something which is very important. I would have thought that the normal way to operate would be to raise something as a reference to a committee and then ask that committee to look at it. The same practice applies with the Standing Orders Committee as with any other committee--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OP7">Senator ROBERTSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. As my colleague says, they knocked that over. I do not quite know why, because we have had recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee presented here and the standard practice seems to be to refer matters back all the time. Here is something which came out of the blue and yet that is not to be referred to the appropriate committee for discussion. We have put forward propositions before in reaction to what people have said and they have been sent back to be looked at again after debate. But here we have something which, with due respect, has been plucked out of the air and brought to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us remember that the Missen suggestion was that we 'instruct'-and I dislike that word-the President to do certain things, to take notice of certain Standing Orders. I do not believe that that is the way it ought to operate. I believe we ought to look at a Standing Order if it is not appearing to be effective and ask the Committee to say why it is not effective, why it is not working in the way that it was meant to work. Then the Standing Orders Committee, which is composed , as Senator Georges indicated earlier, of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition, the Whips and other people who have a particular interest in this subject, can give it quite a deal of time and consideration. I would suggest that the consideration which is given to the proposition that has come forward be given in a slightly less emotive atmosphere than that which has prevailed this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> I am encouraged by Senator Martin's comments that if, in light of the rejection of my amendment, I come back later with a proposition that this matter be referred to the Standing Orders Committee, it will receive support. I understand , of course, that Senator Martin, despite her prestige within the party, cannot commit the Government to it. But there seemed to be a few nods of approval on the other side at the suggestion that we look at this matter again and bring it back to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would ask honourable senators to think very seriously about this matter. It is most unfortunate to look at Standing Orders on the run-the phrase that we have heard this afternoon-and make very drastic changes to what we are going to do without referring it back to the Committee. I would suggest to honourable senators very seriously, with all due respect to my colleague Senator Gietzelt, that we send this matter back to the Standing Orders Committee at a later stage, but that we reject his proposition at this stage because I do not believe that it has been given enough mature consideration. I suggest that we reject that proposition. It does not matter whether we reject or accept the Missen proposition because the status quo will remain. I will then, at a later stage, on the prompting of the Government, bring forward a proposition that Standing Order 406 be looked at again by the Standing Orders Committee and then we can come back with a recommendation which we can place before the Senate for further and perhaps mature debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise for not having copious notes. I hope that I might be able to make do with the few that I have. The Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts brought down the report entitled ' Preparation for the Workforce' quite some time ago. Unfortunately, due to a series of events, we have been unable to have a general debate on this subject. The next major event, after the tabling of this report, was the Government's reply to it. As I remember, it was almost a year ago-at the beginning of the Budget session last year-that that report was tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;June.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was tabled in June. At that time I thought it was a relatively poor report, and upon reading it again, as well as the Government's reply, that opinion has been confirmed. That is a pity because the subject matter of the report on preparation for the workforce is probably one of the most vital educational issues that faces this country today. It seems to me to be a pity that the chance was lost at that time to have a thorough, in-depth and hard hitting report instead of the one we received. I think, as a consequence, the ministerial statement-the Government's response to the report-also failed to find much meat in the report. The responses tended to be along the lines of, ' This is a good idea' or 'This is a good idea and it is a matter for the States to look at'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The education area is extremely important and it is one in which this Parliament has a constitutional role. The States, quite rightly under the Constitution, have control of education, but education cannot be divorced from the total direction of the nation. Therefore, I think this Parliament has a role , not so much in the nitty-gritty, not in the running of schools-except in the Australian Capital Territory-but rather in a much wider sense of giving a broad national plan where education fits in with the other important national considerations. It is not possible for individual States to undertake that role. They have their own specific responsibilities and rarely, if ever, are able to give consideration to that totality of direction that is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore with increasing disappointment that I realise that the Government has failed in many areas to grasp the types of advances that have been made in the past. The last time I spoke on the subject of education was in relation to the Curriculum Development Centre, which I thought was an extremely worthwhile and important educational innovation in this country from the point of view of a national look at that vital issue in terms of where we are going as a country. Without some type of national plan, some forethought or some reaching into the future, we will end up with a hotch-potch of educational responses to the problems that constantly arise. In its report the Committee emphasised that aspect. I believe that part of the report focussed directly on the issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are you suggesting a unitary response, Senator?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not suggesting a unitary response. What I am suggesting is that the Commonwealth Government, in terms of its economic planning, its industrial planning for new industries and in terms of how it views the problem of finding work for its citizens into the year 2000, must pay attention to the educational development of those citizens. It is not constitutionally proper for this Government to be conerned with the nitty-gritty . I believe quite firmly that the devolution and dispersa of that type of power is to the advantage of education. I am talking about the vision that is necessary at a national level to provide the broad scope, the forward thinking plans, such as were provided with the Curriculum Development Centre. In the short time that that Centre was in operation it gained an international reputation for its work. I think educationalists overseas were shocked and dismayed when they heard it was to be disbanded. Apart from giving that broad national response, the Curriculum Development Centre was probably one of the first attempts by the Commonwealth and the States to work together. The unfortunate part about it was that the Commonwealth gave an ultimatum concerning finances which were really quite peripheral to the whole issue. The States did not pick it up. That only reinforces the point that I have been making; the States do have a much more parochial view of education. That is not a criticism of them. I am merely saying that that is their area of legitimate concern. But the area of legitimate concern for the Commonwealth Government is much broader.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the report which, on page 13, mentions the class size. Unfortunately it is clear that time has rapidly caught up with the Committee's work, because the report states;</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is not aware of any significant research findings in Australia that would lead to any firm conclusions on what optimal size classes should be. </PARA>
<PARA>It then refers to Professor Glass's work which was really only a reworking of the findings of a large number of individual research projects. Of course, since that time Professor Campbell of the University of Queensland has done some excellent pathfinding work in this regard. He has put up, I believe, conclusive evidence on class size in relation to educational outcomes. I believe he has been able to show quite conclusively that the gut feeling, as it were, that teachers have always had about class sizes can be empirically verified, and that I believe is extremely important work. The Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) in his ministerial statement said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Commonwealth accepts the merit of the objective that class sizes be as small as practicable for teaching and learning, consistent with available resources . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Here, unfortunately, we get back to the interaction between the Commonwealth's overall role in national planning and its financial obligations. Here again I believe that, as we can see by looking at the grants given by the Commonwealth to the States over the last four or five years, the actual diminution in the amounts going to the States has made it extremely difficult for the States to pursue what might be now regarded by all unbiased commentators as legitimate concerns for reduced class sizes-not only legitimate but absolutely necessary-if we are to get any advance in the more complicated and complex areas that are being addressed at the school level. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to what I believe is one of the most unfortunate elements in the report, and I am not necessarily being critical of the Committee. The Committee points out:</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the occasional reference by a witness to some educational problem that was thought to warrant research attention, the role of educational research and development did not emerge as a significant issue in the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a most extraordinary admission. However, as I say, it may not be a criticism of the Committee itself; it may be more a criticism of the educational community. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very hard to believe that witnesses of the calibre of those who appeared before the Committee would not have had an enormous concern for educational research and development. The list of witnesses who appeared before the Committee reads like a Who's Who of educational research. All I can conclude , therefore, is that in the hearings of the Committee this aspect did not exercise the minds of the members of the Committee overmuch and therefore perhaps they failed to draw out from those expert witnesses detailed information and comments on that central issue of educational research. If we are to do anything constructive and useful for preparation for the work force, we must not simply do what is often done in a State where, for instance, if a lot of advertisements appear in the newspapers for shorthand typists they rush into a course in shorthand typing. That type of reactive response is not what is needed in terms of a national plan. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Committee was somewhat dilatory in its obligations in relation to this, I would point now to the Minister's response to the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA> Priority for educational research should be directed towards solving practical problems and findings translated into statements for policy development . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister in his response stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth accepts this recommendation and will continue to encourage the co-ordination of research through the Australian Education Council, and meetings of State and Commonwealth education researchers. </PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, that is being a little devious. This Government has been responsible for the destruction of the co-ordinating body for educational research and development in this country-the Education Research and Development Committee. This was the Committee empowered actually to bring some co-ordinating function to that very real and difficult problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators, except for those who have personal experience of putting in an application for funding to the Education Research Development Committee, may not be aware of the type of information that the Committee required. The Committee required that information specifically so that it could fulfil its charter of co-ordination. It often turned down research on worthwhile educational projects on the basis that this work was being adequately carried out in other educational institutions in other States and that the normal dissemination of that information through educational journals and conferences would be sufficient in that area. It thus advised the researcher to direct his attention to other matters. In addition, the Education Research and Development Committee at the beginning of every year put out a list of what it felt might be some of the major areas which were being under-studied or under-researched and some of the areas to which researchers in various institutions might direct their attention. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that it is not possible for the Government to say: 'The Commonwealth accepts this recommendation and will continue to encourage the co- ordination of research through the Australian Education Council', because the Australian Education Council is a totally ineffective body in relation to educational research. It consists of education Ministers. With all due respect to the Federal Minister for Education, who I believe probably does know a fair amount about education, many of the education Ministers may follow in the tradition of the first Federal Minister for Education in this country, who could not read or write. Those education Ministers may not be intimately aware of matters of educational research and development and that is not a criticism of them. It is not possible for a person to enter into a portfolio as a Minister and gain that type of intimate acquaintance with a research area, which after all involves a person in a great deal of time, study and effort in his chosen profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the Australian Education Council is a policy development body, not a body to look at the co-ordination of research. It does not have that capacity. Even if one wants to draw into that Education Council the advisers that all the Ministers bring with them-that is generally their director-generals of education -those people are also not the most capable people to be carrying out this task. If they were, presumably directors of research and development would not be employed within their departments. Surely the body which had been established and which worked most effectively for years was the best body to continue. Unfortunately, the Government has felt it necessary to argue for its demise on the basis of an ill-informed and, I believe, ill-considered judgment of the committee which reviewed Commonwealth functions-the so-called razor gang. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if we are to fulfil any of the types of things to which the Committee on Education and the Arts directed its attention-the very real problem of coming up with some type of reasonable transition programs, transitions which will not look specifically at the development of very narrow skills but will look also at the development of those broader capacities which will be necessary in the changing world in which we live-and if that type of far-sighted work is to be done in this country, unfortunately we need the development of a committee such as the Education Research and Development Committee. We need to put in place a new educational research and development committee. It does not matter what it is called as long as the function is taken over by an expert body. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I wish to make concerns the developing technological revolution. Unfortunately, when one reviews the transition programs which have been put in place already around this country one is not given a great deal of satisfaction or confidence. The emphasis is often on one of two areas. Either it is to compromise the student and suggest that he may learn a whole range of skills which are not necessarily directed towards employment but will make that person happy in later life and better able to live with his unemployment, which I believe is a defeatist approach in a country such as ours, or else there is a tendency to focus very heavily on skill development, and low level skill development at that. Let us consider a very simple point, which I think makes telling the type of change that we are engaged in. Alvin Toffler published a book in 1970 called Future Shock which doubtless almost everybody has now read, at least in part. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Future Shock was criticised for being terribly exaggerated when it was put out. I remember reviews saying: 'This is really taking the thing far too far'. If honourable senators care to go back and look at that book they will notice that nowhere in Future Shock are microprocessors mentioned-not even once-for the very good reason that they did not exist in 1970. That is the sort of advance that we have suffered. It is a staggering admission. When I recognised that I went back and had a look, and it is perfectly true-a most extraordinary thing when one considers the vital importance of microprocessors in the economy of today. I think that merely bears out that to set up short, narrow programs which look to next year or the year after is to be of such a defeatist, such a head-in-the-sand viewpoint as not to provide anything for our future generations. What we must be doing-what I hoped that the Senate Committee might have done, but unfortunately it did not; I am not sure for what reason-is to grasp this extremely difficult problem, to provide vision, to look ahead and to suggest really the level of funding, the level of opportunity and work that we need into the year 2000. That type of exciting report we could have looked towards not only now-a year later when this one has rather died and looks very saggy and dog-eared-but even in five years' time and said: 'Well' that at least was a breath of fresh air in this rather stodgy debate about transition from school to work'. I do not blame the Government for responding in the way that it did. It probably responded in as lively a fashion as it could to this report, but I reiterate my main point that the Government should look yet again at its co-ordination of research if we are to provide anything in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was in June 1981 that the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts brought to the Senate the report ' Preparation for the Workforce'. About a year later the Minister for Education, Senator Peter Baume, in one of his first public statements on becoming Minister, brought down this statement as the Government's response to the Senate's report. The issue is: Are Australia's schools effective? Senator Macklin has said that this is a vital area of public policy in Australia. As a very active participant in the preparation of the original report, and as someone who has a continuing involvement in these education issues, I can only agree. Unfortunately the time has almost expired; only a few minutes remain for debate today. I understand the Minister wishes to introduce a Bill before we rise in a few minutes. My remarks will therefore be shortened and I hope to continue when this item comes up again .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principal matter that I want to refer to is the undertaking by the Minister that he would bring this report formally and directly to the attention of State Ministers for education in the Australian Education Council, and to the non- government school authorities. I want to press that that be done, not only by circulating the report formally-this was done at the last AEC meeting in Alice Springs in June-but that the Ministers seek to have on the agenda for the next meeting of the AEC, which I understand could be in February of next year, comprehensive and formal reports on these continuing issues in secondary education so that the nation can see exhibited in a national way the responses to these calls that the Senate Committee has made. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952 which prescribes charges payable in respect of the use by aircraft of aviation facilities and services provided, operated or maintained by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives effect to the Government's decisions to vary the rates of air navigation charges for all domestic sectors of the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It was announced in the Budget Speech that air navigation charges were to increase by 20 per cent for both domestic trunk and regional airlines and by 12 per cent for general aviation aircraft. The Bill provides for the increased charges to apply from 1 October 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Total revenue from air navigation charges in 1982-83 is estimated to amount to $119.3m, compared with $101.8m, from this source in 1981-82. Of the $17.5m increase, $7.1m is attributable to the payment early in 1982-83 of amounts payable in respect of 1981-82; the balance of $10.4m relates to the full effect of the 1981-82 variations to the charges, industry growth and increased revenue resulting from the increases in charges now proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> By themselves, the increased rates of charges for which this Bill provides are expected to yield additional revenue of $8.4m in 1982-83 and $12.5m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that, since 1961, successive Governments have pursued a policy of eventual full recovery of costs properly attributable to the aviation industry for the provision and maintenance of the aviation infrastructure. The decisions taken by the Government to increase air navigation charges are in line with that policy. Overall cost recovery in 1982-83 is estimated (after adjustment for 1981-82 arrears) at about 53 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1981 Airlines Agreement formally recognises the Commonwealth's entitlement to recover 100 per cent of its costs. The 20 per cent increase in air navigation charges for domestic trunk airlines is expected to achieve a recovery rate approaching 90 per cent for this sector in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> The increases in charges for regional airlines and general aviation are expected to lead to 1982-83 recovery rates from these sectors of some 25 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been considerable public comment about the possible effect on air fares of the proposed increases in air navigation charges. The 20 per cent increase in charges for domestic trunk and regional airlines is estimated to increase total airline costs by around only 1 per cent on the basis of information already published. It is therefore expected that any overall impact on air fares would be marginal. However, the determination of air fares for specific routes is, of course, a matter for the Independent Air Fares Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that there has been a high level of cost recovery from the international sector in recent years. It is, however, expected that the recovery rate will be reduced to around 100 per cent in 1982-83. Accordingly, there will be no variations in charges for international airlines this year. </PARA>
<PARA> With the concurrence of the Senate I incorporate in Hansard the following paper setting out the annual cost recovery rates for each sector of the aviation industry for the ten years to 1980-81. </PARA>

<PARA> The Bill also provides for amendments to the Air Navigation (Charges) Act which are necessary to ensure that charges can continue to be validly imposed on all aircraft when proposed revisions to licensing classifications under the Air Navigation Regulations are introduced early in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill now provides that the charging arrangements set out in the schedules to the Air Navigation (Charges) Act will apply, as appropriate, to aircraft operating under proposed new revised licence categories. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments relating to the licensing categories are essentially of a machinery nature. No substantive change in charging arrangements currently applying to particular classes of aircraft is involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, I believe in Sydney, Denis Byrne Horgan issued a statement in which he said that he was no longer the Perth Liberal Party bagman or chairman of its finance committee; that he had ceased to hold that position as from the end of June. I did not know that previously. I accept that as being correct and will in future refer to him as the past Liberal Party bagman. He also again denied any involvement in a tax avoidance scheme. He said that at the time he sold Treamog Ltd, no tax assessment had been issued. That, the record shows to be correct; it also evades the issue. It was usual; most of the companies detailed in the McCabe-Lafranchi reports are companies which had no tax assessment issued against them at the time the vendors sold the shares.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As was usual with the companies, Treamog, Denis Horgan's company, had a contingent liability for company taxation of $1.7m. That is the issue that Horgan has avoided. If Horgan wants to deny being a tax cheat, is he denying the facts as shown in Volume 2 of the McCabe-Lafranchi report regarding Treamog which mentions current year profits of $3.762m? Is Denis Horgan denying that the company he sold had current year profits of $3.762m, and therefore a company tax liability of almost $1.7m-a contingent tax liability? It did not have an assessment. It had a contingent liability. Is Denis Horgan denying that it had that contingent liability? Is he denying that no allowance was made in the price offered for the shares in the company for that contingent liability? If Denis Horgan wants to deny his involvement in a tax evasion scheme, let him deny those things. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time Treamog Ltd was sold-again my source is volume 2 of the McCabe- Lafranchi report-Treamog was fully liquid. It sold money. It had a contingent tax liability of about $1.7m and it had money amounting to just over $6.5m. It was sold for $6.181m. To simplify that, the shareholders received from the Maher agent the full value of the money that the company had, minus only $355,000, which was the agent's so-called commission. No allowance was made for the contingent tax liability. Even the National Country Party would have been able to see that there was something smelly about a deal like that where someone came along and bought a company which owned nothing but money and exchanged for the money it was buying almost an equal amount of money, knowing full well that the company had a contingent tax liability of $1.7m. Even the Country Party would know there is something wrong with that. Yet, this business tycoon asks us to believe that he did not know the deal was shonky. Horgan's denials-categorical denials as he calls them-are in fact generalised assertions. They are never specific-for a very good reason. When one looks at the specifics of the case Horgan is clearly convicted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement that he issued and which was carried by Australian Associated Press is grossly misleading regarding the degree of his involvement in the Treamog share sale. He said that he was one of the seven directors. He was. He was also the chairman of directors. He did not tell us that. He said that he had paid tax on the profits earned by his 3 per cent shareholding in Treamog. Horgan in fact held directly less than 3 per cent of shares in Treamog. What he omitted from his statement was his indirect ownership of the company. Prindiville Holdings Pty Ltd, which owned 49 per cent of the shares in the company, has as its shareholders, Denis Horgan, one share, and Byrne Holdings, 299,999 shares. The directors of Byrne Holdings are Denis Horgan, Patricia Horgan and a fellow named Ingram. They own one share each. So, through his ownership of Prindiville Holdings Horgan owned another 16 per cent of Treamog. Patricia Horgan owned another 16 per cent. Rural Securities Pty Ltd, part of the Barrack House Group, controlled and primarily owned by Horgan, had a 6 per cent shareholding in Treamog. Henderson Investments Pty Ltd, a company of which Horgan is also a director, had a 10 per cent shareholding. Another major shareholder was Metro Industries Pty Ltd, a company in which Horgan, in turn, was a major shareholder. I am afraid that I do not have the details of Metro Industries in the office in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> When all those things are added up-I have incomplete records at my fingertips at the moment-Horgan owned 40 per cent of Treamog directly and indirectly, not the 3 per cent to which his statement of last night admitted. Horgan is not only a tax dodger; he is a liar as well. I note in passing-I will not go into this in detail because we all want to get away-that Horgan was a director and a shareholder of Henderson Investments. Henderson Investments also was sold to Maher and Donnelly in December 1977 and on-sold to Errol Faint in June 1978. I will not bother going into the details. I will save that ammunition for another day. Finally, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was questioned tonight on PM about the involvement of senior members of the Western Australian Liberal Party in tax evasion. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't know what these allegations are. I never have and I don't want to. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is correct the Prime Minister is culpably negligent, convicted out of his own mouth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. The Prime Minister is convicted out of his own mouth of gross negligence. The Prime Minister is saying that he does not know and does not care whether somebody who holds seven government sinecures, including the very important positions of directorship of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and commissioner of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, is a tax cheat. The Prime Minister has the audacity to say that he does not know and he does not care. I can imagine no more total abdication of responsibility of Prime Ministership or abdication of the maintenance of the standards of propriety about which, some years ago, we heard so much from the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
