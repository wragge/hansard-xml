<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate, in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That your petitioners are gravely concerned at proposed future hydro-electric developments in South West Tasmania. As this area is on the Register of the National Estate it is therefore of national concern and your petitioners humbly call upon the Senate to conduct a Senate Inquiry into South West Tasmania. A Federal Inquiry has been recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly call upon the Federal Parliament not to allocate funds or allow funds to be raised for development of roads or dams in the South West of Tasmania but rather to provide such funds as would enable the preservation of this area. This is a national issue and therefore Tasmanians should not be made to bear any financial burden resulting from its preservation.</PARA>

<PARA> That all members of the Women's Services 1939-45 War qualify as 'Australian Soldier' under the Defence Service Homes Act for loans because on voluntarily joining the Australian forces they took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies making themselves available for combat duty in War Zones, and according to Acts and Regulations of the period the Military women had enlisted for service anywhere, some Naval women to sail in any waters, with all servicewomen available for service in Papua New Guinea.</PARA>

I am aware that any recent suggested change in policy on capital gains tax by the Australian Labor Party cannot be enforced because it is a matter for the Labor Party conference, which can well override such a suggestion. We have a Labor Party which is committed to increased tax in a wide variety of ways. Mr Hayden is on record as saying that he personally is a high tax man. That is his own statement. Indeed, other members of the Labor Party are on record as saying that when-if ever, Mr President-they get back into government it will be necessary to increase taxes. Quite clearly, the Labor Party is a high tax party. The Liberal Party and the National Country Party as a coalition have made it clear that they are opposed to a capital gains tax.</PARA></TALK.START>

In fact, it is a matter of how Senator Elstob should look at this. For example, if one were to compare today's figures for inflation and other matters with the figures for the years 1973, 1974 and 1975 one would see that today we are admirably situated by contrast and that the inflation rate today is significantly less than it was under the Whitlam-Hayden Labor Government.

I am aware of the study which was conducted in the northern suburbs of Sydney, at the Hornsby and Ku-ring-gai Hospital, on a number of casualties-almost 100 I think. It showed the presence of cannabis metabolites in about a quarter and alcohol in a number when their urine was tested. It is difficult to know exactly what the significance of the figures for cannabis is because the breakdown products continue to be excreted for weeks after people have smoked cannabis. Nevertheless, a report of a committee of the Senate expressed concern about cannabis smoking and motor car driving. I understand that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety has also drawn attention to this problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister, as I understand it, was commenting on the present situation in the light of the present Budget and the deficit. The aim of bearing down on inflation and interest rates is, of course, to reduce the deficit in the Budget so that there is no necessity to borrow openly and compete in the market thereby forcing up interest rates and the cost of money. Therefore the application of the Budget strategy, which was praised, incidentally, by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, was a bearing down to provide the anti-inflationary pressures and also to provide room for the private sector to borrow. The Government was referring to that point in time. If in the future and if in the contemplation of the Budget ahead the Government should find itself capable of providing sufficient revenue for tax cuts the Government would clearly have before it its desire to ensure that the people of Australia receive tax cuts. I remind honourable senators that during the period from 1976 to 1978 the Government did make significant reforms in the tax system.

It would be a very useful thing indeed if it were possible to make room for tax cuts but at this moment tax cuts could be made in only two ways: Either by substantially increasing the deficit and thereby forcing much greater pressure on public borrowing and therefore forcing interest rates up higher to the great detriment of home purchasers by robbing them of their wages, or by cutting expenditure. I have not heard Opposition senators suggest any avenue in which expenditure could be cut by in the order of $500m to $700m. If they have any such suggestion they might indicate it to us. There are only two ways to do this. One is to increase the deficit, which we reject. Sadly it is being blown out anyhow because of industrial unrest, unduly high wage rates and other matters, but if it blows out further it will put pressure upon public borrowing.

Does the Minister believe that this activity, which apparently envisages a doubling of wells drilled this year and an expenditure on exploration in the vicinity of $800m, has come about as a direct result of the Government's import parity pricing policy? Is it likely that this will result in a substantial increase in Australia's oil reserves and production? If so, will the Government consider reviewing its policy on import parity to take these successes into account? Further, can the Minister advise the Senate whether it is correct that should the Australian Democrats block legislation increasing crude oil levies this would provide major oil producers with a windfall profit of about $45m, thereby denying the Government the same amount in revenue, detracting from its financial situation and making it more difficult for it to reduce personal taxation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The oil exploration bodies have recently published quite exciting information regarding the huge increase in both the money to be spent on exploration and development and the number of exploration wells and development wells to be undertaken. Indeed, this shows, as Senator Jessop said, a doubling of effort compared with the previous year and an enormous increase in these efforts since the last year of the Labor Government. It is true that the Government is emphatic that this has come about because of its import parity pricing policy. It is quite clear that that is so. Indeed, all the explorers and developers themselves indicate quite clearly that it is as a result of import parity pricing that they are doing this and they would not do it otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been some initial success-not sufficiently developed at this moment to be measured in terms of its long term benefits-some initial definition of fields and some prospect that there will be some very useful small to moderate fields that may well offset the decline of Bass Strait fields. But we are still a long way from any point of complacency. It is fundamental that we should keep up the pressure of exploration and development. Therefore, we should keep up the pressure of our policies bearing on this matter. Our policies of import parity pricing have worked. They provide for Australia's oil and gasolene to be sold at less than half the average price in overseas countries with which we trade. We are, in fact, finding petroleum energy and at the same time providing energy at a cost much lower than costs in the countries of our trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the effect of what has been foreshadowed as an action of the Democrats, one would need in the first place to understand what they intend to do. I do not believe at this moment that they will find that they have another error of judgment. I cannot believe that the Democrats who went to the people in 1980 saying that they would never oppose a policy for which a government had a clear mandate could reject import parity pricing, which was the main policy on which the election was fought. If ever there was a policy for which a government had a mandate it is import parity pricing. I do not know whether we will hear that the Democrats have made an error of judgment. I will need to find out what their policies are as they unfold. The legislation that we will put to the Parliament will be the normal validating legislation introduced in this half of the year to validate the rises in price over the whole of the year. One of the effects that could very well arise from the rejection of the legislation would be to leave in the hands of the oil producers very substantial sums of revenue which ought to be in the hands of the Government to spend on the taxpayers and presumably to give tax relief.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, there seems to be a great reluctance on the part of the Australian Democrats to have this subject aired in any shape or form. That is rather surprising because of the political capital they have made out of the fact that they alleged that they had sworn statutory declarations in relation to this matter. Of course, it is a matter which may well be within my ministerial responsibility, depending upon the law under which the statutory declarations were sworn. I say no more on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that my only knowledge in relation to these statutory declarations is what the Democrats themselves have said about them. They certainly have made a lot of public statements about them and, as I said, they made a lot of political capital out of them in the last election campaign. My only direct knowledge of these statutory declarations allegedly sworn by them was when Senator Mason, in the course of the debate on the last Budget, read into the Hansard record what these statutory declarations contained. That is the limit of my knowledge about them. I do not know under which law they have been made. As they are described by the Democrats as statutory declarations-as I said, they made great capital out of them-I take it that they have been made in accordance with some law in Australia relating to the solemnity of such declarations and that the Democrats will observe and will continue to observe the solemnity of the declarations that they have made.</PARA>

I understand that the Government is at present examining options for ways in which unemployment benefit payments are directed to remote communities as subsistence payments, including the provision of funds for the Community Development Employment Project. Increased payments of unemployment benefit for subsistence in Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory have caused a chaotic situation which has not been helped by the fact that the extension of the CDEP scheme is in question.

Unemployment benefit is known in some communities as sit-down money and is not welcome. The CDEP scheme has been introduced in a number of communities throughout Australia and has had variable success. It has been quite successful in the Torres Strait. Where communities have an established structure , a consensual basis of decision making and where it can be seen to be susceptible to democratic control it seems to have worked quite well.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the decisions made upon the adoption by the States and the Commonwealth of the new Agreement was that the terms of the Agreement would be carried out straight away and that there would not be a delay whilst the legal processes were put in force; in other words, that we would not wait for the Agreement to be put into law. This has been done. There is now wide testing of the quality of the water. The significant situation is that the Agreement makes an insistence upon quality, and this is being undertaken now in a significant way. A computer model of the river system is set up for examination. Additional undertakings of the Maunsell recommendations are being carried out. In addition, it is significant that the Dartmouth Dam has moved towards a substantial holding of water. It is not wholly full but the situation is, nevertheless, much more reassuring than in the past. There has been a considerable flush of water down the Murray and the salinity of the Murray today is significantly lower than it was for quite a while. It is fair to say that even in its most precarious situation last year the saline content, whilst higher than one wanted, was less than it had been in the past. So some pressures have been working.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things that will have to be watched very carefully is the use of Snowy Mountains water for hydro-electric schemes so that irrigation volumes are kept in mind throughout the winter period. The Commonwealth announced some time ago that it would invite all States in Australia to undertake with it an overview of water needs in Australia up to the turn of the century. That dialogue is now taking place with the States. We hope that within a year we will have that data because fresh water is significant for the future of not only agriculture but also industry. We have also been looking at the mechanisms that lie within the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and my Department. The CSIRO is in the process of locating all the research into water which is carried out in many of its sections, to see whether it can better organise that research. My Department and the Atomic Energy Commission are in consultation. A discussion is going on at the moment with the Australian Water Resources Council about a report on water research which we hope will be before the State Ministers fairly soon.</PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of work is being done now in the overall quantitative and qualitative measurement of water in Australia. I hope to be able to report substantial progress towards the total overview in Australia in the early months ahead and the rationalisation of the various researches that are being undertaken. This will be a very significant step forward in the understanding and qualitative control of water in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The present Atomic Energy Act is defective in that it was designed essentially as a defence Act and therefore does not deal largely with peacetime nuclear problems. As a result the Government has under very active review at the moment the whole question of redrafting the laws. It is in discussion with the six States and the Territories with regard to the nature of the new types of legislation, with regard to both the responsibilities that might be State and the responsibilities that might be Federal. It will, in fact, be keeping in mind the fact that, in the longer term in Australia, governments of the future may well decide that nuclear power stations are a desirable adjunct to thermal power generation. Accordingly, it will be keeping in mind the Zeidler recommendations in that regard. It is true at the moment that the capital cost of a nuclear power plant is very high compared with the capital cost of the alternative thermal plant. But it is equally true that the cost of coal will rise. Therefore there may be some break-even point down the years and it may be considered that nuclear power could compete. But that is a matter for the judgment of governments in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) released his policy speech for the 1975 elections, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For three dark years, our freedom, our prosperity, the self-respect of many Australians have been eroded-eroded by the highest taxes in our history. </PARA>
<PARA>When that statement was made, personal income tax amounted to 12.7 per cent of gross domestic product. The estimate for this year by the Government is 13.9 per cent. So taxes, as a proportion of gross domestic product, have increased by 10 per cent under the Government of the man who said that taxes had destroyed out self-respect, our prosperity and our freedom. Alternatively, total taxes, which were 23 per cent of gross domestic product when the Fraser Government was elected, have increased to 27 per cent. The estimated income tax revenue for this year is $20.86 billion-that is, just over $20,000m-which is 93 per cent of the total tax collected by the Labour Government in the financial years 1973-74 to 1975-76. In one year this Government, which was elected on a fraudulent promise of lower taxation, is collecting in personal income tax as much as 93 per cent of what the Labor Government collected in three years. It was a fraudulent promise. That is what the aggregate figures show. But it is a lot more significant and meaningful if one looks at the effect of these rapacious tax policies upon the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look, for example, at the single income family on 85 per cent of average weekly earnings-a single income family of four persons. This is the family unit idealised by the Fraser Government and about which the Fraser Government purports to be primarily concerned. If taxation rates as a proportion of income had remained where they were in 1975 that family would be paying $19 a week less in taxation than it is paying now. In real terms there has been an 81 per cent increase in the income tax collected from this idealised family on 85 per cent of average weekly earnings which, incidentally, just happens to be what statisticians call the mode. That is the income level at which the highest concentration of wage earners is found. There are more people on 85 per cent of average weekly earnings than any other level of income. This is where it hits hardest. This is where it hits the greatest number of people. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, if we look at average weekly earnings-approximately one-third of all wage earners are on average weekly earnings or above-we find that these taxpayers are paying $1,200 a year more in income tax than they would be paying if the 1975 levels of taxation had been sustained. By that I do not mean the 1975 tables. If the same proportion of income was taken in taxation in 1981 as was taken in 1975 these people on average weekly earnings would have $1,200 more take-home income than they in fact have. It is a highly significant figure because on looking back through some of the previous speeches by the present Prime Minister, we see that in July of 1975, just before he became Prime Minister, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the person on average weekly earnings were taxed at the rate of 10 years ago , he would be taking home another $1,000 a year in wages. </PARA>
<PARA>If the person on average weekly earnings today were taxed at the same rate as he was taxed not ten years ago but six years ago he would be taking home an extra $ 1,200 a year in wages. Back in 1975 Mr Fraser continued:</PARA>
<PARA> No wonder the person on average earnings finds it difficult to save the deposit for a house, buy the best education for his children, look after his ageing parents as he would wish. </PARA>
<PARA>They no longer find it difficult to do those things; they find it impossible to do those things. Mr Fraser promised, again in 1975, that he would end what he used to call the secret tax of inflation. We heard a lot about the secret tax of inflation from Mr Fraser in those days. Astonishingly, we even heard something about it from Senator Sir John Carrick this afternoon. In the 1975 policy speech Mr Fraser said:</PARA>
<PARA>Failure to adjust the progressive income tax schedule for the effects of inflation will lead to acceleration in the rate of wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA>As well as robbing people of their hard earned incomes in 1975, according to Mr Fraser excessive levels of personal taxation induced demands for higher wages and therefore higher levels of inflation. It is interesting to note that he is now saying the opposite to what he said then. Of course the promise for full tax indexation-the absolute promise, the solemn promise to end what he used to call the secret tax of inflation-was unceremoniously buried in May of last year. He used to say, not just in 1975 but even in 1977, that lower taxes were an essential prerequisite for economic recovery. On 22 November that year, again significantly during an election campaign, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have taken the view that a reduction in the personal tax burden is essential to economic recovery and to boosting job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>That belief, like tax indexation, has been obviously dumped by the Prime Minister because the 1981 Budget increased taxes on wage and salary earners by no less than 22 per cent-a telling demonstration of the effects of what the Prime Minister used to call the secret tax of inflation actually in operation following the one-third indexation of the taxation schedule at the beginning of this financial year. The effects of the secret tax of inflation will be significantly greater next year unless the taxation schedule is indexed. Indeed, if wages increase at the rate forecast by the Government in the Budget Papers, if there is no indexation and if the consumer price index increases by between 11 per cent and 12 per cent as the Budget forecast-it seems likely to do that- there will be a real increase in personal taxation of $1,400m. In other words, the secret tax of inflation will collect automatically in the next financial year an extra $1,400m of revenue for this Government. The corollary of that is that any so-called tax cuts which might be introduced in the latter half of this calendar year which amount to less than $1,400m will, in fact, be hidden tax increases. They will not be presented as that, of course, but that is what they will be. </PARA>
<PARA> My comments so far about the present record level of taxation refer only to income tax. To complete the picture one should add the $3 billion increase in the petroleum excise, which this Government has imposed in the last few years, and perhaps the $900m in a full financial year which it seeks to impose because of the sales tax increases and extensions introduced in the 1981 Budget which incidentally, contrary to claims made by at least one of the Government spokesmen in the House of Representatives, have a highly regressive effect on income distribution. If one looks at statistics on the highest income group surveyed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and published in the latest Survey of Household Expenditure one finds that those sales tax increases will account for something less than 0.5 per cent of the household income of those highest income households and for slightly over one per cent of the household income of the lowest income households. In other words, the poor will pay proportionately twice as much as the rich as a result of those sales tax increases. That again is the aggregate. </PARA>
<PARA> That information does not mean so much in the aggregate as it means when it is actually applied at the level of the individual citizen. When we put all of these things together and adjust for inflation we find that this idealised family of four with a single income of 85 per cent of average weekly earnings is , as a result of the taxation policies of this Government, paying an extra $19 a week in income tax, an extra $10 a week in petrol tax, an extra $10 a week in interest charges if it has a $30,000, 25-year housing loan, and an extra $10 a week in health insurance premiums. So, this idealised family is paying $50 a week more tax than it was paying in 1975 when Mr Fraser said that our self- respect, our prosperity, had been destroyed by record levels of taxation. He said that it had been eroded by the highest taxes in our history.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government still likes to talk about allegedly high taxes in the middle 1970s. It would rather dwell in the past than in the present. Given its dismal record of failure that is not surprising. But if taxation was at punishing and unjustifiably high levels in 1975, how can anyone in this Government justify the very much higher levels of taxation over which the Government is presiding right now? How will Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, or anyone else who is to follow in this debate, justify the collection of policies which have imposed on this idealised family of four with a single income of 85 per cent of average weekly earnings an extra $49 a week in taxation? That is precisely the set of circumstances over which Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and this Government preside. We know, of course, that in 1977 the Prime Minister said: 'Interest rates will fall by 2 per cent over the coming year. It is a target that can and will be met'. They are his exact words. </PARA>
<PARA> When he said that, the average interest rate for a housing loan was in the vicinity of 11 per cent. It depended upon whether it came from a building society or from a savings bank and it still does. That figure of 11 per cent was the mean figure which required weekly payments of $74 for a $30,000 loan on a 25 -year term. The same loan of $30,000 on a 25-year term and at an interest rate of 14 per cent-which is the mean figure now-requires a repayment of $90 a week with $16 a week being lost in interest for the typical householder taking out a new loan. Indeed it could be validly argued that it is somewhat more than $16 a week. Because of the intervening inflation the actual loan which is taken out has increased so the house purchaser is paying a much higher rate of interest on a substantially higher principle. </PARA>
<PARA> The income tax burden is frightful in the aggregate-a very large increase in the proportion of the gross domestic product which is consumed by the Government in taxes. It ought to be a matter of shame to any Liberal or National Country Party politician who asserted a few years ago that it was intolerably high then. But it is even worse in detail because this enormous aggregate burden of taxation has been progressively shifted to an increasing degree to the middle and lower income groups. It has been shifted for three reasons because of deliberate policies by the Fraser Government designed to increase the taxation burden on the middle and lower income groups with, of course, the corollary to reduce tax levels for the very rich-a deliberate policy compounded by stealth by what the Prime Minister used to call the 'secret tax of inflation'. A progressive income tax schedule not adjusted for continuing inflation does two things: It automatically increases the proportion of income paid in tax by all people and it automatically increases by the most the proportion paid by the lower income groups. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Professor Mathews the tax burden has been redistributed regressively because of widespread tax evasion and avoidance amounting currently to some $7 billion a year. That is about one-third of the total personal income tax collected by the Government. It has also been shifted regressively because of deliberate policies and provisions written into the Income Tax Assessment Act by this Government-policies such as the investment allowance which is costing the revenue around $450m a year; the ludicrous film industry taxation rort which the Prime Minister picked up from the make-up girl in a television studio in Sydney which is costing in the vicinity of $30m a year; and such taxation avoidance and evasion measures provided for Pitt Street farmers as income equalisation deposits under which Pitt Street farmers and half of the members of the Fraser Cabinet lend the Government $10,000 for one year, borrow $15,000 for two years and pick up a cash bonus of $4,500, half of which is non-taxable. That rort, deliberately written into the Act by this Government-I might add with the assistance of the Australian Democrats and the tax dodgers' friend, Senator Harradine-is not the result of a bizarre interpretation of the taxation Act by an incompetent or a corrupt High Court under the tutelage of Sir Garfield Barwick but the consequence of provisions deliberately and consciously written into the Act by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> A Pitt Street farmer and a Cabinet Minister can borrow $15,000 for two years, lend $10,000 for one year and pick up a $4,500 cash bonus, half of which is non- taxable. This Government, which condemned a previous government for imposing allegedly excessive levels of taxation has in fact imposed, is imposing and will continue to impose, the highest and most inequitable tax burden that Australia has ever seen. It presides over the highest ever rates of interest, the highest level of unemployment since the present Australian Bureau of Statistics data has been collected, the highest inflation for five years, rapidly falling economic growth, a collapsing house building industry and a rapid run-down of our foreign reserves. It is a failure and it is time for it and its Prime Minister to be gone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance brought forward by Senator Walsh relating to the distribution and record level of taxes is one of importance for discussion. Perhaps it is useful always to discuss in this place matters of such fundamental importance. Levels of taxation and the distribution of the tax burden are great issues which are at the heart of government. They indicate many things. They indicate many things that perhaps were not mentioned by Senator Walsh in his speech today. They indicate the size of government, the expections of government and the way in which government needs to raise the revenues which it requires for the policies and programs for the Australian people. Of course there are matters on which there are many conflicting views in this or in any other community. It would be ridiculous to suggest that there is any person in any community who would not like to see levels of taxation lower than they exist at any time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walsh continued to quote the figures of 1975 which were quoted in a debate that we had in this place in November last year. When those figures of 1975 are quoted as the levels of tax and the proportions of gross domestic product I must state-as I stated at that time-that if one is to look at that year one must look at the tax that was to be collected and the deficit that was there for the Government and the Australian people to provide for in some way in the future. It was a deficit that the Government of the day was not prepared to fund. It was a deficit that the Government was not prepared to raise funds for, either by personal tax or any indirect tax. It was prepared to come into the House with a Budget and an enormous deficit requiring a form of funding which was not disclosed at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Walsh has given 1975 figures I repeat that the real figure at which he ought to be looking for that time, having regard to tax on individuals and the unfunded deficit, is 18 cents in every dollar. That is the appropriate figure that he could have given for that time. I think it would be a good thing if the Australian Labor Party, as the Opposition in this country, were to look realistically at the taxing and revenue raising policies of government and then look at what size deficit it would be prepared to have and how that deficit would be funded. I do not want to restate the figures that I stated on 18 November last year because I think they are well known. They ought to have been noted by Senator Walsh. Instead of continually coming into this chamber and talking about the level of tax while disregarding the whole casting of that Budget, he ought to be bringing his figures up to date and looking at how that year affected the economy of Australia and what were the actions of government with regard to its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy to come into this chamber and to criticise what might be the levels of tax but perhaps relative values also ought to be stated. If we are stating levels of tax, amounts of tax per week and so on, we also ought to be looking at how levels of wages have changed from the time relating to some of the statistics which were quoted. Senator Walsh spoke about taxation burdens. He did not mention the fact that real household disposable income increased, in real terms, by $2.7 billion last year. In the current year, another significant increase is expected to occur in the incomes of Australian households. Those figures need to be taken into account. It is pointless Senator Walsh talking about somebody paying $10 more in tax or more by way of some other charge unless he relates those figures in real terms to comparable figures. Senator Walsh mentioned indirect taxes-for example, the $3 billion in excise on petroleum, the sales tax increases and other such things. Perhaps we can say more about some of those things a little later on. </PARA>
<PARA> In none of what Senator Walsh said was there anything about alternative policies. We know that the Opposition is prepared to block in this place Bills that raise revenue in an indirect way. It will join with the Australian Democrats to block a Bill that would raise indirect taxes in the form of sales tax-$132m in this year or $330m in a full year. That is another means of revenue raising which gets away from the personal income tax that Senator Walsh has quoted today. Perhaps some of those policies ought to be looked at too. If the revenue is to be raised from the Australian people the mix of that revenue is equally important. It is not good enough to come in here and talk about the level of personal income tax and then not pass Bills that would raise revenue in other forms and provide a greater opportunity to spread the responsibility between direct and indirect taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh mentioned tax avoidance. I think it ought to be stated again that it is this Government which has done as much as possible with regard to tax avoidance. I think it is fair to say that John Howard, as Treasurer, has made a most concerted attack on tax avoidance. We could contrast his efforts with those of the ALP Treasurers, Crean, Cairns and Hayden, who in their turn did not take the measures that have been taken by the present Treasurer to see that those who are seeking to avoid or evade their taxation responsibilities are brought to account through the changes in the legislation which we are able to make. If we look at the levels of taxation I think we would have to say that the Opposition is not concerned about the total amount of taxes paid in this country because, to finance expanding policies, taxation levels under a Labor government would have to increase. Mr Hayden, as Leader of the Opposition, has said that a philosophy of lower taxes is a threat to the socialism that he espouses. That statement was made by the Leader of the Opposition. For one of his front benchers to come in here and talk about levels of tax under this Government without stating how he would reconcile the statements of his own leader, who talks about increasing taxes, seems to me to be a rather peculiar way to deal with this item. I point out that Senator Walsh brought this matter forward for discussion. Mr Hayden has said-and I have quoted this before-that:</PARA>
<PARA> The challenge to traditional democratic socialism has been expressed in a number of deeply dispiriting doctrines. One example, is the rapid spread of philosophy based on lower taxes and smaller government. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is a philosophy I would find no difficulty in supporting-lower taxes and smaller government-but it is against all of the doctrine of the present Opposition and it is against the statement made by the present Leader of the Opposition. Of course, the shadow Treasurer has made his intentions quite clear with regard to the need to increase levels of taxation. He has made statements to the effect that if the Opposition does not gain office by 1983 it will be a mammoth task to rebuild the public sector and may be an equally mammoth task to convince the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable Labor to increase the public sector. So, to talk of taxation levels as they are at present under a government with a commitment to maintain as low a level of government expenditure as possible seems to me to be a very strange thing to do especially in the terms in which it has been done in the matter of public importance raised by the shadow Minister for Finance today. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Willis has made his objectives clear. Mr Hayden has made clear his concern with regard to the challenge to democratic socialism. I think that those who sit with Senator Walsh and the Opposition would in no way dispute the fact that the ALP wants an expanded public sector. One can only get that from the funds of the Australian people, whether they are levied by way of personal income tax or indirect taxes. Whatever way it is done, ultimately it is the people of Australia who will pay for that expanded public sector. If the ALP platform commits a Labor government to massive increases in public expenditure then it is the people of Australia who will pay for that particular platform and policy. Such a policy can only be financed in the usual and traditional ALP way, that is , higher taxes, higher deficits and the printing presses-all of those things that we saw in the three years from 1972 to 1975. One can contrast every action of the Fraser Government to cut back the public sector with the Labor Party's approach to government. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is true and fair to say that every action that has been taken by the present Federal Government to cut back the public sector has been vehemently attacked by the Opposition. When we cut out a program that is irrelevant, or cut out or reduce some element of expenditure that could be reduced because of the cost to the Australian community, there is a concerted attack by the Opposition on that element of change. There is a philosophy of big government in the Opposition party. Its own spokesmen can see that big government means higher taxation. I do not think that the figures quoted by Senator Walsh would in any way be the figures he would cast in a Budget if he were given the opportunity to put his philosophies into effect. The figures that he quotes as being the levels of taxation which were collected-he did not look at relative figures in 1975-are not the figures that would provide for the funding of the policies that have been espoused in more recent times by the alternative government. Under the Whitlam Government, in the three-year period Commonwealth Budget outlays soared from 24 per cent to 30 per cent of the gross domestic product. Taxation soared, inflation soared and the deficit soared. </PARA>
<PARA> The term of the ALP Government, I think, has become synonymous with economic mismanagement. It was a three-year period in which every statistic that one could measure was damaging to the Australian economy. I do not think we could find a figure we could quote from that period of government that would allow us to expect lower taxes from any future Labor Party government. I do not think Senator Walsh could dispute that because in a recent speech he said as much as that. He made some comments which I will quote in just a moment. The share of public expenditure in the gross domestic product has been wound back by the Fraser Government to about 27.5 per cent. That contrasts with 30 per cent of gross domestic product which was the figure in the period of the Whitlam Government. I repeat that it is 27 1/2 per cent as against 30 per cent during that period of government. I think that ought to be noted. If we are talking about policies, that particular policy is the one that I want to stress. Personal tax collections under the ALP Government rose by 125 per cent over three years. That figure was not cited today by Senator Walsh. Government spending jumped by 20 per cent, 46 per cent and 23 per cent in three consecutive years. None of those figures can give us an opportunity to imagine that low taxation is the policy of the present Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The regressive nature of some taxes was mentioned by Senator Walsh. He omitted to mention the major reforms that have been made in the personal tax policies of the Fraser Government. We have reformed the income tax scale, reducing it to three steps. We have introduced the rate of 32c in the dollar as the standard rate, reducing the marginal rate for taxpayers on average weekly earnings. We have more than doubled the spouse rebate and increased the sole parent rebate nearly threefold compared with the levels under the Whitlam Government. Gift duties and estate duties-another means by which a government can raise revenue should it wish to do so-have been completely abolished at the Commonwealth level . This Government does not rest on those initiatives which have already been put in place. Indeed, the Government is committed to further reductions in taxation. All the policies quoted by Senator Walsh will be implemented when possible because it is part of the philosophy of the Government to reduce the burden of expenditure and to leave opportunity for further tax cuts. No one should doubt the Government's commitment to reduce the level of public expenditure and consequently to reduce the level of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> No major reforms were mentioned today in any way by Senator Walsh, but reforms have been mentioned outside this chamber. Perhaps we ought to look at those to see the consequences. Despite the Australian Labor Party's platform, which is binding on every Labor parliamentarian, we are led to believe that the Australian Labor Party has dropped its capital gains tax proposal. There are serious divisions in the Labor Party on this matter. Senator Walsh may concede that, but he certainly did not mention it. He did not mention his party's platform. He did not mention that, with the impending Lowe by-election, a statement has been made by the leader of his party. He did not mention that other Labor Party key principles will perhaps be jettisoned in the desperate search for votes in that by-election. I do not know whether the Labor Party's new-found policy on capital gains tax will be able to be upheld, and perhaps honourable senators opposite do not know that either, but recently Mr Hayden was asked on the Channel 9 Sunday program about his pledges at this by-election and whether they would be the same pledges he would give at a future general election. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Oh, gosh no! . . . . in eighteen months time there will be a lot of water under the bridge, social, political and especially economic water, and the policies appropriate to the last election are starting to recede because of changed circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>I imagine that the policies that will be espoused at the Lowe by-election and in the weeks to come will be jettisoned just as the policies at the last election have been jettisoned and just as the capital gains tax proposal has been carefully put under wraps so that it will not be discussed. But people want to know what the policies are. Given the flexibility of the Labor Party on its basic principles under Mr Hayden, who knows what might happen with any policy. Will Senator Walsh be arguing at his party's conference for the reinstatement of the Australian Labor Party's capital gains tax policy? Will he be arguing elsewhere for a different mix of tax than that seen under the present Government ? Will he be looking for ways of raising revenue? Or will he be looking for a deficit such as previous Labor Treasurers were prepared to produce in their Budgets? In Victoria the Australian Labor Party is arguing for the retention of probate duty. I mentioned the action of the present Federal Government in that area of the collection of taxes. The Victorian Premier pointed out recently that Victoria, under an Australian Labor Party government, would be the only mainland State to have probate duty and that that would be an invitation to people to arrange their affairs in such a way as to avoid paying probate duty. We need to ask: What are the Australian Labor Party's policies on raising revenue and how great is its sincerity with regard to tax avoidance?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh has conceded that the Australian Labor Party's policies are frequently regressive. He did not mention that in his speech today because a fairly permanent record is made of things mentioned in this place. I think he was trying to give the contrary impression when attacking the present Government 's policies which he says are regressive. Last November in a speech to the Committee of Economic Development of Australia reported by the Canberra Times Senator Walsh described the Australian Labor Party's policies-not the Government 's policies-as confused and ignorant. Senator Walsh was not altogether complimentary about the Government, which is perhaps to be expected in any speech made by Senator Walsh, but let us go back to what he said about his own party's policies. The Canberra Times reported his speech in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party, which had an 'affinity for intervention'-</PARA>
<PARA>That costs money-</PARA>
<PARA>frequently supported policies 'unlikely to foster efficiency and which demonstrably distribute income regressively'. </PARA>
<PARA>That was his own quotation as reported in the Canberra Times. He said further:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor has no moral problems with intervention and usually manages to maintain its ignorance of the not-infrequent regressive consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>That is his own party's policy, but he did not tell us here what he felt the party would do, had it the opportunity to introduce changes to that policy. He said that Labor manages to maintain its ignorance of the not-infrequent regressive consequences of its policies. Further, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The epitome of Labor's confusion is its inability to distinguish between socialism and regimentation. </PARA>
<PARA>We were not informed today what he meant by that in terms of tax collections, but Mr Hayden, as reported by the Canberra Times, appeared unperturbed by Senator Walsh's show of dissension in a major policy area. Maybe Mr Hayden agreed with Senator Walsh's view on the regressive consequences of many ALP policies. Perhaps the people of Australia ought to know, because these are the things that are not said in discussions in this place or with frankness anywhere . </PARA>
<PARA> The confusion in the ALP's ranks might be acceptable were we talking about issues which are not of great importance. But taxation and the raising of revenue from the Australian people are of fundamental importance and I think Senator Walsh has readily admitted that the policies of his party, presumably in a number of areas, are regressive. He has given us no positive ways in which he would change them. It is probably time that he got his own house in order so that the next time he speaks in this place he can put forward something more positive with regard to the levels of taxation that need to be raised from the Australian people to fund the programs of government which his party apparently wishes to see unchanged and added, as further burdens, to the usual policies of the ALP when it is in office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the matter of public importance submitted by my colleague Senator Walsh today, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inequitable distribution and the record level of taxes being imposed by the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA>First of all, I will make a brief comment on the reply given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to Senator Walsh's speech. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, not surprisingly, concerned herself less with a defence of her own Government's record in taxation matters than with an attack on what Labor is supposed to have done in the past and what she speculates it is our intention to do in the future. On both matters I think she was quite erroneous. I agree with the Minister when she says that the equity or inequity of the level of taxation is a matter of concern to the entire community. When she says that there are conflicting views on these matters fundamental to our economy, I do not find myself in agreement. At this stage the essence of Senator Walsh's argument is that this is a matter for consensus and not a matter for conflict. Surely nobody in the community says that the level of taxation is not at a record high. Surely nobody-it seems, not even the Minister for Finance herself- can say that the distribution of the taxation burden within our community is equitable. In fact, I do not believe the concept of equity entered into the Minister's comments at all-which of course, is not surprising as the Liberal Party of Australia is concerned with anything other than equity. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out too that it is the intention of the next Labor Government to see not an increase in the burden of taxation on personal income taxpayers but a redistribution of the tax burden according to the principles of equality. Of course, we will want to increase the revenues available to the Government, but we will increase those by measures which are equitable and which involve strategies other than those which increase the burden on the average wage or salary earner. Of course, the latter strategy is the only strategy pursued by the Fraser Government in the last six years. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the subject of the debate-the inequalities in and the high level of taxation under the current system. I remind honourable senators in summary what the Government's current taxation strategy is. In the last Budget the Government provided for a record high outlay of $40.7 billion and for a record increase of taxation of wage and salary earners of 22 per cent. With the addition of the new wide-based sales tax, should the Senate agree to pass it, the Government will extract from the community a record level of government revenues in 1982-83. Those matters, I think, are beyond dispute. It is worth commenting that amongst the records which this Government has achieved is the outlay of a record $40.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle has just given us the stereotype Liberal rhetoric about wanting to move back to small government and wanting to reduce the size of the public sector, it ought to be noted that the public sector is as large now as it ever was and that the amount of public outlay by the Federal Government in its last Budget was larger than that under any preceding government, including any preceding Labor government. So what we have seen really is not a reduction in public expenditure in terms that would be of benefit to the average wage and salary earner but simply a redistribution of outlay of public money away from public services towards areas that subsidise the private sector and that certainly subsidise the high income earners and the very wealthy in this community. The taxpayer is not being saved money; the average taxpayer is simply being denied the services that ought to come from the taxation that he or she is forced to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to a particular area of inequality in the Government's taxation strategy. I refer to the effect of the Government's taxation strategy on women. In framing its taxation strategy the Government has demonstrated a total disregard for the unequal burden current tax policies place on Australian women. In fact, so far from the collective mind of the current Government is the welfare of Australian women that I very much doubt whether women, as a separate and disadvantaged group comprising more than half of the Australian population, even entered into consideration when tax policies were formulated. The Federal Government appears to have failed to realise what is evident to increasing numbers of Australian women-that to them, as a very large group suffering economic disadvantage in our society, taxation, as the major means of redistributing income, is a vital issue. To achieve economic equality women must first achieve an equitable tax system-that is, one in which they do not bear a disproportionate tax burden. It is a matter of particular concern to Australian women that the Fraser Government's policies have served to increase the inequities in the current tax system and that the Government displays not the slightest interest in giving Australian women a fair deal on taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall outline the current taxation system to demonstrate how it discriminates against women. I refer in particular to three groups of women which comprise almost the entire female population of Australia-that is, women in the paid work force, women who are age pensioners and women in the home. Taking the first group, women as wage and salary earners, I remind honourable senators that Senator Walsh's contribution to this debate established that the tax burden falls heaviest on middle and low income earners. I do not think that matter was refuted at all by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. When we look at that group which is bearing the heaviest burden of pay-as-you-earn taxation we find that women form a disproportionate percentage of low income earners. The 1981-82 Budget figures on taxable incomes of males and females show that while 90 per cent of men earn less than $30,000 per annum, about 90 per cent of women earn less than $15,000 per annum and that 55 per cent of women who pay taxes have incomes of under $10,000 compared with only 27 per cent of men. One-quarter of all women paying tax earn under $7,000 per annum. This reflects women's participation in the part time work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of working women are wage and salary earners and as such are paying substantially higher taxes in 1981-82 due to the Government's abolition of full tax indexation. Total income tax collections will rise by $3,134m or 22 per cent in 1981-82. While this means that all taxpayers will pay a greater proportion of their income in tax this year those on low incomes-that is, the majority of women taxpayers-will face the highest percentage increases. For non- PAYE taxpayers-those with business, property and dividend incomes, a group in which women have disproportionate representation-taxes are budgeted to rise by only 5.3 per cent in 1981-82 compared with the 22 per cent rise in tax paid by wage and salary earners. It is clear that lower income earners, the group in which women are over-represented, are bearing the brunt of Fraser's high taxation policies. </PARA>
<PARA> When we turn to pensioners and people living on benefits we note that women comprise 65 per cent of those in receipt of pensions and benefits. Of course, the majority of those women would be single age pensioners and a majority of the remaining pensioners would be supporting mothers, that is, women alone bringing up children on a pension. So in both cases we are looking at very disadvantaged groups of women indeed. Fraser Government policies have ensured that the rates of pensions and benefits have lagged well behind community income movements. The majority of those relying on benefits-as I have said, a very large number of them are women-now live in poverty and to exacerbate the situation, because the Government has failed to alter the tax threshold and because of inflation, some pensioners and beneficiaries will this year pay increased taxes and many pensioners and beneficiaries will this year be forced to pay tax for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA> Already 250,000 pensioners pay tax. After the May indexation pension increases which will incorporate September and December consumer price index rises, most of their low income colleagues will join them. Single pensioners will be paying tax on any bank or building society interest of more than $6.50 a week. I think that is a fact that deserves exposure throughout the length and breadth of this land. It is not surprising that the Minister for Finance did not mention the concepts of equality or equity in her address when a government is prepared to tax pensioners on that. Pensioners and beneficiaries who have not previously paid tax on their social service payments will face 32c in the dollar tax on any income above the $4,195 threshold level. Every pensioner who has more than $6.50 pocket money on top of the pension will be hit. I remind honourable senators that the majority of people I am talking about are women. It is little wonder that the Government faces defeat in the approaching Lowe by-election. Lowe is an electorate which has a large number of pensioners, particularly women on the age pension. I ask: What incentive would such women have for voting for the Fraser Government whose policies have run pensioners into the ground? In 1980-81 the single person's pension was 23 per cent of average weekly earnings. This year it has fallen to 22 per cent of average weekly earnings. Because the tax threshold has not been altered in this Budget, single pensioners who receive the maximum pension will pay an extra $155.37 tax this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to women in the home, a group for whom the Fraser Government professes to have special consideration, a group which is seen by some members of the Fraser Cabinet as exemplifying the way in which they would like women to participate in this society. What has happened to women in the home in response to the Government's taxation strategies? The Government's attempts to increase indirect taxes and to introduce new indirect taxes will, of course, hit everyone but particularly women in the home. It is the Government's intention that housewives trying to cope with a household budget shrunk by higher income tax, expensive health insurance and high mortgage payments will pay more for everything from essential household goods such as refrigerators to items such as shoes and clothing which must constantly be replaced. If the Government's proposals are passed by the Senate, taxpayers will pay an extra $800m in increased sales tax. Although food will not be directly affected, increased taxes on packaging will put food prices up. The tax on furniture, floor coverings, drapery, bedding and white goods will double and shoes and clothing, which were previously exempt, will be subject to a 2 1/2 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Housing Industry Association estimates that the tax on building materials will add $1,000 to the cost of building and furnishing a new home. The net result of sales tax increases on the average household budget will be a cut of at least $4 a week. And the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has had the audacity to tell us that we will not even notice it. Perhaps the Prime Minister and Mr Howard will not notice it. Those on salaries as high as Mr Fraser's or Mr Howard's will not notice $4 a week. However, to women on low incomes or pensions $4 on top of $11 for health insurance and an average of $15 a week increase in mortgage payments, stemming from interest rate increases in the last Budget, will mean the difference between surviving and not surviving. Interest rates concerning home ownership are, of course, another factor contributing to the deteriorating situation of women in the home and women taxpayers. Many women attempting to buy a home are in a desperate position due to the 1981 interest rate increases and now face the possiblity of further increases in interest rates. Yet the Federal Government has just rejected any suggestion of assisting low income home buyers or potential home buyers through the taxation system or by any other means. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look briefly now at the other side of the taxation coin-how taxation revenue is used. In particular, I want to look at the decision by the Government some years ago to abolish child tax rebates and introduce a system of family allowances. Those allowances, because they constitute a redistribution of income from men to women, are the most important redistributive measure for Australian women. However, since the introduction of family allowances in 1976, their real value has been eroded by at least 40 per cent due to the Government's failure to index or raise them. In 1976 the allowance for two children equalled 5 per cent of average male weekly earnings and for four children it equalled 11 per cent. By August 1980 the value of the allowance for two children was equal to 3.7 per cent of average male weekly earnings and for four children it was down to 8.9 per cent. Again women are losing out. I also draw attention to the fact that the amount paid by the Government by way of the dependent spouse rebate is now more than the amount allowed by the Government for family allowances for all families in Australia. When we take into account the fact that the dependent spouse rebate is not needs based and has nothing to do with dependent children and, in fact, 51 per cent of families with dependent children do not receive it, I think it is time to question the equity of a policy of increasing that rebate while refusing to increase or index the family allowances which are the most direct form of assisting women. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I believe that the Government's taxation policies are actively working against the economic interests of Australian women. I believe that Australian women are becoming more and more aware of this. The falling vote by women for conservative parties over the last ten years demonstrates that Australian women are becoming totally disillusioned with the economic and taxation policies of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was Edmund Burke who once said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To tax and to please, no more than to love and be wise, is not given to men. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that is a truism in any country. But while we live in a structured society the government of the day will always have the responsibility of imposing taxation so that it can implement its plans and try to accede to the wishes of the people who elected it. The matter of public importance that we are discussing today refers to the 'inadequate distribution and record level of taxes being imposed by the Fraser Government'. I think it is fair enough that every so often any government should stop to look at how equitable are its distribution and imposition of taxes. I believe that we have done so. When we took over from the previous Labor Government we had a good look at where this country was going and at the high rates of taxes existing. That Government had almost destroyed rural Australia with its taxes. We decided to alter the taxation mix and have been altering it ever since. I recall that we introduced income equalisation deposits and tax averaging. We allowed write-offs for irrigation in order to get a bit of heart and a bit of production back into rural Australia. Many people have only just realised that when the country hurts in Australia, it is not long before the city hurts too.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that is excercising our minds at this stage is the recent decision taken by the Government to change the taxation mix and opt for broad based indirect taxation rather than direct taxation. Sales tax has been part of our taxation mix since it was introduced by a Labor government in 1930. Even at that stage sales tax was introduced on food items. Over a period commencing in the middle 1940s successive Liberal and Country Party governments reduced sales tax on food until it was finally abandoned in the 1960s. Let us be quite fair about it. A tax on foodstuffs was imposed by a Labor government. Our side of the political spectrum decided that it was not fair and thus we gradually reduced and ultimately abolished sales tax on food items. </PARA>
<PARA> It is generally agreed that in the Australian tax system too much reliance has been placed on direct personal tax. Our overall taxation burden is generally pretty low and that has been brought out by recent Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development figures. The average taxation burden, as a percentage of gross domestic product, is 35.8 per cent. Australia's rate is 28.8 per cent. I understand that only four countries have a lower overall taxation average than we have and that is a good point in our favour. But what did show up in those Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures, which supports our Government's policy in changing the mix, is that we have more emphasis on direct taxation than we have on indirect taxation. That is what we are trying to change. Sales tax has a long term value and we are trying to broaden that base and put greater reliance on sales tax and less reliance on personal income tax as a source of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we realise that when the Labor Government was in office it used personal income tax to pay for its grandiose spending programs and high taxation was essential for the Labor socialistic policies. Socialistic governments need high taxation. It is as simple as that. I do not see why the Labor Party should quarrel with that principle. The record in the Budget Papers shows that the total tax grab while the Australian Labor Party was in government grew by $8.4 billion-in other words, it increased by 99 per cent in three years. What is more to the point is that its income tax collections grew by 125 per cent. Those figures are taken straight out of the Budget Papers. They are there for all to see. It is quite interesting that some time ago I had a table prepared showing the after tax income of selected incomes for the single wage earner from 1971-72 to 1981-82. On an income of $5,000 in 1971-72 the after tax income for a single income earner was $3,999. In 1975-76-the year of Mr Hayden's last Budget-the after tax income was $3,790. It was less than in 1971-72. In 1981-82 the after tax income is $4,742. For an income of $7,500 in 1971-72 the after tax income was $5,555. In 1975-76-so much for the Labor Party looking after the low income groups-the after tax income was $5,415 and in 1981-82 it is $6,442. I will look briefly at the figures for an income of $15,000 over the same years. In 1971-72 the after tax income was $9,234. In 1975-76 the figure was $9,790 and for 1981- 82 it is $11,542. It can be seen by looking at those selected figures that in any year the Labor Government's performance was abysmal. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia raises 6.1 per cent of its tax revenue from what is known generally as general consumption taxes. In Australia we know it as sales tax. France, Denmark, Norway and Finland raise more than 20 per cent of their revenue in this way. When judging our standards by those in other countries we have good reason to change that tax mix. Tax dodging is a sore point on both sides of the chamber . Both parties recognise the problem. But we cannot avoid sales tax the way it is currently allocated. </PARA>
<PARA> Sales tax can be adjusted. This fact is overlooked, I think quite deliberately, when the Opposition tries to make a point. Sales tax can be adjusted to have greater impact on luxury goods than on everyday items. That is the way it is structured. In other words, a greater burden is placed on people who have a capacity to pay than on low income earners. Those who have a capacity to pay cannot dodge it. I cannot argue with that and I do not think the Labor Party would want to either. People tend to buy within their means or their capacity to pay. As I have said, sales tax is levied at a higher rate on certain goods, on goods such as photographic equipment and jewellery. People who buy these goods contribute a greater amount of revenue through sales tax. Low income earners tend to buy cheaper articles and their sales tax contribution is therefore less. I think the point has to be made that the lower income earner is far more protected under the current sales tax provisions than he would be from income tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I probably have a better understanding than the honourable senator. We have sales taxes across a broader range of goods with a higher amount payable on luxury items. Under Labor a family income earner paid more and more taxes as inflation forced him into a higher tax bracket. In her speech Senator Guilfoyle brought out the fact that we had a seven tier system of income tax until we changed it in 1977. Not only did we change the system but also we moved the bottom cut-off point upwards. From our first move alone over 225,000 people who paid tax no longer had to. I understand that in the movements that have been made since we started that procedure about half a million people who would have paid tax under the Hayden scheme are now not paying tax. That is another point which is conveniently overlooked by the Opposition. It must be said that our moves have certainly helped lower income earners. In 1972 the average income earner paid 19 per cent of his total earnings in tax. Under Labor this increased to 25 per cent. If Mr Hayden's tax scales were still in--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="C67">Senator COLLARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is out of the Budget Papers. Use your calculator. If Mr Hayden's tax scales had still been operating in 1981-I do not have an update on these figures-a person earning $200 a week and with a dependent spouse would be paying $14 a week more in tax. A taxpayer earning $200 a week and with a dependent spouse and one child would be paying $10.20 a week more. We have crocodile tears coming from the Labor Party about what we have and have not done . It is interesting to note some of the quotations from the Labor Party. I quote the famous speech by Mr Ralph Willis to the Labor Economists in Brisbane in June 1978. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Labor does not gain office at the next election then by 1983, when we could next hope to gain office, we would face a mammoth task in rebuilding the public sector-</PARA>
<PARA>Big government again-</PARA>
<PARA>and maybe an equally mammoth task in convincing the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable us to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Labor Party is quite unashamedly a high tax party. As I understand it, real after-tax income has increased over the last few years. In 1975-76 the average after tax earnings of people without dependants was $6,812. In 1980-81 it was $11,247 and in 1981-82 it was $12,640. That represents an increase in after-tax income of 65.1 per cent and 85.6 per cent. Over that period the increase in the consumer price index was 62.5 per cent and 80 per cent respectively. Of course nobody is denying that our taxation receipts have increased. Of course they have increased. More people have joined the workforce and as incomes have increased we have become more affluent and people have bought more and more consumer items. But the point conveniently overlooked is the fact that our outlays have also increased. Our outlay on social security has doubled while we have been in power. Our outlays on defence have doubled while we have been in power. Our outlays on education have almost doubled while we have been in power. Another point conveniently overlooked is the fact that in the last 10 years the deficit has exceeded $3 billion three times and we have gradually reined that in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right. We were trying to get the Labor Government' s grandiose schemes back under control. The point that is overlooked is that because of those massive deficits and because of borrowings to finance that deficit the interest on the public debt has tripled since we have been back in power. That is also an outlay that this Government has to meet. Nobody has to destroy the Australian Democrats' credibility; they do it every day for themselves. The unfortunate part about sales tax is that we have now found that we have had to forgo $79m that we were budgeting for-at least if the sales tax legislation does not come into operation until 29 March. If it gets knocked back altogether we will have to forgo $132m. That has to be made up by the income tax earners. At the end of this year we will not be able to lift our base rate. People who would normally expect not to pay tax will have to. In the meantime the Government will probably have to borrow money and that will have an effect on interest rates. I reject out of hand the matter of public importance introduced by the Labor Party. I defend quite strongly the role this Government has played during the time it has been in office and the steps it has taken to reduce tax while at the same time meet the expectations of those who rely on it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He said 'progressive'; that it affects poor people less than it affects the rich. I will read out slowly for the honourable senator's understanding and comprehension statistics provided for us by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. For people receiving less than $130 a week the increase occasioned by the Government's sales tax measures will be 1.06 per cent, whereas for people earning over $560 or more there will be a charge of 0.59 per cent. That is twice the amount. The burden will hit the poor twice as hard as it will hit the rich. Senator Collard tried to tell us this afternoon that if he had to pay sales tax on a tractor that he had to buy for his farm and if the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had to pay a sales tax on the same tractor for his farm, then it would hurt his pocket more than it would hurt the Prime Minister's pocket. That, to me, shows either a misconception of Senator Collard's assets or a total misunderstanding of what regressive and progressive taxes are all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me refer also to what Senator Collard said earlier about this Government's priorities in expenditure. I refer him to no other authority than Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. I ask the Senate to note that Senator Collard is not content with staying and listening to this expose of his speech. In an answer to me, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, in total contradiction to Senator Collard, said that the estimated change in Budget outlays at 1980-81 prices between 1975-76 and 1981-82, in the field of education, was minus 0.5 per cent, a decrease in real terms. That is the decrease which Senator Collard refuses to acknowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt about the fact that this Government came in on a promise and will go out not having fulfilled that promise at all. Senator Walsh mentioned the 1975 policy speech of the Prime Minister in which he promised to reduce the tax burden. He mentioned that in the 1977 speech the Prime Minister claimed to have ended the big tax rip-off. It was only on 5 February that the Prime Minister, in an interview on Channel 10's Good Morning Australia program, when asked about the possibility of an early mini-budget to cut taxes, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't think it is a good idea. </PARA>
<PARA>He said also that while the Government wanted to reduce taxes it was making no commitment on when it might do so. We have had five years of promises and five years of manoeuvring. In that period we have had absolutely no alleviation of the tax burden. In fact, this calendar year, for the first time in Australia's history, a person on average weekly earnings, under the existing tax scales, could be paying 46 cents in the dollar tax. This is happening under a Government that claims to be protecting the Australian community and to be introducing low taxation. We have had the highest taxation in Australia's history; we have had the highest record of taxation levied on pay-as-you-earn income earners; and we have had a massive distribution of income through the taxation system from the poor to the rich. In fact, Professor Mathews, a Government adviser, acknowledges that under this Government taxation is very much a system of redistributing wealth from the poor to the rich and it is very much a system of voluntary taxation for the rich. I will not go into the statistics that indicate that. They have been covered adequately by Senator Walsh. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to look at the system of redistribution under this Government. Let us look at who pays taxes and who has been asked to bear the burden of taxation and the burden of this Government's economic and social priorities. In five years under the Fraser Government the net amount of money raised from pay-as-you -earn taxation has increased from 41.7 per cent of total Commonwealth tax revenue to 45.7 per cent. At the same time, the amount raised from company taxation has decreased from 15 per cent to 13.7 per cent. That may not sound great, but in actual fiscal terms it is a massive reapportionment. Let us have a look at the figures. Once again in an answer given by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle to a question upon notice, No. 1189, there appears the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA> The OECD figures for Australia show tax on corporate income as a percentage of total taxation reducing from 16.66 per cent for 1970 to 10.32 per cent for 1979.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a rejection of Government priorities in this area. While looking at this diversion of money from one sector to the other, let us look at some of the other aspects of Government policy implementation which have had an even greater effect on redistribution. In the period of this Government, we have had 44 tax concession measures, 12 to assist farmers and 13 to assist companies. Net direct assistance to industry from Government Budgets increased from 1.6 per cent of Budget outlays in 1975-76 to 2.3 per cent in 1981-82. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his Budget last year, provided figures for revenue forgone by the Federal Government. Two of the major provisions announced in that section of the Budget were the investment allowance and the now abandoned Trading Stock Valuation Adjustment Scheme. In 1979-80, $499m was estimated as having gone in the investment allowance. In the following year the amount was $411m. The trading stock valuation adjustment amounted to $334m in 1979-80 and in the last year of operation it was $64m. These are the tax concessions that this Government handed out in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at one industry that has benefited under the Government's policies. It would not surprise honourable senators on this side to know that I am referring to the newspaper publishing industry. From 1975 to 1981, $18.3m in investment allowance was paid to this industry. This figure applies only to News Ltd, Australian Consolidated Press Ltd and John Fairfax Ltd. This investment allowance has financed the introduction of new technology in that industry. That new computer technology has led to drastic reductions in the number of people employed in the newspaper publishing, especially in the printing area. The Australian Government, through this and many other measures-by encouraging, through generous allowances and concessions, the introduction of machines to replace workers-has subsidised unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the prevalence of tax evasion in our system. I noticed in the Australian Financial Review this morning, at page 16, a little advertisement entitled 'Happy News for Tax Dodgers'. The advertisement stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Peter Clyne will return from Vienna on the 5th March and will be available for private consultations in Australia for about two months. Brand new fiscal-fiend- proof schemes available, for this financial year and for the future. </PARA>
<PARA>For those who are desperate enough and who cannot wait for Doctor Clyne's return the article states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if the matter is urgent, I can be contacted c/o Hotel Sacher, Vienna. </PARA>
<PARA>Under this Government we have seen a massive increase in tax evasion. This is one instance of blatant tax evasion supported and allowed to continue by a Government that shows absolutely no concern. As I said earlier, Professor Mathews, a Government adviser, has described the taxation system under this Government as one of redistribution from the poor to the rich. The Commissioner of Taxation in his report last year detailed tax evasion as he saw it. He identified 22,366 participants in tax avoidance schemes. This compared with 11, 253 identified tax avoiders and $424m lost in revenue in 1978-79. He went on to say that in 1979-80 there were 17,233 identified tax avoiders with $711m lost. He went on to say further that in 1980-81 he could identify 22,366 participants in tax avoidance schemes involving revenue losses of $973m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know his nickname. According to the official figures, under this Government we have an increase in the number of people involved in tax avoidance and an increase in the amount involved in tax avoidance schemes. Based on the amounts that the Commissioner can identify, a conservative estimate of the amount of the lost revenue is $1,000m. Professor Mathews's estimate is $3 ,000m for 1978-79. Projections since then indicate that the figure could very well be over $6,500m for the current financial year. The Government's response was as indicated in the Commissioner's report and in correspondence to this House on 28 October 1981. The Government's response was to decrease the numbers employed in the Australian Taxation Office by 3 per cent. This meant, at the time, a reduction of 179 persons in that Office. It meant also a saving for the Government of $1.3m in salaries. In a letter to a Senate Estimates committee the Commissioner indicated that this decrease in the number of staff would mean a loss to revenue of $46.88m, an overall loss to government revenue of $45.3m. That was the Government's initial response. It was a response to which it could not hold for much longer in that it had to reverse its decision quite recently. But that is only one instance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under this Government transfer pricing has continued at massive levels. Trust schemes, superannuation schemes and foreign tax havens are continuing. In April 1981 we had, as shown by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) in another place, a system of debt assignment whereby professional groups could continually assign their debts to their families as capital, not income, and as a consequence pay no tax. This Government keeps going to the people about lowering taxation but it takes absolutely no concrete steps towards doing it. There is one simple action which this Government could take which would in effect wipe out the bulk of tax avoidance in Australia and pave the way towards the real redistribution of wealth-a redistribution to which we on this side of the Parliament are committed. That action is simply to introduce retrospective legislation dealing with specific issues of tax avoidance. We have advocated this approach in previous elections and we will continue to do so. This approach is gaining greater acceptability with the Australian electorate as it comes to realise the benefits of it, what is in fact happening to its standards of living and connects this huge non-payment of taxation by the wealthy and the corporate to the fact that its standards of living are going down. As I said, this approach is gaining more and more acceptance in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to an editorial in the Melbourne Age, a newspaper which for a long time did not support this approach. On 30 June last year the Melbourne Age stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive to recall the circumstances in which the High Court determined the right of Federal Parliament to impose retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>That happened in 1915 in the case of R. v. Kidman which related to legislation introduced in May 1915 that rendered fraudulent actions relating to the sale of goods to the Government dating back to the previous October. The High Court unambiguously determined the right of the Parliament to make actions criminal which were perfectly legal at the time they were done. In the 1980s tax avoidance poses a threat to Australia as did the somewhat more distant Kaiser Wilhelm in 1915. We have support from the Melbourne Age. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, my time is running out. I want to look briefly at what the Government is doing in the overall context of its economic policies. We have a Government which has been keen to sit back and preside over a redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich through the taxation system by deliberate actions in terms of sales tax increases, petrol levies, health levies and so on. We have a Government that has also been prepared to perpetrate this approach through its direct Budget outlays and allocations. As the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party indicated in the House of Representatives this afternoon, if we look at the increase in personal income tax, indirect tax and the savage cuts to social wage that this Government has perpetrated, we will see that the average tradesperson this year would need $60 more in his or her pocket to achieve 1975 levels. That is the record of this Government and that is the record on which I think this Government will fall. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the third speaker on the Government side it is my duty to summarise the views of the two previous speakers and at the same time point out certain weaknesses or criticisms in the contributions of the speakers from the Opposition parties. Senator Walsh, I think, had some temerity in bringing forward this matter of public importance today, namely, the inequitable distribution and record level of taxes being imposed by the Fraser Government. To some extent I believe he is campaigning to put himself at variance with his own leader. We all know there are certain problems within the Australian Labor Party at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle mentioned, Mr Hayden is on record as saying that the Labor Party has a philosophy of higher taxes. A philosophy of lower taxes is a threat to the socialism he espouses. He has said also that he is a high tax man. Senator Walsh's implication is that he will be a low tax man. I certainly welcome that. I believe that many of Senator Walsh's pronouncements on economic matters put him outside the Labor camp and, strangely enough, alongside such Liberals as Bert Kelly whom he acknowledges as an expert on economic matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle rightly drew attention to the very large increase in the level of deficit that would follow under a Labor government unless it did something about the problem of taxation. She mentioned also the very big increase of $2.7 billion in the level of Australian disposable incomes. She pointed out also that there is a requirement on the Labor Party in bringing forward such a matter of public importance to point out the means of achieving some equitable increase in taxes. Senator Walsh's contribution was simply an exercise in destroying something rather than trying to put someting constructive in its place. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle emphasised also the need to improve the tax mix. I think we all recognise that. She very rightly put forward the argument that as soon as we attempted to do this the Labor Party-now the Australian Democrats have joined in-opposed a change in the mix of taxation. She very rightly asked: Where is this increased taxation required by the Labor Party to fund its large expenditures to come from? She rightly said it will come from the pockets of ordinary Australian taxpayers. She believes that we cannot expect lower taxes under a Labor Party which espouses such great increases in public sector expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe Senator Walsh had an obligation to the Parliament to show how his party would finance this extra level of expenditure. We have a record of tax reductions-Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle pointed out a number of them-bringing about better equity in regard to spouse rebates, the sole parent rebate, et cetera, and the elimination of gift duty and death duty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, if Senator Walsh likes to talk about progressiveness, I point out that the Labor Party has suddenly found itself in a dilemma in respect of capital gains tax. It appears that the Labor Party is split right down the middle on this question. It appears that at the forthcoming by-election it will do some political grandstanding about its change of stand on capital gains tax. The Labor Party wants to keep its options open by saying that it could be done by certain amendments to section 26A. No doubt it will find this is rather difficult and that after the election is over it will have to fall back on its original policy of having capital gains tax per se. But we all know there are many troubles associated with capital gains taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ryan, of course, reinforced previous statements of the need to maintain high levels of public sector expenditure. Although she mentioned that the extra taxes would have to be equitably raised, she made-I could stand corrected on this-no positive contribution apart from saying that they had to be equitably raised; she did not state how they would be raised. She mentioned also the need to protect the status of women and the need to increase family allowances. She failed to recognise a very significant contribution which was made by the Fraser Government in the last Budget whereby an increase in the family allowance for the third and subsequent children was made. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Collard mentioned the need to change the tax mix. He pointed out that sales taxes which at present are the bogey of the Labor Party were in fact introduced by the Labor Party in the 1930s. At that time there was a tax on food. It was our side of politics that removed the tax on food. It remains free of tax even at the present time. He pointed out also the need to move to a more indirect tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collard was followed in the debate by Senator Bolkus who put himself forward as a sage on economic and taxation measures. He gave a nice, neat little example to try to show how my colleague was astray and he used an example from primary industry. I believe he must be an expert in this field! But not when he gave his little example about a sales tax on tractors as he overlooked the fact that there is no sales tax on agricultural tractors. We can all make mistakes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact of life is that there is no sales tax on agricultural tractors. I think even most members of the Opposition are aware of that. In this matter of public importance we talk about inequitable distributions. I refer to the 1980 tax benefit position of a typical worker in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries. On pages 22 and 23 of an OECD publication we have a comparison of gross earnings and take home pay. This is presented in the form of indices. If we take a selection of countries and compare the position of the Australian worker with the positions of workers in some of those other countries we notice that Australia has a higher take home pay in terms of percentage than, say, France, Greece, Italy and New Zealand and has comparable levels to those in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, though the Australian level is a little lower in percentage terms than the levels in those two countries. Surely, it is the typical workers who will be greatly disadvantaged in terms of what has been proposed in this matter of public importance. Against these examples of the developed, and possibly some of the less developed, countries I believe that the typical Australian worker stands out in fairly good light. Therefore, there is no great substance in this matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cited 1980 figures. We can look at the publication 'Revenue Statistics of OECD Member Countries 1965-1980'. Senator Walsh has not even been brought up to date, asking what the dates were. If we look at table 1 on page 78 headed 'Total Tax Revenue as Percentage of Gross Domestic Product at Market Prices-1979'; we find at the top of the table that-I think these are true indices indicative of the fact that overall Australia is a low tax country-the total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product at market prices was 50.27 per cent for Sweden, 47.42 per cent for the Netherlands and, further down the list, 41.16 per cent for France, 34.02 per cent for the United Kingdom, 31. 18 per cent for New Zealand and, sixth from the bottom of the table, we find Australia with 29.82 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Which countries are below Australia on that list? If we look at a country with industrialisation and a standard of living similar to ours we see that Japan is below Australia at 24.77 per cent. The other countries below Australia on the list are Turkey, Spain, Portugal and Greece. I contend, taking into consideration our standards of living, et cetera, that this table giving total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product shows that Austraian people are pretty well off. That is not to say that our Liberal Government is entirely satisfied. We are determined to improve the equity in this field. No Treasurer other than John Howard has been so determined to cut out tax avoidance . His record is second to none. Look at all the legislation that we passed last year, for example, on crimes in relation to taxation. As soon as an item is detected we pick it up. Unfortunately when taxation levels are fairly high there is a tendency by some people to go unashamedly into tax avoidance schemes. We are a government that is determined to bring equity to the Australian people and as such we have vigorously attacked tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh keeps on seeking to interject. In his speech he kept referring to 1975-a shocking year, I think, about which to cite figures to us. We can look at the extract from the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It was stated that under the Hayden Labor Government tax scales those earning from $7,000 a year would have paid 35c in the dollar, from $10,000 they would have paid 45c in the dollar and from $15,000 they paid 55c in the dollar. Look at the figures under our Government. The threshold commences at $4,195. Pensioners who are living solely on a pension do not have to pay any tax. Taxation at 32c in the dollar continues to $17,893. Taxation at the rate of 46c in the dollar is levied up to an income of $35,787. Taxation at the rate of 60c in the dollar is levied above an income of $35,788. We have a record of substantial improvement in tax reform showing that we are concerned to lower taxes, to raise the taxation threshold so that people are not worse off. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) has indicated also that he is determined to attack tax avoidance. Shortly in this session we will introduce legislation to improve the effectiveness of such sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act as section 136. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the first occasion on which I have had the privilege of presenting a report such as this from the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I seek only to provide an overview of the far greater detail that is to be found in the pages of the report. In December 1976 the Senate Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee tabled its report 'Australia and the Refugee Problem' which dealt mainly with the settlement in Australia of Vietnamese refugees in the turbulent period following the fall of Saigon in April 1975. At that time Australia had accepted about 1000 Indo-Chinese refugees. Now the number is some 60 000. In the years since 1975 Indo-Chinese refugees have become a dominant feature in South East Asian affairs, with significant repercussions for Australia and indeed world-wide. Therefore, the Committee considered it timely that it should be asked to inquire into and report on the Indo-Chinese refugee situation and how Australia has responded to these events. </PARA>
<PARA> The advent of the Indo-Chinese refugee problem, at times reaching crisis proportions, brought a positive response from Australia, a humanitarian commitment and an acceptance of these refugees for resettlement. As a consequence, refugee issues have become an important element in Australia's foreign relations, at the bilateral and the multilateral level. We have established ourselves as being prepared to respond constructively to refugee issues and this has undoubtedly raised expectations in others of our role in future refugee situations; a role that is not necessarily confined to our immediate region, for example, our offer to Polish and other Eastern European refugees. How well and in what way we respond to future refugee situations will require careful judgment and will need to take into account the domestic as well as the external factors in determining the nature of any assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's role in the Indo-Chinese refugee situation has had a positive effect on our relations with the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations and the Association itself. It demonstrates a willingness on our part to participate in efforts to find solutions to the problems of the region and has helped to break down impressions that selection for settlement in Australia is on a discriminatory basis. The Indo-Chinese refugee problem has not been entirely resolved and there are no guarantees, if conditions in the source countries deteriorate, that the outflow of refugees would not increase dramatically, presenting new problems for the region and beyond. Here again there is a continuing role for Australia to participate in regional and international efforts to avoid a repetition of the past crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has established a reputation in refugee matters not only as a settlement country, but also as an active member of the international community working to find solutions for refugee problems, both at the governmental and the non-governmental level. It can be anticipated that we will be expected to maintain our role and our future participation will have an important bearing on our standing in the international community. The arrival of Indo-Chinese settlers has had an impact on the Australian community. It is the first time that Australians have been exposed to sizable intakes of peoples racially and culturally different from previous settlers. It is a visible difference, yet from the Committee's investigations the evidence overwhelmingly points to a general acceptance of the new settlers. If any resentment or opposition is discernible, it is from isolated sources, involving relatively few people. The Committee received no evidence expressing opposition to Australia accepting Indo -Chinese refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's inquiry also examined the settlement program for Indo-Chinese refugees coming to Australia. Over the past three years their arrivals have been at the rate of 15,000 per annum. The confused state of events and the urgency of the situation after the Vietnam war gave little time or opportunity to formulate a comprehensive refugee policy or settlement program, nor was there any warning that the refugee exodus would become a crisis. As a consequence, Australia's settlement program has been an evolving one and in many ways needs to be able to cope with changing refugee situations. </PARA>
<PARA> The resettlement processes are working well and initial settlement facilities and assistance are of a high standard. Subsequent settlement of refugees into the community is progressing successfully and at a quicker rate than initially anticipated. The Indo-Chinese refugees are regarded as good settlers, anxious to find employment, to further their own and their children's education, and are highly motivated to make a success of their settlement. The proportion of Indo- Chinese seeking to take out Australian citizenship is high compared to most migrant groups. </PARA>
<PARA> In the settlement process there are some problems to overcome, such as a lack of English language proficiency among many of the refugees, non-recognition of overseas qualifications and the social, economical and cultural traumas associated with settling into a totally different environment. Government and non-government authorities are aware of such problems and a continuing effort is maintained to alleviate their impact. Witnesses appearing before the Committee pointed out a number of shortcomings in the settlement experience; these varied between locations, some were past problems, others temporary in nature, but most importantly the problems have been identified and solutions are being sought. </PARA>
<PARA> It is generally accepted that more could be done in the settlement process if more funds and resources were available. However, the reality of the situation is that both government and non-government resources have limitations and other areas of need exist. Australia's expenditure on Indo-Chinese refugees overseas and for resettlement has exceeded $150m. From the evidence before it, the Committee concluded that the settlement of Indo-Chinese refugees in Australia is progressing well and the new settlers are integrating effectively in this country. The Committee commends Australia's humanitarian commitment to refugees and the work of all government and non-government instrumentalities, organisations, groups and individuals endeavouring to make refugee resettlement successful. </PARA>
<PARA> I became Chairman of this Committee half way through this inquiry. I am sure I speak for the present membership when I express our gratitude to former Senator Peter Sim, who was a distinguished Chairman of this Committee for several years, to the late Senator John Knight, whose contribution was immense, and to Senators Kathy Martin, Stan Collard and Kerry Sibraa for their work on this inquiry when members of the Committee. I also thank the present members for their bipartisan approach and their constructive contributions to the compilation of a unanimously agreed to report. Indeed, Mr President, as so often happens, one should add to the contributions of those people the efforts of the staff of the Committee whose contribution was generous and efficient. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly to support the remarks of the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in relation to this report. In fact, I found it a rather easy task to go through the process of this inquiry because, as is well known, the Committee only four or five years ago completed a similiar report. Of course, the whole idea of the task before us was to go back and check over what we perceived to be problems at that stage and to see what had been done and what improvements had been made. I suggest that overall the Committee found that by and large the various Government departments and non-government organisations, in fact everbody concerned with the influx of the 59,000 Indo-Chinese refugees over recent years, had learnt a lot. They had certainly made mistakes but they had agreed to rectify them. I think the Committee generally concluded that the integration of the great bulk of those 59,000 refugees into Australia has gone extremely well. In fact, I recall witnesses repeatedly saying that one of the problems some of the welfare groups concerned with refugees had in relation to Indo-Chinese refugees was that once they left the migrant camps they disappeared into the community intent on getting on in our society. Those organisations found them rather hard to find. Once they freed themselves of the refugee camp they seemed to be content to try to do their own thing, to find work, to get their children into schools, to buy a new car, to pay off a home and to do the sorts of things that I suppose everbody is desirous of doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly, there was evidence of some problems, particularly in New South Wales , of a racial nature but it appears that the people concerned have got on top of that and I have heard no more of those reports. One of the other items of evidence that again came from many people in the education field was what they found in relation to Vietnamese or Indo-Chinese children in the classroom. The children were rather reluctant to take time out for a play period. That appeared to be something related to their cultural background and, I perceive, a general desire by those students to study hard to get on, to try to grasp the education system of a new country and to do well. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter I wish to take up relates to evidence that was given to the Committee by a group of refugees. It concerns an allegation regarding the treatment of the Hmong people in their own country relative to the alleged use of aerial spraying of hill tribesman with toxic chemicals. This matter has been in the world Press. My suggestion is that it has been put forward by the American authorities in particular. The last report that I saw-a report which could only be considered to be impartial-said that the Americans were hanging their evidence for this allegation against the Vietnamese people on four leaves from trees or shrubs. That is where the allegation lies-on four leaves which have been found to have been discoloured by some means or other. The Americans seem to believe that they can hang an allegation of the use of toxic chemicals by the Vietnamese against the Hmong people on this. I suggest that it is a very weak argument and one that might be worthy of further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to add-I may be digressing slightly but we are talking about refugees- that there are some remarks in the report relative to coastal surveillance. Any reading of the evidence, particularly the in camera evidence, will suggest that there is a lot to be done in the area of coastal surveillance. The matter is far from satisfactory, in my view, and has been raised publicly by other people also . I would suggest that in the event of a further outward bound movement of Indo- Chinese refugees heading towards Australia our coastal surveillance system is not capable of doing the task that it really should and that there is a great amount of room for more government co-ordination and expenditure and perhaps better utilisation of the forces we have, particularly our armed forces, in patrolling our northern coastline. There is, as I said earlier, a great deal left to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to raise in relation to refugees is this: As we all well know, in post-war years, Australia has been a ready sponge, a ready reservoir, for refugees from countries where the politics are of the left. We have taken anybody, it seems to me, providing they are fleeing from a communist or an alleged communist government. We have been very reluctant to take people from countries where fascist or extreme right wing dictatorships are the vogue. I suggest that relates particularly to refugees from East Timor. I do not believe this Government has done as much as it could well have done to satisfy the wishes of hundreds of East Timorese men, women and children who are desirous of getting out of that country because of the fascist type government that the Indonesians have imposed on them. </PARA>
<PARA> By the same token, we have done little or nothing to assist political refugees from South America. South America today is possibly one of the worst areas of the world as far as human rights are concerned. Human rights virtually do not exist in the whole of South America. There are thousands upon thousands of citizens of the various countries that make up that continent who have been shot and who have been tortured and who have fled to other countries, for example, from Uruguay to Argentina. They are thrown into gaols there and tortured and sent back for further torture and mutilation while their relatives and friends here in Australia appeal to the Australian Government for some assistance in getting them out. My friend Senator Mulvihill has plenty of first hand cases in his files relating to men, women and children who fit into that category. I suggest that, if Australia is to play a part in and is to hold up its head in any way at all in relation to human rights around the world, we should be looking to do what we can to try to get people into this country and out of the prison camps and other restrictive devices and mechanisms that fascists can and do use in South America. </PARA>
<PARA> Closer to home I do not think we have a very good record. I want to relate some events of about three years ago in West Irian. One Jacob Prai, the leader of a rebel group in West Irian, and one of his lieutenants, Ondawame, were captured on a trip to Papua New Guinea, were hurled into gaol, and tried. It was deemed that they should be deported. I took up with the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Peacock, the case for Prai to be given sanctuary in Australia. After all, he was a man who had lived all his life in a tropical climate. But the answer was no and Prai finished up in Sweden. I know for a fact from personal correspondence I have had with Jacob Prai that he is not happy there. I know for a fact that by that very inaction Australia lost a lot of friends. Prai is about as old as I am, and I guess that when I was putting pennies on the plate for missionaries Prai was on the receiving end of them. He was brought up in the Christian belief. He was brought up to believe that Australians were pretty good sorts of people. But I can tell honourable senators that when he finished up as a political refugee in Sweden rather than in Australia he lost all faith in Australians as a people and in Australia as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Hundreds of political refugees from West Irian have gone into Papua New Guinea and have been turned back, some to their deaths; but we in Australia have done nothing whatsoever about it. The refugees of West Irian are in exactly the same position as the people of East Timor. It seems to me that until this country breaks away from the Americanised subservience that we have towards Indonesia and starts to look at people for what they are-people-we are going to have very some very hard barbs thrown at us in the years to come. Perhaps our children will be the recipients of the hatred that we are now breeding by our reluctance to look after refugees who are much closer to home than the Indo-Chinese refugees. The people who have suffered and are suffering by way of prison camps and torture closer to home, and in South America, have suffered 100 times what any refugee from Indo-China in recent years has suffered. A great many Indo- Chinese refugees who have come here by boat or in other ways can be seen only as economic refugees. Very few, if any, have suffered in concentration camps or from the vile torture that fascist governments are handing out in other parts of this world. I believe from a humanitarian point of view alone we should be looking at some of these countries where, as I said earlier, human rights do not exist and should be doing what we can to alleviate the suffering of some of those people. </PARA>

I agree with Senator Scott that the Australian authorities have done a wonderful job when it comes to the settlement of refugees. However, I think I should make some comment on a couple of references in the report. For example, half way down page 8 it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . Australia suspended the assistance program and cultural relations. This led to a deterioration in relations with Vietnam. The suspension of assistance has been criticised in Australia, both in Parliament and outside it. Nevertheless, the Government has maintained its stand on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>After the destruction and the devastation of Vietnam, we had some moral obligation to assist with aid to that country. The stopping of economic assistance to Vietnam, which amounted to a pittance, cut our opportunity to negotiate with Vietnam. America can hang its head a lot lower than Australia when it comes to the assistance program to Vietnam. We complain that Vietnam is in the COMECON camp, and I often wonder how much we assisted in forcing Vietnam economically into that camp. Of course, our terms of reference did not include investigating such situations. Nevertheless, we felt that a small reference of some kind should be made. The terms of reference were concerned with Indo- Chinese resettlement in Australia. We had to go into the resettlement of refugees and not into the reasons that they were refugees. I wish we had had an opportunity to go into some of the reasons. Page 18 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is also appropriate that the size of the refugee intake within the program is determined annually. For the program to remain effective, it must be flexible enough to be adapted to changes in refugee outflows, the changing nature of refugees, e.g. economic rather than political, Australia's international obligations and domestic factors which indicate the community's capacity to absorb refugees. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 34, in reference to something similar, the following is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In the context of Indochinese refugee boats arriving anannounced in Australian waters, the role of effective coastal surveillance is crucial. This was highlighted in October 1981 when an unauthorised boat arrival was found to comprise of people, claiming to be refugees, who were subsequently found to have no claim on Australia for protection under the Convention and Protocoal relating to the Status of Refugees. </PARA>
<PARA>I must reiterate that we were not looking into the statust of refugees. However, we felt that some comment was necessary there. That took place towards the latter part of the inquiry. It was becoming increasingly obvious that the nature of Indo-Chinese refugees was changing and that refugees were leaving source countries for economic reasons rather than for fear of persecution. The Australian authorities recognise that this is occuring and are closely monitoring the situation, according to the departments. I must add, however, that there is no evidence to suggest that Australia is accepting in large numbers of people who could be termed economic refugees. But the situation must be kept under scrutiny. The terms of reference did not call for an inquiry into the nature of refugees. But the Committee acknowledges that, if the nature of refugees is changing, the attitudes of resettlement countries, including Australia, could well change and could alter their preparedness to accept people who are not refugees in fear of persecution. It is extremely unlikely that the Australian community would tolerate economic refugees in the same manner that they tolerate political refugees, especially in the present economic climate. I had to mention those two passages from the report. The matters mentioned were not within our terms of reference. Nevertheless, the Committee had to make some comment on them without going into them too deeply. We acknowledged the change that could take place and we wanted to draw attention of the Senate to it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I deliver this statement on behalf of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) whom I represent in this place. Where I use the first person personal pronoun it should be understood to refer to Mr Viner. Wage determination and industrial relations are of the most profound importance to the welfare of all Australians and for the development of the Australian economy. Sound policies in these two connected areas are obviously critical to Australia's growth and prosperity as a nation. It is appropriate therefore that I place clearly before the Parliament the Government's policy regarding wage determination, industrial disputation and industrial relations legislation. I do so against a background of widespread community concern about the marked increase in industrial disputation which has taken place in recent times, against a background of very substantial increases in wages which have been received by much of the work force since the abandonment of wage indexation, and against a background of questioning of the traditional system, and of a desire by the community for action to ensure that a better way is found to resolve industrial matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's wages policy has been firmly established since the abandonment of wage indexation last July. It gives clear expression to the Government's basic philosophy and objectives and it is the product of a number of factors. The Commonwealth does not have direct power over wages. The Commonwealth cannot legislate for any particular wage level. As a result, the Commonwealth's role in wages determination is necessarily more indirect than with policy areas for which it has direct constitutional responsibility. At the same time, however, the Government has a major responsibility to make sure that the growth in wages does not frustrate the achievement of overall economic objectives. It remains the government's firm view that the sustained control and reduction of inflation is basic to the achievement of substantial economic growth and the improved living standards all Australians seek. Reasonable wage levels and competitive labour costs are obviously a key element in pursuing these economic and social objectives. The Government's wages policy needs to be seen in that context and in the light of the reasons why wage indexation had to be abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA> From its inception, the wage indexation could operate effectively only as long as the consensus between the parties necessary for its survival remained intact. This required the union movement to remain within the centralised wage fixing system and not to seek additional wage increases outside the system. Unless that condition was met, indexation could not survive. The work value round of 1979 was a clear indication that the system was beginning to falter. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission warned of the threats posed by substantial wage increases outside the central system and the level of industrial disputation associated with the shorter hours campaign. But these warnings were not heeded. Disputation increases and pressures for wage increases outside as well as inside the indexation system continue to mount. The result was the abandonment of indexation in July 1981 and, as the Commission made clear at the time, the long- standing procedures whereby individual claims by unions would be heard by the Commission remained available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission also indicated that any application for adjustments on economic grounds would not be heard before February 1982. The Commonwealth Government moved quickly to consult national employers and unions as well as State governments to determine an appropriate course in the new circumstances. Following the Premiers Conference all governments called on unions to use the established system of wage determination involving Commonwealth and State tribunals. Moreover, they stressed that all governments and all parties involved had a responsibility to make the system work and that it would work if it were allowed to and if it were supported by all parties. Governments foresaw that wage claims would come before the Commission as they were pursued on an industry basis. That view was also endorsed by the Confederation of Australian Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The main elements of the Commonwealth's wages policy in the post-indexation period have been: Maintenance of firmly anti-inflationary economic policies to establish an appropriate economic environment for wage restraint; reliance upon established arbitral tribunals and their processes; support for the more decentralised approach to wage settlements on an industry-by-industry basis; to emphasise that it is the responsibility of unions and employers to use the existing system in an orderly manner with a minimum of industrial disputation, and to be willing to give maximum commitment to agreements reached and to bring them before industrial tribunals for scrutiny in the public interest; a less direct role for the Commonwealth Government in interventions in individual cases reserving the Government's advocacy for national wage cases and major industry cases; and action in its own sphere of employment to ensure that wages and conditions do not lead the market. Consistent with the overall need for wage moderation the Commonwealth accepts that its employees' wages and conditions should be maintained in a reasonably competitive position. </PARA>
<PARA> In past months significant wage increases have been gained by a substantial proportion of the work force in both private and public sectors as the industry- by-industry approach has worked its way through industry bargaining and ratification by the Commission. On top of this there will be a national wage case later this month. The Government's response to this has to be viewed against Australia's present economic situation and prospects. </PARA>
<PARA>What Lies Ahead</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policies over recent years have achieved considerable success in bringing about economic recovery. Let me remind the Senate that over the last two years living standards have risen and thousands of new jobs have been created-over a quarter of a million in the two years to December 1981. The facts are important to state at a time when the union movement and the Opposition would have the community believe the wage earner has suffered a loss of real value in earnings. This is patently not true. Seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings in September 1979 were $239.10 per week. By September 1981 they were $ 301.10 per week. In the same period the consumer price index increased by about 20 per cent. Thus in real terms average weekly earnings rose by about 4 3/4 per cent over the period. Putting it another way, the annual income of a person on average weekly earnings increased by over $700 in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Between fiscal year 1979-80 and 1980-81 real household disposable income rose by 3.42 per cent. That is, the real disposable income of Australian families- their after tax income-increased by nearly $3 billion. Movements in average weekly earnings in 1981-82 are expected to be broadly in line with the Budget forecase of 13.5 per cent. The full impact of recent wage and shorter house settlements will not, however, be felt until the 1982-83 financial year and may well be greater than for this financial year. The Government has emphasised to employers and unions alike the serious implications of excessive wage increases and industrial disruption for inflation, the competitive position of Australian industry and levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> All Australians should share the benefits of economic growth and the rising standard of living it brings, but there must be a recognition that there are limits to the growth of wages possible in any one year. Wage justice is compatible with moderation in wage settlements. Claims for wage increases have to be balanced against other calls on the resources of the community such as those for welfare beneficiaries and the need for investment funds by businesses. This view was supported by all governments at the August Premiers Conference. It is a view the Government has consistently expressed to the Australian Council of Trade Unions in economic discussions with its President, Mr Dolan, and senior union officials. It is a point of view which should be accepted and acted upon. The Government is firm in its commitment to ensure that its broad economic policies work to encourage a climate of wage restraint and to dampen inflationary expectations. Let there be no misunderstanding; the money supply will not be expanded so as to accommodate excessive wage increases. Economic policies will continue to be implemented to achieve this objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Conditions in overseas economies make restraint in Australia all the more important, for while our economy has been growing, and our national output and employment have been rising, our major trading partners have been experiencing continued recession, and growing unemployment; and as a consequence, inflationary presures in those countries have been falling. There is now a real prospect of inflation rates in Europe and North America dropping below Australia 's. This is a prospect which is compounded by excessive wage claims. Our international competitiveness, the profitability of Australian businesses and the confidence needed to maintain business investment are under threat. Job prospects both for those already with jobs and those looking for them, are correspondingly being reduced. Obviously the Government and the community want employers, unions and arbitral tribunals to act responsibly so that such an outcome is avoided. As the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development notes in its latest survey of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA>It is to be hoped that progress can be made in developing a better understanding between those who make and those who grant wage claims of the effects of their action, taking into account the relationships between inflation, real wage costs and employment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has been underlining to both employers and unions the broad national consequences of excessive wage increases for investment, economic activity and employment prospects for Australians. It is time then for the ACTU and its affiliate unions to take heed of the consequences of unrestrained wage demands and claims for shorter hours. Employers also have a very real responsibility to keep their work force fully informed of the impact excessive labour cost increases will have on investment, output and employment in their industry or enterprise. Against this background the forthcoming national wage case is of critical importance. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU is seeking substantial wage increases, possibly of the order of a further $25, for those wage and salary earners whose increases since the abandonment of indexation have been for lesser amounts. These increases would apply to a majority of the work force. On top of this the ACTU is seeking the introduction of full automatic quarterly cost of living adjustments commencing with the 4.2 per cent increase in the consumer price index for the December quarter. There is no way that the Australian economy can stand wage increases of this magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's submission to the forthcoming national wage case will express our primary concern that existing wage pressures are not exacerbated by any national wage decision. The abandonment of indexation makes no less important the requirements of section 39 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that the Commission shall take into consideration the public interest and for that purpose shall have regard to the state of the national economy and the likely effects of any awards with special reference to the level of employment and inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> With substantial industry wage settlements having moved through most of the work force and significant shorter hours agreements made in key segments of the economy, there is no room for any general wage increase to be granted in the national wage case and there should be no return to indexation. Such claims on top of wage increases obtained and being sought through industry by industry bargaining run the grave risk of doubling up on union wage demands, putting the health of the economy in jeopardy and causing the opposite of what the ACTU professes it wants to achieve for members of the work force-lowering instead of lifting their standard of living through accelerating inflation and reduced employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission in the Transport Workers Union decision in July last, clearly indicated that the unions faced a choice as to how wage increases should be obtained: Either by way of general economic cases, that is national wage cases, or by way of increases at the industry and award level. They have chosen the latter course. The unions cannot have it both ways. The Commonwealth will submit most strongly that the industry by industry approach best meets the needs of the Australian economy. This approach best meets the needs of all, by offering a real chance of containing the rate of inflation while leaving open to all sectors of the work force the way to pursue their claims by negotiation or, if necessary, by arbitration where matters will be dealt with on their merits. The weaker unions will not be left out in the cold by this approach. It is wrong for the Opposition or the ACTU to say that they will be, for the State and Federal tribunals are always there for them to pursue their claims. The union movement itself has a heavy responsibility for the orderly processing of claims and ensuring that the industrially strong do not gain unfair or unreasonable advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the national wage case, the Government will reserve its interventions before arbitral tribunals to major industry cases where agreements setting new standards for wages or other conditions of employment and having significant flow-on consequences are involved. This course was followed in the case of the metal trades agreement where the Commonwealth recognised the special features of that agreement-its 12 months 'no extra claims' clause and the willingness of the parties 'to run the gauntlet of the public interest'. Our submissions emphasised to the Commission the need to avoid flow-on of the agreement to other industries whose circumstances were fundamentally different. </PARA>
<PARA> In some other industries settlements which contain 'no extra claims' clauses have also come forward for scrutiny by industrial tribunals. This development offers the prospect of a reduction in industrial disputation during 1982 provided unions and employers accept their responsibilities to ensure that such agreements are honoured. It is some distance from a true 'no-strike' clause but I hope employers will in future bargaining put themselves in a position to push for such a clause. It is the ultimate test of the bona fides of the union movement. If the industry by industry approach is to be properly used the distinctive features of particular industries and the circumstances and terms of specific agreements reached by bargain and compromise must be recognised by employers, union and tribunals alike. Each claim has to be weighed and evaluated by the appropriate arbitral tribunal, having regard to the particular circumstances and the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to intervene to oppose ratification of the recent printing trades agreement on wages and hours is based on its concern for a settlement which is out of step with bargaining in other major industries. The agreement, by providing for a 35-hours week from December 1982, could lead to pressures for similar conditions in other industries when the economic situation requires the exercise of maximum restraint. The agreement to implement its terms regardless of whether it is ratified by the Commission brings into question the willingness of the parties to accept the obligation of justifying their agreement in the public interest before the Commission in order to render it legally binding on all parties to it. </PARA>
<PARA>Industrial Framework</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising against a background of a high level of industrial disruption that the institutional framework for industrial relations in Australia has been called into question. While arbitral tribunals have been ready to deal with wage claims, and have done so in a number of significant instances, the Government deplores the marked increase in the level of industrial disputation that occurred in the second part of last year. The figures I am about to quote are given in a way which corrects and clarifies the figures given by my colleague, the Minister for Industrial Relations, in his statement to the House of Representatives today. The latest official figures for industrial disputes show that in the September 1981 quarter 1,147,700 working days were lost through strikes compared with 848 600 working days in the September quarter 1980 and 631,000 working days in the December quarter 1980. All Australians have needlessly suffered as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> Of special concern were demarcation disputes and those in major industries caused by relatively small numbers of key employees. Demarcation disputes backed by unions placing bans on certain kinds of work or certain employers have become a blot on the industrial scene. The high point of such disruption has been the activity of the Builders Labourers Federation in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU has adopted rules for self-regulation of inter-union rivalry but the glaring omission from its code is any requirement that industrial disruption cease while the dispute is sorted out. Unions cannot shrug off the consequences of their action upon industry and the community. The right given under the law to organise collectively is not a licence to ravage the trade and commerce of the nation with impunity. As a result of the concern of all governments about recent trends in wage movements and industrial disputation, especially those associated with demarcation issues, it has been agreed that these matters will be a major focus for discussion at the Premiers Conference to be held on Friday next. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few months I have engaged in extensive discussions with the major employer and trade union organisations in most States. In addition, representatives of many companies, both large and small, have discussed with me or written to me expressing their concern about such factors as:</PARA>
<PARA>The structure of Australian unions and their heavy dependence on craft unions rather than industry or even enterprise unions;</PARA>
<PARA>The breakdown in any sense of commitment to bargains made and the spirit and intent of the conciliation and arbitration processes;</PARA>
<PARA>The constant resort to the indiscriminate use of union power often before the parties have even reached the bargaining table: as an act of first rather than last resort;</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal-State division of industrial relations powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of a responsible approach by management and unions to industry wage bargaining is tied up with the shape of union structures and the rights and obligations placed by the law on each of the parties. It has become clear to me that many Australians-not only employers-are concerned at the lack of responsibility demonstrated by the trade union movement in its use of industrial action and the relative weakness of employers in the face of such action. It is now more than a decade since the Clarrie O'Shea case and the major industrial battle over absorption of the Metal Trades decision of 1967, during which time the union movement has declared itself against any legal restraints on industrial action and the untramelled right to strike and impose bans in almost any situation. I believe the Australian community is saying enough is enough; that no section of the community can be above the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Improving the institutional framework of industrial relations is a priority task. It is being approached in a number of ways. The implications of divided jurisdiction and ways of achieving better co-operation and consistency between Federal and State jurisdictions has been under review by Commonwealth and State Labour Ministers and will be canvassed at the forthcoming Premiers' Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> During this session I intend to introduce a number of legislative initiatives which I discussed with the National Labour Consultative Council on 4 February and which will be the subject of further discussion at a special meeting of that Council to be held in March. The Government has been accused of seeking confrontation with the union movement because of these legislative proposals. Far from being confrontationist, the three legislative proposals are a responsible and reasonable response, both immediate and longer term, to meet a level of industrial disruption which all Australians recognise as totally unsatisfactory. The Government has a clear obligation to develop legislation which will protect the interests of Australians and provide a sound and balanced legal framework within which employers and employees can conduct industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is very much aware of the problems associated with union structures which arise in part as a result of the large number of unions that operate in individual industries and range over particular enterprises. Much of the recent discussion about amalgamation of unions has failed to distinguish between the objective of allowing the creation of industry unions and amalgamations which create big conglomerate unions such as the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, whose membership straddles a number of industries . Encouragement of the development of unions along those lines would not, in the Government's view, assist in reducing the level of industrial disputes to any marked degree. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's long-standing objective, clearly expressed in its industrial relations platform, is the encouragement of industry based unions. It is also the objective of the Labor Party and the ACTU. Clearly that objective will take considerable time to achieve. The legislation I intent to introduce this session will facilitate the development of industry based unions and allow enterprise unions to be formed. The door needs to be opened to movement from within the workforce so that the present rigidities and monopolies are loosened and structures created which are more suited to a modern economy and representative negotiations in industrial relations and dispute settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> The multiplicity of the unions involved in individual industries also means that key workers who do not belong to the major union with coverage of a particular industry can create substantial industrial disruption and effectively deny useful employment opportunities to their fellow employees. Recent disputes in the waterfront and coal industries are prime examples of the major costs that such action causes. Increasingly rolling strikes and bans from plant to plant or industrial action by small key groups of workers have been used to put intense economic pressure on a single employer, a whole industry, or the community at large. In those circumstances quite often the employer has no work for the other employees. The employer's capacity to resist a strike is reduced to nothing because his wages bill goes on running. He needs protection in that situation and the Government intends to provide it. Consequently, I will be introducing legislation later this session to provide employers with the automatic right to stand-downs. Employees who are unable to be usefully employed because of the effects of industrial action by other employees of the same employer or industrial action by employees of other employers may be stood down. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be clearly understood that the stand-down clauses will operate only if there is industrial action. If unions accept the normal processes of negotiation and conciliation and arbitration instead of taking industrial action , stand-downs will not be required. The Commonwealth will be drawing on the Commonwealth's Constitutional power over interstate and overseas trade and commerce and over corporations as well as its industrial powers to support this legislation. The Government firmly believes in the right of the individual to choose to join or not to join a union. We do not believe in giving unions the capacity to exercise monopoly power over the working lives of people. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has broadened legislation to allow individual employees to not become members of unions where they have a conscientious objection to doing so. Freedom of association on which unionism is based should not be distorted by denying the fundamental freedom of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> We intend to go further and to legislate to incorporate the principle of voluntary unionism in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and to provide safeguards against intimidation or victimisation for those who exercise their freedom of choice in this matter. Moreover, I will introduce legislation withdrawing from the Arbitration Commission jurisdiction to grant union preference. This will greatly assist in reducing the incidence of the closed shop, which is a total negation of voluntary unionism. </PARA>
<PARA> These legislative initiatives are but the start of our program of reform. The Government, with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Confederation of Australian Industry, is currently examining the report submitted by Mr Richard Searby Q.C. and former Deputy President Taylor on the simplification and streamlining of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I expect that legislation action will be taken on the basis of that report later this year to bring about a substantial re-structuring and simplification of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. This should be of major benefit to all those associated with industrial relations in Australia. Ultimately reform of industrial relations in Australia needs to go further than simplifying and restructuring what we now have. I will be pursuing for the Government the work already begun against the bench-mark of what I regard as two basic principles-equality of bargaining power and the equality of legal responsibility of employers and unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislative initiatives I have outlined are essential if better industrial structures and industrial relations are to be achieved. Legislation of course sets the framework and establishes the rights, duties and obligations of the parties to industrial relations. In this sense the law can change or mould the conduct of people but fundamentally, of course, industrial relations is about relationships between people-employees and management. Unions, employers and governments have a common interest in avoiding industrial disputes, and providing for a fair and equitable wage determination system. The achievement of those objectives will facilitate the development of the Australian economy which is essential if improvements in our standard of living are to be achieved. The national interest is clearly being damaged by present rates of increase in labour costs so often pursued by severe industrial disruption. Union leadership, business management and individual wage and salary earners, need to recognise this and work to improve industrial relations and to contain the inflation in labour costs. Progress towards this unity of interest and purpose will be to the common and personal good of all Australians. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agreed with the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party the day before yesterday when he said there was a tinge of madness in the trade union movement in New South Wales . I thought that expressed the situation very eloquently. But if there is a tinge of madness in the trade union movement in New South Wales there is a glaring psychopathology in this Fraser Government's attitude to industrial relations. I do not think it is better illustrated-there have been plenty of illustrations-than by this statement brought down by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) and read by the unhappy Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, who has to represent him in this place-a difficult task indeed. That is why I sympathise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the Fraser Government was elected to power there have been nine major statements on industrial relations which were designed to fix up the industrial relations problems of this country. I have not examined whether they emerge in a cyclical form every four months, when the moon is full or something like that. They normally emerge before by-elections, an election in the State of Victoria, a Federal election or sometime such as that. There is no particularly cyclical quality about their frequency. However on each occassion they have been put forward as the solution to the industrial relations problems. If honourable senators read the present statement they will suddenly realise-it becomes glaringly obvious-that the other nine statements have all been wrong. None of them have worked. None of them have been the solutions which they were claimed to be at the time they were read in an atmosphere of great drama to the House of Representatives or the Senate. They have all been wrong. So what confidence can we have that the tenth statement of this kind is right?</PARA>
<PARA> A minute ago the Minister read a statement which said that what the Government was concerned to do now was to equalise the bargaining relationships between employers and employees. It is going to do that by giving employers a new stick. Six pieces of legislation have been introduced by this Government designed to achieve exactly that effect and none of them have worked. If honourable senators want a specific example, amendments were made to the trade practices legislation to allow proceedings against unions to take place in the Trade Practices Commission. The Commission rather than proceeding with that matter-it saw that it would not work-and as it had been imposed on it, set up a procedure whereby it consulted with the Australian Council of Trade Unions about any matter which came before it. The legislation which the Fraser Government introduced is reduced to the level of a farce by that procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one example; there are plenty of others. The Industrial Relations Bureau, which was going to solve all of these problems, is now a source of frantic but debilitated controversy within the Liberal Party. Mr Peacock, the former Minister for Industrial Relations, was going to get rid of the Industrial Relations Bureau after some experience in that portfolio. He went and the Industrial Relations Bureau stayed. But the arguments which were put forward at the time, of course, have never been grappled with by this Government. All of the industrial relations initiatives of the Fraser Government stand for nothing when we look at this statement, because it adopts a quite different approach to the problems which have been sought to be dealt with by various methods. Now I want to browse, if I might, through this statement and to show some of the extraordinary suggestions which are contained in it. One ought to be duly modest about this, I suppose, but if I have had one success in politics it has been in telling the thickheads on the other side that a particular proposal will not work in industrial relations and I have always been right. </PARA>

It makes the Government feel much better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all I want to deal with the intellectual dishonesty in this statement which is not surprising when one has regard to the source of the statement. The statement seeks, first of all, to establish an environment for saying that the changed pattern in industrial relations has nothing to do with the Government's economic policies. Basically, that is what it seeks to do. At pages 5, 6 and 7 of the circulated copy it seeks to present some figures which would suggest that a person on average weekly earnings, for example, is better off and therefore, by indulging in industrial disputation, he is really a greedy Australian, as distinct from those who sit on the Government benches, that really his lot is no worse than it ever has been and that, therefore, there is some aberrant behaviour which is leading to the present level of industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Viner chooses, for the purposes of comparison, the period from September 1979 to September 1981. He says that in that period annual income of a person on average weekly earnings increased, in real terms, by over $700. If we examine all those figures one thing he carefully ignores is the tax bite. That is just ignored in the figures provided. In real terms, in fact, if we take the longer period that this Government has been in office, from September 1975 to September 1981, real average weekly earnings increased by a little more than $500, not $ 700 as the Minister claimed. The figures used by Mr Viner neglect the increasing tax burden because, as average weekly earnings went up, so did the rate of tax which people had to pay. Taxes have increased in the last year by 22 per cent on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers-a total of $3,000m. I mention these figures by the way because the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has glibly picked them up, as is his wont, and put them over his Nareen radio program to explain to people how they have been better off under his Government in the last couple of years. It is an extraordinary allegation. I invite honourable senators to ask anybody in their constituencies how they feel about that proposition and see what sort of answer they will get. In fact, I would not risk asking the question. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975, for example, when this Government came into office, taxation represented 22 per cent of average weekly earnings for a single person. By 1981 it represented 23.5 per cent. For a taxpayer with a spouse and two children-the classic family-it has gone up from 12 per cent to 15.5 per cent. Taxpayers on average weekly earnings but not those on the higher incomes are now paying a greater proportion of their earnings in tax. In real terms, this means that the single taxpayer's income has gone up by 1.5 per cent in the relevant period. From 1979 it has gone up by 3.8 per cent or $439, not $700 as the Minister alleged. One can go through the figures in respect of various sized families and so on, but I think the most significant point is that since 1975 the income of a married taxpayer with no children has actually gone down by 0.5 per cent. So what the Minister has sought to do in this statement is to create an environment which suggests that any industrial disputation that has occurred in the last few months is based on greed. </PARA>
<PARA> As the statement points out, there are two major parties to industrial relations-the employers and the employees as represented by the unions. One would have thought that the Government also has a role to play. This statement indicates that that is a shared view. Of course, there have been many statements which suggest that the Government sees that it has a role to play. One of the most important factors is that Senator Chaney went to the trouble to give us detailed figures of the industrial disputation in the September quarter last year as compared with the previous year. Mr Viner in his statement said that there was twice the level of industrial disputation. After debate in the House of Representatives where he was accused of misleading the House on these figures , Senator Chaney has very astutely and diligently not fallen into the same error as Mr Viner. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point to be made about the September quarter last year is simply that since the collapse of the wage indexation system which the Fraser Government inherited from the Labor Government this Government has had no wages policy whatsoever. That is why I asked Senator Chaney this afternoon what the main points of this Government's wages policy were. Senator Chaney, with great astuteness again, referred to this statement. This statement does not indicate anything by way of a wages policy. The point I am making is that there was a high level of industrial disputation in the last quarter of last year because of the collapse of indexation and the absence of any wages policy at all. There was the royal wedding syndrome: The Telecom Australia strike could not be resolved because the Prime Minister had to get away to the royal wedding. 'Give them $20' , he said, in order that he could catch the Boeing to the royal wedding. That was the collapse of any wages policy in this country, and it is precisely because of that that we had a very high level of disputation in the final quarter of last year. But of course that level of disputation was designed to achieve a result which directly flowed from the actions of this Government. In 1975 Prime Minister Fraser, in his election speech, said: 'We will maintain wage indexation.' That was the electoral promise. That was undoubtedly one of the factors that helped the Government secure such a good result in 1975. There were many factors but that was one of them. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I believe that is so. The point about the disputation level last year was that there was concern to bring wage levels back to relativities of the sort that applied at the time that promise was made in 1975. It was promptly abandoned in the March quarter of 1976. There were 15 national wage cases between 1976 and the end of last year, and in five of these the Fraser Government argued for partial indexation, contrary to the promise which was made , and in ten cases the Government argued for no indexation at all, also contrary to the promise it made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Viner, at the end of the statement Senator Chaney read, says all that glib stuff about industrial relations not being about laws but ultimately being about good attitudes between people and about fairness and trust. How can that sort of statement roll out of a Minister's mouth when one considers a record of total lack of fairness and total lack of trust which employees naturally have of this Government because of that broken promise? The result of the broken promise, the royal wedding syndrome and the collapse of wage indexation was of course the effort to restore wage levels. The Government got it all in one hit for its sins in the last quarter to September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few specific matters in the statement on which I would like to comment. First of all, as I said a couple of environmental matters are introduced at the beginning of the statement. It tries to set the environment of greedy employees whose real living standards have actually improved under Malcolm Fraser when everybody else other than the fantasy makers in this Government believe otherwise. Secondly, it suggests an atmosphere of great community concern about industrial disputation. I think there might have been some effort to examine the reason for that. The reason can pretty fairly be laid at the door of this Government with its record of broken promises in industrial relations. The Minister goes on to say that there is a background of questioning of the traditional system of industrial relations in Australia. The interesting point to make is to ask the question: By whom? This statement represents an acknowledgement of a total record of failure. A whole lot of new questions are asked by the Government for the first time in the context of this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to get into the argument with which this statement deals at length, namely the importance of the Australian economy of a wages system. I think there is common ground on that issue. If we can extract any point from the last report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development it is simply that. It is saying in the politest terms that Australia does not have a wages policy, which is something I think most people are aware of. The statement goes to great lengths to point out that it would be desirable to have a wages policy in Australia and then goes on to lecture people about their responsibilities in various ways. On pages 4 and 5 of the circulated statement there is an attempt to set out the Government's present wages policy. I invite all literate honourable senators to read that statement of so-called wages policy and analyse precisely what it means. If we read it carefully we see that all it means is that the Government, having no wages policy, wants everybody involved in industrial relationships to behave themselves. That is what pages 4 and 5 add up to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. To show some sense in the national interest, as Senator Chaney would like to add to what I said, is not unreasonable. That is what they say. Government should show some sense in the national interest and not make promises to people which they then turn around and dishonour immediately. The Fraser Government Ministers are very highly paid. They are not on $180 a week. They are supposed to give a lead to the community about the sorts of standards to be set in terms of national responsibility. I think Senator Chaney's view and my view were not far apart in that regard. Surely when honourable senators offer themselves for government they say that they are in a position to set a lead on national standards in these matters. It is not much good imposing that moral obligation on somebody on $180 a week when Government senators are not prepared to accept it themselves. That is what I find rather pious about this so-called statement of wages policy. The next section of the statement tends to suggest that people will be better off economically than they are now. Page 7 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Government has emphasised to employers and unions alike the serious implications of excessive wage increases and industrial disruption . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That statement then sets out a number of factors. One of the exercises in emphasising that point was the famous ICI Australia Ltd incident over the 35- hour week. The Government intervened in that matter and turned it into a fiasco with the sort of magic midas touch of failure which it has in industrial relations. Another incident was the famous revelations of Costain's private documents in connection with the Builders Labourers Federation dispute. They are the sorts of interventions which the Government has used to emphasis to employers-</PARA>

<PARA>There is now a real prospect of inflation rates in Europe and North America dropping below Australia's. This is a prospect which is compounded by excessive wage claims. </PARA>
<PARA>That might be true, but of course if this Government is to set standards I remind it of the standard set by the Prime Minister, again in 1975, when he was in a slightly different situation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped, it is part of a world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership when if they were men of real stature, they would be saying 'we can overcome'.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the standard which Malcolm Fraser set when he was in Opposition, but now of course just as wages become an alibi for economic failure the fact that we perhaps are not doing so well or we are doing better than some countries also becomes an alibi for failure.

But the figures on unemployment were well in the pipeline before the figures for industrial disputation in the September quarter emerged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the proposal of the Government relating to the way that wage fixation should take place in the future. In essence, what the Government is doing in this statement is abandoning arbitration as we have known it in this country. What it is doing is opting for a system of industry collective bargaining with the arbitration system remaining, it is said, to look after the weaker employee groups. As the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The weaker unions will not be left out in the cold by this approach. It is wrong for the Opposition or the ACTU to say that they will be for the State and Federal tribunals are always there for them to pursue their claims. </PARA>
<PARA>If this Government had any understanding of the development of arbitration in this country it would be clear to it that there is nothing magical about the arbitration system which protects the weak unless there is an institutionalised minimum standard which is set within that system. That is why we had a basic wage for a very long time and why the basic wage was replaced by a minimum wage. The Government cannot opt out of that sort of discussion altogether and just say that the stronger unions, by a system of collective bargaining in industry, will be able to look after themselves and the weaker unions can reply on the arbitration system. That is the sort of system which the Government is really adopting. The Government seeks to change the objects of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in a quite fundamental way and to institute over and above it a new system of collective bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> Collective bargaining will not work in Australia. It will not work, first of all, because Australians do not know how to do it and, secondly, because of the very history and tradition of this country. I think it is a very good conservative principle to adapt institutions to meet new circumstances rather than try to change them completely. This is a conservative principle which I espouse. There are a number of reasons based on that view as to why the proposed system wll not work in terms of providing a satisfactory solution to industrial disputation problems. The Government, it is said, will play a more low key role in industrial claims before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. That, indeed, may be a very positive statement with this Government. If the Government plays a low key role it cannot be worse than when it plays a high key role, if that is the opposite, Senator Chipp, to a low key role. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which is, of course, of fundamental importance and which goes hand in hand with this question is the industrial framework and the proposals in relation to amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to change the structure of trade unions in Australia in a very artificial way. In this statement two notions are confused about the nature of the sort of unions which we would want. First of all, the statement says, as everybody says, that there are too many unions in Australia and there is too much trouble among small unions-the point I thought that we on this side of the house were making only a few months ago during consideration of the amalgamation Bill which I introduced as a private members Bill and which the Government itself had previously espoused. I just want to remind the Senate of a couple of things about that Bill . It was to give to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the power to determine what sort of amalgamations between unions could be regarded as being in the public interest. It was to give the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the power to determine that question-a proper exercise of the industrial power of the Commonwealth. Of course, what could have happened under that provision, which was one of the Government's fantasies last year--</PARA>

Under that legislation a proposition regarding union amalgamations could have been taken to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission could have said: 'No, this is not an industry union amalgamation. This is not desirable in the public interest'. The Commonwealth Government could have been represented in such proceedings and said: 'No, we oppose this sort of amalgamation. It is not consistent with our policy for the development of industry based unions'. That would have been a very sensible procedure. I just remind the Senate that when Senator Chaney as spokesman for the Government addressed himself to that legislation he said on two occasions that what the Government is concerned about is industry based unions. That was not a proposition at all inconsistent with the Bill before the Senate. I am concerned about industry based unions too, because I think they are in the best interests of efficient management in this country. This proposal now before the Senate talks about two types of unions-industry based unions and what are called enterprise unions. I do not know what they are really; I suppose that it is an idea which has come from Ohio or Japan or somewhere like that and which appeals to the Government in some way. Those places probably have a better economic performance than we do. The notion of industry based unions in the Australian context both historically and socially is quite absurd. I have not seen the slightest evidence in the Minister's statement or in any other statement about it that people know what they are talking about when they use the expression ' enterprise unions'. The only one I ever struck was a thing called the AMP Society which was set up by the management of AMP which provided the bickies and everything else for morning tea. That was, I suppose, an enterprise based union- the company owned it.</PARA></TALK.START>

One would get the same sort of bizarre result again as one got from the development of the craft unions in a modern industrial society. So I think it is important that that notion be hit on the head. If we do not do it in the Senate honourable senators opposite can do it in their party rooms and they will be doing well. Before it gets here that notion of enterprise unions should be hit on the head pretty early because it is terribly silly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the other item of industrial coercion which is to be introduced into the system is giving the employer the right to stand down employees when they cannot be usefully employed because of an industrial stoppage. Now that, for those honourable senators who are historians, is conceptually fascinating. That right for an employer to stand down an employee at his discretion was something that the English courts of the eighteenth century-the judges of the English courts of the eighteenth century were scarcely red hot radicals-got rid of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Your Commonwealth does it, Senator, by getting a stand-down provision in an award or determination. This proposal is that the employer should have a right to do that without any reference to a stand-down provision in an award or an arbitral tribunal. That will lay the Government open to a lot of trouble. Even if, in one's wildest fantasies, one wanted to encourage a modern democracy in Australia, as the last sentence in the statement suggests, if one wanted to encourage good industrial morale and a feeling of belonging and participating in this society, which one would hope that honourable senators in their hearts would want to do, that is the wrong way to start. That, I suppose, is the most awful thing of all in this statement. Other things are just silly but that is bordering on the iniquitous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing which I find strange is that this Government will have an industry wage bargaining system and the capacity for enterprise unions. That does not seem to me to fit together very well. I hope that when we get the revised version of this statement-as it will have to be revised-that bit will be ironed out. I do not see how we can have enterprise unions and industry wage fixation. The two just do not seem to me to work together at all. If anybody could explain to me where I am wrong I would be grateful. I think the Government ought to have a look at that matter when it prepares its next version of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add that if the stand-down proposal survives this Parliament in my view it will not survive the High Court. There is no way in which one could say that the right to stand-down, in the circumstances suggested in this statement, is in any way related to or incidental to interstate or overseas trade, or commerce or corporation power. Of course, it is quite out of court under the industrial power of the Commonwealth which is to establish machinery of government for conciliation and arbitration for the settlement of disputes. This Government is saying that there will be no machinery. I think we ought to get rid of that here in the Senate to save costs in the High Court because it will go down the chute over there anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other rhetorical matters relating to altering the objects of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which really only cast Mr Viner in the role of a radical. Mr Viner is a radical I do not know what, seeking in a radical sense to make quite dramatic changes to the history and development of industrial arbitration in this country. I am sure that the best developments of these kinds are ones which allow for a degree of continuity and adaptation of existing institutions to meet new circumstances. That sort of process is the one which will produce results, not this sort of root and branch change which I suppose Mr Viner got fixed in his mind after reading some book or-</PARA>

Perhaps there was some bug in the system in Paris who said: 'But we should also point out that they have no wages policy'. So that went into the report and all these embarrassments were heaped on the Government's head. There was a sudden recognition that this Government was not doing so well and so this statement was trotted out as a sort of a desperate effort to call spirits from the vasty deep before the Lowe by-election and the Victorian State election in April. It will not work in either of those two contexts and, of course, it will not work as a way of developing industrial relations in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take part in the discussion of the statement on wage determination and industrial relations. I suppose there could be no more important part of Australian society to discuss and to debate than just that. I want to make just one or two references to some of the things which were mentioned by Senator Button in his speech over the past 30 minutes or so. He started by suggesting that there had been something like nine major statements on industrial relations in the past six years or so of this Government. Indeed, he made that remark and the inference was that we had no capacity to solve any problems and that we were constantly changing our minds. I add to that observation the fact that there have been at the hands of all governments in this country more than 70 amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act since it was founded some 70 years ago. The real inference that comes from both those statements surely must be that the industrial relations problem in this free society of ours has proved to be a very difficult problem to solve. A government, of whatever colour, would fail to live up to its responsibilities if it were not continually trying to come to grips with and in some real measure to solve this very problem. The evidence that has been put before us proves that it is a problem constantly in view and one which is difficult to solve. That certainly does not mean that we or anyone else should stand aside from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was sorry that from time to time Senator Button moved away from his humorous jibes and, indeed, from his delightful capacity for a humouros approach. When he moved on to industrial relations he seemed to have no contribution at all to make except a measure of destruction. In fact, he said quite happily at one stage that his contribution to debates on industrial relations in this chamber over a significant period had been to say on every occasion: 'Well it won't work '-and he congratulated himself on being accurate. He said that was the view he took, and that was his contribution, and the inference was that that was a fine contribution. He merely said: 'It won't work'. We want something much better than that. I assume that if Senator Button and the Opposition in this chamber are not prepared to suggest in this place the real solutions to industrial relations problems, they do so in the electorate. I imagine that they tell the people of Australia how simple it is to solve these problems. Indeed, the Labor Party, having explained that to the Australian electorate over the past 33 years , has succeeded in convincing the Australian electorate that it had the answers to the problems for three of those years. For three years out of 33 apparently it provided answers to the community on these matters that convinced the community that the Labor Party should be the government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button said that this wage determination and industrial relations statement was a diversionary action. Surely to come to grips with industrial relations matters in this country can hardly be said to be diversionary. It is certainly not an easy area and if one wanted to be diversionary one would move to an area where one could achieve more successfully and more easily something that may well appear to be a popular move in the community in which the Government and, indeed, the Opposition have a place and a policy to serve. Senator Button referred to average weekly earnings. As I recall, he said that as average weekly earnings went up the tax rate confronting people went up too. I think we should pause to consider tax rates in the Australian economy because it is so often being asserted that the rates are going up and people are paying more tax. Of course people are paying more tax. That is because they are earning a very great deal more money. The facts are that the rates of tax in this country now conform to three specific levels whereas previously they conformed to about seven specific levels. The position now is that if one earns in the vicinity of $18,000 a specific rate of 32 per cent will apply. Beyond $18,000 and up to nearly $36,000 of taxable income a rate of 46 per cent applies. Beyond that amount a rate of 60 per cent applies. There are then only three ratios or rates of taxation applicable whereas six years ago there were seven rates applicable. Constantly the more one earned the more likely one was to pay more tax proportionately than is the case in the current circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether we like it or not, many of the problems in this country are the problems of an affluent society. That does not mean that we should not recognise them or come to grips with them. Surely we must recognise their nature in that sense. Of the tens of thousands of young Australians and some older ones who travel, I suppose to the four corners of the globe every year, I believe that without exception all of them come back to their homeland in a matter of weeks or months or whatever of the opinion that this country we seem to berate so often and in so many places is indeed as good as or better than any other country to live in today. Let us keep it that way. Let us adopt a constructive attitude to the problems we can all recognise. Let us find some solutions that will retain for Australia and Australians the sort of attraction that Australia has had to this point. Indeed, I recall Senator Button making some references to the $20 a week pay increase that the Telecom employees achieved through whatever sources at the time when the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was going to the royal wedding. I do not believe that that function had anything to do with the $ 20. It came from sources outside that particular area. If we are talking of $20 to solve a situation, I recall very clearly that only a week or two ago the Premier of my own State, Mr Wran, solved a problem with the coal miners by granting them a full $63 a week. That was his solution. Whether that has any relevance to economic stability and progress I am not sure, but I believe it is most unlikely that it has. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button also made considerable comment on the fact that some six years ago we undertook to maintain wage indexation and that on five occasions we had sought partial indexation and on 10 occasions we had sought no rise. I make no apology for that sort of action. I guess that it is a response to reality because the economic scene is always a changing scene. It is quite infantile to assume that one can apply a straight standard and maintain it year after year regardless, in many cases, of situations over which one will have no control at all. I am sure that in retrospect the Hon. Gough Whitlam would have the same reflections on his period in office. I seem to recall that during his time he sought not to put a government view or a view of restraint into the courts which were deciding areas for wages rates and standards in this country. He had no presence in those negotiations, discussions and debates and, of course, a fascinating escalation of wages was the outcome. That sort of escalation ended up with an inflation rate of somewhere in the vicinity of 17 1/2 per cent. So we can certainly see that it is responsible for a government to move into the courts that determine wages and conditions and a lot of other things referable to the economic community, to move in and take a realistic view of changing circumstances-in many cases, circumstances over which the Government and, indeed , the Australian people have little or no control. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Button was reflecting, as I recall, on the need that this statement on industrial relations suggests for a change in the structure of industrial relations procedures in this country with a view to attaining some form of realistic and constructive peace, he asked: 'Who questions the system?' I do not think anyone in this chamber or outside it would fail to question the system very seriously when around him he finds the sorts of industrial disasters that are occurring today and that have occurred for many months now. If that is not sufficient reason to question the system, I certainly do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not mean to be highly critical of what Senator Button said because I must say that I believe his response to the statement was a good-humoured one. Whilst it did not succeed in pulling the statement to pieces, it certainly gave no really constructive alternatives. Senator Button referred to direct bargaining and, of course, there are arguments opposing that sort of thing. Yet when one examines the concept of direct industry to industry bargaining in the industrial relations legislation that will come down in the near future, one finds that it is not an irresponsible situation, because it will be direct bargaining in the presence of the employer and the employee and with the need for ratification by the Commission. Surely direct bargaining, if it does anything at all, must increase the pressure for responsibility on both the employer and the employee. If direct bargaining results in a situation that makes things economically impossible for the employer, there will be created a situation in which the employment and the economic trading capacity of the community are at stake. I do not believe that sensible organisations, at least those which do not seek to destroy the whole politically philosophical system of a free enterprise democracy, will have a bar of that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> In this statement there has been foreshadowed the introduction of legislation which will make union amalgamations in all probability easier and result in the formation of industry unions. Industry-based unions are something that we have talked about over many years. They exist in a significant number of countries where the historical position differs very often from the Australian circumstance. I suppose that West Germany would be the truest indicator of an industry union situation. That country was able to start with a clean slate, as it were, after World War II. Industry unions have developed there and would appear to be successful. Amalgamations along those lines would bring, I believe, a greater responsibility to unionists and management alike. An industry union concept should bring a realisation of the interdependence of all people working right along the line throughout an industry, no matter whether they be plumbers, electricians, welders or whatever. They will be seen to be part of a total entity. The logical result of that would be that there would have to be a significant increase in the responsibility of each and every member of that particular union. I hope and believe that that sort of thing would prove to be acceptable in Australia and certainly to be worth the promotion and trial that this Government intends to give it. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the legislation seeks to rub out the preference for unionism section in the principal legislation. I suggest that when people look at that proposition quietly and intelligently they will say: 'Why not? What is freedom all about? Is there a right to work? Is it necessary for one to be directed to a job or not because one is or is not a member of a union?'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and they will continue to do that. The third area foreshadowed in this ministerial statement concerned stand-downs. Stand-down legislation has been held up by opponents of its introduction as something fairly horrific. The proposition is that a stand-down would apply only if there were industrial action, strike action, that made it economically impossible for another group of unionists in another related industry to be usefully employed. That seems to be a reasonable and responsible attitude. How can any economy survive if it is forced to pay wages or anything else in a situation in which it is totally uneconomic to continue?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe this statement on wage determination and industrial relations is of such significance that the whole Australian community should be paying an extreme measure of attention to it. It is necessary because it is relevant to the total development of the Australian economy. If it is relevant to that, it is relevant to the welfare of every Australian and to Australia's capacity to be a successful trader and a successful contributor to the nations around the world , developed and developing. There can be no doubt about the need for intelligent and serious discussion in this area. I believe that there is no more appropriate time than the present to bring these matters forward for the sort of discussion I have suggested. There is no more important appropriate time because surely in this country in recent months, particularly since the abandonment by the Arbitration Commission of indexation in July 1981, there has been practically no time when there has been a worse situation relating to industrial unrest. A whole spate of go-slow campaigns, bans and strikes really is starting to wear mighty thin the patience of even the great mass of Australians. So it is appropriate that the Government should bring forward this sort of discussion, this sort of promotion that contains within it some significant changes to the method and structure of industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been enormous wage increases since the abandonment of indexation. One can understand the sort of rush that followed that situation. Prior to the abandonment of indexation an attempt was made on the Government's behalf to institute a measure of restraint on wages, not for that reason alone but in order that inflation, which is probably the greatest single enemy of any Australian, could be contained. That sort of restriction was lost when indexation was abandoned and there was to be no consideration of a national wage case until February 1982-a week or two from now. In that period there has been an enormous rush for people to get as much as they can in the time available. That has been done totally and absolutely, I believe, without any reference to the sort of damage it could and may well do to the economy and the sort of jeopardy it may place around job opportunities in this country. It has been done without any reference to those matters at all. Indeed, we have seen, again in my own State, the problem of granting shorter working hours and very significant increases in wages without any reference in reality to productivity levels. </PARA>
<PARA> In the New South Wales power industry the 35-hour working week has been granted , allegedly on the basis of increased productivity, making it a proper, reasonable and responsible course to take. The facts are that in that period of six or seven months, the cost of power-there is mightly little of it-has increased by in the vicinity of 40 per cent. The community cannot stand that sort of thing. I believe that the community has a right to expect a government to examine a situation which allows that to happen and to try desperately to legislate for circumstances which will obviate those problems. They are the problems of every Australian. They are the problems of employment, inflation and capacity to trade. It is as basic as that. We are becoming perhaps non- competitive merely because we are not loading the ships, merely because we are failing to produce the power in a land that can do those things superbly. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to talk for just a moment or two about the Government's wages policy. Since the abandonment of indexation in July of last year that policy has been firmly based on the direct negotiation between employer and employee and on the ratification of the resultant agreements and arrangements. Indeed, the situation has resolved itself into a rush, as I said a moment or two ago, to increase wage levels by as great a degree as is humanly possible, having total irrelevance to the capacity of the community to pay and to the public interest. A number of factors are referable to the wages policy of the Commonwealth. The first such factor-it is a very significant one-is that the Commonwealth has no direct power over wages and cannot legislate for any particular wage. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I must insist that this Government and any government in this country has a very direct responsibility to make sure that the sorts of arrangements that are reached between employers and employees and looked at by the appropriate tribunals are arrangements that take real consideration of the public interest and of the capacity of the economy to pay. Indeed, if the capacity of the economy to pay and the public interest are not observed of course a depression across a very wide range of this community must be a certainty. We try to ensure that the growth in wage levels does not frustrate economic policy and performance. That is the province of a government, and that is the province that this Government seeks to follow in the course of its wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Sustained control and reduction of inflation must be the policy of the Government. That is more relevant to wage levels and the real affluence of a community than almost any other single thing. It is totally basic to economic growth and to living standards. (Quorum formed). I was talking about the need to ensure that all wage determinations have a relevance to the country's anti- inflationary situation and course and to the economic development of the whole community. It is worth remembering just why it was that wage indexation was finally abandoned by the Arbitration Commission. It was abandoned on grounds about which there had been constant warnings. They were that wage indexation was not going to work at any time if there was a constant effort towards and a constant fact of wage determinations and levels being arrived at outside the system. If we have a system of wage indexation and determinations constantly being made by people outside the system it will not work because it will create a great measure of discord. That is exactly what it did in this country which led to its abandonment in July 1981. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That could be what Senator Keeffe wants but we are seeking to establish an industrial relations structure that will not bring confrontation but will give real opportunity for all individuals concerned, whether they be employers or employees, to express a strong point of view and to arrive at situations which will ensure-this is the important thing in any industrial relations proposition-the capacity of this economy to develop along the massive and fascinating lines it should be capable of doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's wages policy in the post-indexation period-I mention these matters again; they were mentioned briefly in the statement itself-includes a determination to hold to an anti-inflationary course and to make wage restraint realistic. It is important and, I believe, absolutely reasonable to remember that wage restraint is realistic only if we can control inflation and keep it down. We have to rely on the established arbitral tribunals and their processes. That is part of this wages policy. We have, as I have already expressed, determined to support wage determination on an industry by industry basis. Naturally, it is the responsibility of unions and employers alike in that circumstance to abide by agreements and to subject them to the scrutiny of public interest. That is an important part of wages policy. I do not believe that many Australians would disagree with me. We should involve the Government in the advocacy of a national wage case and, perhaps, a few major industry cases . Finally, the Government's policy must be directed towards maintaining a relevance between wage structures and agreements and the capacity of the economy to pay. Its own employees, who must of necessity be properly and excellently remunerated, must not be seen to be the leaders in the field of wage determination. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by suggesting, once again, that this proposed legislation in the industrial relations area has a great deal to commend it. In many senses it sees a new era. It takes, as it always takes with any legislation, a real determination by both parties to wages agreements and by the tribunals themselves to see that justice is done in accordance with the public interest and the economic capacity of the Australian community. I suggest that this sort of legislative process will not harm the smaller, less powerful unions. They will always maintain their capacity for advocacy within the appropriate tribunals. Consequently, it is a red herring to assume that this sort of industry by industry negotiation will leave the smaller unions in a problem situation. That is not the case and I commend the statement to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard this evening much comment and criticism about the area of industrial relations. We have heard very few solutions to a vexing problem. I believe that the comments and criticisms have served more to confuse further the area than to clarify it. I will start my comments by referring to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) at the beginning of the year that there was to be a new approach to industrial relations in this country. He said that we would try a period of conciliation and co-operation. That led many of us in industry to the hope that at least something positive was about to be done and that we would try to get some new initiatives in this area. It led me to hope that perhaps even industrial democracy may be given a brief chance of success. However, this new approach, as heralded by the Prime Minister, was very short lived. No more than a week later we heard that the Government proposed to introduce what can be described only as the most inflammatory approach to industrial relations that one could conceive. The Government said that it intended to introduce legislation for compulsory stand-downs. This legislation, apart from being inflammatory, was also unnecessary. Stand-downs, at present, are a matter between the unions, the industry and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. We maintain that that is where the responsibility should remain. It is a complex question in a strike situation as to whether stand-downs should apply. It is impossible for legislation to try to bring in a situation that covers all possible contingencies. It can only inflame an already difficult area of industrial relations. The Australian Democrats give notice now that they will vigorously oppose any legislation that attempts to make it possible for automatic stand- downs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If it is the Government's intention to use industrial relations as an election issue-that has been suggested-it is a very hypocritical approach. The Government has presided over the ending of indexation and, so far, has been unable or has refused to fill the gap in wage fixation. The Government's Pilate-like indifference has led to one of the greatest wage explosions we have had in this country. The inflation that this will cause and the problems it will create for those on fixed incomes will be very great. The unions are already moving to establish relativities following the recent agreement with metal workers. We can see only industrial chaos ahead. We believe that this chaos is brought about fundamentally because the Government has not been able to make up its mind whether to apply a centralised or decentralised wage fixing system. This basic conflict between the two approaches to wage fixation is at the core of our problems. There are, in fact, three approaches to wage fixation at present involving either a centralised approach or a decentralised approach. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will outline the three approaches. First of all there is the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission with its national wage case. Then there is industry-wide negotiation as we have seen in the recent negotiations with the metal trades and the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union. Both these approaches-wage fixing through the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and negotiation between an industry-wide union and an employer organisation representing a national industry-have resulted in the disastrous agreement between the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union which is spearheading the present wages explosion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third approach to wage fixation is a decentralised approach. The first two I have just mentioned are centralised approaches. We can have a decentralised approach which involves negotiation between unions and companies. The problem in this country is that we are using all three approaches concurrently and this is leading to chaos. Companies are used to direct negotiation with unions. This happens every day of the week. Unions can knock on the door of any company and say: 'Here is a log of claims. We want to negotiate with you or we will pull employees in your factory out on strike'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button claimed there was no experience of direct negotiation in Australia. The contrary is the case. Companies are negotiating directly with industries on over award payments all the time. The problem is that unions want the best of all worlds. They want a centralised wage fixing system, they want to retain the ability to hear cases in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, they want to retain the ability to negotiate with employer bodies such as MTIA and they are also insisting on their right to negotiate directly with companies.</PARA>
<PARA> Centralised wage fixing can work given two pre-conditions. One is that the unions are prepared to forego their right to direct negotiation and abide by the decisions of the Commission. In the absence of this undertaking, it is difficult to see how a centralised wage fixing system can work satisfactorily. We also have the additional problem in this country of overlapping State and Commonwealth legislation on industrial matters. This brings the Australian Democrats to the conclusion that inevitably we are progressing towards a decentralised wage fixing system, one of direct negotiation and direct bargaining. Essentially it is our solution to the problem as we see it in this country. Because the parties concerned have shown an unwillingness to make a centralised wage fixing system work, we are advocating that we adopt the alternative which is a decentralised system based on direct negotiation between the company and the union. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there has been confusion in the discussion so far because the words ' company negotiation and company unions' and 'industry negotiation and industry unions' have been used rather loosely. I understand the terms 'industry unions and industry negotiations', to mean a national industry such as the metal industry or the transport industry. When we talk about a company union we are talking about a union that relates to a specific company. We make the point that industry wide negotiations must still be regarded as a centralised approach to wage fixing and this is essentially the system that is causing the problem in Australia at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement also goes on to indicate that the Government proposes to encourage industry unions. The Democrats support this approach. We believe it is consistent with our suggestion that we move to direct negotiation, a direct bargaining approach to wage fixing, the decentralised approach. We can have industry wide unions and we can have branches of those unions that are applicable to specific companies. Generally speaking this is the situation that applies in the United States of America and it works well. It would gradually lead to overcoming the basic problem of a great multitude of unions operating within an individual company. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that the statement raises is the question of compulsory unionism. It has been indicated that there should be legislation to eliminate preference in employment to union members. It is our view that unions are well able to look after their own affairs. On principle we are opposed to any legislation in existence at the moment that encourages compulsory unionism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Frankly, I am not sure what is meant by a large enterprise union. This is where I have been confused. As far as I can see there are two terms, an industry union and a company union.

It must be one of those two alternatives. I am making the point that we are in favour of industry wide unions that have branches within the company. That is not substantially different from the situation that applies right now in many cases in the metal trades. The AMWSU is as close as it could possibly be to an industry wide union in relation to the metal industry. It is a national union and right now it negotiates on a company by company basis on over award payments. The significant difference that we advocate is this: In decentralised negotiations, in direct bargaining, it is essential that the negotiation result in a written agreement that can be legally binding. Unless that is done we have really achieved nothing . The unions should not be in a position where they can negotiate, come to an agreement and walk away without undertaking that they will not be back next week or next month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summary we are saying that a decision must be made between the two approaches to wage fixation, either centralised or decentralised. The unions must be prepared to say that they are moving in one direction or the other. They cannot continue to advocate that they want the best of all worlds. It is intolerable for unions to have direct negotiations resulting in an agreement and then the following week, the Commission having brought down a national wage increase-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! It being 10.30 p.m., under sessional order, I put the question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate do now adjourn.</PARA>
<PARA>Many honourable senators will be aware that during the recess Mr Tom McIntosh, a long serving member of the Senate staff, passed away. Tom McIntosh joined the Senate as an attendant in February 1970 and later in the year became the Assistant Transport Officer, a position he held until December 1973. From January 1974 he served in the Records Office and remained there holding a variety of positions until his untimely death on 15 January 1982. Tom also served the Senate and the Parliament when he worked in the Government Printing Office for a number of years prior to joining the Senate. Over those many years Tom McIntosh served the Senate well.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that he was held in the highest regard by many honourable senators, not only for his devotion to his work, but for his particular expertise in the area of tabled papers and the Parliamentary Papers Series, an area in which he was widely renowned as the parliamentary expert. He endeared himself to his many friends in the Senate and other areas of Parliament House by his straight forward approach, good humour and his willingness to help. Such qualities in these days are all too rare.</PARA>
<PARA> Tom is survived by his wife Cynthia and his five daughters. It would be remiss of me not to say that this man was a very devoted husband and father. It is a side of Tom McIntosh which I believe is not well known by honourable senators but is one which is respected and admired by his many close friends. Tom McIntosh will be sadly missed by this chamber and those who had the privilege to work with him in this building. I again express to Mrs McIntosh and her family my deepest and sincere sympathy on Tom McIntosh's death.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Mr President, personally, and on behalf of Government senators, I join with you in extending sympathy to Mrs Cynthia McIntosh and Tom McIntosh's five daughters. Like youself, Sir, and like so many of us who have been here for quite a while, we knew and, I think it is not too extravagant to say, were fond of Tom McIntosh. He was a man who gave affection and therefore he attracted our affection. Therefore, it is doubly sad. So often this Parliament is depicted to the people outside by those of us who are in the front line and those who make the noise day by day. However there are people like Tom who give to the Parliament and to the parliamentary institution a type of service that is essential to the running of the parliamentary system. I want his family to know that, in his untimely death, we too have lost a very valued friend and the Parliament has lost a very fine and dedicated officer. His death, of course, was , as I have said, quite untimely and sad for us all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like most honourable senators who came into the Senate about the time that I did, I first came across Tom McIntosh when he held the position of Assistant Transport Officer. Most of us, I think, will remember him for that and for the tremendous service that he gave us so cheerfully. Somehow or other with that intuition that only transport officers have, he knew how the Senate was going to run, what time and how it would finish and where we were all going, and ahead of us all he was able to offer that kind of service. There is not one of us here who will not remember him with deep gratitude and affection for that. He will be remembered by us for the cheerfulness he always showed to us at Parliament House or at Canberra Airport when greeting or farewelling us. </PARA>
<PARA> After he went to the Records Office I did not have as much contact with him although occasionally I did. However, I am well aware that he served there very well indeed. He was a man who, as you have said, Mr President, was very devoted to his family and his death will be a great personal loss to them. In expressing sympathy to his family, I hope that the knowledge that there are many of us who are trying to share their sense of grief may help them to carry the burden a little. The gentleness that time does have will soften the blow for them, but we will nevertheless retain in enduring fashion the memory of a man whom we were proud to walk alongside and call a friend. </PARA>

As the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) pointed out, Tom was then the assistant transport officer to our late esteemed friend Wally Lee. Tom went to the Records Office in 1974 and continued to serve the Senate in a loyal and competent manner until his illness forced him to seek hospitalisation late last year. Whilst Tom suffered for a long time he never portrayed that suffering to his many friends in this place. It came as a great surprise to many of us to know that Tom had a terminal illness. Tom always gave his service to us in the most cheerful manner that one could expect-I looked upon him as a personal friend. He will long be remembered by us all. I want to associate my Party colleagues with the remarks of you, Mr President, and the Leader of the Government in the Senate and to extend sincere sympathy to Mrs McIntosh and her family. We will long remember Tom McIntosh for the work he did in this place. I am told that he was just as cheerful in the work he did outside the Parliament for many organisations.

That was the first time I had heard of Tom McIntosh's untimely death. We all offer our sympathy to his wife and his daughters. Nothing we can say can ever lessen the sadness that they must feel. I first met Tom when I came to this place alone in 1978. He, together with other Senate officers, was particularly kind to me.

His quiet persuasion, his gentleness, his friendliness and a whole host of magnificent personal characteristics made him quite a special person around here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to associate myself with these expressions of condolence. I did not know the late Tom McIntosh's wife or his daughters but I did know Tom. I am proud to say that we became firm friends in the time that I have been a member of the Senate. I first met him in mid-1971 after my appointment by the Queensland Government to this chamber. I came to visit Canberra for the first time to get to know something about Parliament House and its workings. At that time Tom was working with the late Wally Lee in the transport office.

It did not matter what information or what help I needed, I knew Tom would do it because he was that kind of person-cheerful and helpful. To me he was a very close and dear friend.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is difficult at such a time in the adjournment debate to raise other matters. We all mourn the death of this good and kindly man but as he would know things must go on and I will go on to another subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From time to time in a world when death and oppression are far too common, when the abuse of civil liberties and freedom is also very common, an event occurs which concentrates our attention on the injustices and abuses which occur in particular regions of the world. Such an occasion, I believe, was the death on 5 February, this month, in a cell at the security police headquarters in Johannesburg, South Africa, of Dr Neil Aggett, the Transvaal Secretary of the African Food and Canning Workers Union. At various times the Senate has discussed such examples of collective oppression as the invasion of Afghanistan and East Timor, the present events in Poland, the abuses by the Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea and the Pinochet regime in Chile, the suppression of civil rights in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in El Salvador and individual cases like the death of Steve Biko in South Africa and the farcical trial of Kim Dae Jung in South Korea. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate, I believe, that some reference should be made to the life and death of Dr Aggett. Neil Aggett was 28 years old when he died. He trained as a medical practitioner. He gave up medicine to become an official and later Transvaal Secretary of the African Food and Canning Workers Union, a union of mixed races but predominantly a black union and one of South Africa's oldest free trade unions. He was one of those courageous white South Africans willing to work in a hostile environment for the principles of free trade unionism and against the oppression of the black majority in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> On Friday 5 February he died, apparently by hanging, in his cell where he was in solitary confinement. He had been detained in November last along with other trade union officials, students and church leaders in a round up of what the South African Government authorities considered to be subversives. At first he was detained under the General Law Amendment Act in South Africa which authorises detention without trial for 14 days and then, as is the usual practice in that country, he was detained under the Terrorism Act which allows indefinite detention. He had not been charged. No trial date was notified. He was allowed no visitors. Neither his parents nor any of the parents of the others who were detained at the same time with him could find out anything about the reasons for his detention. His best friend, also a doctor, who was also detained was not permitted to attend the funeral. </PARA>
<PARA> His was the forty-sixth death in detention in police custody in South Africa since 1963. He was the first white person to die in custody in this way. The authorities' initial claim was that he committed suicide. His friends and his medical colleagues either doubt or do not believe this story-not an unreasonable attitude in view of the history of deception and outright lies in previous cases by the security police in South Africa, in particular, in the more recent case of Steve Biko, the one which has recently received the most publicity. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the ruling group in South Africa-of course white, predominantly Afrikaans-claim to be devout Christians. They use their religion to justify the suppression of the majority and their racial theories of apartheid. They claim that the country is a democracy yet they deny the majority the vote or any share in power. They claim a system based on the rule of law but they allow detention and arrest without charge or trial. They permit the cover up of abuses of civil rights and even death as demonstrated in the Biko case. Like all authoritarian regimes they refuse to allow the operation of free trade unions. It is in this atmosphere that Neil Aggett became a trade union official rather than enjoy the benefits of medical practice in that country. He advocated openly for the disenfrachised and the oppressed in the country, for the freedom to vote and to join in free association in trade unions which we in this country take for granted. I believe it is to our disgrace that so many in this place defend and support the regime which exists in South Africa and claim that it represents a bastion of freedom on the African continent and in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironical that Neil Aggett was, in fact, a doctor. His profession in South Africa emerged from the investigations into Steve Biko's death with a tarnished reputation. The doctors have accepted that they can be overruled by the security police when treating patients. The South African Medical Association will not take responsibility for what happened or make any meaningful investigation into what happened, hiding behind legalistic barriers rather than asserting its moral responsibility in this matter. The medical faculty at Dr Aggett's own university , Witwatersrand, has asserted that the Biko affair resulted in a cover up. The profession as a whole has collectively washed its hands of this disgraceful affair. Its members are in disgrace. One wonders what they, in fact, will do now that one of their own colleagues has suffered from this system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The medical examiners let the country down. The medical examiners refused to testify in the investigations. The South African Medical Association accepted the fact that the medical profession in that country in dealing with people in custody is secondary to the security police. I think it is a shame quite frankly, Senator Baume, that the organisation that you belong to and that I used to belong to has not taken a greater stand on this matter than it has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr Aggett was allegedly found hanged in his cell. His death was quite clearly either murder or suicide and his friends, as I have said, believe it was murder. Whatever the cause, he is quite clearly the victim of a system which is designed to crush ruthlessly all opposition in the name, ironically, of democracy and Christianity. If he indeed committed suicide what sort of a system is it which drives a young man, well educated, in good health, motivated by high ideals, to take his own life after three months detention? I quote the lawyers for human rights in South Africa, who stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Even if it is found that Dr Aggett took his own life as claimed the question remains: what makes death preferable to detention? Detention without trial and in solitary confinement is a cruel and inhuman punishment. No effective safeguards can or will be found to prevent its abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>This man was placed in solitary confinement for activities conducted openly and considered normal in any free country. If he was murdered we will probably never know. If it, in fact, was suicide it is a disgrace in any community considered to be civilised that he should have reached such a desperate state and, I suppose one can say, particularly in such a short time. His death, of course, has resulted in widespread criticism inside and outside South Africa. The Federation of South African Trade Unions and the Trade Union Council of South Africa have protested and, almost unprecedented in South Africa, wide strikes resulted from his death. At his funeral, the Cathedral, the streets and the cemetery were packed with people and the emotional scenes, the desperation, the frustration and the defiance of those present, as could be seen in the brief television screenings that we saw here, demonstrated quite obviously the feelings of those present. Some good may come of his death. The other detainees who were picked up at the same time as he was were, for the first time after his death, allowed visits from their parents and other relatives. The trade union movement in South Africa was temporarily united. Unfortunately though the courageous Press in South Africa, limited in its operations, will be further restricted by legislation pending in the South African Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We may not get full reports of just what has happened in this case and even in subsequent cases. It is to be hoped that those courageous South African citizens , black, coloured or white who are willing to take on the oppressors in the Nationalist Party, the Broederband, the security police and other organisations in that country will not be disheartened by what has happened, but, in fact, inspired and assisted. It is to be hoped that those apologists for this regime in this country will rethink their position. Dr Neil Aggett was a brave, dedicated idealistic man willing to live up to his beliefs in a way that few of us, I might suggest, are willing to do. He is a reminder to us all that it is due to such people that freedom survives throughout the world. That the Australian Government chose to make no statement about the matter is disappointing. One can quote from many articles and editorials written in this country and other countries after his death. I will quote from only one, the Melbourne Herald of 15 February, a paper I suppose that is not often quoted from my side of the Parliament. It states in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Aggett's death and the funeral demonstration speak of both hope and hopelessness. Hope can be seen in the way that he, and many other whites, have defied evil at personal risk. Little hope can be found, on the other hand, that the rigidity at the heart of the white controllers of the nation is softening. A crackdown on the remaining freedoms of the English-language media is in the air. South Africa is defiant on Namibia, agressive in Angola. Can no international action really confront the arrogant Afrikaners?</PARA>
<PARA>I raise this matter merely because I think it is important that an incident like this, which has aroused such international interest and has drawn, once again, our attention to the oppressive situation in South Africa should be on the records of this Parliament. I hope the fact that it is on the records and the fact that it has happened will make those who I mentioned before who are repeated apologists of what happens in South Africa think again and re-look at the situation so that this country at least can be united against the sort of oppression which occurs there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter related to the subject of assisted migration from the United Kingdom to Australia. I understand that no money is available at present to bring out those migrants who have been selected under the assisted migrant program. The fact that money is not available has raised a number of problems. I want to make a suggestion which might assist to overcome some of the problems which have been raised in this area. I would like to illustrate with the case of a boilermaker-welder from Jersey in the Channel Islands. This gentleman is a married man with two children who has relatives in Australia and who was selected last year to come to Australia. I will read extracts from a letter from the Australian High Commission in London to him. The letter reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to inform you that your application for an assisted passage to Australia has been approved. This is on the basis of your going to the State of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> As you are aware, the Australian Government has already announced the cessation of the Assisted Passages Scheme. However, approved applicants may receive the benefit of assisted passage provided they travel before 30th June 1982. In view of this decision I would encourage you to commence finalising your affairs so that you will be able to depart promptly once you have been notified of a firm travel date. </PARA>
<PARA>This letter was sent from the United Kingdom to Australia. On the back of the letter the wife of the gentleman concerned wrote to her relatives in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA>We phoned movements section-</PARA>
<PARA>Movements section being part of the Australian High Commission Office-</PARA>
<PARA>because we couldn't finalise any plans as our accommodation was tied with George 's job-they then told us by phone to give notice and return to U.K. to be ready for our firm date. </PARA>
<PARA>On the basis of this written and oral advice the gentleman concerned gave up his job, spent Christmas with his family in Clydeside and converted his assets, furniture and so on, into cash ready to come to Australia. He was then advised that no money was available but that it might be available some time in 1983. We have a situation where the gentleman finds himself with no job and no prospect of employment. Clydebank, where he was living at the time, has one of the highest unemployment rates in Britain. No accommodation was available to him because, of course, the accommodation that he had was associated with his previous job and he has relinquished that job. His relatives, with whom he was living over the Christmas period, were not able to accommodate him, his wife and two children because of a scarcity of accommodation. He then found that the small amount of capital that he had built up to come to Australia through the sale of his effects and what he had accumulated in his work time was being dissipated supplementing his dole payments. So he decided to pay his own fare and come to Australia. The problem is that he will not be reimbursed. The money which should have been made available now will not be paid to him. So he has spent his savings and his accumulated capital coming to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I will not make any comment about the situation where people are selected, told to give up their job and then dumped. A government which does this sort of thing needs to look to its own conscience. I simply ask that the money which he has paid out should be reimbursed to him when money is available. It is quite clear that we must have wanted him to come in the first place because we selected him. We were prepared to make money available to assist him to come to Australia. So the problem which he faces at present was created by government bungling and mismanagement. We made a commitment to this family both in writing and verbally, and we should keep that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject the argument that if he has the money he ought to pay his own fare. It is quite clear that the man did not have sufficient money to come originally; otherwise he would not have been granted an assisted passage. He made up the money with which he was able to pay his fare by selling off those assets which he had accumulated in the way of furniture for his house and savings that he had . This money would have been needed to set himself up in Australia and to replace those things which he sold in the United Kingdom to come to Australia. Of course, if the money were to be spent it would be spent in Australia and would not go outside. But that is not the point. I think it is a matter of principle and fair play. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to consider agreeing to a refund in this case and the other few cases where assisted migration has been promised. We created this problem-'we' being the people of Australia. Let us keep our credibility as a nation. We should not make a commitment, involve people in changes to their lifestyle, promise them things and then leave them in the lurch. I request the Minister to refer this recommendation to the responsible Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At 1.35 in the morning of 26 November before this Parliament rose for the Christmas recess I made a plea to Senator Sir John Carrick concerning the new Special Humanitarian Program for members of minority groups. I asked him to endeavour to give reasonable priority to the people in Latin America, particularly people from the Argentine, Chile, Uruguay and Bolivia which have military dictatorships. I did so at that stage because there was a degree of hope on the ramifications of the program. That program was spelt out in detail in Settlement News No. 12 of December 1981. People say that a fortnight can be a long time in politics. I suppose that between November and mid-February a lot can happen in countries in which dictatorships prevail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Grimes referred to the excesses of the South African Government. We could apply what he said with equal force to Latin American countries operating under dictatorships. As a matter of fact, my Victorian colleague, Senator Primmer, tonight when dealing with our refugee intake made the same comment. In saying that I am fortified with a communication from the Committee of Solidarity with the Uruguayan people. The letter deals with certain obligations Australia has undertaken. Incidentally, I anticipated that Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle would be in the chamber tonight. I showed this to her today because of what I thought were foreign affairs ramifications. Mr President, I seek leave to have that document incorporated in Hansard. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, is in the chamber. I will not seek leave immediately but will wait until the Minister has looked at the document. The substance of it is that it is claimed that the Australian Government decided to grant 50 visas to Latin American political refugees who were in a camp near Rio de Janeiro, that camp being under the protection of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The communication, which is in the hands of the Minister, indicates that we have been very dilatory in implementing that decision. Mr President, the Minister has indicated his agreement to the incorporation of the document, so I formally seek leave to have the letter, addressed to me from the Committee of Solidarity with the Uruguayan People, incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator,</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government recently decided to grant 50 visas to Latin American political refugees for humanitarian reasons. Our organization, (C.O.S.P.U.) received a letter from the Committee of Latin American Political Refugees in Transit, based in Rio de Janeiro, asking for information and help. The people for whom this Committee was formed come from various Latin American countries and are at present in a transit camp in Rio de Janeiro under the protection of the United Nations High Commission of Refugees. Protection must be stressed, for it must be remembered that they are political refugees. They are not only under threat in their countries of origin but also by the efficient, co-ordination of military security forces in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Their economic situation is desperate and added to this must be all the problems and traumas of what can only be described as 'unstable status.'</PARA>
<PARA> According to our present information no visas have yet been granted, four have already been rejected for reasons unknown to us. Two more people have applied to come to Australia with their families, they have been waiting several months for an answer to their applications. </PARA>
<PARA> We were elated to hear of the Australian Government's decision, we are now puzzled by their lack of action and clarity in regard to those refugees. These people are not simply numbers on a file but men, women and children who desperately need assistance-now!</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that, with Canada and the USA, we have more than met our obligations under our refugee program. I know that there are tremendous pressures. I know that in any country's immigration policy, particularly our own , it is one component that has to be evaluated against the others, including the normal family reunion and job category components. But I do echo the sentiments of Senator Primmer. I believe that on a numerical basis our intake from Latin America has been relatively small. In the light of what is contended by our Uruguayan colleagues, I appeal for a response in the near future from our appropriate representatives in Brazil or one of the adjacent embassies on why we have been so slow in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I concede that the United States experienced difficulties. I know also from the days of Foreign Minister Willesee that sometimes some governments are inclined to produce people who do not meet the refugee criteria. They can be, to say the least, odd people. But I know enough about the Uruguayan community in Sydney to make this appeal. It is buttressed by Senator Primmer's experience in Victoria. They are putting up a case for our meeting the request of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees concerning Uruguay. It is not the only country with which some of us have had difficulties. Bolivia is another. I suppose it is a case of the harvest being great and the labours few. Even there, with the aid of a number of unions in Sydney, we were successful with some neo-refugee problems when it took quite a while to get out families of trade unions and university activists. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that appeal as an external obligation. I say that deliberately because I have had further overtures from the Uruguayan community in Sydney, which expressed quite a reasonable complaint that, when many of them go back to their homeland or place of birth, if you like, to visit relatives and they have with them children who were born out here and have Australian passports, Uruguayan officials are not above sneering and talking about 'your foreigner children'. At this time of night I am not going to get into the matter of dual nationality. I think it is fitting that Senator Gareth Evans is in the chamber when I am speaking about this matter because last year he sounded the tocsin and asked why we do not chastise more vigorously Latin American ambassadors here when there are proven examples of torture and of a complete cessation of civil liberties. I simply say tonight that we could do no worse than ask our Department of Foreign Affairs or, if necessary, the Minister himself, the Honourable Anthony Street, to ask the Uruguayan Ambassador to Australia whether people born here of Uruguayan parents are going back to Uruguay and being subjected to sneers and jibes. I know that if that were to happen in countries in Eastern Europe there would be a lot of protest. I accept that there should be such protest. But I like to be even-handed and I would like that aspect to be investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on a more serious note. This communication that I have contained the assertion that a Mr Lemos, who was a member of repressive forces in Uruguay, came to Australia in 1971 and is working as a security officer at the Kelloggs Cornflakes plant in Botany in New South Wales. Again, the complaint is made by these people of Uruguayan origin in Australia that when they do visit their homeland there seems to be a sort of unhealthy interest in or knowledge, if one likes, of whether they have been to El Salvadorian, Nigerian or Chilean functions, countries which are not very favourably disposed, and rightly so, towards these military dictatorships. There is a sort of civilian ring. They claim that a Mr Lemos, who is security officer at the Kelloggs Cornflakes factory in Botany, New South Wales, apparently has plenty of time to carry out surveillance of these people as a form of intimidation. As honourable senators know, I am one of those who believe in the retention of a federal law enforcement agency. I accept the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation if it has an even-handed policy. On the question of our intake of political refugees, this may be a matter for the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee), but I would also like to believe that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) will confer with the current chief of ASIO and find out about Mr Lemos. I have discussed this matter with a number of Latin-American members of the Mill Employees Union-I hasten to add that Mr Lemos is not a member of that union but a security officer at Kelloggs-and while one of the officials I spoke to, who was a fairly broad-minded man, did not say outright that Mr Lemos may be involved in spying on people of Uruguayan origin, he did say: 'Well, he is certainly an arrogant man'. </PARA>
<PARA> In review of the assertions made by members of the Uruguan community, I do not want to see another Srecko Rover incident. We all know that he was a Pavelic supporter. He still resides in Victoria. The Townley Committee was a very powerful committee. It had as members the now Mr Justice James McClelland, a leading newspaperman, the then Senator John Wheeldon, and other senators to whom I am too modest to refer. But I point out that it had as a member the Commonwealth Attorney-General. I will not say who the other two senators were but Senator Evans would have a shrewd idea. That committee probed the circumstances surrounding Srecko Rover. He would not come before the Committee. I do not want this neo-fascist from Uruguay, Mr Lemos, to be denied proper supervision. I have checked the electoral roll and I cannot locate him as a resident of the Grayndler electorate. I suspect that he has been denied citizenship or is not game to claim it. </PARA>
<PARA> I expect our Federal agencies to investigate how this man got here and whether he is involved in neo-fascist activities. Many of our people of Latin-American origin believe in the land of the Southern Cross, a land where there is freedom, the Eureka Stockade concept and all the rest of it. I believe that some of these ex-security officers still think they are in Latin-American dictatorship countries and they are prostituting their position in this country. I hope that the question of our obligation to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will be taken up and that the Attorney-General will have an early talk with ASIO to see whether it will visit the Kelloggs factory. I am not namby- pamby about this because whether we are dealing with 'the Skull', a native born fascist, or this person, such people should be interrogated to see just what their political track record is. I know that on occasions Senator Baume has shared my views about getting rid of fascist creatures like this man and I hope that, if necessary, he will even enlist the services of the New South Wales Special Branch to get rid of this person Lemos who is terrorising members of the Mill Employees Union because he happens to be a company security officer at Kelloggs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, tonight I wish to raise a matter which comes in part within your jurisdiction and control. I refer to the Bills Digest Information Service which, since its inception, has been a most valuable service provided to senators and members by the research service of the Parliamentary Library. Yesterday I received from the Library's research service copies of digests and indexes of quite a number of Bills but could find no digest of the Institute of Freshwater Studies Bill 1981, introduced in the House of Representatives by the honourable member for Hawker, Mr Jacobi, on 4 June 1981, or of an identical Bill introduced by me in the Senate on 9 June. This Bill is a most important one and a digest of it would have been most helpful to those senators and members not fully acquainted with its purpose. The fact that this Bill had not appeared in the digest prompted me to look further through the documents I received yesterday. Much to my surprise, I found 12 other Bills which had received a mention but with a statement attached, under the heading ' Short Digest of Bill', stating:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Owing to time constraints a Bills Digest was not prepared. </PARA>
<PARA>Eight of those Bills were non-Government Bills and four were Government Bills introduced in the other place by Ministers. On making further inquiries as to the reason for the lack of digests for these Bills I was able to ascertain that the Library's research section is under very severe constraints due to staff restrictions, further aggravated by resignations, brought about by the actions of this Government which, to put it bluntly, is trying-it now appears to be succeeding-to restrict the library services available to back bench members of Parliament to a degree which will prevent each and every one of us, particularly Opposition members, from carrying out our duties in the interests of the people who send us here. Library staff have a reputation of having given excellent service to members in the past. One wonders how much longer this standard of service can continue, given the actions of this Government. I place on record now that we on this side of the Chamber will not be blaming Library staff for the breakdown in the excellent service we have come to expect and have always received. The Government must take full responsibility for the breakdown which is occurring and which is evidenced by the matters I have cited this evening in respect of the Bills digest. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask you, Mr President, to take every action possible to ensure that sufficient staff and funds are provided to the Library's research service to enable that service to be maintained at the high standard provided in the past. I understand from my inquiries today that a submission has been made setting out the problems that confront the research service and that in this submission suggestions are made as to the necessary remedies to overcome the problems that are growing greater day by day. I further ask you to ensure that the submission is made available to all honourable senators at the earliest opportunity to allow us to be fully acquainted with the problems now being experienced in the Library. I await your early reply to my request. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no wish to detain the Senate for more than a few minutes at this very late hour but I do wish to put on the record some additional information about a matter which has attracted a fairly lively degree of attention in the last few days and which does also raise a couple of important matters of principle. Last Friday, from around 11.30 p.m. until the early hours of Saturday morning, a major series of raids was conducted on 53 Melbourne massage parlours by a task force comprising some 120 members of the Australian Federal Police, the Victoria Police and officials of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, all acting under the direction of the Australian Federal Police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The centrepiece of that raid and the part of it which attracted the media attention of which I have been and will again be critical tonight involved a group of approximately 30 massage parlours in a single block off St Kilda Road which was cordoned off for this purpose. The object of the police raid involved an attempt to break what on any view sounds like a rather nasty immigration vice racket, allegedly involving South American and Asian women illegally entering the country and being employed at sub-standard wages-if that is the appropriate terminology for this industry-for their activities. In the result some six people were arrested and charged. Some 27 people had been held on suspicion or held for questioning early on, to employ the favoured police euphemism in this respect, but only six people in the event were charged. </PARA>
<PARA> So far perhaps so good. Prostitution is a sordid business at the best of times particularly when it is linked, as it so often is, with drug taking and, as was apparently potentially the case here, with organised crime. It is no less sordid when it is conducted in the glittering environment of Melbourne's massage parlour row. Certainly there can be no objection, and I make no objection, to a police raid with the objective I have mentioned carried out efficiently, expeditiously, fairly and with no unnecessary drama. But that is not what happened last Friday night. What we had instead of a raid conducted in those circumstances is something that is perhaps better described as a tasteless media orgy laid out in all its splendour not only in some Saturday newspaper reports but more particularly on Saturday night television in the reports of most channels, I think, certainly including the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The television coverage to which I refer took the form essentially of quite extensive film of those emerging from the parlours in question as the police entered the premises one by one and having to run the gauntlet of police and television camera floodlights with a rapidly growing crowd of jeering onlookers, no doubt attracted by the flurry of activity in St Kilda Road. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A grand final atmosphere.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, it was. One might put it that way. The operation, which was rather aptly codenamed Butcher, was carried out, I suggest, with a quite spectacular disregard for the dignity and privacy of those caught, sometimes literally, with their pants down in these circumstances. I acknowledge that the initial disposition of many of those who perhaps witnessed this television coverage may well have been to chortle at the acute and obvious discomfort of the people involved in the television coverage in this way. But I also suggest that the reaction of anyone with any sensitivity at all after that perhaps initial reaction would have been one of fairly profound distaste for the nature of the media coverage which was thus being generated. A number of the faces and figures on the screen would have been undoubtedly quite recognisable to those who knew them and perhaps had no knowledge of the nature of the profession or business in which they were involved or, in the case of the clients in question who happened to be caught up in this of the nature of their behaviour on that particular night. There is, of course, a potential for profound embarrassment not only for the individuals themselves but also, in some cases, for quite innocent members of the family-children at school and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of those caught up in this particular extravaganza clearly were committing no crime-certainly not one for which they were being pursued or with which they were in fact charged on the night in question. I believe it is quite indefensible to expose those individuals, whatever one thinks of their moral behaviour, to contempt and ridicule of this kind. I make that point quite seriously. I do so also in the context, as far as the media is concerned, of the continuing, indeed growing, debate that is emerging in the community as to the desirability or otherwise of privacy protective legislation being passed by parliaments around the nation. We are constantly being told that such legislation is not only potentially dangerous as an intrusion on media freedom but also unnecessary because the media can be relied upon to exercise a degree of self-regulation and self-restraint in these sorts of circumstances. I fear that the media coverage, particularly the television coverage, of Friday night's affair was a spectacular counter-example. So much for the role of the media. </PARA>
<PARA> Might I have also a word or two about the role of the police in this matter, which does appear to leave something to be desired. What I suggest is that this lapse of media taste-if it might be so described-was made worse by the fact that it was, on my reliable information, deliberately set up and orchestrated by the Australian Federal Police through its director of information, Mr Gregson Edwards. It appears that early on the Friday night Mr Edwards arranged for all radio stations, television stations and newspapers in question to be informed of the impending raid through Australian Associated Press telex. Radio and television crews were singled out for specific invitation and a rendezvous outside the St Kilda Road barracks was, in fact, specified. Reporters and camera crews were asked to await the arrival of Mr Edwards personally who would appear in a car numbered ZUD 218 at around 11.30 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told reliably that Mr Edwards duly arrived at the appointed time, handed out background briefing sheets, directed the television and other crews to the scene of the action and ferried at least one reporter around from vantage point to vantage point. What could have been and undoubtedly would have been, without the manipulation of the impresario Mr Edwards, a perfectly efficient and expeditious as well as justifiable police exercise, was converted-it seems to me as a result of that intervention and orchestration-into something that can be described only as a raunchy circus. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that our police forces appreciated that respect for them and their work depends upon the quiet, efficient and fair performance of their proper functions and not the manipulation of privacy-invading extravaganzas that I believe would be out of place even on most American television crime shows. If the police want to claim, as they do, that respect for civil liberties is part of their way of operational life-thus making legislation like the impending Criminal Investigation Bill unnecessary-I suggest that they will have to demonstrate in the future a lot more sensitivity than was shown on this occasion . </PARA>

Senator Robertson raised a matter and asked that a suggestion be passed on to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In due course. I will certainly undertake that task for the honourable senator. It might also assist if he were able to supply the name and file number by way of letter to the Minister in case there are any matters in relation to this case requiring attention from the Minister. Several matters were raised by Senator Mulvihill. He spoke of a program of admission for minority groups under refugee programs, the question of whether certain people who had entered were appropriate migrants and whether some of them were engaging in inappropriate political activity. It seems that the appropriate course is to refer his remarks to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street)-I think there was a foreign affairs aspect- and also to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) as he requested on the other matter. I will undertake to refer his remarks to those three Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans raised a matter which I heard him raise first on a morning radio program a couple of days ago. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) is aware of the matter and he has already expressed his concern about the incident. He has also called for a full report on the matter and he may be in a position at a later time to confirm, deny or amend some of the details which have come out. I would agree with Senator Evans that it is not a question of whether it is desirable to stop the practices, but the process of the law and the role of the media are matters of concern. I understand that Senator Evans has a particular concern about the action of the Director of Police Information. He has raised that concern tonight. For my part I am at a loss to know why radio and television cover is even desirable when this kind of raid or activity takes place. This matter will be referred to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman). I know that he is interested in it. I am authorised to say that he has expressed his concern and he is looking into the matter now. I say this not in any critical way, but had I had some notice I might have been able to get more information. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes raised a matter concerning the death of Dr Neil Aggett. I am reminded when I talk to my own rabbi that he has a fairly marked South African accent. Sometimes we ask him: 'Why did you leave South Africa?'. His reason is that the final straw came when the security police visited him the day after he delivered one of his Yom Kippur sermons. He thought that if giving a sermon was going to mean a visit from the security police it was time to leave the country. Let me say that he has been a gain to Australia. We have had a number of gains from South Africa, a number of refugees. I am reminded of Irving Frankel, a jurist who appeared for some of the people interned by the South African Government and who is now practising law in this country with distinction. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues of summary arrests, solitary confinement and unexplained and unnatural death are matters which concern us all, as do the other questions Senator Grimes has raised about the proper role of citizens and, in the case he raised, the role of medical professions in making known their concerns and not being party to certain practices. I am as concerned about the events in South Africa as I think most honourable senators would be. I am also concerned about the events in a whole range of countries of left or right persuasion where these kinds of things are happening. I am concerned about some of the events in Poland . I am concerned about Kampuchea and Chile. I am concerned about the Gulag Archipelago. I believe that Solzhenitsyn was telling the truth. I am concerned about Iran. I am concerned about Idi Amin's Uganda. I am concerned about the matters raised by Senator Mulvihill a little while ago. It does not seem to matter which country it is; it does not really help for people on one or the other side of politics-I am not suggesting that Senator Grimes did this; my remark would apply to anyone-to pick one example. All examples are thoroughly reprehensible. I would like to think that we would pursue in this country our interests in all the people who are improperly arrested. Those who have read the books of Nadine Gordimer will know in a very vivid way some of the things that are going on in South Africa and some of the concerns they give to many people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament of Australia has an Amnesty group. Many honourable senators and members from all sides and members of the staff of the Parliament belong to the Amnesty group and are active in it. I had the honour to be on an Amnesty mission to Indonesia a few years ago together with a leading lawyer and the Chairman of the Council of Churches. What is important about the Amnesty group in the Parliament is that it is quite impartial in relation to the people it tries to sponsor and tries to look after. If we can learn anything from the unfortunate events of recent days and the death of Neil Aggett it is just to have emphasised once again the desperate situation of many people in many countries and, perhaps , to understand the fragility of the freedoms we enjoy in Australia. I will make known Senator Grimes's concern to my ministerial colleagues in case there is anything that they want to add. </PARA>
