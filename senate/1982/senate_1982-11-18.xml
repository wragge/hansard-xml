<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators know from questions I have answered over the last year or so that when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I started off a series of negotiations which involved, on a tripartite basis, the Commonwealth Government, the Northern Territory Government and land councils in the Northern Territory. The object of those negotiations was to develop a set of agreements that would lead to some amendments of land arrangements in the Northern Territory which would operate to the mutual benefit of all parties. The situation that emerged was that, apart from a couple of remaining sticky points, there was a move towards consensus on most of the matters under discussion. At the time I left the portfolio and Mr Wilson succeeded me those remaining issues were being negotiated. Part of the difficulty was that the processes of the Central Land Council made it really quite difficult for it to present a single consensual view on some of the matters which had different implications for different parts of its membership.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am answering the question in my way. I believe the Northern Territory Government had general agreement with the position that was being reached in the negotiations. Certainly, the Commonwealth was trying to get endorsement of what it thought was the position that had been reached in the negotiations between all parties around the table. I have no knowledge of whether Mr Everingham introduced a motion this week in the terms suggested by Senator Ryan but I have no reason to doubt that she is correct. I do not follow the Northern Territory Hansard. If Mr Everingham wanted to get endorsement of the position which had been developed in these negotiations then I must say that I would find it helpful to know that there was endorsement by the Northern Territory legislature. But I cannot say to Senator Ryan that there has been any agreement. An agreement has been sought between all parties with a view to getting an agreed position that would benefit Aboriginals and Territorians generally. While those negotiations are incomplete, I believe that Mr Wilson, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, will do his best to try to seek consensus among the parties with a view to getting those arrangements agreed and promoted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be aware that, publicly and privately, and for some considerable period, I have been pressing the Australian Government to adopt a code of conduct applicable to Australian companies and individuals engaged in or associated with trading in South Africa, which code would involve the reporting of positive efforts taken to improve the economic and social conditions of non-white employees in South Africa. I ask the Minister whether the inquiries which the Australian Government was making to see whether a code could be developed most suitable to apply to Australian trading activities have now been completed. When will the Australian Government advise the Parliament of what action it intends to take to bring Australia into line with Britain and with European and other countries in demonstrating, in a practical sense, our determination to fight apartheid in South Africa?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The question of a possible introduction of a code of conduct for Australian companies engaged in trading with South Africa remains under consideration by the Government. The Minister regrets that it has not been possible to complete inquiries into the matter. It would be appreciated , I am sure, that the question of introducing a code of conduct for Australian companies raises a number of issues requiring extensive investigation and consultation. The Government remains committed to maintaining its total opposition to apartheid and to considering means by which that system can be peacefully changed. I emphasise that the Government has already instituted a range of measures with practical effect which demonstrates its determination to oppose apartheid in South Africa. I think that it is fair to say that we reject any suggestion that there is a need for Australia to come into line with European countries in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two codes of conduct for foreign companies operating in South Africa have been adopted. These are the code for the European Economic Community and the Sullivan principles drawn up for the United States firms. The EEC code puts emphasis on trade union rights, and the Sullivan code puts emphasis on desegregation. They both, however, call for equal pay for equal work and for the abolition of segregation practices. The codes cannot be enforced and are basically statements of intent. Their major shortcoming is that they operate in isolation from the apartheid structure and their effect on helping to reform the apartheid system is possibly limited. As I said earlier, the matter is still under consideration. The Minister notes Senator Missen's interest in it. Any further information will be given to him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Government is seeking to confirm the substance of the article which has been referred to by Senator Hill. If it is verified the Government will consider any implications for Australian trade in the region. China and the Soviet Union held a series of talks in Peking during October. Further talks may be held shortly in Moscow. Both countries recently reaffirmed their desire to improve relations. There has been little indication from either side of the results of the talks so far. Chinese leaders have told the Press that there was no significant progress on major bilateral issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia follows with interest the relationships between China and the Soviet Union. Australia would welcome a reduction in the present level of hostility between the two countries which might contribute to greater stability in the region. However, considerable obstacles remain to a substantial improvement in relations, particularly China's opposition to Soviet strategic policies. China has made it clear that relations can improve only if the Soviet Union changes its policies in Afghanistan and elsewhere.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Education a totally non-party-political question about the drift of children from state schools to independent schools. The Minister would know that since 1976 enrolments in the government school system have declined by one per cent while the level of enrolments in independent schools has increased by a startling 10 per cent. How does the Minister account for this sudden and dramatic change in the confidence of parents in the ability of government schools to provide their children with a good education? As a champion of government schools, may I state some reasons given, upon which I want the Minister to comment, as to why parents are no longer sending their children to state schools: Violence in the playground, teasing and boycotting anyone who departs from the norm, strong peer group pressure to avoid work, belittling of achievement and sidestepping of responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask whether the Minister can comment on the following reasons given for the drift to independent schools: There is a courtesy between all members of the school community in private schools which is not present in state schools; sound subject teaching by teachers who know their subject; a cheerful, sensible, down to earth attitude to the day to day running of the schools, and a stimulating variety of extra-curricular activities which are not present in state schools. Are any of these matters, in the Minister's experience, relevant to this rather alarming drift away from the state school system to the private school system, an area in which many parents must obviously be spending a great many of their discretionary dollars which they cannot afford? They are making the sacrifice to send their children to private schools when free state school education is available to them.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp's question touches on an important matter. I am grateful for the chance to answer it. The first point to make is that the great majority of Australian children, of course, receive their education in government schools. Many of the parents have their children in government schools by choice and by preference. I would not want anyone to lose sight of the fact that the government school system in Australia is extensive and generally is of good quality. In the Australian Capital Territory, in the system which I administer, there is a retention rate of 65 per cent to the end of Year 12, which is the envy of schools around Australia. That is in the government system. The debate has to take place against the background that that is the majority educational milieu for Australian children. It is true that there has been a movement of children to non-government schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two main factors operate. The first one is demographic change. The number of children of school age is diminishing. Already we are finding that enrolments at the primary level are dropping. Although the previous wave of children is still coming through the secondary system, I imagine that enrolments there will also start to decline in a few years. Demographic change will be reflected in school enrolments. Of course, against that there is the other factor to which Senator Chipp referred; that is, that parents in quite considerable numbers are exercising a choice to move their children to non-government schools.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp makes an important point. In making that choice the parents are using discretionary income to back up that choice. They are voting not only with their feet but also with their cheque books. The other point to be made is that most of the schools in the non-government system to which parents send their children are within the Catholic system and most of them by any measure are poorer schools.

I am interested that the President of the Australian Council of State Schools Organisations, who advocates no support for non- government schools, was educated at St Peter's College in Adelaide. One of his vice-presidents from New South Wales was in my class at Sydney Grammar School. Mr Marginson, who works with the Australian Teachers Federation and writes such virulent stuff, was educated at Scotch College. Mr Dawkins, who writes such magnificent stuff, is an old Scotch College boy from Perth. Joan Kirner, who has so much to say about non-government schools, went to a good ladies college in Melbourne.

I am interested in the kind of primeval guilt that some of these people must feel to work against the non-government system. I must also say that some of them are not terribly good advertisements to give one confidence in the non- government system. But to come back to Senator Chipp's point, parental choice must be based on some belief that in the non-government system there are some values or offerings which they like and which they find important.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It relates to a whole lot of things: It relates to some of the matters raised by Senator Chipp; it relates to some of the values taught in those schools; and it relates to a feeling of confidence which parents have in the school environment and in what the school has to offer. I recently made some comments about the undesirability of some teachers federations making formal political allegiance with political parties. One of the things that I was trying to say was that a consequence of that kind of formal political allegiance will be a loss of confidence in the system by parents. Parents want to know that when their children go to school they are going into what is an open and, in political terms, neutral situation. A lot of factors relating to the values taught and the way in which parents perceive the system are leading a number of parents to remove their children from the government system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I come back to the first point. The numbers of children in non-government schools still represent a minority. The percentage is still less than it was in the early 1960s. Since then there has been a loss of children from non-government schools. It is just catching up. The majority of Australian children are in the government school system. For many of them it offers an excellent, appropriate and valued form of education. I would like to keep the argument in proper perspective and say that while we support parental choice and while we support a universal grant for children in non-government systems we do it against that kind of background and with a desire to help all children in all Australian schools.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation is really very simple. I believe it is a matter of equity that the Commonwealth should be moving in the way it is proposing. In past years we have been providing up to 30 per cent of all the capital required for the building of government schools around Australia. That money has been provided by the Commonwealth. This year up to 50 per cent of all the capital funds which will be used in the States will be provided by the Commonwealth. In most States there has been absolutely no recognition of the Commonwealth's contribution or of the Commonwealth's role in the funding of the construction of government schools. It seems to us proper that if we are making a major contribution that fact should be made known publicly and should be clear . That is simply a question of equity and proper public accountability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the approval provision which we are proposing is simply so that we can know which schools are to be built with the money, that proper acknowledgment can be made while those schools are being built that they are joint Commonwealth-State funding efforts and Commonwealth funds are involved, and that if there is an opening ceremony the Commonwealth can in fact at least attend and take part in it. The purpose of seeking approval is to know what those projects will be. The States themselves can select the projects. The only reason we have put in the question of approval is that we would like to make sure that a State does not decide that it will use the Commonwealth funds, say, to upgrade washrooms around the State and build no schools, that in fact a State will put the money into building some of its schools and that it is acknowledged as having been assisted by the Commonwealth. Having said that, we are not out to say to a State that it should build schools here or there; we just want to know what the money is going to be used for. We think that is proper accountability for the use of taxpayers' funds.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's position has been totally clear from the outset. The Government has taken the view that the main cause of inflation and of loss of jobs has been the great upsurge in wages throughout Australia-in the order of 17 per cent or 18 per cent in past months-and that what is needed is a restraint on wages. The Government has held the view that the main costs involved are labour costs, that there is very little profitability in the community today and that, therefore, profitability cannot be a major factor in costs. Indeed, the need to take industry out of a loss situation into a profit situation so that it can continue to employ and to expand is vital. The Government has said from the outset that the States have the constitutional power over prices and charges and, if they so desire, they are welcome to use those powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has always said that inflating the deficit simply to bring about job creation of the leaf scraping variety will solve nothing, and that inflating the deficit will simply create more inflation and more unemployment. The Government has been looking to ways of expanding its transition from school to work programs, its retraining programs and its practical works programs. I repeat: The Budget contains such significant programs as the Bicentennial Roads Program, the airfields construction program and many others. There is no inconsistency in the statements that have been made. The Ministers concerned are carrying out the ordinary policies that the Government indicated in its Budget. The Treasurer indicated today quite clearly that the proposed wage freeze is strictly in accordance with the economic principles that the Government has pursued and intends to continue to pursue. As each day goes by, more and more the public commentaries are in favour of what the Government is doing. More and more sections of the community, and virtually every responsible newspaper in Australia, are saying that what the Government is doing is right.

<PARA> If you place the priority on maintaining the real wage gains of the past as Mr Crean does by default you make the unemployed bear the whole cost of the recession. If you place priority on maintaining jobs and are prepared to let real wages slide for a while, as Mr Halfpenny seems to do, you spread the costs of the recession around and minimise the human tragedy of workers finding themselves unwanted. One man's pay rise is less important than another man's job .</PARA>
<PARA>Where have I heard that before? That is from the Age. Newspaper after newspaper now is saying that what we are doing has a fundamental common sense about it. Virtually every newspaper in Australia has said that what Mr Hayden is advocating is disaster. Let me read what the Age newspaper said on this, because I am invited to do so by members of the Labor Party:</PARA>
<PARA> And in all the twists and turns that Mr Hayden's economics have undergone since he won esteem as Treasurer in 1975, the one constant appears to be a belief that the voters can be fooled, that the hard options can be fobbed of, and that it is unnecessary for a party preparing for government to have a credible economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA>Need I, in fact, read what the Australian Financial Review said of his policy? It states:</PARA>
<PARA> This leaves the Labor Party with a fiscal program which promises nothing but unemployment and inflation on a larger scale than we have now, and the prospect of further involuntary devaluations of the Australian dollar as we are locked into a devaluation/inflation spiral.</PARA>
<PARA>What we have at this moment is more and more members of the community saying: ' Yes, it is necessary to get wage restraint. We do not want one man's wage rise to be another man's loss of a job. We want to have costs down for the future. We want Australians to move together in a consensus'. It is a tragic thing for Australia that the Labor Party refuses to be part of the consensus, refuses to do the one thing that is now being generally acclaimed. It is now generally acclaimed throughout Australia that we must bear down on wages if we are to succeed in overcoming our problems. It is a tragedy that a party whose own economic policies have been condemned by every major newspaper in Australia--</PARA>

<PARA> Mr Hayden's own recipe for economic survival-by stimulating spending through tax cuts or higher benefits, by increased capital works spending, by freezing State government charges, by capital grants to provide jobs and by maintaining real wages-is unrealistically expansionary in the present climate.

The fact is that every responsible commentator in Australia has said that what Labor is offering is as wrong as can be, that it would create more unemployment and more inflation. They are all saying that the Labor Party ought to get behind the aims of ordinary Australians. I make a plea to the Labor Party to put aside its partisanship in this situation.

Senator Gietzelt asked me two things. He asked me whether the comment on price surveillance was a departure from Government policy and whether the comment of Mr Macphee, in terms of jobs, was a departure from Government policy. I answered in both cases: 'No, it was not'. I said that the Government had made its main thrust on wages because of its conviction that they are the major ingredient of costs today; that it has an understanding that constitutionally the States have the powers to co-operate together in price surveillance or control; and that the Commonwealth Government has been looking towards the money which would be saved by the Commonwealth, the States and local government-an amount of about $700m-being directed towards public works which could re-employ people. The billions of dollars saved by a consensus from the general population and from commerce and industry could also steady down unemployment and create re-employment. There is no inconsistency whatsoever in the policies. They are the same policies as we announced before.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague's question is a vital one in the face of the fact that Australia, particularly the two eastern States of Victoria and New South Wales, is facing a drought which is potentially the worst on record. Very comprehensive temporary measures are being advanced by the Commonwealth Government, which are being criticised by the Australian Labor Party, to mitigate the effects of the drought and to preserve stocks, particularly the breeding stocks. Those measures are being taken in the short term. In the longer term, of course, it is necessary to ensure that all water in this most arid continent should be used to its best advantage. I announced several days ago the formation of the National Water Research Council, a body which has been approved and recommended by the Australian Water Resources Council, which is the Council of Ministers of the States and the Commonwealth. I announced its formation and its composition of some very well-equipped Australians to undertake a task similar to that which is undertaken in the energy field by the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council. That has been widely acclaimed as a major step forward.</PARA></TALK.START>

I announced that the study on the water perspective of Australia for the year 2000 was progressing speedily and I hoped a report would be available in April. In addition, in the last Budget there was an increase of some 28 per cent in the money put aside for national water resources by the Commonwealth, in conjunction with the States on a dollar for dollar basis. We regard water conservation-the control of water both in terms of quality and quantity-as the major resource issue in Australia today. We will continue so to do.</PARA>

Further, will doctors, lawyers, dentists and other professional and business enterprises also be asked to freeze their fees?

Secondly, we must reach outwards -as we are already doing-to commerce and industry and ask for co-operation. We will be looking everywhere for that kind of restraint. That will apply to professional people who make charges. There is always in this place a tendency to cite doctors as evil.

In the recent Budget we brought down a package of relief by way of tax cuts, increased family allowance, interest subsidy on homes and a whole range of other actions. These measures represent, in a net sense after tax, a gain in real wages of some $17 to $20 a week. That is our recognition that the wage earners have extra burdens to bear.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme is, as its name describes, a subsidy on freight costs of petroleum products. It is a fact that there has been a recent change to the system which means that freight costs are now subsidised to a differential of one cent instead of 0.44c per litre, as was the case previously. So there has been a reduction in the degree of subsidisation with the differential now standing at one cent instead of 0.44c. That review was undertaken by the Government because the scheme was proving to be ever more costly. There was a cost last year of $147m as against a Budget estimate of $129m and there were also certain problems of abuse in the system. It is clear from the experience all of us have had around Australia-this reflects the interjections made during the course of the question-that despite that freight subsidy scheme variations do exist between the retail prices of petroleum products in various localities. That is because the subsidy is one on freight. That does not affect other differentials, including different prices, different discounts and so on. So the scheme does not impose a uniform cost or price for petroleum products. The scheme reduces the cost of freighting petroleum products to the more distant parts of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the Northern Territory, which is, of course, remote from the large centres of population, it is clearly understood by the Government that the freight subsidy is of particular interest and concern. I understand Senator Kilgariff's concern to maintain some element of subsidisation because of the difficulties suffered by the Northern Territory. I am sure that those are the sorts of considerations which will very much influence the Government in its consideration of the future of this scheme.</PARA>

<PARA> I think the question is an important one and warrants further examination and a considered reply. I do not believe that it is helpful, in Australia's current circumstances, to produce a resentment about profits in the context of discussions which are aimed at increasing employment opportunities. It is a fact that it is only when industry is profitable that employment will be created. Whilst it is true that a substantial part of the work force in Australia is employed by bodies which do not have to make a profit, namely, the Commonwealth and State public services and statutory authorities, although many of the statutory authorities have some commercial sanctions on them, those jobs can be financed only by taxation. That taxation can accrue only from the general profitability and enterprise of the community. We are in a situation in which I believe all sides of politics should try to accept that it would be in the interests of all Australians and in particular in the interests of those Australians currently in employment and those seeking employment to maintain profitability of enterprise because, without that, the position must worsen.</PARA>

I refer to the recent report from the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia on the investigation into the establishment of an Australian uranium enrichment industry. I ask: Why did the Group not consider current research being done in the world in relation to laser enrichment technology for uranium? Is the Minister aware that the United States Government has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars annually for most of the last decade, looking into laser enrichment technology?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware that the centrifuge and gaseous diffusion technology involves vast capital expenditures on the plants and that it also requires vast amounts of electrical energy? Is he aware that, by comparison, laser enrichment technology holds the promise of being a whole magnitude less in capital cost and uses something like one-5,000th of the amount of electrical energy to process it? In view of that, will the Minister assure the Senate that the Government will not be compromised into supporting any outdated technology such as the gaseous diffusion process and that of the Urenco-Centec type as outlined in the report, without first looking intelligently at what research is going on in the world?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both UEGA and the Government have been looking at four different technologies. As Senator MacGibbon said, the gaseous diffusion technology, which is very much the French technology, uses vast amounts of electricity. In fact, some four nuclear power plants support the gaseous diffusion plant. UEGA reached the conclusion that on that premise alone gaseous diffusion would be too costly in terms of electric power. The Group looked at two other methods prior to coming to its conclusion on the centrifuge process. It looked at chemical exchange or Chemex. That in itself is a fascinating technology. It is a device which, by a chemical process, aims to change uranium to the enriched isotope U235. The belief is that that technology is still essentially in the laboratory stage. It has prospects. Its commercial possibilities are probably a decade ahead, but in any case it can be added as a modular increment to any plant that is built before that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> UEGA has been looking also at laser and has reached the same conclusions on it ; that is, that it is still in very much the experimental stage and that should it in fact prove capable of being a commercial venture it can be developed in the future as an addition. The advantages of centrifuge are: That it is a known and proven technology; that its costs are known; that all the details can be known about it now; that it uses very little electric power compared with other technologies; that it can be built in a relatively small segment first-say, one million separative work units or SWUs, as they are called-and, if necessary, one can add new technologies to it in the future. The Government will certainly , with UEGA, be looking to any breakthrough. Of course, it would be willing to take such information into account for the future. I am grateful for the question. It is very much under study by UEGA and the Government.</PARA>

I sought from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Wilson, any further information that he might have. He advised me that the only agreement which exists between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory Government regarding proposals to amend legislation affecting Aboriginals is that which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs announced on 2 June 1982. In that announcement the Minister indicated that the Commonwealth Government intended, in parallel with the Northern Territory Government, to introduce legislation designed to give effect to a package of proposals which had been the subject of lengthy negotiations to which I referred in my earlier answer. It is the Minister's understanding that the reference made by the Chief Minister to an agreement between the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth refers to the intention of both governments to enact legislation to give effect to that package of proposals as was outlined in the Minister's public announcement of 2 June 1982.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in Question Time Senator Button asked me a question about unemployment figures in Frankston. He asked me further about an instruction to the Commonwealth Employment Service about talking to the Press. The question arose, apparently, out of a report in the Age of 16 November. I am able now to give the Senate a little more advice on the latter part of the question. Apparently there was an instruction to zone managers and employment office managers concerning the procedures to be followed when dealing with the media. In brief, it instructed managers that they should not talk to State-wide media without first obtaining permission from the regional office. That instruction reinforced a longstanding policy that local managers of the CES were not to comment to the Press on labour market matters or CES business levels without first obtaining the permission of the regional office. However, it is thought there is some inconsistency in the instruction as it now applies in view of the recent decision to publish, on a regular basis, details of CES business transactions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am told that it is now proposed to advise regional directors that employment office managers will be permitted to make comments on their local labour market area to any branch of the media which may approach them. It will still be necessary for any comments relating to the labour market for the State as a whole to be made from the regional office. That latter part of the further information I have given is consistent with the position I expressed in the answer which I gave without the benefit of this advice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a personal explanation about articles which appeared in the Australian Associated Press and a news item. Before coming to Parliament House this morning I turned on my television set to watch the National Today Show. In the course of that show a news reader stated that a Bill had passed the Senate last night with the support of six Government senators of whom I happened to be one. He went on to say that the Senate had passed a Bill which would take away the powers of the Senate to block Supply and that there would never again be another 1975. Upon arriving at Parliament House I went to the Library to see whether I could get a transcript of that report. I was given a report by AAP which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Senate has passed a Labor Party Bill to lessen its power to bring down governments by blocking or threatening to block Supply. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill's passage was ensured last night when six Government Senators crossed the floor to support the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that statement is incorrect. If one looks at page 2018 of the Senate Hansard of 28 October, one will see that part of what I said that evening was:</PARA>
<PARA>I will not support anything that would weaken the powers of this chamber, which is the House of review and which is responsible to the States. I represent Queensland and I want to ensure that whatever is done in this place is right, proper and appropriate for the constituents I represent. I would not want to do anything that would weaken the power of the Senate. Therefore, I will not support clause 8 or clause 9. </PARA>
<PARA>Both of those clauses were taken out of the Bill. Therefore, I believe that the statement made on the news this morning and in the AAP report are totally incorrect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented, and I wish to make a statement on the same subject. I did not hear the news report to which Senator Bonner referred and which was broadcast this morning. However, I have a copy of an Australian Associated Press version of what happened when we voted in the Senate last night on the private member's Bill brought in by Senate Evans. I too, in debate on that Bill, indicated that in voting for the second reading I was voting for the Bill to go into Committee. I did not endorse all the things that were in that Bill in its then state, and I indicated that my subsequent vote on the Bill would depend on whether it was suitably amended in Committee, particularly in relation to the Senate's powers. This news release suggests that my vote last night endorsed a move to lessen the power of the Senate, but that is certainly not what I had indicated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also mention another section of the release. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The original Bill provided that an extraordinary double dissolution could only be ordered by the Governor-General because of a motion of no confidence being carried against the Government in the House of Representatives or if the Government chose to break a sustained deadlock between the two Houses with an election. But Senator Martin last week successfully moved an amendment to delete a provision directly removing the Senate's Supply blocking power. </PARA>
<PARA>That section muddles two issues. I moved an amendment relating to the Governor- General's powers. I moved an amendment which took off a limitation on the Governor-General's powers, which was one section of the Bill with which I was not happy. I certainly voted for an amendment which deleted the provisions directly removing the Senate's Supply blocking power. I supported that that should not be part of the Bill and that the Senate should retain its power in relation to Supply. However, I did not move the amendment. I mention that to clarify what is a bit garbled. I am only sorry that it is possible that this news release, which has a number of facts quite muddled, might lead to adverse comment and misunderstanding as to what my views were on what were really three quite separate issues in the Bill: First, the question of fixed term parliaments ; secondly, the question of the Senate's power on Supply; and, thirdly, the powers of the Governor-General. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a statement on the same subject. I join with my two colleagues in expressing objection to the slovenly reportage which has obviously occurred overnight by the media of this country-it happens too often these days-of what has happened in this Senate. It has been constantly the case in regard to this Bill. It can lead only to confusion in the minds of people in the various States as to what has happened. Clearly, the report which has been made, and of which I now have a copy in my hands, is so inconsistent in itself; it talks about the lessening of powers for blocking Supply and also about Senator Martin moving an amendment, which she did not do. But the provisions on Supply blocking came out of the Bill. It will probably lead people only to confusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These matters do not make me particularly uptight except they mean, therefore, that the public has a very unclear understanding of what was done by the Senate last night-namely, to pass, purely and simply, a fixed term Bill with the complete deletion from it of any provisions which would have reduced Supply powers or anything of that sort, or any changes in the Governor-General's powers . Those were gone. The Bill was pruned down to the single issue only. I want to express the fact that I deplore the slovenliness of the media of this country which do not bother to ask anyone about what has happened and, therefore, do not get an accurate idea of the result of the deliberations of this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise three matters on the report of the Department of National Development and Energy, if I can do so in the absurdly short time of 10 minutes given to honourable senators to comment on these important documents. The first matter relates to the heading 'Legislative Matters' under the general title 'Uranium' in Chapter 7 of the report. In that chapter one finds this sentence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Government announced in June 1981 its intention to establish a new legal base for the development, regulation and control of nuclear activities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In that short sentence one has evidence of 16 months of dithering and procrastination in relation to one aspect of the development of the mining of uranium which is absolutely fundamental and of grave concern to many members of the community; that is, the legislative framework within which the industry is to be conducted, if it is to be conducted at all. The policy of the Australian Labor Party is, of course, well known. It is that there will be a phasing out of existing mines and that in the meantime their activities will be subject to the most stringent conditions particularly in relation to policies on overseas purchases. But in that phasing out, that transition period, there is obviously a need for a legislative structure to guide their operation. </PARA>
<PARA> For that transition period it is intolerable that the Government still has not produced for the Parliament a legislative framework different from the 1950s framework which still governs the industry generally. That framework was, of course, evolved at a time when Australian uranium was used to fuel the nuclear armaments programs of our allies-one thinks of the Rum Jungle deposits and so on . Therefore, they are framed in a way that is most deleterious in its impact on civil liberties. There have been debates in this chamber on that matter. I have not time to review them all. What I am saying very clearly is that the Labor Party is dismayed that after 16 months there is still no evidence from the Government of a legislative framework more conducive to operations for peaceful purposes as it is alleged-for commercial profit, as it is said-of mining activities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, insofar as the sentence that I have quoted talks about the development, regulation and control of nuclear activities in Australia, I make it extremely clear that as far as the Australian Labor Party is concerned that could be a much wasted effort. I quote from the policy adopted at our National Conference in July, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party will not permit the treatment, storage or enrichment of nuclear materials in Australia nor domestic use of nuclear power. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, as we see it, there is not the need for a regulatory framework dealing with those matters so to preoccupy the Government that it is unable to bring with reasonable speed to the Parliament a new legislative framework to deal with mining during the transitional period of which I have spoken. There is no doubt in the community's mind that a strong national legislative framework is required. Insofar as the paragraph in the report of the Department of National Development and Energy speaks of developing this legislative framework in consultation with the States and the Northern Territory, I say once again that it is intolerable to think that the States, the Northern Territory or any other section of the Australian community could in any way hinder, retard or control-a term which is perhaps extremely strong and not so intended-the industry. But at all times it is essential that the national Government retain through its export controls complete, utter and inalienable legislative and governmental control of this industry. That must always be the objective. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise briefly two other matters referred to in chapter 13 of the report, headed 'Management-Review of Commonwealth Functions'. In other words, it concerns the implementation of the razor gang report in this Department. One finds this sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>The Soil Conservation Program to be transferred to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>That fairly innocuous sentence obscures the fact that in relation to the greatest threat to Australian agriculture, namely soil degradation, that great threat to half our export income, or 8 per cent of our national product, the national Government has declared that it no longer will be responsible for a soil conservation policy but rather will transfer such programs to the States. As recently as Friday 29 October an article by Geoff Sorby, under the headline ' Soil conservation policy is still blowing in the wind', appeared in the 'Rural Review' published in the Australian. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It can be argued that Australia is blowing away and nobody, particularly the Federal Government, appears to care a damn. </PARA>
<PARA>He points out that for every tonne of grain produced the concomitant effect is that 13 tonnes of topsoil can be lost. On the famous Darling Downs in Queensland soil losses have reached 50 tonnes a hectare in some places. In Victoria alone there are about 100,000 hectares of land affected by salinity. It is the same story of wind and water ravage throughout the continent. The land has also been ravaged by bad farm management practices. The Government, having announced a much vaunted soil conservation program just prior to the 1980 election, has washed its hands of that program and has pretended to transfer that responsibility to the States. I can say, without prejudging or pre-empting the recommendations of a current Senate Committee into the matter, that when some six senators looked into this matter, they were utterly dismayed that the national Government should abdicate this responsibility. As Mr Kerin, the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is the Commonwealth's function to provide leadership and provide the support for a national program. Land degradation is a national problem. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Labor Party has stated that in co-operation with State governments it will promote and fund a national soil conservation program. It will restore Commonwealth involvement by providing $4m to the States for approved programs in the first year, rising to $20m after four years. It is essential that that national involvement take place because the States piecemeal , the rural industry research funds piecemeal, cannot solve this tremendous problem facing Australian agriculture. The rural industry research funds, for example, direct their efforts to the commodities with which they deal. This is a multi-disciplinary problem and it needs all the resources and leadership which a national Government ought to bring to it. The Labor Party will do that and I hope that farmers and farm organisations take note of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, and briefly, in the razor gang report one reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth to withdraw from regional development activities. Regional Development Program and Decentralisation Advisory Board to be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA>That has been carried out, once again in the teeth of a Senate committee report. In the report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources entitled ' The Development of Bauxite, Alumina and Aluminium Industries' which reviewed the impact on regional Australia of these great projects using our great natural resources, it was concluded that the Commonwealth had a very real obligation to provide for regional adjustment. This is particularly so in regard to the social infrastructure of regions which are unduly burdened by the migration of workers and the siting of these tremendous resource projects, communities which cannot bear either the social infrastructure or geneal disruption that occurs, whether it is in relation to housing, education, health facilities or mere social and recreational amenities. Those regional support schemes, which are so essential if the vision of a decentralised regionally robust Australia is to be achieved, need to be put forward and funded by a national Government which cares about the regions of Australia. Once again, the Labor Party will do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take a brief moment of the Senate's time to respond to matters raised by Senator Tate. He raised three matters. The first one related to the legislative framework for nuclear energy in Australia. I have to inform the Senate that in fact two measures will come before the Parliament in the autumn session. One measure will deal with the international situation-the non- proliferation situation-and the other will deal with the domestic situation, being a new kind of legislative framework for the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and the work it performs. The Government has recognised over the years, as has previous governments, that the previous Act was more a defence Act and should be brought up to date. Other governments did not do so. This Government will do so by the autumn session. The Senate, therefore, will have the advantage of being able to study the measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has happened during the time this Government has been in office is that the essential recommendations of the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry have been carried out. A wide range of activities have been undertaken to implement the recommendations of that inquiry. This Senate has had the benefit of that literature. Codes have been established in Australia. We have, firstly, a mining code relating to radioactive materials and, secondly, a code for the handling of radioactive materials, both minor and major, throughout Australia. All this has been done. All this consensus has been reached. Therefore, a great deal of progress has been made in recent years and is continuing to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not easy to put together the kind of legislation that is contemplated. Senator Tate referred to a delay of 15 months. Interdepartmental committees have been working on this matter. Honourable senators should bear in mind also that we have a Commonwealth Constitution and we have States. Therefore, we have to put together legislation which is constitutional and sustainable in the High Court and which will work. We are doing this. Senator Tate has said that we ought to enforce our export controls. We have shown-this was evident by our action in relation to Fraser Island-that we are prepared to do those kinds of things. We have found no necessity whatsoever to do so in terms of uranium mining and milling and of prospective enrichment because the States and the Territories concerned have agreed to co-operate to the fullest extent. I repeat that the standards of safeguards adopted in Australia are of the highest level. The recent agreement between the States and the Commonwealth Government fully implements the decision of the International Atomic Energy Agency and other international bodies regarding radioactive materials. We have advanced an enormous distance in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very hard indeed to reconcile the unqualified statement of Senator Tate about the Australian Labor Party's policy-Senator Tate said that the Australian Labor Party was opposed totally to the treatment, storage or enrichment of uranium-with the fact that during the South Australian election campaign the Labor Party deliberately said and represented to the Australian people that the elements of uranium at Roxby Downs would be part of a compact which would be proceeded with by an incoming Labor government. This is a new factor. There is no doubt in the world that the headlines in the newspapers were meant to intimate that Roxby Downs, which depends upon the conjunctive development of minerals, such as copper, and uranium would in fact proceed under a Labor government. It is quite clear from what Senator Tate has said that that will not be so, that Roxby Downs cannot be considered to be a project that had been agreed upon by governments beforehand. The Labor Party has been completely ambiguous about this matter. I am sorry that that should be so. Indeed, it is of immense importance to the people of Australia to know what the Labor Party means . Does it mean, for example, that it would oppose the construction of uranium enrichment plants in Australia?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do I see Senator Tate nodding? Am I able to say that the Labor Party would oppose any enrichment plant in Australia unequivocally and , therefore, that it would be futile for the Bannon Labor Government in South Australia to have any discussions with the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia ? Am I able to say to UEGA that the Labor Party would be opposing that plant and , therefore that UEGA should not have discussions with the Bannon Labor Government? Is this what is being said today? It is very important indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I move to the second question. Senator Tate intimated that the full thrust of soil conservation was a Commonwealth matter under the Constitution and that somehow it had been buckpassed to the States with no benefit to the States. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that the constitutional responsibility for soil conservation is wholly with the States. The States over the years have always accepted it totally. Most of the States have developed first class departments with first class technology. My Government offered, as a supplement, $3m a year for additional work on soil conservation. Senator Tate's intimation was that that had disappeared. That is completely untrue. That $3m was added to and absorbed in the tax revenue disbursements; so each year the States are getting that money. All that has happened is that the Commonwealth, instead of administering the money itself, has passed it to the States. I repeat : It is true that sovereignty over soil conservation lies totally with the States. It is not true that the Commonwealth had that responsibility. It is true that there was a peripheral supplement and that that money has been transferred.</PARA>
<PARA> Mention was made of regional development and of the movement away from it. Regional development within a State is wholly a State matter. What has not been said is that the funds for regional development have been increased enormously by the Commonwealth. Seven years ago the amount of money passed by the then Labor Government to the States by way of Grants Commission local government disbursements was $79.9m. It is six times that amount today-in excess of $400m. The Commonwealth has introduced a scheme whereby 2 per cent of revenue goes to local government. That is a huge amount of additional funds for regional development and has been one of the most important factors for local government.</PARA>
<PARA> This is not a report of no progress on the three matters mentioned. Rather the Government has acted very vigorously and successfully on legislation for the controls of nuclear and radioactive materials. It has transferred the money for soil conservation, and the States have gained by that money and absorbed it. With respect to regional development, it is no bad thing that local government should today be getting six times the amount it got seven years ago. Even allowing for inflation, that is a tremendously larger amount than it got previously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The report from the Education Research and Development Committee is an unfortunate report. It is unfortunate because it is the last report of that Committee. I read from the general comments made at the beginning of the report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 30 April 1981 the Prime Minister announced, as a result of the Government's decisions following the Review of Commonwealth Functions, that the Education Research and Development Committee (ERDC) would be abolished and its programs terminated. </PARA>
<PARA> Effective abolition of the Committee was accomplished on 5 June 1981 when its members were formally advised that their appointments ceased from that date. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on in the general comments under 'Policy', in relation to principles and procedures, to note that the Committee was advised and, of course , had to take account of the fact that it was ceasing operations. It attempted to terminate in its last year of office the various educational, research and development projects that it had in train. The report itself says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in deciding to terminate ERDC programs, determined that established commitments and immediate ongoing obligations should be discharged. </PARA>
<PARA>Some of those projects were taken up through the Australian Education Council and some were funded directly by the Government in other ways. However, it remains the case that the body in Australia which had been established to co- ordinate research development in this area has now been abolished. Yet we find a member of the Government saying in this place, in response to another item, that the Government, in fact very much supports the notion of co-ordination of educational research. One finds it rather intriguing that the Government can abolish the Committee which was undertaking that and at the same time say that it is intent on fostering co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Education Research and Development Committee was an extremely important committee in educational research terms. It had had a number of distinguished chairmen and on its board had gathered together from all States representatives of various education groups. The Committee, because of that wide representation, was able to look at applications from the education establishment in Australia and to fund those projects which it believed would have a practical ongoing effect. Interestingly enough, recently the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) talked about, and even criticised, education researchers for not having done enough of that. If one has a look at the last guidelines of the ERDC one finds that, in fact, that is precisely what the ERDC's guidelines were attempting to do. The ERDC was attempting to disseminate information and to generate research which was of a practical kind to the practitioner in the classroom. It is very interesting that the Minister for Education, who is newly arrived in his portfolio, could make those types of criticisms having presided over the abolition of the one body which was doing what he was advocating. It, indeed, is a pity when one goes through the various types of research which were described in this last report to see, in fact, that no longer will we have that co-ordinating, expert body. It was not a body of Ministers of Education, most of whom presumably have had no professional or research training in that area to deliberate on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that if we do not look into the excessive rundown of our research establishments we could very well find ourselves in a very short time without the technological base that would be necessary to go into the year 2000. Senator Martyr interrupts with the old worn out cliches that I would have hoped somebody in this place would not again mouth. The fact is that research is an extremely important underpinning to any technological society such as ours. One needs only to look at areas such as technology, bio-technology and communications to see that if we do not vastly increase the funds to research establishments around Australia we will be not only behind but so far behind that it would be impossible for us to catch up to those societies which have looked at this matter, such as West Germany, Japan, Switzerland and the United States of America, and which have heavily increased their research budgets in recent years. They know where to invest money. Investing in research is not a cost, it is an investment. It is a pity that the abolition of the Education Research and Development Committee was not connected with a more general type of proposition on the part of the Government as to what it saw as necessary in terms of the promotion of research in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe the time has now come to seek to bring together the various research funding bodies to form an Australian research foundation. This particular body would, I believe, be capable of not only taking money from governments but also seeking money from private enterprise. The usefulness of that operation would be seen if one were to look at the vast problems with tied grants which are currently arising in American universities. For example, there is the ethical problem of a professor teaching a technology course while he is the principal owner and operator of a technology development company, and setting his post- graduate students various tasks within the area that he may be able to profit from in his private capacity. Those ethical problems have exercised the minds of administrations and researchers in universities in Australia. I believe it is now time to seek the establishment of an intermediate body which will be able to receive either tied or open grants from private enterprise and to make arms length agreements with researchers to provide them with the ability to undertake that research without the ensuing ethical problems of tied grants. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe unless we look closely at this point in a very short time we will find ourselves entering into a range of very deleterious and extremely vicious debates within the higher education area about the notion of taking money from a variety of groups. Senator Martyr might remember the debates in the 1960s and early 1970s about funds which went from the Department of Defence to universities and of the enormous heartache and concern that that caused. I urge the Minister for Education to look at this matter. I hope that shortly he will announce the Government's initiatives in this area and that we will again be able to discuss a report from an education committee that has as part of its brief educational research and development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in response to Senator Macklin's comments. To put Senator Macklin's comments into context, I want to set out just how extensive the role of the Department of Education and the portfolio of education is in supporting research. I start by saying that I am attracted by his idea that we should do in a flexible way the maximum amount we can for research, but I am not attracted by the comments he made quite gratuitously about Ministers for Education. I say to the honourable senator that it really is a vanity to assume that he is the only educated person around or the only person who may have had a background in research. He knows that what he said about the Ministers for Education is not true. I cannot imagine why he turned to a personal comment of that kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The total identifiable research expenditure which has been made available for universities in the six States actually increased from $82m in 1977 to $106m in 1981. Both figures are expressed in the same kinds of dollars to allow for inflation and to set out the magnitude of the increase in real terms of what has become available for research. That money is provided to the universities, much of it through my portfolio. If I wanted to look at Commonwealth support relating to educational research, I could do so under two broad categories: I could look at research performed in or commissioned by the portfolio and I could look at research carried out by external organisations where there is a portfolio contribution of money, guidance or advice. It is necessary to do this because Senator Macklin's comments went to research applied in the educational area generally. I have to set into perspective what the effects are likely to be of the wind down of the Education Research and Development Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Department of Education-within the portfolio structure and including what is now known as the Curriculum Development Centre-there are now almost 30 current or proposed projects examining issues and schemes in the education field . The great majority of those enlist educational researchers from Australian universities and colleges of advanced education with the administrative assistance of liaison committees which are maintained through departmental resources. The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, which is another part of my portfolio, has almost 50 projects in hand or contemplated. Most of these are evaluatory studies or reviews. The Commonwealth Schools Commission, which is another part of my portfolio, has about 15 further projects. In addition, about 42 further projects are still current from the Commonwealth's commitment under the ERDC, the matter which we are discussing this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> The departmental research and development work includes undertakings of long term dimensions, especially in producing materials for teaching English as a second language and in multicultural areas. Over several years analysis has been carried forward of issues involved in progress towards a national language policy. That is other research activity within my portfolio area. Projects which have been proposed by the Curriculum Development Centre include those for teaching mathematics to Aborigines, values and attitudes in a multicultural society and the attitudes of the Australian education community. Among the many projects of the Tertiary Education Commission is a study of the participation of young Australians in tertiary education, the attrition that occurs in education and manpower studies that are also important for planning and tertiary education . The work of the Schools Commission includes studies such as those of resource allocation within government school systems and of target recurrent resource standards for schools in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> I observe that the research was carried out within the portfolio and some of it was extended beyond the portfolio with our support. If we look at that research extended beyond the portfolio commitments, the Department also participates in studies which are decided on by the Australian Education Council which consists of Commonwealth and State Ministers for Education about whom Senator Macklin chose to speak so disparagingly. I should cite the portfolio's involvement in Australian Studies in Student Performance and the Australian Co-operative Assessment Project. That involves a school focused achievement testing program. The Commonwealth is also represented on the Australian Education Council Committee on School Statistics. That Committee was set up in 1979. The Commonwealth is represented on the Steering Committee for Co-operative Study of School Enrolment Patterns which the AEC established in 1981. Further, the portfolio has taken part in the study which commenced in 1979 of issues relating to resources allocation in the government schools system of the six Australian States, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and New Zealand . The Department has also participated in the work of the Commonwealth Aboriginal Studies Working Group which reported to the AEC in March this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has also committed itself to providing half the cost of the Technical and Further Education National Centre for Research and Development Ltd . That commitment extends over a five-year period and up to a maximum Commonwealth contribution which is quite considerable-almost one-third of a million dollars a year. But that is another contribution to an ongoing research activity. The core program of research performed by the Australian Council for Educational Research is normally supported too by the Commonwealth and by the States in equal amount. In the present financial year, the Commonwealth is providing as its share almost $400,000. Of course, as I have said, that amount will be supplemented by an equal amount provided by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will also provide an expected $1.5m during the initial development period of the Australian Children's Television Foundation, whose purpose is to work for improvement in the quality and quantity of children's programs on Australian television-another area of development and research. Further, the Government announced in the last Budget that $100,000 would be made available in the current financial year to go towards research in the use of communications technology in Australia. We have established a Commonwealth-State advisory committee to try to get that under way. The importance of that is that with the development of satellite technology and the opportunities that that will present, for example, for distance education, we need to have that kind of research activity going ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also remember the support given through the transition education program to evaluative studies at national and State levels and to the Australian National University clearing-house on transition education. By the end of 1982 the Commonwealth will have paid almost $300,000 to tertiary institutions for evaluation of the program and for research into transition education. More is provided this year. Senator Macklin is quite correct when he deplores the fact that the facility of the ERDC is no longer present. I have tried to set out the fact that a very considerable amount of research activity continues. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a table, which I have not yet shown to other honourable senators, which sets out in tabular form portfolio directed expenditure on education research. In view of the concerns of Senator Macklin and perhaps allowing for those who may wish to vet the table, I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Today we must be aware that cultural identity depends in large part on language retention . Whilst it is essential that migrants and their decendants acquire some degree of written and spoken proficiency with English-our nation's primary language-it is equally essential that multilingualism be encouraged. The Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) will remember that he and I had the privilege of sharing a platform when addressing multicultural groups on this matter. I must say-I am not trying to score points-that the remarks of the Minister for Education were closer to those I made on behalf of the Australian Democrats than I think were the remarks of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges). I am hopeful that Senator Baume's persuasiveness will prevail eventually and that the Government's policies will become closer to his views than to those expressed by either the Department or the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on the question of a national language policy, which the Democrats support very strongly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since our very beginnings, the Australian Democrats have recognised the need for non-English speaking children, upon their entry into the school system, to be taught first in their dominant language with a gradual transfer to the second language after basic literary skills are mastered. It was evident from what was said at the conference that Australians are probably the worst in the world in terms of being equipped with two languages. It is almost pathetic how few Australians are bilingual or multilingual compared with the people of almost every other nation. While we still force mind-bending subjects such as algebra and trigonometry compulsorily on our children at an advanced age, the wisdom of which sometimes escapes me, we have a largely untapped national resource in that nearly two million Australians are bilingual. Our schools and other institutions must build upon that resource so that we can have a truly multilingual Australia in which at least a second language is accepted as an integral part of the learning of every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall recommendation 14 of the Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services to Migrants Committee-the Galbally Committee-which states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the language learning efforts of isolated individuals or even groups is not capable of sustaining a policy of multilingualism or of changing established practices of monolingualism. </PARA>
<PARA>Although I have praised the Government for many of its efforts in promoting multiculturalism-its efforts are worthy of praise-I must register the caveat that far too many of the Government's language planning efforts are proceeding on an ad hoc, hit and miss basis. We need a considered policy commitment from our Federal Government charting just where we are going with our multilingualism and co-ordinating the many branches of a language policy-the education system, international trade, translator and interpreter services, community language programs, the arts and international communications development. </PARA>
<PARA> The efforts of an individual solicitor, nurse, politician or business person to master a second language in order better to serve the community are not to be discounted, but without a national language policy to provide a direction and a framework for such individual efforts our nation will not overcome the cautionary dictum of Galbally recommendation 14. In a time of difficult economic fortunes, it is perhaps appropriate to remind the Government that multilingualism is not a luxury, stealing scarce resources from other areas of public life. Rather, multilingualism goes to the core of Australia and its destiny. It is as fundamental to our nation as health care and housing, defence and commerce. I trust that the singular opportunity offered by the National Language Policy Conference is not lost by our Government or our people. </PARA>
<PARA> Too often discussions of multiculturalism or multilingualism boil down to what 'they' will have to do to get along in 'our' society, or what 'we' can do to help 'them'-the 'us and them' syndrome. We are proud to dwell on the many advantages Australia has to offer as an incentive to migration and tend to think that adjustment to our way of life is a price to be paid by the migrant in order to get all these benefits. But in the 1980s we must complete the task of discarding our monocultural myopia and recognise the enormous benefits-tangible and intangible-which people from different backgrounds have brought to Australia . In doing so, we will find immense joys in discovering the rich mosaic of cultures and languages which are now available in Australia. I thank the Senate for its indulgence. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to page 18 under the general heading 'Medical Services' and draw to the attention of the Senate some of the statements made therein, in relation particularly to the expansion of medical services in a number of States including Western Australia. A few weeks ago I had brought to my attention the 1981-82 report of the Perth Aboriginal Medical Service. I wish to express my concern that in the report of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs I could find no specific mention of the work of the Community Nurse Practitioner, which receives a fair amount of attention in the Perth Aboriginal Medical Service report. I wish firstly to make it quite clear that I am concerned that because of limited government funding it is not possible for these facilities to be improved, in the Perth AMS particularly, although this practitioner is the first point of contact at the AMS for many whose situations are extreme, to say the least. The Community Nurse Practitioner, in her report, says:</PARA>
<PARA>Since settling into our new premises the main problem which comes up time and time again is lack of finances to carry out our daily work schedules. As we have many more people coming to seek assistance the radius becomes larger consequently it is impossible to conceive that one community nurse is able to adequately cover an area stretching from Armadale to West Swan, North Beach, Lockridge, Fremantle and the Perth metropolitan area. As two or three families may need intensive follow-up others are being neglected. Although submissions have been made for another community nurse to cover the specific needs of Aboriginal families it has fallen on the deaf ears of the funding body in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The avalanche of new patients registered seems to be directly related to the introduction of the Government's new medical scheme introduced last September.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, September 1981. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Large accounts for medical services from hospitals and laboratories tend to confuse and send many of the supporting mothers into a panic. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of our time has been spent sorting out these accounts and confering with the relevant bodies. It has become increasingly more expensive to become ill under this new system. While women on supporting mothers benefits and other pensioners get allowances for prescriptions, others like the unemployed and low income earners do not get this benefit. The $3.50 and soon to be $4 for a script can mean the difference between bread, milk etc. for a meal or medications for the sick person concerned. Many opt for the food and so the prescription remains in the pocket and they go without medicines. </PARA>
<PARA> At the A.M.S. we endeavour to give these people lotions, dressings or medications from our stock cupboard. The money budgeted for medical stocks became depleted a month before the end of the financial year and in some instances the first aid kits which are supplied to Lockridge and Saunders Street had to be doled out in a frugal manner to enable us to eke out our stocks till the end of the month. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 12 months many of the Aboriginal families in the low socio-economic group have faced severe hardships, trying to feed, clothe and generally care for their families. Rising costs have eroded their meagre allowances to such an extent that life has become a continuous struggle against the poverty forced upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> Welfare agencies which once were a ready source of help, now have their backs to the wall helping the ever growing number of people seeking assistance for food, clothing and help with electricity bills. </PARA>
<PARA> As these conditions prevail the children and small babies are the first to suffer a breakdown in health. Many families visited have not had one scrap of food in their houses for days at a time while they are waiting for their next benefits cheque. This is a criminal state of affairs in a country as rich as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>After expressing concern about what is happening in some areas in the north of the State, at Meekatharra and places of that nature, the report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Another area of concern is the families at Saunders Street where pressure is being put upon the people to leave their premises to give way to a wild flower industry. No one seems to know or care where these people are to go-there are approximately 15 small babies and children and about 30 adults who would be affected if this programme is allowed to be proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA> I first reported in a paper written in 1977 of the vast improvement in health of the children when these people first moved into these houses at Saunders Street. </PARA>
<PARA>I might add that at that time those houses were not what I would consider to be houses but they were certainly shelter, something to which the people of Saunders Street had not been accustomed. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> There is still the on going problem of homeless Aborigines around East Perth. Gradually every shelter they have found has been bulldozed down. From the Bull Paddock they now camp about 20 yards within the shadow of the new Education Department Building. Ironically to me this pathetic situation depicts the futile position of the Aboriginal people in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> Working with the new medical system has caused much confusion among the general public as well as the professionals. We were asked to sort out problems arising when patients from country areas had to come to Perth for medical appointments. Apparently when the first referral is made this is quite straight forward, but subsequent appointments are creating problems in the area of travel refunds. This breakdown is causing considerable hardship to the elderly and ante-natals. It is unbelievable that there can be so little communication between the departments dealing with people's health problems. As most recipients are unaware of the assistance for travel, they are put under great hardships trying to raise the money for fares between country areas and Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the downturn in the economy many aspects of health needs has tended to be overlooked in catering for the lower socio-economic bracket. This has put the A.M.S. under a greater strain acting on behalf of the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that disturbs me is that because we have never recognised-there is almost a refusal on the part of governments to recognise-that Aboriginals are people, we have never upgraded the services to make sure that the health needs of Aboriginal people are brought up to a standard which would apply in a normal white community. We have constantly set up organisations. We have totally under- funded them to the extent that statements such as that made by the general nurse practitioner at the Perth Aboriginal Medical Service have to be made time and again and are still totally ignored by the Government. The situation in Perth for many years was that we had a very old building. It contained the original Aboriginal Medical Service. I think that in the period 1981 to 1982 the Service moved into new premises which are much more substantial and it provides a larger range of medical services. But the funding for the Service has still not increased to the extent that it has even kept pace with the rate of inflation. It is a tragedy that it takes the total day of one working person to get through just two or three disadvantaged families, purely and simply because of confusion and the lack of communication that exists in our community. This is not new amongst the Aborigines. The situation will never be satisfactory. But I would maintain that now is the time to establish a line of communication to be followed if in actual fact we are serious in our intent to promote the health, welfare and education of the Aboriginal people in our community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly, given the time constraints on ordinary senators, merely to record how exciting and excellent it is to see, right around Australia, the involvement of so many community groups in the broad world-wide movement relating to peace and disarmament issues. I read the report of the Australian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly's Special Session devoted to disarmament with interest. Given its complexity and the range of papers contained in the report it is possible to give only the scantest attention to them all. I will take one or two points out of the speech of the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Tony Street, as a basis for a couple of remarks. Amongst other things, Mr Street said to the General Assembly:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . there is a risk that by their popular appeal, mass peace movements may divert attention from real arms control and disarmament measures. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that those words of the Foreign Minister reveal not only that there is a misunderstanding in that they imply that those involved in the peace movement around the world are not interested in real, concrete proposals for disarmament but also a typical politician's fear, I think, of mass movements, of really popular, widespread, genuine expressions of opinion by people who, perhaps, cannot be pigeonholed too easily and cannot be controlled by the political process. In this regard, rather than being fearful of it, politicians need to respond creatively to the lead which has been taken by ordinary people, because we are faced with the expression of a very deep-seated aspiration of mankind for peace. It is being expressed, as I say, in the activities of many people and community organisations throughout Australia. I have said before that one is reminded forcibly of the quotation of the prophet Isaiah, who was one of the great Jewish prophets, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. </PARA>
<PARA>That aspiration, given voice by the Jewish tradition, is shared, I believe, by all people around the world. It is up to politicians to respond. Mr Street was correct in stating that the peace movement in free countries should find a way of 'joining its voice with similar expressions of opinion which are struggling to make themselves heard from within closed societies'. It is a fact, I believe, that we who are privileged to take part in these demonstrations in democratic societies should give voice not only to our concerns and fears but also to the fears of those who are not permitted to express themselves in some other countries. Could it be denied that the mothers and fathers of Leningrad and of Moscow share the same fears about the future of their children as do the mothers and fathers of Melbourne or Sydney? We have to give voice to their fears, with our own, otherwise if the catastrophe which hangs over our heads comes to pass they may haunt us forever. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, a sea change has been taking place in perceptions around the world, not only as to the imminence of nuclear destruction which we face but also as to the very real fact that with the diversion of so many billions of dollars into the armaments program of countries right around the world, particularly those gobbled up by the super-powers, there is less money available to meet the real social and practical needs of humanity. For example, if the nuclear arsenals of the super-powers were reduced by half, some $50 billion could be saved to be put to good use. For example, the six diseases measles, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus are child killers. The World Health Organisation estimates that every minute 10 children may die as a result of those diseases. Vaccines have existed for decades, yet only 10 per cent of the 80 million children born yearly in the developing world are immunised. The cost of immunisation would be $3 per head. Surely that is where the resources of mankind should be placed, rather than in the ever-growing arsenals of destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in Australia we need to take concrete practical steps. Without anticipating any debate on a notice of motion that I have given, let me say that it is a fact that the Senate will be called upon to discuss supporting the creation of an Australian Peace and Development Research Institute as an independent authority of international standing to undertake research and stimulate public awareness of peace and development issues; and further, the Senate will be debating the creation of such a mechanism as a Ministry of Peace, as advocated by the United Nations Association of Australia, in order to ensure that at the top levels of decision making, in government, at Cabinet level, the very perspectives and points of view of the peace movement can be put in order to counter and balance the point of view put by those who see foreign affairs and defence in the traditional terms. With those remarks, I leave the way open for other senators to contribute. </PARA>

However, I think that his enthusiasm sometimes runs him into a kind of naivete which one would not expect of someone who has the intelligence that he has. He does not make it clear at all who is responsible for world tension. Everybody knows that it is not the United States of America. Everybody knows that it is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that is entirely responsible for the present state of world tension. Like many others in this chamber, I take strong objection when people do not make it clear that it is the USSR that is responsible for this world tension. Further, I do not like it at all when assertions are made that the basic values of the United States and the USSR are the same. They are not the same. Those of the USSR proceed from an entirely different basis from those of the United States of America. I will not have it that the United States is responsible in any way for the present state of world tension. There is no doubt that it is the USSR.

It was generally recognised as a fiasco and American commentators then and since have consistently referred to the desirability of the United States intervening in a military way on the mainland of Asia. It was America's intervention that was being talked about when those comments were made. Of course if one looks at other places in the world it can be said, on documented evidence of statements by United States leaders and Presidents, that the United States has played a role, a significant interventionist role-I do not make any moral judgment about it-in Central and Southern America. I do have personal views about the desirability of that in terms of the integrity of those societies and their capacity to develop as democracies, if that is not too naive a belief. There is no doubt at all that the United States has had an interventionist policy so described in relation to Central America and a number of South American republics. They are interventionists and are responsible for tension in those areas. I will give other examples. It was not the USSR that tried to put a helicopter force into Iran; it was the United States of America.</PARA></TALK.START>

I was saying that I would like to feel that I could do something about it. I would like to feel that this Parliament could do something about it. Prior to the Second Session I felt that we could have done something about the United Nations if we had accorded it the importance to which it is entitled. We recognise that the United Nations does not have the backbone that it needs. I said in my speech in this place that if it was as important to us as I thought it was, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) would have represented this country, not the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street), to give it the importance due to it. Whether he would have made a contribution and raised the status of the United Nations is something else again. But it may have put it on that government to government level which is lacking in the United Nations. The United Nations does not have a policy; it does not have a ready-made solution to all these things. The lines of communication have broken down because of the tier, the hierarchy, that exists in the United Nations. It has become ineffective and it has become ineffective because we have anticipated that it is like a world government. We have expected great things of it. We have not made a contribution to it. I am not talking about a financial contribution; I know our terms of reference there. I am talking about the contribution that we as citizens of the world could have made during all these years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When have our delegations to the United Nations done anything constructive? When have we demanded that we have a chair of peace at every one of our universities so that we can do something constructive about peace? When have we supported Senator Tate's notice of motion for an institute of peace and research development? Senator Martyr today knocked his proposal because he does not have the courage to go for peace. He is the type of person who was behind the Vietnam War. He is the type of person who sat on his backside and did nothing. That is what he will do again, except that he will not have a second chance because I believe that there will be only one more opportunity for the world to get together and to determine that we will have peace. Otherwise, the only thing that we will have will be the destruction of mankind. I would support at any time any move to set up those lines of communications which I see as lacking in the United Nations at the moment. It would set up lines of communication in our own area, such as between Australia and Indonesia. There are a lot of people in Australia who are fearful of Indonesia, as there are a lot of people in China who are fearful of the USSR. A lot of people in neighbouring countries are fearful of others. Surely it is possible, surely we are enlightened enough, to sit down and talk about lines of communication. </PARA>

I have explained why it did not; it is because it is not a world government. It comprises a number of governments that come together, but it has no clear lines of action in the resolution of conflict. There is no way that it can say: 'You are not going to do this' or 'You are going to do that'. We have not given it that authority. Until such time as we do we have to look at alternative methods. One of those methods is being called for now by leading academics, lawyers, concerned citizens-even me as an ordinary senator. I am calling for it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party's position has been stated many times by its spokesman on foreign affairs, Mr Lionel Bowen. He has spoken about the need for the world to move into a more peaceful position . I think the holding several months ago of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Disarmament, and the report of the Australian delegation to that conference which is before the Senate today, is an indication of some maturing of attitudes on this very vital and important question of disarmament. It is clear that we cannot continue on the path that the world has taken. We cannot continue to accept a position in which the super-powers, namely the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, determine what course of action should be taken in respect of the issues of world peace and disarmament. As the Labor Party speakers in this debate today have indicated , the issues go far beyond ideology. They go far beyond the right of two major countries in the world to determine the fate of humanity and to determine whether we can find the path by which sensible people and sensible governments can live together despite their differences, whether they be ideological, religious, racial or other differences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that the United Nations has taken the step of having a specific conference called to discuss disarmament is an indication of that maturing which I believe ought to be encouraged-not denigrated as Senator Martyr did today. Of course, people on both sides of this important international question have blind spots. Obviously Senator Martyr is one who sees the issue of disarmament in the context of black and white. He does not accept that it takes two to tango; that it takes two to get into a conflict; and that on both sides there are fears about the intentions and motivations of those who claim to speak on behalf of the East and the West. What he does not understand, and what obviously members of the Government parties do not understand, is that those of us who as Senator Tate has suggested have been active in the quest for peace, in the pursuance of a peaceful resolution of the world's differences, accept the fact that there is a genuine fear in the United States about the intentions of the Soviet Union as indeed there are genuine fears in the Soviet Union about the intentions of the United States. There is abundant evidence to show that those fears are based genuinely in the minds of people and perhaps even in the minds of governments. </PARA>
<PARA> But one cannot suggest that all of the world's tensions can be placed at the door of one particular country or even one of the super-powers. I can understand -Senator Martyr obviously cannot-the concern in the Soviet Union about world war . It is a country that had one-third of its territory-villages, towns and communities-overrun during World War II, when some 20 million people lost their lives. They had more of a vested interest in establishing a world of peace than we did in Australia. A few bombs were dropped on Darwin and there were a few explosions in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. They were the only effects felt by the general population of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be futile to suggest that the Russians were the main force in the Korean war or, indeed, in the war in Vietnam. It is just as futile to suggest that the liberation of many countries in Africa can be placed at the door of the Soviet Union any more than it can be placed at the door of the United States of America. It was the right of the people in those countries, along with the United Nations, to determine their own affairs. Yet, they were traduced and criticised-they were called terrorists-whether they were in Kenya or Zimbabwe. These sorts of connotations and descriptions of attempting to write off people's attitudes were made just because we did not understand the forces that were operating in those particular areas. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Martyr and obviously some members of the Government-I believe there has been some slight improvement in the attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) about this conference and the question of disarmament-failed to appreciate was the growing number of men in the military machines of the East and West, particularly the West, who have, in more recent times, warned about the dangers of nuclear war and of allowing the arms race to continue. The Chief of the General Staff of the United Kingdom and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation generals in Europe and in West Germany itself have become active in the peace movement. This movement no longer accepts the view that everything is the fault of the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was elected a member of the Australian Senate I was asked to become a member of the World Peace Council. I accepted that position in the belief that I could make an impact at that level and that I could help achieve some balance on this matter. I reject entirely the simplistic and erroneous conclusions that Senator Martyr drew because I allowed my membership to lapse. I do not go along with the view, indeed neither does the Australian Labor Party nor substantial sections of the peace movement, that the fault with respect to the current problems of nuclear weapons lies on one side. There is an understanding that concessions need to be made, concessions of the type that began with the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty-SALT I and SALT II-agreements. It is a matter of regret that such is the suspicion that exists that these talks between the super-powers have been stalled in more recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely what we have to do is not to suggest, as some people do, that everything the Americans do is wrong or everything the Russians put forward is wrong; some concessions have to be made in the minds of the people of the world, the people who will rise above governments. I point out to Senator Martyr that the overwhelming sentiment of the people of the Soviet Union would be towards a peaceful solution of world tension. I concede that the same desire exists amongst the people of the United States and among the people of Australia. To suggest that governments, in the long run, can ignore the views of their own citizens in these matters is to ignore the reality of the way in which public opinion can play its part. The United Nations conference on disarmament was about harnessing world opinion. It encouraged people to put aside their beliefs that prejudices are more important than finding a consensus approach to the problems facing the world today. To achieve that, we have to accept that good will can be found in both the United States' position and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics' position. Therefore, we have to get out of the area--</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make a statement on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industry outlining the Government's response to the report from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations into the Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1982. Senator Rae, Chairman of the Committee, tabled the report on 19 May 1982. The committee's review arose in the context of a Review of Commonwealth Functions' decision that the Government's policy of recovering approximately half of the total costs of export inspection be extended to several industries, including honey, from 1 July 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee's principal recommendations are, in summary, that current honey inspection procedures be abandoned and replaced by a system of limited random sampling and testing of honey by the Department of Primary Industry; that the system of export control through export permits be abandoned; that exporters be required to bear the responsibility for sampling and cost of analysis where a ' Certificate in Respect of Honey' is required; and that the department continue its role in relation to inspecting premises for registration as export establishments. The committee also recommended that charging not be proceeded with and that the size and role of the Australian Honey Board be reviewed when new stabilization arrangements for the industry come under government consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's views were based on submitted evidence of only a very limited incidence of malpractice in the Honey Export Industry, and on the basis that commercial contract and Australian Honey Board controls based on the colour classification of honey should themselves assure adequate control through the operation of market forces. Since receipt of the Committee's report, evidence has come to hand indicating that possible adulteration of export honey has been taking place. New methodology developed and introduced by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories earlier this year has shown evidence indicative of adulteration of Australian export honey by the addition of glucose syrup in twelve samples drawn from export honey consignments. Such addition can lighten the colour and taste of honey and also improve the bulk of honey otherwise substandard due to excess moisture. Further investigations are proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned to investigate and control all instances indicative of malpractice and fraud in the export food industry. These were fundamental aims when inspection was first introduced and have not changed. The Government's response to the Committee's report has been conditioned by this consideration. Importantly, the Government recognises the need to continue basic export inspection monitoring of honey to safeguard against malpractice and to ensure continued acceptability of the product on world markets. The major area relating to inspection in which follow-up action is proposed concerns the sampling and analysis of export honey where overseas authorities require analysis and related certification as a condition of importation. It is appropriate that the responsibility for obtaining such analysis should rest with the exporter rather than the Department of Primary Industry. Arrangements will be phased in requiring exporters to arrange for sampling and analysis at their cost rather than as a cost to revenue. Such sampling would be in accordance with recognised standards. The Department of Primary Industry would monitor sampling activity by industry and also maintain some basic analysis to ensure that samples are representative of export shipments. </PARA>
<PARA>Aside from this, the scope for savings is limited. Honey inspection already substantially takes the form of a limited sampling and monitoring operation. It forms part of the activities of dairy inspection staff located Australia-wide. The effort in total involves the equivalent of only three people. Cuts would not achieve substantial savings but could seriously compromise the effectiveness of control. In the light of recent events the Government is not prepared to do this . The Committee's recommendations that export permits be abolished and that the Department continue to inspect premises for registration as export establishments raise questions of the method in which control over export shipments of honey is to be maintained in the future. The export permit system is a central and important feature of the inspection operation both in honey and in other commodities subject to control. The Government is aware, however, that there is some overlap between it and the Australian Honey Board's certification procedures. The question of possible better co-ordination of requirements in these areas is being pursued in the context of a broader review of export inspection activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of introducing charges for honey export inspection will also be reassessed as part of this broader review. It is essential that costs involved in exporting should as far as possible be contained, and the Government is concerned in this regard that inspection arrangements should be both cost- effective and at the minimum levels necessary for effective basic control. Until these matters are resolved on a broader basis, for products such as fresh, dried and processed fruits and vegetables, fish and dairy foods, it would be inappropriate to reconsider charges for honey. The Government will also act on the Committee's recommendation that the size and role of the Australian Honey Board be reviewed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement is not very clearly worded in my view but the Government seems to have rejected the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations partly because since the Committee's report was received evidence has come to hand indicating the adulteration of honey with glucose syrup. If the Government is hanging its case largely on that peg it does not seem to me to be a very solid peg on which to hang it because if such adulteration has taken place it has taken place under the previous system under which all export consignments were sampled and tested. It may not have been possible in the past to test accurately for the forms of adulteration which it is believed have been discovered now. The procedures which have been followed in the past have demonstrably failed to prevent that malpractice if indeed such malpractice existed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has rejected the principal recommendation of the Committee which was that sampling be done on a random basis rather than on an across the board basis and that quite heavy penalties be imposed for the failure to maintain the required standards or for attempts to adulterate the product. I believe that still would have been the best course to follow because the sampling procedures used in the past, according to evidence given before the Committee, were largely of an honour system nature in any case-that is, the samples were usually, if not usually then frequently, drawn by the exporters themselves and handed to the inspectors of the Department of Primary Industry. The samples were not, at least in some cases and apparently in most cases, actually drawn off by the DPI inspectors. The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Committee that , for those few markets where certification and analysis are required, the quite substantial costs of doing that fairly exhaustive analysis should be borne by the exporters to those few markets rather than be a generalised charge on exports as a whole. The Government has decided to defer the final consideration of the Committee recommendation that export permits be abolished. The evidence given to the Committee stated that export permits were very rarely required by the overseas customers. </PARA>
<PARA> While I welcome the Government's acceptance of the Committee recommendation-and I was a member of the Committee-that the exporters bear the cost of a fairly comprehensive analysis for the minority markets which require it, I do not believe the Government has presented an adequate case for continuing the practice of across-the-board sampling which appears to be what the Government intends. The fact that malpractice under the pre-existing system has been detected certainly does not justify the continuation of that system. Unless the Department of Primary Industry is to tighten up very considerably the sampling procedures that were explained to the Committee, there seems to be absolutely no point in continuing to sample in the way in which it has been done in the past, that is, of all consignments. I still believe that the Committee's recommendation was the sounder, that is, that random checks be made and that quite significant penalties be applied to exporters who are detected by those random checks to have failed to maintain the required standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks are similar to those made by Senator Walsh. I believe that the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations would have given a far better basis for proceeding in this area. It seems to me that the Government's response is based somewhat on the possible attempts of the Department of Primary Industry to justify itself after the event, when one reads on page 2 of the Government's response about possible adulteration of honey by glucose. Of course, glucose occurs naturally in honey. I understand that often the natural content can be as high as 35 per cent. The tests referred to in the Government's response were made in Western Australia. As I understand the situation, those tests were inconclusive as to whether glucose was of natural origin or had been added. It seems to me rather odd that it has been the practice extending back some 30 years for glucose to be added to export honey to generate a range of products. Of course, the product then is not able to be sold as pure Australian honey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When this possible adulteration was raised, almost immediately after the Government had moved to discharge the Honey (Export Charges) Bill from the Notice Paper the reply came from the industry that this was an attempt to show why the very reasonable recommendations of the Senate Committee with respect to the costs and the ability to control the export of honey should not be proceeded with. Of course, the Department in seeking to justify its previously rather odd position sought to bring this point forward. It seems also rather odd that no further points have been raised since that time about the possible adulteration of honey. It is now quite a few months since that adulteration in Western Australia was announced. I would have thought that, rather than a comment that further investigations are proceeding, we might have been able at this stage to have a more definitive comment in relation to the Western Australian analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Senate Committee brought forward a very reasonable report. It was welcomed by the industry as not imposing undue charges on a very tenuous export industry. I believe that the Government may be better advised to look at that again, particularly in these extremely difficult times for the maintenance of exports when we should avoid at all costs imposing on producers additional charges which they can ill afford to pay. </PARA>

Table 3.1 on page 7 of the report shows that while local production actually fell by 2,000 units between 1979-80 and 1981-82 imports skyrocketed from 84,000 units to 203,000 units-an increase of something like 142 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The market share held by locally produced air conditioners has fallen from 42 per cent in 1979-80 to just 23 per cent in 1981-82. I think this situation is fairly indicative of what has been happening to many of our manufacturing industries in Australia in recent years. Kelvinator pointed out during the inquiry that the increasing level of imports was clearly to blame for the fall in employment in this area of its operations from 546 in 1980 to 458 in June 1982. The report makes the point that imports have not only a price advantage but also certain design advantages. For example, the Kelvinator units are based on a 1972 design while importers claim that their units have undergone major redesign since then and Kelvinator uses more expensive piston type compressors whereas imported models use cheaper rotary compressors. I make the point here that there is no indication whatsoever that wages in Australia are the cause of this price differential. In fact, the tables on page 5 show that the number of air conditioners produced at Kelvinator per employee rose from 101 .1 in 1980-81 to 129.6 in 1981-82-in other words, productivity in this area increased by something like 28 per cent in that 12-month period while real average weekly earnings increased last year by just 6 per cent. This proves quite clearly that price disadvantage is a result of design and technical considerations rather than labour costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another point I want to make concerns an answer given to a question I put to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) on Tuesday last week. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the imported summer stocks with which Kelvinator will be competing for this summer's trade are already imported. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, he was incorrect-only 70 per cent of imports expected in 1982-83, or about 160,000 units had landed by the end of October, according to this report. In other words, another 70,000 units are still to be imported to this country for this summer's trade. Yet the estimated sales of room air conditioners in Australia in 1982-83 are expected to be only around 190,000 units, according to Kelvinator. It is most unlikely that sales will be higher than this in the present economic climate. The Temporary Assistance Authority said that it makes no sense to apply quotas at this stage. Instead, Kelvinator should be given a bounty so that the price disadvantage can be eliminated. My main worry with this proposal is that there is still no guarantee that people will buy Kelvinator air conditioners because people take other things into account, such as design factors, as I mentioned earlier. On the other hand, if we immediately stopped further imports, that is, if a quota were applied in such a way as to prevent another 70,000 models being imported, Kelvinator would automatically have a potential market of 60,000 units. With the Temporary Assistance Authority's recommendations potential local production is practically zero, especially given the surplus stock of imports. What Kelvinator is asking for-this is shown in Appendix D of the report-is surely not unreasonable because it would give it the breathing space it requires until its proposed investment plans are completed. I seek leave to incorporate Appendix D in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Kelvinator   1. Alignment of RAC tariffs with those of other major appliances. This would have the effect of raising the tariff from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for the period from July 1982 to June 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>2. An increase in the tariff will not by itself allow the immediate problems to be surmounted, because of the present pricing attitudes of some importers. The short-term assistance requested will be best effected by ensuring a consistent market share for the locally produced product. This market share should be 36 per cent-the share held in 1979-80. To achieve this we seek quotas, calculated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) In the first year total imports for the twelve months to 30 June 1983 need to be limited to 94 000 units, calculated as follows:</PARA>

In 1983-84 we forecast that the market will recover and that sales to consumers will be 220 000 units. No excess stock problem is forecast at either Retail or Wholesale level, and the requested quota of 141 000 units is calculated as follows:</PARA>

A bounty system in conjunction with a form of quota protection would have been a more sensible compromise in the circumstances. Those measures, combined with a vigorous media campaign to convince people to buy Australian made goods, would have a greater chance of success than the Temporary Assistance Authority's recommendations which have been adopted by the Government. Unless we start vigorously promoting Australian made products and develop a greater awareness in the community that buying locally produced goods will actually save jobs in Australia the current problems will remain with us.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> This week the Statistics Group of the Parliamentary Library released its monthly economic and social indicators. The figures on trade show quite clearly what has been happening. These figures were mentioned yesterday by Senator Evans when he was attempting to give the Leader of the Government in the Senate ( Senator Sir John Carrick) a lesson on economics. Table 4.1 on page 18 of the Statistics Group's document shows quite clearly how imports have risen over the last few years. I think that table was incorporated in Hansard yesterday so I do not seek leave to have it incorporated today. It shows that in 1981-82 imports rose by 17 per cent over the previous year from $19,188m to $22,451m. This was on top of a 21 per cent increase in the previous year. If we look at the figures on retail sales in table 5.1 on page 22 of the Statistics Group's document we see that in 1981-82 sales rose by 12.4 per cent over the previous year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we look at these figures and compare them with the import figures I have just mentioned it is fairly clear that imports are rising at a much higher rate than retail sales. There was a 21 per cent increase in imports in 1980-81 compared with a 14 per cent increase in sales and a 17 per cent increase in imports last financial year compared with a 12 per cent increase in sales. Therefore, quite clearly, imports are assuming a greater share of the market. I believe that this is a problem that the Government refuses to acknowledge and come to grips with. With retail sales beginning to fall in real terms the problem will become even more acute unless the Government acts now to restrict the flow of imports. Even the Australian Industries Development Association recently complained about the unprecedented increase in dumping by overseas countries. Apparently many overseas companies, in an attempt to remain viable in the current depressed economic world climate, are dumping goods on the Australian market at prices well below actual production costs. Unfortunately the Federal Government's action to deal with this has been largely ineffective. The Australian Industries Development Association has now called on the Government to change the import procedures. For instance, as the position stands , the burden of proof so far as dumping is concerned is on local producers, whereas it should really be on importers. Unless this Government changes its attitude and realises the damage that is being done to our manufacturing industries, the situation can only get worse.</PARA></TALK.START>

That surely is an admission of failure or helplessness. The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick, is always talking about lower wages in other countries. What he omits to say is that unemployment in those countries is well into double figures, which goes to show just how effective is a reduction in real wages in bringing about a fall in unemployment-it does not work. The fact is that the only glimmer of hope for the Australian economy in 1981-82 was the improvement in the level of retail sales, which came about as a direct result of the increase in real wages. If this had not occurred in 1981-82, unemployment would have been even higher than it is at present and our manufacturing industries would have been in an even worse position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Government is now proposing is so simplistic and ill thought out that it will lead to a complete collapse of consumer confidence. If real wages fall, real retail sales will fall also and even more will become unemployed.

Unless this Government moves now to protect Australia's industries from highly efficient producers, such as Japan, and assists in the restructuring and revitalising of our industries, employment levels will continue to fall.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to use the opportunity afforded by this debate to pay recognition to a great Liberal. It would be most remiss of me, in what is perhaps the second last week of the session, to allow an opportunity to pass without giving an adequate recognition following the resignation of Sir Phillip Lynch from the Federal Parliament. He made a consistent and conscientious contribution to the Liberal Party from the time he was first elected as Member for Flinders in 1966. It is indeed to be regretted that ill health forced his decision to step down from parliamentary life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Phillip Lynch's success was brought about by hard work. It was stated in the Age newspaper that he would 'stick his hand in a fire for the Party, emerge uncomplaining and return to another 18-hour day in his office'. His rise within the Liberal Party was all the more meritorious in that he did not come from the establishment. Qualifying as a teacher from Melbourne University with a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma in Education he went on to become a management consultant and national president of the Jaycee movement. In my student days, when studying political science, I recall a tutor saying that it would be almost impossible for a Roman Catholic to become President of the United States of America. In subsequent years John F. Kennedy resoundingly squashed that theory, but I must admit that sort of thinking from that tutor was still around in conservative circles in Australia when the then Phillip Lynch was making his mark in Liberal Party politics. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Phillip made an exceptionally distinguished contribution to Australia through his parliamentary service. He joined the Ministry in 1968 under Sir John Gorton as Minister for the Army. This was followed by appointments as Minister for Immigration, Minister assisting the Treasurer and Minister for Labour and National Service. He was then shadow Treasurer, prior to becoming Treasurer when the Liberal Party was returned to office in 1975. His portfolios since have included Minister for Finance and, until 11 October this year, Minister for Industry and Commerce. Sir Phillip was also Acting Prime Minister on two occasions. As Treasurer and Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch has been involved in decisions which affected all Australians. He is to be admired for his hard work and ability, particularly in restraining inflation an in restoring sanity and sound economic mangement when following the Whitlam years he became Treasurer. For 10 years he was Deputy Leader of the Federal Liberal Parliamentary Party. He made a magnificent contribution in this capacity largely as a team coach, as a fix-it person and as an anchorman. He also engendered loyalty and stability within the party. </PARA>
<PARA> Most great men are remembered by their last major activity. Richard Nixon's great achievement was in establishing a rapprochement with China but this generation unfortunately remembers him for Watergate. Regrettably, Sir Phillip Lynch's achievements have been overshadowed by his chairmanship of the razor gang. His ability and his presence in this Parliament will be greatly missed. But Sir Phillip Lynch must feel content in the knowledge that he has served this country well. Our Liberal Party must continue to attract the sons of blue collar workers and, indeed, the blue collar workers themselves. We must be seen to be a party which has amongst its numbers people from all sectors of society. Phillip Lynch, I thank you for your contribution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I take advantage of the first reading of the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill-the stage at which we can make comments which are not necessarily relevant to the Bill-to make some comment about television programs which are broadcast during the Christmas-New Year period. We are now fast approaching the Christmas-New Year period. For many people this gives them a chance to relax, put up their feet and enjoy the simple pleasures of life for which we usually do not have time. One of those simple pleasures of life is watching television. I admit that during the festive season we tend to relax and, therefore, may be less inclined to be critical. However, there is a limit to human endurance. I suggest that many television stations and programmers are pushing us to the very edge of those limits of endurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year during the Christmas period I was utterly appalled at the fare which was offered to metropolitan television viewers, not only in my own State of Queensland but also in other States. In Brisbane, the capital of the State which I represent, viewers have a choice of three commercial stations. During the last Christmas-New Year period this boiled down to a choice between old programs, inferior programs and repeats. As a rule television viewers do not have a profound knowledge of the broadcasting industry but they realise that what happens over the Christmas-New Year period is more than coincidence or bad luck. What happens is summed up in one word-the word that strikes fear and obedience into the hearts of television executives all over Australia-that is, ratings. At Christmas time, ratings surveys, like many Australians, take holidays. Unfortunately, so do the broadcasting stations. Because there are no all- important ratings surveys television programmers feel free to dish up inferior programs secure in the knowledge that it will not be reflected in the ratings and thus their advertising revenue will not be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Christmas I was not alone in thinking that what was offered to television viewers was not good enough. After many people spoke to me I made a public statement about the dreadful programs that were being foisted upon viewers. I suggested that the Government could undertake official ratings surveys during the Christmas-New Year period and publish the results of these surveys to keep the television stations on their toes. I must admit that television executives were less than enthusiastic about my comments and suggestions. In fact, some of them contacted me and were quite pointed in their remarks, saying that I was not giving them the justice which they deserved. On the other hand, I was overwhelmed with positive responses from disgusted and disgruntled viewers. At the suggestion of some of them I was prompted, on their behalf, to distribute a petition on the matter. Thousands of Queenslanders were sufficiently motivated to sign a petition saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Some television stations throughout Australia are taking advantage of the absence of ratings surveys during the Christmas-New Year period holiday season to broadcast inferior quality programs and innumerable repeats. </PARA>
<PARA>The petition called upon the Government to 'undertake and publish the results of ratings surveys during holiday periods to encourage the broadcasting of quality TV programs at those times'. I add that my comments were directed principally towards metropolitan stations. To be fair, I must say that there were some bright spots on TV programming, but they were few and far between. From my observations and from comments made to me it seemed that provincial stations in Queensland made every effort to maintain viewing standards in the holiday season . I congratulate those stations for this. I take this opportunity of warning TV stations, especially the producers and programmers in the State which I represent, that the public trusts that they have taken note of the view of a large number of Queenslanders that they deserve better during our Christmas-New Year holiday period. I trust that some of the stations will not insult viewers' intelligence with some of the mindless drivel to which we were subjected this time last year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity presented to me by the first reading stage of the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill to make some comments on behalf of the Opposition about the current crisis in the Australian film industry. It is a matter of great concern to the Australian Labor Party. It is certainly a matter of great concern to people working in the industry. I believe it is increasingly a matter of concern to the public, particularly the film-going public, that our film industry, of which we have justifiably been so proud in recent years, is currently in a state of severe crisis. The reason for this is not that we have any lack of talent among directors, actors, writers, technicians or camera persons. It would seem that we have an abundance of talented people and ideas. The reason is that private investment in the local film industry has virtually dried up. This has come about largely as a result of the Government's negligence with regard to one particular tax concession scheme and its incompetence insofar as its own film tax concession scheme is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The crisis has been brought on by a number of factors, but the most crippling is the channelling of Australian investment moneys into overseas film production through a particular use of section 51 (1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. There are problems with the Government's own film tax concessions scheme which operates under Division 10BA of the taxation Act. These include the one-year completion regulation and the inadequacy of the Australian content requirement. But the most important problem which the Government has failed to address throughout this year is the use of section 51 (1). As film financing schemes using section 51 (1) have flourished, investment for Australian films has dried up. A significant number of local projects has been shelved. The number of Australian feature films produced has gone from over 30 in the last financial year to about only six in production now. As I have said before in this place, the main company involved in marketing this scheme under section 51 (1) is United Artists (Australasia) Pty Ltd, although there are other companies involved in this, including a company called Transpacific Media Productions. </PARA>
<PARA> Our major objection to this scheme-we have many-is that it encourages Australian investment in overseas films. If one invests one's money in a film which is marketed through this scheme one is offered a 375 per cent tax concession on the money one invests and there is no requirement at all that the film be an Australian film. In comparison, the concession offered under the Government's scheme-a 150 per cent tax concession-is not attracting investors. The Australian Labor Party has many criticisms of the Government's scheme, but the one thing about it that the Labor Party supports is that it is an attempt to help the local industry. In order to qualify for a tax concession under the Government's scheme a film project has to be certified as Australian by the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. At least that means that the bulk of the assistance going via this scheme goes to Australian productions. In the case of the section 51 (1) scheme there is no such requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Australian taxpayer is subsidising both of these schemes. I think it is very important to point out to the general public particularly that the operation of a tax concession scheme to assist an industry is, in terms of revenue forgone as far as the taxpayer is concerned, equivalent to a direct grant or a direct form of assistance. What happens is that taxpayers have their tax bill reduced by a certain amount of money. That money, therefore, is not available to the Government to spend on services and other things. The effect is the same as if the Government had the money and allocated it to the industry. So we are talking about the use of Australian taxpayers' money in both of these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980-81 the loss to revenue through deductions claimed in respect of section 51 (1) film tax schemes was actually greater than the loss to revenue through the Government's Division 10BA scheme. That is, it appears that taxpayers paid more in 1980-81 to support foreign films than they did to support our own film industry. I have evidence to support this assertion. This matter was pursued on my behalf by my colleague Senator McLaren at Senate Estimates Committee C. In response to questions asked by Senator McLaren, the Second Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Black, stated that in 1980-81 the loss to tax revenue attributable to the Government's Division 10BA scheme to support Australian films was $13m. Mr Black went on to say that the amount of tax lost through film schemes using section 51 (1) of the tax Act was $16m in 1980-81. That is very clear evidence that the scheme operated by UAA and others, which encourages investment in foreign films, is actually a greater drain on our revenue than the scheme which is intended to help the local industry. As I think there will be a fair amount of interest in these figures, at this point I seek leave to table the letter from the Commissioner of Taxation which gave this information. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Whilst the figures for 1981-82 might be slightly better than last year's figures because of the large number of Australian films made in that year, it is certain that the 1982-83 figures will show that section 51 (1) schemes have taken out almost all of the investment and tax concessions available to the industry. What I want to ask now and what I have asked previously on more than one occasion in this place is: Why does the Government tolerate this draining of funds, this haemorrhaging of film investment funds, from our industry to overseas? The Government has been aware of the problem for a long time but has failed to take effective action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As early as June 1981 this matter was raised in the Senate. Former Senator Puplick actually raised the activities of UAA in his speech on the introduction of the Government's tax incentive scheme for films. I have raised the problems created by section 51 (1) schemes on a number of occasions-in a fairly complete way in a speech to the Senate on 26 May this year and in subsequent question and Press releases. The media has widely publicised the effects of the section 51 (1 ) schemes. Australian Business carried a substantial article on the activities of UAA in February this year. Subsequently, the issue has been canvassed by all the financial Press and also in a number of television programs. I think Four Corners had a long item on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Numerous delegations from various sections of the film industry have come to Canberra to bring their concerns about this matter to the attention of the Government. Opposition members have met with them on many occasions. When the Government had still done nothing the industry got together in Sydney in October at the Theatre Royal to develop its strategies as an industry to deal with the problem. I was at that meeting, which was attended by over 700 people. At this stage I would like to read part of the resolution that was passed at that meeting. The resolution reads:</PARA>
<PARA> We express abhorrence at the rise of new film financing schemes operating under section 51 (1) of the Tax Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The next effect of such schemes is to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Have the Australian taxpayers fund overseas produced, and controlled, films. This is highlighted in UAA's involvement in the films Arthur and Superman III. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Sabotage the efforts of Australian producers raising funds for genuinely Australian films since the section 51 (1) tax advantages more than double the tax concessions available in 10BA. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. These schemes escape the requirements of 10BA arrangements which insist on concessions being granted to genuine Australian films only. </PARA>
<PARA>The resolution went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> We call on the Federal Government to take immediate action to close this threat to the industry by including a strong anti-gearing provision for film expenditure under section 51 (1), in order to halt the activities of companies such as Trans-Pacific Media and UAA. </PARA>
<PARA>The response of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has been too little and too late. After some weak-kneed statements he has finally set up a working party of industry representatives to develop procedures for overcoming the investment crisis. When the Australian film industry, which has brought so much to this country in terms of our international reputation and our cultural development and which has provided much needed jobs for the local work force, is on the brink of collapse, I think the decision of the Treasurer merely to set up a working party can hardly be regarded as adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> What should the Treasurer do? In the view of the Australian Labor Party the Treasurer should do what it will do as soon as it gets into government-that is, to make it clear to the public and to investors that section 51 (1) was not intended to operate in the way it is currently being used for film investment schemes and to announce that this loophole will be closed. I acknowledge that there may be technical problems in closing the loophole. Some time may elapse between the making of the statement and the closing of the loophole. But it ought to be clear, once the Treasurer announces his intention to do so, that the loophole will be closed. Presumably, sensible investors would not continue to invest in such schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major task to which the Treasurer should address himself is ironing out the defects in the Government's Division 10BA film tax incentive scheme. First amongst these defects is the provision in that scheme which requires producers to mount, shoot, edit and release a film all within the one financial year in order to secure effective tax concessions for their investors. The Labor Party warned at the outset of what the consequences of this provision would be and, indeed, those warnings have turned out to be very well founded. What happens under this scheme is that there is an encouragement of tax avoidance. There is a bunching of productions because all the films have to be made within the same period and the amount of time is too short to make films properly. The quality of Australian films is suffering quite seriously as a result. This has already been noticed by international film critics and the reputation of Australian films overseas, which has been so high, is starting to suffer because of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The film industry has come up with some detailed proposals which would have the effect of allowing the films to be made, edited and marketed over a period of 24 months. We believe the Treasurer ought to give urgent and sympathetic attention to that recommendation. It is certainly the view of the Labor Party that it will , when in office, review the level of the concession-150 per cent-because it seems to it to be too high, but we believe the scheme should operate in such a way as to provide stability and permanence for the industry. At this stage we would co-operate with the Treasurer to get rid of this bunching effect and this unrealistically short timetable. </PARA>
<PARA> The last thing the Treasurer needs to do-I see my time is running out and I want to emphasise this point-to repair the damage that Government policies, or lack of effective Government policies, have caused to the Australian film industry is to tighten the Australian content requirements of a 10BA film. In particular, money paid as salaries to overseas film personnel should not attract the 150 per cent tax concession. This would avoid any repetition of productions such as Pirate Movie, which had two American lead actors plus an American director, art director and executive producer but somehow got its certificate as an Australian film and attracted tax concessions from the Australian taxpayers for all of the wage bills. My questions of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) as Minister representing the Treasurer as to how this film managed to qualify for tax concessions under the Australian scheme have remained on the Notice Paper unanswered for many months. I think that in itself is a sign of the negligence of the Government with respect to this urgent matter . </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian film industry has in the past received strong bipartisan support from this Parliament. That the Government has allowed the film industry to reach its current desperate state is, as I have said, an act of negligence. That it fails to take decisive action at this stage I think is inexcusable. I hope that my remarks today, which I will convey to the Treasurer and to the Government, will cause the Government to act quickly and urgently to address what is a very serious problem. I hope that we can return very soon to a position where the whole of the Parliament is acting in a co-operative way to ensure a stable, successful and flourishing Australian film industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I want to take advantage of the few minutes that are available to refer again to the problems of East Timor and to repudiate the statements that were made by Mr Whitlam, a former Australian Prime Minister, at the recent United Nations discussion on decolonisation. I want to refer to the problems that have resulted from the aggressive action of the Indonesian Government in invading East Timor in December 1975 and the subsequent process of a so-called act of self- determination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to remind the Senate that following World War II a number of important declarations were made, including the Atlantic Charter, the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations' own charter. These declarations established some very important fundamental principles including not only the principle of freedom of expression in political and religious matters but also the principle of self-determination. We have seen changes of tremendous magnitude in the last 30 years. A total of 64 nations were present at the foundation of the United Nations. The fact that this number now has crept up to almost 150 indicates the degree to which the act of self-determination has taken place-sometimes peacefully and sometimes not so peacefully. Nevertheless, the pious hopes expressed and the declarations made at the end of World War II have slowly but surely been put into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a world community of nations in which the principles of self- determination have been established for indigenous people. I do not believe that one can have different attitudes on this matter. I think either one supports the principles of self-determination or one does not. I support them unequivocally. I believe that the principles of self-determination have equal validity in respect of Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Namibia and East Timor. Therefore, I completely and utterly repudiate the stand that was taken by Mr Whitlam at the United Nations, where he was grilled for a considerable number of hours about his attempts to defend the annexation by the Indonesians of a country that admittedly has a population of only 600,000. Many of the members of the United Nations and many of the nations in our Asian-Pacific region have populations of fewer than 600,000. Therefore, one cannot say that a different policy or different principle should apply because of the size of the nation. One can only accept that the principle of self-determination applies universally, unilaterally and indivisibly. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to go on the public record as supporting the courageous and, in my view, correct position that was taken by Senator McIntosh in a private capacity at the meeting that Mr Whitlam attended. Mr Whitlam tried to suggest that although Portuguese Timor, commonly known as East Timor, had been colonised by the Portuguese some 400 years ago the Portuguese had abdicated their responsibilities at the time of the overthrow of the right wing dictatorship in Portugal in 1974 by not taking a much more determined position in respect of East Timor, something which they did in respect of a number of territories which were part of the old Portuguese empire in the African continent. I do not disagree with that. However, I think that Mr Whitlam's suggestion that there is some indigenous ethnic link between the people of Timor and the people of Indonesia belies the fact that they are different races of people. Thus the former colony was entitled to self-determination, and the United Nations and surrounding countries had a responsibility to assist in that process. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of Mr Whitlam's argument was that the independent movement in East Timor really had no claim to legal government after the abdication of power by Portugal because it had not carried on a war of liberation against the Portuguese authority. What Mr Whitlam ignored, of course, was that the Army officers in Portuguese Timor, who were part of a junior officer movement in Portugal proper that overthrew the right wing dictatorship in that country, advised the people of Timor not to wage a war of liberation which they could not win because they did not have outside support. These officers, who belonged to a group which overthrew the dictatorship in Portugal and established a democratic state there, told the Timorese that they should bide their time until there took place in Portugal events which would enable a peaceful transfer of power from the old colonial regime to the indigenous people of Timor. I think that was the correct advice. Surely we would all support and encourage advice aimed at winning independence and establishing self-determination without bloodshed. </PARA>
<PARA> I give credit to the officers, some of whom I met when I visited Timor in early 1975 and subsequently met again when I went to Portugal some years ago, for giving the people that sort of advice. But Mr Whitlam has suggested that the people of East Timor, having taken that sort of advice, are not entitled to determine their own affairs and ought to be annexed by a major power in the region. Mr Whitlam went on to say that he had no knowledge of the situation. I remind Mr Whitlam that at a meeting of the National Executive of our party he admitted to me in a discussion about Timor that Australia knew everything that was going on in the region. I can only say that I accepted that statement because if our intelligence organisations did not know about the arms build-up on the borders of Timor there would have been something wrong with them. I would have thought that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation would have had sufficient evidence at its disposal to advise the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of discussions that Labor Ministers Moss Cass and Gordon Bryant and I, as a back bench member who had been to Timor, had with former Senator Willesee, who was then the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I can only say that Mr Whitlam's memory is very faded. Only a week or two before the Whitlam Government was removed from office as a result of the actions of former Governor-General Kerr, at one o'clock one morning when we were having a discussion about what we could do in respect of the problem that obviously existed in Timor, Senator Willesee indicated that his Department had knowledge of the Indonesian build-up in that area. So Mr Whitlam's memory of events is certainly faded and belies the facts conclusively. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to an article that Peter Hastings wrote for the Sydney Morning Herald of 12 June 1975 as a result of my representations to Mr Whitlam following my first visit to East Timor. A simple request was made of Prime Minister Whitlam at that time about which Peter Hastings, strangely enough, having regard to his current attitude, made the point that there was a major advantage in Australia's having a consulate operating in East Timor. If we had opened a consulate there the whole course of events and the position today may well have been different. I cannot understand why Peter Hastings's attitude has changed, except that there is the school of thought in the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs, I suppose in some sections of the media and in the Australian public that at all costs we have to maintain a friendly and subservient attitude towards Indonesia. I do not accept that position if in observance of it people's rights are trampled upon. The people's rights in East Timor have been trampled upon. </PARA>
<PARA> I was fortunate enough to go back to East Timor in September of that year, again as a member of a parliamentary delegation, and to see the tremendous amount of support amongst ordinary people in Timor for the act of self- determination. There were large public rallies. We spoke to a Catholic bishop, nuns, church dignitories, shopkeepers, villagers and a whole range of people. What we were told was sufficient to indicate to us that the people of that small country-600,000 of them-and their representatives, the opinion makers in that country, were keen to have the right to determine their affairs. They did not want to be annexed by Indonesia. The Apodeti Party, which was the pro-Indonesia party, had very little support in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it hard to understand how a person such as Mr Whitlam, who has stood for the realities of life in respect of foreign affairs, has succumbed to the pressures from Indonesia in the belief that it is more important to protect the interests of that country, which has many problems of its own, than it is to protect the interests of the people in Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that Senator McIntosh was able to bring back statements signed by substantial numbers of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate in respect of the problems in East Timor. Opinions were taken from across the whole political spectrum, as was the case in this place. Prominent members of both of the major political parties in the United States, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, have written to the United States President and to the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in that country in support of Portugal-as indeed the United States did at the United Nations in proposing the motion that it did-which country has asserted that it has the right to determine the future of East Timor. The resolution that was finally adopted recognised that right. Substantial numbers of members of both Houses of the United States Parliament have signified to the American President their support of those important principles. I can only hope that sooner or later the people of East Timor will have the opportunity, as we demand in our country and is demanded in every other country, to determine their own affairs, to have self -determination. I hope that that country will not be annexed by a power that believes that it has the right to have influence in the whole region. If we give away that position, it seems to me that we will stand the risk of Indonesia saying sooner or later, that it has the right to be interested in Papua New Guinea and in parts of Melanesia. That is an objective which I think ought to be repudiated at this stage by any right-thinking person. I therefore deplore the views expressed by Mr Whitlam at the United Nations decolonisation discussions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the eight minutes remaining in this segment of the Senate's activities I wish to present some thoughts relating to some key features of the Australian Labor Party's national housing policy. I think it needs to be said at the outset that in having a national housing policy the Labor Party is immediately distinguished from the Liberal Party of Australia which, in seven years of neglect of this very important social and employment- generating aspect of our society, has seen housing stocks diminished to an intolerable degree and which at the same time has seen interest rates-coupled with diminishing real incomes, cause very real hardship to many Australians and their families. The fact is that the national Government needs to develop a policy in order to provide simple shelter for Australians, an increasing number of people, that is the key issue. For example, many hundreds of thousands of Australians dwell in caravan parks around the country, not out of choice but out of necessity. One can imagine the sort of living conditions that such a situation provides for bringing up a young family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One also thinks beyond the issue of basic shelter to that of sheer fairness and equity within a rich society. Affluent people like Mrs Susan Sangster are paying some $6m for a waterfront home in Sydney saving, of course, another $1m in order to redecorate it. At the same time, millions of other Australians are struggling to fulfil their dream of purchasing a home at a manageable cost over a period of years, are facing public housing lists of such dimensions that it seems pointless to put one's name down, or are caught in the private rental market in which one out of every five Australians finds himself or herself. It is not often understood that 20 per cent of Australians depend on the private rental market in order to ensure their accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are facing a crisis. There is no doubt about that. In late September churches right around Australia devoted a weekend to highlighting the crisis in housing. In recent days the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace has issued a report entitled 'House and Home.' I commend it to all those who want a clear and compassionate summary of the housing situation in Australia, with some very tough-minded suggestions as to some solutions. But the fact is that those churches and, indeed, other community groups have condemned the Government for not having a national housing policy. The Government does not have a national housing policy, as symbolised by the fact that there is now no federal Minister responsible for housing. In May 1982, that part of the ministry for housing and construction relating to housing was abolished. I think that is an indictment of the present Government. Certainly the Australian Labor Party, when it assumes office, will re-establish the Department of Urban and Regional Development as the means by which responsibility will be accepted by an incoming national Labor government for the provision of circumstances in which Australians can house themselves decently and at manageable cost. </PARA>
<PARA> In the five minutes now available to me I have time to talk only about the fact that in relation to public housing, for example, State governments are now getting only one-seventh of the finance they received from the Commonwealth seven years ago. One can imagine the social consequences of this for individual Australians. It was Canon Hollingworth, who, in a letter to the Australian some weeks ago, condemned the present Federal Government for the grave restriction on funds moving into the public housing sector over which it has presided during its term of office. The incoming ALP government will certainly renegotiate the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. It will make available an extra $170m in the first year for public housing construction and public rental accommodation. It will make available an extra $10m for community amenities in public housing estates. We see the provision of housing as being much more than the provision of a mere shelter. Community amenities are part of the provision of a full social context for the bringing up of young Australians in particular. We say that some $15m ought to be made available for use by local government in areas of high housing priority. </PARA>
<PARA> The public housing program needs to be reinvigorated, not only, as I say, for the provision of housing opportunities to those who are squeezed at the moment in the private rental market-some one in 20 Australians find themselves in that sector-but also in order to stimulate the construction industry. Governments can put money into public housing but, of course, governments do not own the brick kilns, the timber mills, the carpet factories, the window glazing factories and so on. All of this money will flow into the community via the stimulus which undoubtedly housing construction provides. It will also, of course, provide opportunities for the utilising of the skills of Australians which are at present not used at all because of the failure of so many firms in the construction industry and the consequent putting aside, throwing into redundancy , of many skilled tradesmen and apprentices. In other words, a stimulus to public housing construction will not merely serve a real social need in the community but will provide that stimulus to the construction industry which will provide benefits right throughout the economy. That is understood, I believe, by every Australian. Every Australian would understand that this is not just throwing money away on some centralist scheme; it is providing money for distribution in as effective a way as is possible throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to those in the private sector rental market, many low income households find themselves paying sometimes in excess of half of their weekly income in rent. They find themselves caught in the pincer movement between higher rents and diminishing real incomes as either household income is reduced because of fewer working days by members of that household or even, of course, because of the catastrophe of unemployment. As more private rental accommodation is purchased as an investment by unscrupulous persons who keep on escalating rents month by month, without any regard for the tenants, one finds an intolerable situation. A Labor government will extent supplementary assistance of $10 a week to all social security beneficiaries and adults receiving unemployment benefits for six weeks or longer and who pay rent or lodging charges to private landlords. That is the least we can do as a compassionate, caring society, to help those who find themselves in the intolerable situation of being reduced to a budgetary situation in which they can barely put aside enough money for food and other necessities of life, and who find themselves without sufficient money to pay rent to their private landlord. The Labor Party will try to remedy that situation, along with public housing, in order to provide justice and national leadership in the provision of housing to all Australians. </PARA>

However, the departmental minute requested by the Committee contains information on the commercial operations of certain manufacturers, the public release of which potentially could damage unreasonably the operations of the companies involved.

<PARA> A condition of all advances is that they must be repaid before the product to which they relate is withdrawn from store. </PARA>
<PARA> A further provision is that such advances must be repaid no later than six months after the end of the production period in which the product was manufactured. </PARA>
<PARA> For the 1980/81 season, however, the ADC Board agreed that repayment could be deferred until 31 March 1982 with a commercial rate of interest being applied during the period of the loan extension. </PARA>

<PARA> Because of the situation pertaining in the Companies already checked, and the fact that some other Companies have subsequently made substantial repayments of advances, the ADC is widening the scope of its investigations and checks will be made on further factories in the Eastern States over this and next week. </PARA>
<PARA>Future Action</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> ADC management is currently developing new procedures for the granting of advances and the policing of Company undertakings to ensure a similar situation does not develop in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Committee also seeks certain information relating to PT Indomilk. The sale of the ADC's shares in PT Indomilk is still the subject of legal proceedings both in Australia and in Indonesia. It would be improper for me to comment on matters that are now in issue before the courts. I can, however, provide the Committee with some comments that may be of assistance. The first comment concerns the role of the Minister for Primary Industry in approving of any proposed sale. Section 25 of the Dairy Produce Act requires the approval of the Minister before the ADC enters into a contract-not being a contract for the acquisition or disposal of dairy produce-under which the Corporation is to receive an amount exceeding $100,000. Any sale of the ADC' s shares must take place under the laws and regulations of Indonesia. Provided that a proposed sale has all the authorisations necessary under Indonesian law the Minister has indicated that he is prepared to agree to it. I can confirm that the Department of Primary Industry has been advised that PT Indomilk is currently experiencing difficult trading conditions. No link with the matter of the sale of the ADC's shares should be inferred from this simple statement of fact.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Finance ( Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) for the information. The first matter related to the departmental minute dated 19 May. In spite of the Senate inquiry and what is generally known as the Asia Dairy Industry scandal, if that minute of 19 May is the only record on file, it is clear that the Department of Primary Industry is still tardy in notifying the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) of irregularities within authorities under his control. The irregularities were disclosed at the board meeting on 4 and 5 May at which a departmental representative was present. Yet, according to what we have been told today and according to the minute paper that has been tabled, the Minister was not notified for another 14 days. I suggest that that is a longer time lag than was justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the second point-that is, the sale of the Australian Dairy Corporation's equity in PT Indomilk-the Minister is stating, if I heard him correctly, is that he has no objection to the sale or that he would approve the sale, one or the other. The Minister, over the last 12 months, has been all over the place on this question. The heads of agreement which were signed just over a year ago were conditional upon the approval of the Indonesian authorities and the Australian Minister, whose approval is required under section 25, I think, of the Dairy Produce Act. The Minister wrote to the Corporation on 16 November. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I would not approve of the proposed sale unless I had an assurance that the Indonesian Government, under whose laws and regulations the sale must take place , would give its approval. </PARA>
<PARA>The first point I make is that the Minister chose gratuitously to intervene in the sale. If the Indonesian Government chose not to approve of the sale that is an action which the Indonesian Government is entitled to take and a decision it would have to live with. No valid reason whatsoever has been given for the pre- emptive intervention of the Australian Minister under which his approval would not be given unless there was an assurance that the Indonesian Government would also approve. Quite gratuitously and for whatever reason the Australian Minister chose to save the Indonesian Government from taking a decision which may have been embarrassing to it. It was believed, of course, that the Indonesian Government would not approve the sale although, as far as I am aware, no official statement has ever been issued by the Indonesian Government to that effect. A copy of a telex dated 9 December 1981 to Mr Nixon from Mr Vawser, the Chairman of the Dairy Corporation, cast serious doubts upon whether the Indonesian Government did, in fact, object to the sale anyway. Included in this telex is an extract from the Indonesian Times dated 4 December which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Minister Sumarlin-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the relevant Indonesian Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>assured reporters that no Indonesian Government official had ever exerted any sort of pressure on the ADC or Australian officials to prevent the smooth transfer of the ADC holdings in P.T. Indomilk to P.T. Kebun Bunga . . . Business circles here view Minister Sumarlin's statement as the clearance that the sale of ADC shareholdings will proceed in accordance with the Indonesian laws. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the end of the quotation from the Indonesian Times. So, in addition to the serious questions, to say the least, which one could raise about the pre- emptive and gratuitous intervention by the Australian Minister in the sale, serious doubts are cast upon the accuracy of the premise upon which he apparently acted. In a further letter dated 2 June this year to Mr Vawser, Mr Nixon said, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I clearly indicated to you-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Mr Vawser-</PARA>
<PARA>and Messrs J. P. Bennett and B. A. Norwood that the Australian Government was not standing in the way of a sale to P.T. Kebun Bunga. </PARA>
<PARA>That cannot be reconciled with the statement in the Minister's letter of 16 November in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I would not approve the proposed sale unless I had an assurance that the Indonesian Government . . . would give its approval. </PARA>
<PARA>In the letter of 2 June the Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> You will also recall that I mentioned during our meeting that should the Indonesian Government change its attitude and permit the sale of the ADC shareholding to P.T. Kebun Bunga, I would be prepared to agree to such a sale.</PARA>
<PARA>Within one letter an ambivalent position is expressed. The Minister, on the one hand, asserted that he never has frustrated and never would frustrate the sale of the Dairy Corporation's equity and two paragraphs later he adds the condition that he would do so only if there were an assurance that the Indonesian Government would agree to it. As far as I know, the only item on the public record, at least on the attitude of the Indonesian Government, is the quotation from the Indonesian Times which I have already read and in which the relevant Minister in Indonesia is quoted as saying that the Indonesian Government will not intervene. Incidentally, I do not accept as valid the Minister's excuse that some of these matters being now before the courts is an adequate reason for refusing to tell the Committee whether Mr Vawser warned him that PT Indomilk could drift into insolvency. But as a result of the Minister's intervention, the $10m equity which just over a year ago the Corporation had in PT Indomilk, might well be lost entirely. The Corporation could have had the $10m a year ago. It was not allowed to take the $10m because the Australian Minister took pre- emptive action, apparently based on an assumption that the Indonesian Government would intervene to block the sale. That was an assumption for which there is no evidence-no evidence of which I am aware, anyway-and the accuracy of which must be seriously doubted because there is on public record evidence to the contrary and, even if the Indonesian Government would have been likely to object, there was no reason for the Australian Minister to intervene before the Indonesian Government had made a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that negligence or incompetence, or whatever it was, by the Australian Minister, the dairy industry stabilisation fund does not have $10m which it could have had. The joint venture company, PT Indomilk, on the last report given to me, was operating at a loss in excess of $2 1/2m a year. Kebun Bunga has taken the Austrlian Dairy Corporation to court because of its failure to proceed with the sale, and there is a grave danger-whether this will be officially confirmed as comming out of the mouth of Mr Vawser-that the company will go into liquidation and that the equity will be lost entirely. There is one further point. I understand that PT Indomilk owes the Corporation $7 1/2m for products supplied to it, and that must also to some extent be at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot understand why the Minister acted in the way that he did, but there is no doubt that, as a result of that precipitate and gratuitous action, the Australian dairy industry will lose a considerable amount of money, an amount which could ultimately be as high as $15m. I think that the Minister's treatment of the Senate on this matter has been far from satisfactory. He has treated the Senate with contempt by his failure to give any adequate explanation for his actions or for the changes of position which are revealed in the correspondence from which I have quoted and in other correspondence from which I have not quoted. If the Minister for Finance has any response to the dairy industry matters which I have raised, naturally I would be grateful to hear it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have another question to put to the Minister, or the officers, regarding drought relief. At the time of the Estimates Committee H hearing in mid- September, it was stated that farmers in drought declared areas would, subject to some other qualifications, qualify for the interest and fodder subsidies. I am advised that in South Australia there is no such thing as a drought declared area. What procedures have been devised by the Department to cope with that situation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no further comments to make on the two matters raised earlier. With regard to drought relief, the arrangements are that the State governments declare the drought areas, and there are requirements for the State to incur its level of expenditure and then there is the participation by the Commonwealth Government in the drought relief programs. If the South Australian Government does not declare drought areas, there is no participation by the farmers in the drought relief measures that have been announced. The core measures that relate to State governments in the whole program of drought relief are applied. It is within the States that the measures have their validity because of the declaration of drought areas.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Finance ( Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) for that reply. On the same subject, the cost estimates provided in the second reading speech that accompanied the legislation were that the interest subsidy would cost $36m this financial year and that the fodder subsidy would cost $320m this financial year. My first question is whether there has been any revision of that cost estimate, because it would have been made on the basis of very limited information at the time, and particularly , having been made at the time when it was, it could not have been known with any degree of certainty that the wheat crop in much of New South Wales and Victoria would fail. We now know that the wheat crop has almost failed in most of New South Wales and Victoria. Therefore, with present knowledge, one would expect that the drought is more widespread and more severe than would probably have been assumed when those estimates were drawn up. Has there been a revision of those cost figures? If so, what is the revised figure? The second question is : Whether or not there is a revised figure, what was the general assumption about the duration of the drought incorporated into an original or a revised estimate?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just in case that is not clearly understood, the sort of information for which I am looking is whether it was assumed that the growing season would start before the end of April in 80 per cent of Victoria, or whether it was assumed that the growing season would commence, say, before the end of May in 80 per cent of Victoria? I am asking about the assumptions about the time at which normal seasonal rains could be anticipated in the drought affected areas of southern New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. In northern New South Wales where there is a summer rainfall belt, or at least a belt of substantial summer rain, was it assumed when the estimates were drawn up that the summer rainfall in those areas that have a summer growing season would be normal?</PARA>

Built into that estimate was some inclusion of funds in the belief that there would be a worsening drought and, bearing in mind that it was to cover the whole year, to the end of the financial year, on the best estimate of all factors that could be taken in account, this was the sum believed to be required. There has been no revision of the cost estimate. The Bill that was introduced for the $350m-odd is the estimate. At this stage there has been no revised estimate.</PARA></TALK.START>

However, as they have not been made available I will have to repeat the questions and hope that answers will be forthcoming before the Parliament rises or I will have to seek some other means of endeavouring to get the answers. I wish to deal with two departments, firstly, the Department of the Capital Territory regarding Mr Anthony's home loan and, secondly, the Department of Administrative Services. It appears from reading today's Age that the Government has backed away from some of the statements that Ministers made earlier in response to my questions last week about travelling allowances for three Ministers. Yesterday I asked a series of questions dealing with Mr Anthony's home loan. I asked whether in 1964 when Mr Anthony and other people availed themselves of Commonwealth home loans they were given an added incentive to purchase their homes at a 10 per cent discount on the purchase price as well as paying the low interest rate. I further asked:</PARA></TALK.START>

I looked up the electoral roll and noticed that he is a public servant. It is the only letter that I have received which supports Mr Anthony and I am now wondering whether a crank has written the letter and used Mr Brent's name. I have not had time to contact this person but if the letter was written by Mr Brent he is not a very capable public servant. He says in the letter that he heard only the tail end of my speech yesterday on the radio. Yet he went into a diatribe in his letter about what I had to say. He would not have had time to read Hansard because the letter was posted at, I think, the central mail exchange at 11 p.m. last night. He hastily wrote the letter and drew his own conclusions as to what I was talking about. I will correspond with this person and send him the Hansard. It may well be that someone is sending him up by writing that letter and signing his name on it. It has the correct address. A person named B. G. Brent does live at 6 Prior Place, Farrer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Bolkus reminds me, Mr Anthony's plea that restraint be exercised by the work force in regard to wages has not been accompanied by any advocacy of a freeze on Ministers' travelling allowances, whether for travel in Australia or overseas. As we read from the documents that were tabled the other day by the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), Mr Anthony's overseas travel has cost the Australian taxpayer an enormous amount of money. From a quick look at the figures for 1981, we find that the amount claimed by the Minister for Trade and Resources, Mr Anthony, and his spouse, for overseas travel, accommodation, meals and incidental expenses was $468,336. For his staff the amount was $54,576. That is what Mr Anthony alone has cost the taxpayer. One could comment on the figures for quite a few of the other Ministers, but the cost to the taxpayer of Mr Anthony's travel is about two thirds that of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-the greatest traveller and tourist at taxpayer expense that this country has ever witnessed. Mr Anthony puts himself in a very awkward position when he continually appears on television and radio, as he has done in the last week, particularly, talking about a wage freeze and asking the work force, especially the lower paid workers , who are in desperate financial trouble, to exercise wage restraint. People outside can judge for themselves what type of person we have at present as Acting Prime Minister. I am concerned-I mentioned this the other day about Mr Anthony's remarks about home bases. An article in the Canberra Times reports that he said that he wanted to have a home base at Murwillumbah and that he stated further:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I've had one base, which is Canberra, for working, and my own home in Murwillumbah . . . It has been that way ever since I was a minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> He reiterated that Murwillumbah was his principal base and always had been. </PARA>
<PARA>He is also on record as having said that in other places and as being supported in that statement by his party colleague, Mr Sinclair. Mr Sinclair is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 5 November as stating through a spokesman-he has not denied it-that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the home base for the purposes of travelling allowance was his property Bendemeer, near Tamworth, in his electorate. His home base had always been Bendemeer. </PARA>
<PARA>An exercise on the figures that were given shows that if we add to the days in 1981 on which Mr Sinclair was entitled to domestic travelling allowance-286 in number-the days on which he was out of the country on overseas business, only 57 days were available to him to be in his own electorate. We read in the paper yesterday that despite the time that Mr Sinclair has been in office in the Federal Parliament he has only recently opened an office in his electorate to service the people. He has had his office in his State capital city as have a couple of Government members from South Australia-I refer to the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) -have never had an electoral office in the electorates they represent, yet are entitled to an extra allowance because they represent large electorates. They neither have an electorate office in their electorates nor live there. They live in the suburban area of Adelaide. Country people who want to see them must visit them at the Commonwealth Office Building, 1 King William Street, Adelaide. Members of the Liberal Government speak with two tongues, one which suits them and one with which they damn the work force of this country. </PARA>

<PARA> Another interesting thing that emerges from a study of these documents which were tabled in the Parliament the other day, is that if we add Mr Sinclair's tax -free travelling allowance in Australia which amounted to $21,314 for 1981 to his tax-free electoral allowance of $20,300, we find that Mr Sinclair received from the taxpayers last year a total of $41,614 tax tree. If we divide that figure by 52 we find that in addition to all the other perks of office he received $800 a week tax free. One can also add to that his base salary of $38, 500, which all honourable members receive, and his ministerial allowance of $8, 000. Thus he is obliged to pay tax on $46,500 but receives $46,614 on which he is not obliged to pay tax. These are the people who day after day, on television , on radio and in the newspapers, call for wage restraint by the work force. Of course they can call for wage restraint when they receive that amount of money. How many workers in Australia today would like to receive $800 a week tax free and on the side, have such a base salary and ministerial allowance, plus the allowance that Mr Anthony, for instance, has received for all of his overseas trips? I have just read the amounts involved. They total more than $400,000. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Sinclair was the Minister for Communications, which was for only part of the time, the cost of his overseas travel was $31,492, plus $8,920 for his staff. We can see that these people are really on clover. That is what the public is growling about. After I raised these matters in the course of questions last week, they received a lot of publicity. Subsequently, we had denials from Mr Anthony, Mr Sinclair and Mr Street. I was very interested to read on the front page of the Age today an article by Michelle Grattan and Ian Davis which states, 'Ministers seek travel allowance ruling'. These people are running the country yet they do not even know what the travel allowance is really all about. The article states under a Canberra byline:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government has asked the Remuneration Tribunal to clarify its rules for travelling allowances claimed by Ministers and other members of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street, indicated that if the tribunal's reply suggested that he had wrongly claimed allowances for some days he would repay the funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Members of the National Party of Australia have never made such an offer. I am sure they will not. I well recall years ago, when Mr Daly was the Minister for Administrative Services, a huge bill for Avis cars. Mr Sinclair was using these cars after he went out of office and would not pay the bill, which, was for about $1,500. The Government of the day had to foot the bill. </PARA>

<PARA>Of course, he is the Acting Prime Minister now-</PARA>
<PARA>and the Minister for Defence, Mr Sinclair. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to state that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has asked the tribunal to give more details on how 'principal place of residence' applies to Ministers from country areas who cannot run a Ministerial office from near their home. </PARA>
<PARA>Why can they not run a ministerial office from near their homes? The article states further:</PARA>
<PARA> At the Monday meeting-</PARA>
<PARA>This is, of course, a meeting of Ministers. This has caused a lot of concern. The meeting was held before these figures were tabled in the Parliament-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Street, Mr Anthony and Mr Sinclair were anxious to get the definition of ' principal place of residence' spelled out. </PARA>
<PARA> A spokesman for Mr Street said last night: 'If it was found after a precise definition that money was required to be paid back, there would be no question'. Presumably, any refund would apply only after the tribunal's July ruling on ' principal place of residence'. </PARA>
<PARA>So if any money is to be paid back it will be only from 1 July of this year; it will not be for last year. The article states further:</PARA>
<PARA> The spokesman said that Mr Street spent more time at his Melbourne home than at Barwon Heads. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet we know that he has designated Barwon Heads as his home base. When he is away from there as a Minister he can get the travelling allowance. But if a back bencher is away from his home base he does not get it, unless he is in Canberra for the sittings of the Parliament, for Senate committee meetings or for meetings of his own party which have been authorised by his leader. We can see from that article that, after all the blunt denials about those questions which I asked last week, the Government is now backing away and is seeking from the Tribunal a ruling on the definition of 'home base'. That is why I will ask a series of questions. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the tabling on Tuesday in the Senate by Senator Guilfoyle of certain documents relating to the travel allowance paid to Ministers and Opposition office holders. When the Minister for Finance tabled that statement she said that she was tabling the travel allowances for all office holders. In the Tribunal's 1982 report-I have it here; it was tabled in Parliament-there is mention of Australian Democrats office holders. The Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats are office holders yet their allowances were not mentioned in the statement tabled. I wonder why those details were omitted? Perhaps the Minister can tell me and next week we might get a statement showing the travel allowances paid to those people. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be recalled that when I asked these questions last week I queried only the travel allowance payments to three Ministers-Mr Anthony, Mr Sinclair and Mr Street. When the answer was given by Senator Guilfoyle-I had said that I had no objection to the tabling of a statement showing all travel allowance payments-a schedule was incorporated showing the TA paid to all Ministers and to the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives and their counterparts in the Senate. But no mention was made of the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the third political party in the Parliament. Therefore, I am anxiously waiting to see whether we get those figures. </PARA>
<PARA> I have further questions to ask. I hope the answer to my first question will now be forthcoming as the Ministers have raised the issue. My question relates to the change in the definition of 'home base' for the purpose of payment of travelling allowance contained in the Remuneration Tribunal's 1982 review which represented a considerable tightening up of procedures. There had to be a reason for those procedures being tightened up. The answer I received said that neither the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), who is responsible for this area, nor officers of the Department of Administrative Services had made any recommendations or requests to the Tribunal. There had to be a reason for this tightening up. It did not just happen out of the blue. There had to be a reason for it. In the new wording there is no provision for a Minister to nominate any residence he wishes as happened under the previous wording. The 1982 review states that a Minister's home base shall be his or her principal place of residence. So it ought to be. It ought to be the same as in the case of a back bencher. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis can make a speech after me if he has some accusations to make. Does the Minister agree that the new wording represents considerable tightening up of procedures? I have dealt with that-it certainly does. I ask the Minister if she will table, tomorrow if possible, or next week, copies of all the memoranda or advice that was submitted to the Remuneration Tribunal in relation to the definition of home base in the Remuneration Tribunal 's 1982 determination. In particular, will the Minister table all copies of advice submitted to the Remuneration Tribunal on the subject of definition of ' home base' by senior officers of the Department of Administrative Services? Does she agree that it is highly unlikely that the Remuneration Tribunal would have decided to change the wording of the definition of 'home base' in the 1982 review without some evidence having been submitted to it outlining the need for such change?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those are some of the questions that I pose today; I have a few more yet. Will the Minister table a list of all the designated home bases of all Ministers in the Government for the years 1980-81 and 1981-82? Will the Minister table documents identifying the payment of travel allowance to all Ministers on Christmas Day of 1980 and 1981? Since the 1982 determination by the Remuneration Tribunal has there been any change in the nomination of a home base by any Minister in the Government? I could ask the same question about back benchers although it does not really apply to them. It is spelt out in the Tribunal determination that back benchers can have only one home base. They are not entitled to TA unless they are in Canberra for the sitting of Parliament or the sitting of committees. Members of Senate committees are entitled to the allowance if they are away interstate on a committee. There is very little scope for a back bencher to be paid TA to which he is not entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, will the Minister table copies of the documents outlining any changes in the nomination of home base or principal place of residence since the 1982 review? I have put forward a series of questions. The Minister has indicated to me that she has some answers to some of the questions which I raised the other day. I hope that the answers she has will suffice for my purpose. If so, I will not have to pursue this matter any further. I also hope I can clarify a matter referred to in a letter I received this morning as a result of my being misheard on the radio. I asked people in Adelaide who are under threat of losing their homes to write not to me but to Mr Anthony or Mr Fraser, particularly to Mr Anthony, if they are running into trouble with home loan payments. He obviously is well versed in how to pay off just $395.06 in 11 months. He would be able to give them some very good advice as to how to deal with their bank or building society. I am sure he would help them because he has helped himself in no uncertain terms. </PARA>

He is, of course, Mr Sinclair's opponent for that seat. That reminded me of an exchange between the Dalys and the Sinclairs that occurred some time late last year, I think, when Mr Sinclair said that Laurence Daly was not a real person; he was just a puppet for his father. Laurence Daly's reply was this offer to Mr Sinclair: If Mr Sinclair did not talk about Laurence Daly's father, Laurence Daly would not talk about Mr Sinclair's father.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise two matters arising from discussion during the Committee stage of this debate. As yet no satisfactory replies have been received to them. The first concerns the circumstances under which and the precise date on which the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) and the head of that Department approached Mr Costigan regarding the suggestion of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that Mr Costigan conduct an inquiry into the business transactions between Mr Denis Horgan and representatives of Mr Brian Maher. When the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was asked on 14 October why Mr Costigan was not conducting the inquiry, as originally suggested, the Treasurer replied that he was not really too sure about it but he thought that Mr Costigan had been approached by the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman, who handles royal commissions, by the departmental head or by some other senior officer of the Department. As has been observed previously, it was rather extraordinary that the Treasurer could be so imprecise about a matter which had been the subject of several special meetings of the Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, questions were asked in the Committee stage of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) replied ultimately, on behalf of Mr Newman, that the Minister and the departmental head discussed the question with Mr Costigan-I use the Minister's words-'during the week beginning 18 September 1982'. That reply provoked a question yesterday from Senator McIntosh and a reply in which the Minister for Finance said that she would seek advice as to whether the communication was in writing, by telephone, or in what form. She added that she did not have the information at present. Again, I observe that, given that this matter was initially of sufficient importance to induce several special meetings of Cabinet, it is surprising to say the least that a Minister, knowing that she will be questioned on this matter, is not more adequately briefed. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is not my main point. I return to the line 'during the week beginning 18 September 1982'. The date of 18 September was a Saturday, so the Senate has been given a reply to a question-presumably delivered in writing to Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle-which refers to a week beginning on a Saturday. We have known Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle to have problems with numbers previously but we have not known her previously to have problems with the days of the week. It is not necessarily just a trivial or careless error because, as late as 22 September, the Prime Minister was still saying that Mr Costigan was the obvious man to do the job. I agree with the Prime Minister that Mr Costigan was the obvious man to do the job because at least two of the companies that Denis Horgan sold to the Maher organisation finished up on the bottom of the harbour with registered painters and dockers as directors. It is not only entirely appropriate but also logical that the Royal Commissioner inquiring into the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union should extend his inquiry, if requested to do so, to cover the transactions between Mr Horgan, Mr Maher and, ultimately, registered painters and dockers. </PARA>
<PARA> As late as 22 September the Prime Minister was saying that Mr Costigan should do the job. Yesterday the Minister for Finance told us that during the week beginning 18 September-during the week beginning on a Saturday-Minister Newman and the departmental head discussed the matter with Mr Costigan. She added that Mr Costigan was willing to act only in his capacity as Royal Commissioner and the Government decided that that was inappropriate. Presumably we can agree with the Government, or the Minister will agree with the Opposition, that weeks do not start on a Saturday. But what I want to know is precisely when that alleged discussion took place. If it was as early as 18 September, why was the Prime Minister still saying four days later that Mr Costigan was the obvious person to do the job? To say the least, I find it very hard to believe that such a discussion did take place on 18 September. </PARA>
<PARA> I also seek from the Minister for Finance a response-she undertook to do this yesterday in reply to a question from Senator McIntosh-as to when she will tell the Senate whether there was any communication in writing or by telephone between the Minister or departmental head and Mr Costigan. I add to that a request for the precise date or dates on which such consultation took place. I believe-nothing that the Government has done since this matter was first raised has done anything to shake that belief; indeed, it has confirmed it because the Government's answers have been evasive and in the most recent instance, at least on a matter of detail, clearly in error-that what happened was that the Prime Minister realised that he had to be seen to be doing something about this government office holder who had been revealed by documents tabled and incorporated in Parliament to have been a director of at least nine companies which were registered in three States and sold to two different tax promoters and who was holder of seven discretionary government positions. That is why there were special Cabinet meetings every five minutes.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister wanted to throw his encumbrance overboard-to sack Mr Horgan from the government positions-but some other Ministers would not agree. Hence there were a number of special Cabinet meetings. But the Prime Minister, believing that he had to be seen to be doing something, said: 'We will ask Mr Costigan to conduct an inquiry'. Then some of the other Ministers came to him and said: 'Hang on. That fellow is actually serious about exposing tax dodgers and even if you load the terms of reference of this inquiry'-this is what ultimately the Government did-'Costigan might answer the crucial questions whether explicitly asked to do so or not'. In other words it was thumbs down for Costigan. Then some excuse had to be found for not allowing Mr Costigan to proceed with the inquiry. Apart from the toing and froing and evasiveness-and in the most recent case the clear error-I suspect that there is information on the record on this matter which the Government has refused to disclose. </PARA>
<PARA> The critical questions that should be asked in this inquiry are, firstly, whether, as a result of the transactions between Mr Horgan, Mr Maher and his friends, tax which would have been paid was not paid and, secondly, whether, under the provisions of the tax recoupment legislation originally introduced on 23 September, Mr Horgan would have been a vendor shareholder liable to repay money. They are the critical questions. I suggest that they have deliberately not been asked in the terms of reference finally given to Mr Von Doussa. I make no reflection at all upon Mr Von Doussa in making these comments. Indeed, in a previous inquiry, Mr Von Doussa showed that he is a man of some determination. He, of course, was not nominated explicitly by the Government but by the Law Council of Australia. The point I am making is that Mr Costigan was deliberately excluded from this inquiry by the Government because the Government was afraid that Mr Costigan would flush out the truth and reveal it. When speaking about the potential liability of Mr Horgan to pay recoupment tax, I referred to the legislation which was introduced in the House of Representatives on 23 September . That is a very different Bill from the one that replaced it on 21 October. The principal difference is that there is a sub-clause (12) of clause 3 in the latter Bill which exempts the whole class of vendor-shareholders. That is the Horgan amendment. It is there to ensure that Mr Horgan does not have to pay back any of the money that he has stolen, to use the Prime Minister's description. That will be the subject of debate either tomorrow or next week. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise one other matter. I might add that I do not expect to get a substantial response from the Minister for Finance to any of the questions I have raised. I refer to the matter the matter touched upon by Senator McLaren concerning travelling allowances paid, in particular, to Messrs Sinclair and Anthony and the following reply given by Senator Guilfoyle on 16 November:</PARA>
<PARA> Ministers and Opposition officeholders have nominated their home bases in writing. The Department of Administrative Services finds no substance in the allegation that Ministers nominated one home base for periods when Parliament was sitting and another for the rest of the year. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw attention to the fact that that is not a categorical denial that some Minister or Ministers changed their home bases during a year. The operative part of the reply states that no Minister nominated one home base for periods when Parliament was sitting and another for the rest of the year. It does not say that no Minister had more than one home base during a year. I believe those words were very carefully chosen because, in making that statement, the Minister probably has not told the Senate anything which is not correct but nor has the Minister told the whole truth. The whole truth is that home bases were changed during the financial year. The only way in which the Government can clear up this matter is to table the files of those two Ministers on this matter-the two Ministers, of course, being Mr Anthony and Mr Sinclair. Again, I do not expect that that will be done voluntarily. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This third reading debate gives me an opportunity to summarise some of the aspects of the Budget legislation which we have been considering for some time. I want to make a few general comments about it. The first point I make is that we are now in the month of November and it is some two and a half months since the Budget was brought down. It is clearly apparent that there are a number of tremendous defects in the Budget strategy. They become more and more apparent every day. It now appears that the Government is looking at a blow-out in the Budget deficit of some one and a half billion dollars. That is due to a number of factors, some of which may have been foreseen and others of which may not have been foreseen. It is important to consider the implications of the Budget in the light of the Government's latest strategy announcement in respect of a wages pause as a method dealing with unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me look at some of the factors which have contributed to the increase in the Budget deficit. The first, of course, is the increase in the estimate for drought relief. The second is the Budget forecast in relation to unemployment. I will deal with the Budget forecast in relation to unemployment first. The Budget forecast was for a marked increase in unemployment in Australia. The estimates of the amount of unemployment benefits which would have to be paid in the year 1982-83 were based on an average figure which was only 4,000 above the figure for June 1982 and in fact some 10,000 below the unemployment figure of July 1982 . When the Budget was brought down in August the estimates for unemployment benefit recipients for the year 1982-83 were way out of kilter. I want to make the point again that unemployment has been increasing in this country at the rate of 1,000 people a day in more recent weeks. The estimates of unemployment benefits which will have to be paid increase every day. I do not think we should underestimate the importance of that, because one extra percentage increase in unemployed members of the work force costs this country an enormous sum of money . The current estimate of the cost of unemployment is $8 billion and it is increasing, of course, as unemployment increases every day. That is the first rubbery, strange figure in the Budget which needs some comment at this point. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make relates to the amount for pay-as-you-earn income tax receipts in the Budget. That is calculated on the assumption of no change in the level of employment of wage and salary earners. That assumption just does not square with the estimate of negative economic growth in the Budget, nor does it square with the now acknowledged large rise in the level of unemployment. So, as unemployment increases every day, the receipts side of the Budget will be affected in terms of PAYE income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter I raise concerns the Government's estimate in the Budget that there will be no loss of revenue through tax avoidance in the year 1982-83. I remind the Senate that last year the estimate for loss of receipts through tax avoidance was $300m. This year the Treasurer, Mr Howard, declared that tax avoidance schemes were no longer succeeding; that he had effectively abolished them by fiat. He declared that they did not exist any more. The self-delusion which is apparent in the Treasurer's statement appears to be transparent if we examine the Budget estimates. In August of this year the Opposition did not accept that there would be no loss of revenue from tax avoidance. That view, of course, is borne out by the Commissioner of Taxation. The Treasurer ought to have a look at the sixty-first annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation for the year 1981-82, which was brought down in the Senate in September of this year . At page 21 of that report the Commissioner had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is noteworthy that, in revenue terms, overall results for the year were marginally ahead of the 1980-81 year despite a significant drop in the numbers of cases completed by all programs brought about largely by the decrease in staff ceiling in 1981 and the need to devote additional resources to tax avoidance activities. That greater revenue was obtained from fewer completed cases tends to confirm the view expressed last year that tax evasion appears to be increasing. This is, of course-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence entitled 'An Aircraft Carrier for the Australian Defence Force' is particularly pertinent because the Government said that it would make the decision on the aircraft carrier before the end of this month. I want to deal with particular aspects of this proposal that there be an aircraft carrier for the Australian Defence Force. I commend the Committee's report to the Senate. I believe it is a very thoughtful and important addition to the discussion of our defence needs. Unfortunately the Government's record in this area is far different from the style of this report. Of course, the Government let the United Kingdom keep the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible in a pre- election Budget proposal because of the need for it to slash defence expenditure to give it more money for electioneering purposes when the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) anticipated an election this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee needs to be commended for the way in which it indicated that it felt that the cost of a carrier was far too high because of the other options that its purchase would close off. I agree with the Committee in that decision. The Committee recognised the need for a maritime command structure. It pointed out that the Tracker and Orion aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm should be relocated . In my view, the Nowra air base in the electorate of Macarthur would be an ideal place. Under this Government aided by the honourable member for Macarthur, Mr Baume, we have seen the Nowra air base wither on the vine. Indeed, figures from the Department of Defence show that the Navy's approved manpower terminal strength and needs have been reduced as a result of the decommissioning of HMAS Melbourne by 300 and that there has been a reduction of flying hours for Skyhawk , Macchi and Tracker aircraft of 180. That is the serious situation facing the Nowra base at present. The Government's inaction has led to a great deal of uncertainty for the servicemen in that area. Unfortunately that has been made more difficult by the convulsions and acrobatics of the honourable member for Macarthur, Mr Baume, who has said different things each week as the Government's role has changed and, of course, as it has played politics with our defence needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's role in coastal surveillance is a matter of particular concern . The Government has encouraged private surveillance for the security of this nation. In other words, Ansett planes and even foreign planes are surveying our shoreline. This is one area where Fraserism has gone mad. The private sector is handling legitimate defence needs. I suggest that Australian servicemen could be most effectively employed in revamping the Nowra base to allow our surveillance activity to be based there. Mr Baume has focused on headline making by promising a carrier to the people in the Macarthur electorate. The people at HMAS Albatross believe the Fleet Air Arm has been left with no role because 13 Tracker aircraft are in mothballs. The Fraser Government and the honourable member for Macarthur have undeniably placed us in the position of having servicemen unable to fly the hours they need effectively to gain the experience needed for their service. The aircraft should be used. As colleagues of mine in another place have pointed out, trained pilots, instead of sitting on their hands at the Nowra base as they are at present, should be used in coastal surveillance. Ansett planes are going around Australia doing the work of guarding our coastline from the types of problems that the report referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe HMAS Albatross has a changing role but it must have a continuing role . Its personnel need to be reassured, just as the people of Nowra itself need to be certain of the economic stability that the base supplies to the area. We cannot afford to allow this Government to gamble with our defence needs. We cannot allow the honourable member for Macarthur to continue to distort the situation or to mislead the people in the Macarthur electorate about the defence needs of Australia. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that this report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence puts to rest all further discussion on the need for a carrier for the Royal Australian Navy. I am in broad agreement with its recommendations; they are well researched. It is a well-reasoned document. When one considers the restraints that were imposed on the Committee with respect to both time and resources it is a most commendable result. Had the Committee had even more time and resources, it would have come up with the same answer. The report confirms the naval tactical air power study of nearly 10 years ago which looked in great detail at 14 different scenarios in the use of naval tactical air power and came up with the solution that in every case land- based air was a more appropriate, more cost effective and more functionally effective way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Very briefly, Australia has no place for the mini-carriers that are examined in this report, be they the Invincible, the Iwo Jima landing platform helicopter class, the Italian Garibaldi class or the Spanish sea control-type. All those ships are designed to be defended by air from sources other than that of their own origin. In the United States Navy these carriers operate as part of a major fleet which will provide the heavy fleet aircraft, such as the F4s, the F14s or the F18s, for air superiority and the airborne early warning radar capability. The Invincible was designed for use by the Royal Navy in the North Sea with land -based air for both air superiority and AEW. It is the lack of this AEW capacity which is the Achilles heel of this type of ship. Without an airborne early warning capability there is no beyond-the-horizon radar possibility and those ships are vulnerable to low flying strike aircraft. It has been proposed by Senator Hamer in speaking to this report that the helicopter-borne AEW radar would provide this capability. That is not true. The sophistication of the equipment that can be put in a helicopter is limited. The altitude, of course, is very restricted-probably below 10,000 feet-and range is a function of height as well as signal strength with radar for target acquisition. One would want to operate at heights probably twice those attainable with helicopters to get an adequate warning time. Time on station and range is also very critical with a helicopter. Of course, there are always major serviceability problems with helicopters. I guess it is better than nothing. But it is nowhere near adequate for what we need. If we do need a carrier we need a conventional type carrier of at least 40,000 tonnes. We are looking at an investment beyond that which Australia can afford. As the report says, we probably need three of them because we are at least a two ocean navy and we need one in reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing in relation to this document is the matter of timing. Cabinet will receive a report from the Department of Defence by 30 November, I understand. The Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) has made a statement that by the end of December a decision will be made on whether Australia will get a carrier. Whatever that decision might be it is quite wrong for the decision to be taken this year because the Government has called for a new strategic assessment which will be provided in the early part of the new year. The strategic assessment is a confidential document which looks at all the threats to Australia, at needs, the Defence Force structure, manpower and equipment. It is the definitive document against which all equipment and all Force structure is based. If we are having a new assessment done then it is the height of folly to be deciding on a major piece of equipment-whether or not we are going to get it-in advance of the new strategic assessment coming in. This assessment, of course, is always a confidential document, but it is crucial to a decision on a piece of major equipment like that. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 9 of the report deals with the assigning of maritime surveillance aircraft-namely, the P3Cs-to the Navy. The report goes on to comment on the retention of the Fleet Air Arm and what to do with it. If we do not have a carrier then the place of the Fleet Air Arm has to be reviewed. We live in a world of changing technology. Because we have some skills-it does not matter how highly developed those skills are-it does not mean that they have to be retained. Of course, in the Navy stokers gave way to ERAs when coal firing went out of stokeholds of coal fired ships. Of course those stokers in turn replaced sailmakers. There is nothing inviolate about any occupation. Of course, there are many parellels in private industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the solution to the position of the Fleet Air Arm would be to second flying officers and ground staff to the Royal Australian Air Force and have them serve in maritime reconnaissance squadrons. I think that a valid liaison role can be developed for those airmen in the organisation between the Navy and the Air Force. They would be quite valuable in that role. Of course, if at a future date we did want to go to a carrier then we would have those skills retained in the Navy. As for carrier work, the officers could do exchange postings with the United States Navy. So, I do not attach much importance to the argument that we need a carrier to retain those skills in the Fleet Air Arm. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the comments on page 25 of the report in relation to the Harrier. Most of the people who have spoken to this report have commented on this. Page 25 states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Harrier is a sub-sonic aircraft, with a relatively short range . . . radius of action, a poor radar, capable only of daytime or clear weather operations, poor 'look-down' capability . . . imcompatible with modern weapon systems . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a factual account of the capabilities of the Harrier. I saw the first of these aircraft fly in 1959 or 1960 at Farnborough in England. What one has to remember about the Harrier is that it was a proof of concept aircraft-it set out to prove that one could build an aeroplane that could take off and land vertically. It was never designed as a fighter; it was never designed as a strike aircraft. Having invested hundreds of millions of dollars in research and development into it the company had to make it work in some way. It had no application in private industry so it went into Service life. It uses basically Korean War technology. It is a very slow aeroplane-mach .9 at best; when weapons and stores are hung on it it gets considerably slower. Aircraft simply have to be supersonic-at least to a level of about mach 1.4-these days to stay alive in the air. Aircraft have to be able to accelerate rapidly through the trans-sonic regime. This aeroplane simply will not do any of these things. </PARA>
<PARA> The Harrier is a very short range aircraft. Despite what Senator Collard said, range is crucial. It is a matter of its pay load, whether it is taken out as ordnance or fuel, and the fact remains that there is very little capability with this aircraft. The fact that it was ferried an enormously long distance to the Falkland Islands is quite irrelevant from a fighting point of view because it was done with a ferry probe on it. This is always detached in the operational field because there is such an enormous amount of drag from it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very unmanoeuvrable aeroplane. Proof of that is in the great plans that the Royal Air Force had to develop a big wing Harrier to gain more manoeuvrability. The Blue Fox radar, of Ferranti, has proved to be a failure. If one were the designer of it one would say that it was a success because it met the design parameters. But it is short range radar with no look-down capability, no all weather capability. The proof of its shortcomings can be found in the fact that the C130P, which is a slow transport aircraft, could operate into Port Stanley every night throughout the conflict up until the last night before Port Stanley airfield fell. </PARA>
<PARA> The success of the Harrier came exclusively from its 9L Sidewinder missile. It gave an advantage to the British that the Argentinians did not have. The fact that the Argentinian aircraft were operating below 5,000 feet at low air speeds meant that firing was rather like shooting fish in a barrel. There were 19 Mirages shot down by the Harriers of a total of 24 aircraft destroyed by 9Ls; ground fire accounted for 47. So, there were considerably more Argentinian aircraft lost though ground fire. Of course, the British lost nine Harriers out of 42. This is between a fifth and a quarter of its number. This is a not inconsequential loss rate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the strike role the aircraft were similarly ineffective. They flew more than 40 sorties against Port Stanley airfield at very short range. They had three, 1, 000 lb bombs each. I do not believe that they put one crater in the runway. They proved themselves incapable of penetrating the defences of Port Stanely-which were quite minimal-because they lacked speed, manoeuvreability and and ECM capability. Furthermore, the aeroplane has some major handling defects. In 1971 the United States Marine Corps acquired 110 of these aircraft; by March 1982 it had only 68 left. These aircraft have had the highest accident rate of any aircraft in US Air Force history and a higher loss rate after 11 years in service than in the first year of service. This is in contradiction to every other aircraft ever introduced. It is dissembling for pilots to say-as I heard pilots on behalf of British Aerospace Australia Ltd say-that the US Marine Corps put in helicopter pilots who had no fixed wing experience in this role. That is not true at all. Those pilots went through an adequate training program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wish to say a few words on the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence entitled 'An Aircraft Carrier for the Australian Defence Force'. As I was one of the people who made up the Committee that handed in this report I feel duty bound to speak. I agree with the different comments by Senator Childs and Senator MacGibbon. But I wish to say a few other words in the few minutes that are available to me. I believe that Australia has to look very carefully at our defence effort. Australia is, after all, only a small nation. We are limited as to the amount of money that we can spend on defence. I believe that money has to be spent very wisely. The Committee did not, in the true sense, take a political view. The Australian Labor Party members on that Committee, as it happened, were in the majority simply because the Liberal Party Committee members, through unforeseen circumstances, could not always attend that Committee's meetings. It happened that the Labor Party people were in the majority. Right from the outset all the members of that Committee did not look at this reference as a political stunt. I believe that every member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, irrespective of his politics, is looking at his responsibility in relation to Australia and what is good for Australia. I am very happy that that is so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to the financial aspect. Australia has spent not quite 3 per cent of its gross domestic product on defence. I do not believe that any political party can lift this in the foreseeable future to any great amount, so we are restricted in terms of finance. I agree with Senator MacGibbon that it would be far too costly to buy an aircraft carrier. The Midway class aircraft carrier would be ideal if we could afford it, but I believe that the cost would be astronomical. Even if the United States of America had several of the Midway class carriers in mothballs and even if we could buy one on cheap terms I believe the running costs of it would be out of Australia's reach. To man that aircraft carrier we would need in the vicinity of 4,500 men; it would carry 75 aircraft of various sorts. Had Australia gone ahead and bought HMS Invincible it would have been a bargain. There is no doubt about that. To have a cheap alternative in the true sense would not really be an aircraft carrier. We would have a ship capable of carrying hover aircraft whether they be short take off and vertical landing or helicopters. I agree with Senators MacGibbon and Childs that a ship which is not capable of carrying early warning aircraft is highly vulnerable. It cannot survive in modern warfare; that is our experience. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one of the lessons that we can learn from the Falklands war is that although the British forces equipment was not all that much more superior to that of the armed forces of Argentina, the British forces were superior in that they were very highly trained. My fear is that if Australia went ahead and bought an aircraft carrier, even a cheap aircraft carrier, we would be spending in the vicinity of $2,000m. I do not believe it is possible to do that. If we did that we would have to restrict the training of our Air Force, Army and Navy, which would be to their detriment. That would not be good enough. I believe that if trouble ever arose it would be more important to have highly trained troops than to have an aircraft carrier, as was seen in the Falkland Islands dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Australia is the best aircraft carrier. We should be placing more airfields around this nation. We have islands that are quite capable of taking our aircraft. The Committee has recommended that we have in-fuelling services so that our aircraft can reach out to greater mileages and defend this nation. I think six early warning aircraft should be purchased. The Government, instead of looking at another aircraft carrier, should look at buying in the vicinity of 10 refuelling aircraft and six early warning aircraft. In that way Australia's defences would be far better than having one aircraft carrier. One aircraft carrier cannot supply the defences that are needed. If Australia really wanted to go into aircraft carriers it would be necessary, as Senator MacGibbon said, to have three. Two would be needed to patrol the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean while a third was being repaired or under maintenance. The cost of that would be so astronomical that all our defences would be stripped to almost nothing. Our defences would be capable only of maintaining a reasonable defence structure. As I said, the Committee looked at that in the reality of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very honest report although there has been some criticism that we made some wrong assessments on the Harrier aircraft. That, to a small extent, is correct, but I do not believe that the Harrier aircraft is the type that Australia needs to defend itself. I honestly believe that the F18 aircraft-some criticism has been made about them-will be of major benefit to the defence of this nation and I hope that nothing goes wrong to stop that purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike Senator MacGibbon I would like to see the Fleet Air Arm maintained. I think that naval pilots work better with naval personnel. There is a need to maintain the Fleet Air Arm. The Committee recommended that all or some of the P3C Orions should be transferred. The aircraft that are presently available, particularly the Trackers, should be used for the protection of this nation. I do not believe privately owned planes should be keeping surveillance around this nation. I am far happier to see armed and trained personnel doing so. They are professionals, and I want professionals to look after my security. I hope that all Australians want that. It is no use having untrained people doing this job and having trained personnel and their aircraft sitting on the ground doing nothing. We have also made a recommendation that the Fleet Air Arm should be trained in the other modern aircraft that Australia will purchase. We should at least always keep our options open. We did that for a reason. I would like to see the Nowra base kept operational. After talking with the Navy I am of the opinion that naval personnel work better together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking against Senator Colston's amendment last week when the debate on this report was adjourned. I said that I supported the general drift of the report with much pleasure. It makes only modest recommendations. I am sorry that it does not recommend completely unrestricted trading hours because ultimately that is the way trade will be carried on in this country. The sooner we get there the better. Quite simply there is no place for government legislation at all in respect of trading hours in the market place. It is a big adult world and the market is well able to set its own standards as to whether it needs to trade 24 hours a day, seven days a week or three hours, three days a week. It is something that the Government has no place in now, never had a place in in the past, and should never have a place in the future. It has nothing to do with a bunch of bureaucrats or a bunch of legislators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No company can exist like an 18th century capitalist in today's society. It has to be conscious of its social obligations. A company has three principal obligations. The first is to the shareholders of the company. Whether it is a sole proprietor or a proprietor does not matter; it is the same thing. The second is to its employees. The third responsibility is to look after its customers. The responsibilities are inviolate. It cannot look after two of those three or one of those three to the exclusion of the others and stay in business in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> Trading hours are particularly important to customers. We have heard a lot in recent times about women in the work force, single parent mothers, the women's movement and so on. The restriction of trading hours really penalises women who have to work. Not only women but also the whole of society have moved towards a 38-hour week. If there is only a 38-hour trading week, people do not have time to go out to buy groceries, clothes and all the other requirements which keep the business world alive. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention also the tourist trade. We are trying to develop a tourist trade in this country in the face of implacable union and Australian Labor Party opposition. If we are to get anywhere with the tourist trade, we have to operate around the clock-24 hours a day, seven days a week. As I said earlier, it is inevitable that, in the longer term, there will be an extension of trading hours in the Australian community. It is just a matter of being bright enough at present to see the need. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments against an extension of trading hours which have come from the other side of the chamber are the old socialist dogma, rehashed eternally, the closed shop philosophy and the whole authoritarian control approach of 'do what I tell you; just do not use your own judgment'. There has been a total domination of shop traders and employees who have been told what they should do with their lives and, through those people, the community is told also. We cannot live by carving up the commercial world into cosy little niches. We live and prosper through competition. Provided that competition is open and everyone can join in it, it is fair and honest. That is the way it must be because that is the only way Australia will survive. If we are to be alive commercially in the 1990s in the Asian Pacific region, with the dynamic commercial world of which we are inevitably apart, which extends from Japan down to Singapore and through Indonesia, Australia's commercial performance has to be lifted several magnitudes on what it is at present. We will not achieve that by following the Labor Party line of penalty rates and all those union domineering restrictive practices. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that Senator Chipp is not here. If Senator Chipp went out into the real world and mixed with successful traders-I do not know with whom he mixes- the way I do, whether those traders are involved in a small business, or are owner entrepreneurs or are involved in the large corporations in the country, he will find a universal expression that we have extended trading hours for shop keeping because these people who are successful do not shrink from competition in any way at all. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to talk to those people. I have had estimates that trade could be lifted by between 3 per cent and 5 per cent by a simple extension of trading hours. At a time of depressed economic activity in this country, an elevation of between 3 per cent and 5 per cent in the volume of trade being done in the retail world would be very significant. It would mean that factories could produce more. It would mean that more people could be employed. It would mean more money being circulated through the community. It would help us to work ourselves out of the mess which we are in. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I have much pleasure in supporting Senator Reid and the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. I condemn the restrictive practices that are proposed by Senator Colston in his amendment. We have to remember that water sets its own level in the market place. Traders will not trade if it is uneconomical for them to do so. People will not work for shopkeepers or employers if they are not paid a fair return for their effort. If the hours are inconvenient for customers, customers will not go. There is no place at all for the Government to be poking its nose into what is a simple, straightforward commercial matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move an amendment to Senator Reid's amendment to Senator Colston's amendment to the orignal motion on the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory into retail trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'that', insert:</PARA>
<PARA> the unanimous view of the Committee that retail trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory should not be deregulated but considers that the recommendation of the majority of the Committee is inconsistent with the Government's stated objectives of preserving jobs and small businesses and, further, is contrary to the views of the community in the A.C.T. as expressed by the House of Assembly Committee report on trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory, and that Mr President forward a copy of this resolution to the Speaker of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA>I take this opportunity of congratulating Senator Reid on her election as Deputy Government Whip. Having said that, I beg to differ with her in respect of her majority report. I refer very briefly to the tabling statement in which Senator Reid said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that deregulation would most probably accelerate or at least continue the trend towards the structural readjustment of employment in the industry-away from full time to part time and casual employment. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement went on:</PARA>
<PARA> However, it is considered that this is an inevitable trend and major retailers have stated in evidence that only voluntary staff would be used on weekends. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that we should analyse that for a moment in view of the concern that is being expressed in the community about the loss of jobs and in particular the loss of full time jobs. We ought to consider whether this is an inevitable trend as was suggested by the Chairman of the Committee in her tabling speech. I turn to page 30 of the report which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Casual positions are mainly filled by married women and students who do not wish to work full-time. This employment provides an important second source of income to the family. </PARA>
<PARA>A committee of this Parliament recommended to the Parliament a change in working hours which, according to the Committee, will have the effect of reducing full time jobs as stated by the Chairman's tabling speech and at page 32 of the report under the heading 'Conclusion'. The recommendation suggests that those full time jobs be made casual and part time jobs. We have also an indication from the Committee as to who will take up those part time and casual jobs. Those people will include students so they will include school students. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable senators to my address to the Senate at the time the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Act was before the Senate, section 90 of which relates to this matter. At that stage I indicated how many casual jobs were taken by school kids. Are we in the Senate now being asked by one of our committees to destroy full time jobs which are desperately required by those persons who now have them, and pass them over to school students? That is precisely what the Committee is doing. Indeed, the Committee admitted that in its report. </PARA>

The people who are employed during the weekend are the school kids. In fact, there are two things to be said about that. Firstly, those school kids are not paying taxes. Secondly, they are taking the jobs of persons who are already in jobs. I submit that it is not inevitable that we will see a shift away from full time to part time and casual employment in the retail trade. If we say that it is inevitable we, as members of the Federal Parliament-particularly in relation to Canberra-will be giving away our responsibility to preserve the jobs of people who are already in work. The Committee has said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This employment provides an important second source of income to the family. </PARA>
<PARA>What about a first income for large numbers of unemployed people? Let us not beat around the bush. This Committee is saying-what is worse, it understands it- that this move certainly will lead to a drift from full time employment to part time and casual work and that these jobs will be taken by school kids or by people who will bring a second income into the family. Let us get rid of the hypocrisy of the Government in suggesting certain ways of maintaining employment . I am saying that this recommendation from the majority of members on the Committee will destroy employment and that is a tragedy. Why is the Committee doing this? The Committee says why it is doing this on page 18 of the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The question of trading hours has therefore been the subject of considerable scrutiny and investigation in recent years. It reflects the great amount of pressure that has been and is continuing to be exerted on Governments by the various interest groups to effect changes to the legislative regulation of trading hours. </PARA>
<PARA>Only one group is trying to change the trading hours and that is the major retailers. That matter should be of concern to all honourable senators present. The other aspect of this report is that the definition of major retailers is not consistent with anything contained in the rest of the report but is consistent wih a politically motivated decision taken in Tasmania last year to get some retailer off the hook. If that is the sort of thing we in the Senate can expect from our committee system we ought to have a second look at it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a little doubtful when this reference went to the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. Usually when a fairly polarised debate took place in the chamber and the contentious matter was then flipped to a committee one would say that the objectivity of that committee was in doubt. But I have to say that the findings of the Education and Arts Committee on this matter were based only on the evidence. Some of the evidence was favourable to the Government scheme and some of it was not. We heard unfavourable evidence from the Department of Education that the scheme was rushed and implemented in a hurried manner. We also heard from the bankers that it was apparently the normal practice of this Government to devise legislation, pass it and work out the problems afterwards. I would have thought that the reverse would have been the case-that any government would work out what the problems were in the scheme, and overcome them in the legislation. But we had evidence from those two groups that this was not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other major concern I have with the legislation-the Committee has noted this-is that it has preceded three major reports which would directly affect the legislation. Firstly, there was the Beswick inquiry into the state of student finances which was a comprehensive review of what student finances were. The Government has just received this report in the last four or five weeks and it is considering its response to the report. But it did not, at any stage, look at that report and base its student loans views on it. The Australian Vice- Chancellors' Committee has been looking at student finances as well. That Committee's report is due very soon. Finally, the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission has been looking at and doing a major report on participation rates. Within the space of two months this Government will receive three very comprehensive reports on which it could base its future strategy in terms of student finances. Yet the Government has opted for the loans scheme before considering any of these reports. </PARA>
<PARA>Committee on Education and the Arts</PARA>
<PARA>Committee on Education and the Arts</PARA>
<PARA> I detected some other problems in the inquiry which also gave me some concern over the legislation. The first relates to the sum of $50m which has been allocated. It is quite clear that that sum was arrived at by a decision which was not based on what the Government perceived to be the needs for student finances. That was the amount of money the banks would make available. It is true that the Government put extra pressure on the banks to increase the allocation from $30m to $50m. One of the questions I asked-I have yet to receive a satisfactory answer-was why the Government has opted to operate the scheme through the banks and not through one of its agencies. I asked why the Government was not in a position to lend the money through its own financial resources. There may be a good reason but, of course, each of the public servants who were asked this question had to state that this matter was government policy. As I understand it, that is a correct response from a public servant. I hope that when the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill comes before the Senate next week we will get some explanation of why the scheme is to operate through the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The main opposition to the scheme really came from the Australian Union of Students and a few other bodies. The opposition focussed on several areas. I think this Committee has cleared up some of the doubts. The examination by the Committee has meant that some of the doubts about the scheme have been resolved. I do not know whether the Government always intended the current interpretation to apply, but certainly the investigation by the Committee has wrung out certain assurances that make me a lot happier about the scheme. The first of those major points is that the scheme is only supplementary to the grants scheme and is not intended at any stage to replace it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On our side of the chamber we had doubts that in fact this was not the future intention. In my view, if we look back at the Review of Commonwealth Functions we see quite clearly that the Government's initial intention was to bring in a students loans scheme to replace the grants scheme. I was asked a moment ago what guarantee we have. My answer would be, the credibility of the current government. When does it renege on promises? Not very often-not more than about once a day or once a week. But I think that Senator Chipp, being an idealist, would agree that there must be some trust in the world . What we are saying is that we will give the Government a year or more to put this scheme into operation and then will judge whether it is working as the Department of Education and the Minister for Education say or whether in fact it is the thin end of a wedge, whether it is intended to replace the grants scheme. There are no guarantees, but we are saying that we will see what happens with it .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second major objection to the scheme was as to the criteria on which loans would be granted. When I first heard of it I thought, knowing what banks were like, that all sorts of criteria would be imposed. A person who was going to be a doctor or a lawyer would no doubt get credit. However, a person who was going on to become a politician would no doubt get none. I felt there would be discrimination against country areas, women, migrants and Aborignals-that all the groups against which banks currently tend to discriminate would be discriminated against under the scheme. However, we have had an unequivocal assurance from both the Department of Education and from the banks concerned that the only criterion used will be whether a person has had a previous bad credit dealing with a particular institution. That is a very important point to make and we will make sure that the Government and the banks stick to that assurance because if they do not in my view the whole scheme will collapse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that is mandatory under the Act. I dare say steps could be taken if they were not fair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third point we make is that there should be review procedures, which would take two forms. At the end of the first year's operation there should be a review to see just how the scheme is working. There are still many things that we do not know. We do not know exactly how the money is to be allocated between States or between banks. That aspect must be reviewed in the first year of operation. Also, we have asked that the Education and Arts Committee review the scheme in March 1984. Thus, some of the problems that may arise from this legislation would be reviewed by the Committee which would, I believe, examine them critically. </PARA>
<PARA> A few other points can be made about the scheme. The Committee has recommended that more emphasis be given to counselling, that people getting loans should have it available at the university level. We found it unlikely that the banks would have sufficient expertise to deal with this aspect; that it would be best done through the current financial counselling services at universities. Also, I believe that the scheme is not particularly suitable for post-graduate students. Usually a post-graduate student has undertaken an honours degree involving four years study and faces a minimum of another four to five years post-graduate study. As a result that student would spend nine years at a tertiary or higher education institution. By making loans available to such a person we could be increasing his indebtedness to a stage where he may never be able to repay his debts. The opportunity cost involved in completing a higher degree represents at least $60,000 to $70,000 in income forgone. It is too much to say to them at 28, 30 or 32 years of age, when probably they have established a family and bought a house: 'You must now begin to repay a debt.'</PARA>
<PARA> Another related anomaly is that if one happens to be a recipient of the post- graduate award at the moment and is not married one would not be eligible to borrow any money. So what, in effect, we are doing is saying that the person who is married and has greater responsibilities is to be encouraged to get into further debt. I would forewarn post-graduates that I do not think this scheme is particularly suitable for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The business colleges have strongly represented to every member of the Senate that a loan of $2,500 should be made available. That presents difficulties. I urge people to look at the report and examine why at this stage we cannot recommend that. Only a certain amount of money is available and we do not know what the demand for it will be. Our decision also relates to the very type of people who are attending commercial colleges. </PARA>
<PARA> My final point relates to appeals. If indeed someone is rejected for a loan we believe there should be some appeals mechanism by which they can take the matter further. I believe this is the only way of ensuring that the banks will apply only the criterion that I have mentioned. In summary, I am not sure that the Labor Party, if it comes to office, will want to continue this scheme, but I stress that I do not think sufficient evidence for stopping the scheme was put before the Committee. We will have a year to see how it operates. If it operated successfully, no doubt the Labor Party would continue it. If it did not, no doubt it would be discontinued. If the Education and Arts Committee re-examines the scheme in 1984 it will need only a month of hearings to ascertain exactly how it has been working. </PARA>

I disagree with Senator Robert Ray 's comment that the debate on this matter in the Committee was polarised. As I recall it there was very little polarisation because Senator Button, speaking for the Australian Labor Party, said that the Opposition would in fact support the Bill. He said also that when Labor came to office it would remove the legislation. That seems to be a slightly different proposition from the one put by Senator Robert Ray.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, you have spoken. Senator Robert Ray also said that the report was based on the evidence submitted. The Committee came to the conclusion that the students loans scheme provided for by the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill 1982 would not replace or diminish the grants scheme for student assistance. But when one seeks the evidence in the report upon which that conclusion is based one is referred to paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2. Paragraph 3. 2 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>the Department of Education in its submission and through its representatives at the public hearings, was emphatic that the loans scheme would be suplementary to the existing grants scheme and would not undermine nor replace them. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not quite sure what the Committee expected the Department of Education to say. Presumably it would say what it had been directed to say by the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume). The level of TEAS and other grants is a political decision. Political decisions are not decisions for the Department of Education. One would want to ask, if everybody from the Minister down is so emphatic that TEAS is not about to be eroded or replaced, why the Government is so reluctant to index these allowances so that students can be assured of the continuation of those grants at a particular level. No commitment has been made. In fact, there has been a denial by the Minister that that would be done. I think one must then look at the actions of the Government in a political way to see what type of substantiation one could possibly find for a conclusion by the Committee that the grants scheme or student assistance would not be replaced or diminished. I suggest that on any fair view of the evidence it must be taken as only having the weight placed on it by the Department, which is dependent upon the weight that is placed upon it by the Minister. Surely, as Senator Robert Ray has quite correctly pointed out, this Government would be one of the last in which one would want to put one's trust. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first question we might ask in looking at these three Bills is: Why are they necessary and why was it necessary for Senator Siddons also to introduce Bills along similar lines? The answer is that Liberal governments for the last 17 years have not taken a proper revision of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The only revision and the only amendments occurred in the period 1973-75 when numerous electoral Bills were passed in the House of Representatives but foundered in the Senate. Only one Bill relating to redistribution was passed and that was at a Joint Sitting. That Bill was passed and the redistribution occurred. In every case the redistribution was rejected by this House of Parliament. I cannot really understand why the redistributions were rejected. In terms of Victoria, the Liberal redistribution of 1977 was far more favourable to the Australian Labor Party than the 1974 proposal. Nevertheless, owing to obstinacy and all sorts of suspicion, that redistribution was knocked back in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, there have been virtually no changes to the Electoral Act in the last 17 years. The only recent one that I can recall was the elimination from the Act of any restriction on election expenditure. This was done not through any sense of reform but out of fear; fear by the Liberal Party that it would go into a Federal election and that the Australian Democrats would challenge the results because every candidate would spend more money. I cannot remember what the limit was. I think it was $500 or $1,000. These days a good colour leaflet costs $2,000. This limit was removed and the promise was made that we could have a committee of inquiry into the matter and new provisions would be brought in. I do not know whether the Democrats would have challenged the election if candidates had spent too much money under the existing Act. The Democrats usually comply with the Act. They comply for the most Marxist of reasons of economic determinism-they cannot afford to spend any more money. I have sympathy with them in that regard. </PARA>

Senator Mason will be aware that the Harders inquiry report has been in the Government's hands for over a year and that still no action has been taken on it. At least two inquiries have been commissioned to look into the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The reports of both of them have been given to the Government. The first report recommended a whole series of changes which were in line to some extent with Labor and Democrats policy and was rejected by the Government. The Government then commissioned another inquiry. The report of that inquiry is now held by the Government. Again it did not come up with the required answers, so there is still no action. Over the last few years we have had absolutely no action on electoral reform. I congratulate Senator Gietzelt on taking the initiative in introducing this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first Bill I wish to deal with relates to 6 o'clock closing. I think the voting hours, from 8 o'clock to 8 o'clock, were set 80 years ago. First of all, it was decided by the Conservatives to have the election on a Thursday but that rort was amended by a Labor Party government and elections were then held on Saturdays. Many changes have occurred in the last 80 years, at least in the community if not in the parties represented opposite. First of all there has been a change in work patterns. Eighty years ago people were working a 48-hour week. It was common for people to work for nearly all of Saturday and they therefore needed until 8 o'clock to vote. Secondly, we have an improved transport system now. It is much easier to get to the polling booths than it was 80 years ago. Finally, with refined techniques in terms of absentee and postal voting, anyone is able to vote on election day if he or she has difficulty in getting to the polling booth between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 o'clock at night. Especially in a good Liberal electorate with a good rorted postal vote machine, everyone gets a vote whether they want one or not. Those conditions have changed , which I think justifies 6 o'clock closing. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are reasons other than changed conditions for supporting 6 o' clock closing. Firstly, let us have a look at the costs. During the last election, 61,111 people were employed on election day. If we were to reduce the voting hours by two hours and if we assume that such people are paid a minimum of $5 to $6 an hour, that immediately brings about a saving of over $700,000 for the Government. The second factor to bring into account is the actual efficiency . If electoral officers have been working for 12 hours efficiency tends to lessen. Mistakes are made in counting. Mistakes are made in putting votes in one pile or another and they have to be rectified at another stage. My final point- we may not always be sympathetic to this-is that it would make it a lot easier for party workers on election day if they had to work for 10 rather than 12 hours. The day has long since passed in the Labor Party-and I hope it has in the Liberal Party-when one has to spend a 12-hour session at the polling booth unless one is a candidate in a marginal seat. Most of us get away with spending two to four hours at the booth these days. In by-elections in days gone by I have done the 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock stint. One really needed a week to recover, not from the actual work but from the boredom of having to stand there for 12 hours. It would be of benefit to party workers if we reduced the time by two hours. </PARA>
<PARA> My major interest in having 6 o'clock closing, however, comes from an ability to establish early election results on election night. Currently we have a problem in Australia that in a close election when it is very hard to establish who in fact will win, we may have to wait for the Western Australian result to determine the whole election. The problem there is that Western Australia is two hours behind the eastern States and it usually takes two hours to establish a pattern of results. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to that in a moment. Western Australia is two hours behind and it takes a couple of hours to establish the result. So in winter the earliest one could get the result would be midnight. But now we have daylight saving so that means effectively that if an election is held next December and if the Labor Party makes gains in the other States which are not quite large enough, we will have to wait until 1.30 in the morning for the election result. If it is a Labor victory I am quite willing to wait that long.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator McIntosh indicates, we will probably pick up enough seats in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland to win an election easily, but nevertheless it is rather foolish. The public likes to know the election results. Every television channel covers them on the night of an election. To work until 1.30 or 2 o'clock in the morning trying to get a result is ridiculous. I refer to the 1982 Victorian State election results. Victoria crossed to 6 o'clock closing in 1979. In 1982, with 6 o'clock closing, the Labor Party was able to claim victory at 7.25 p.m. The Liberal Party conceded victory at 7.40 p.m. Anyone reading the tally room board could at least see the pattern by 8.30 p.m. and the Australian Broadcasting Commission's computer managed to pick up a slight trend to Labor by 10 o'clock at night. So in my view there is some advantage in early closing. It has worked well in other States. Queensland has had it since 1915. South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria have all switched to 6 o'clock closing. There have been no transitional problems. I do not think that the prospect of 6 o'clock closing would draw much opposition from the other side of the chamber. I hope that the relevant Bill is passed unanimously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second of Senator Gietzelt's Bills introduces a random draw for the position on the ballot paper. This is really in order to negate what is termed ' the donkey vote'. I believe the phrase 'donkey vote' is a good one. Malcolm Mackerras estimates that at the moment there are 11 coalition members who owe their place in the House of Representatives to the donkey vote, and that there are four Labor members who owe their position in the House of Representatives to the donkey vote. It is never easy to establish a percentage for the donkey vote. I have scrutineered at many elections and in my view it is certainly between 0.6 per cent and 2 per cent. It would have been noticed that where the communists happen to draw the first position on the ballot paper in Senate elections they poll 2 per cent and where they draw down the line they are lucky to get 0.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I will cite some examples from the last Victorian election. The Australian Labor Party picked up 17 seats in that State election. In those seats where we drew the number one position and got the donkey vote our average primary vote was 47.4 per cent. In the other seats where we did our vote was 46.2 per cent, indicating to me-there may be other factors involved but the general trend is there-that there was a 1.2 per cent donkey vote in those 17 critical seats. Looking at it another way, in the last Victorian election the Australian Democrats contested 62 of the 81 seats. On 17 occasions they drew the top position. On those occasions they averaged 8 per cent of the vote. In the other 45 seats where they did not draw the top position they averaged 5.6 per cent of the vote. It may be that all the Democrat candidates with ability were right at the top of the ballot paper, but I do not think anyone, especially Senator Mason , would agree with that. I could give many other examples of the existence of the donkey vote and its effect on politics. </PARA>
<PARA> Ninety-six of the 125 members of the House of Representatives have names starting with the letters A to M. If one goes through a telephone book or an electoral roll and works out the average, one will find that there are more people in the A to M group, but not to the extent of 76.8 per cent. The seat for the area in which I live has always been used as a haven for donkeys in terms of the Liberal Party. We held the seat in 1974. The Liberal Party then held a pre- selection and the one and only criterion for picking that dolt was that his name started with A. Local Liberals told me that that was what had influenced them. They had to get the donkey vote as it could have been a very critical seat at the election. So for five years my electorate was left virtually unrepresented. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party held another pre-selection about eight or 10 weeks ago for the electorate in which I live. Its candidate's name begins with B. He does not live anywhere in the electorate. He is unknown to most of the people in the electorate. Again, he was chosen on the basis that his name begins with B. I am sure he was not chosen because he is a lawyer who lives miles outside the electorate. This effectively means that people with names such as Walsh, Withers , Watson or Ray are deprived of having a reasonable chance of running for the House of Representatives. I must say that that has been of great benefit to the Senate. Nevertheless, it is unfair to those people to have to give that sort of head start. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that drawing names out of the hat would not eliminate the donkey vote . All it would do is eliminate the manipulation of pre-selections and other things aimed at someone capturing the donkey vote. The donkey vote would still exist and it will always exist as long as there is one set order on the ballot paper. It would be inappropriate at this stage for me to discuss at any length Senator Siddons's suggestion about the rotation of names on ballot papers. I hope to have the opportunity to do that at a later stage. That system is used in Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. I wish the defeated Liberal club actually had a vote in the Senate on this Bill. They would all vote for a draw for positions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final Bill that Senator Gietzelt presented, and probably the most important from the point of view of the Australian Labor Party, relates to his advocacy of optional preferential voting and the relaxing of the definition of what is a formal vote is and what is not. The Australian voting system, especially in the last 60 years, has always aimed at maximising the number of people being able to vote. In this country we have a situation in which never more than 80 per cent of the eligible people determine who should govern and who should not. Firstly, 5 per cent of the people who are on the electoral roll never vote. We rarely have an election in which over 93 per cent or 94 per cent of the people on the electoral roll vote. Secondly, people are left off the roll inadvertently, often by their own mistake. Perhaps they have moved and failed to get back on the roll . </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, many naturalised citizens do not realise that the next step after naturalisation is to go and get on the electoral roll. This Government does nothing to encourage that. I have had many experiences of talking to representatives of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and others and requesting them actually to go to the regions in which naturalisation ceremonies are held and to hand out electoral enrolment cards on that day but they will not do it. Finally, we have a group of scarlet pimpernels who just refuse to get on to the electoral roll, usually because it is the best way a creditor can track them down or, even more appropriately, the police. So there is a whole range of people who do not vote in any particular Federal election. But what our system does is add to that and disenfranchise people who want to vote, people who are on the roll and who go along conscientiously to vote but do not have the ability to fill out a ballot paper formally. Those people are penalised. </PARA>
<PARA> In my experience of scrutineering I have found three different types of informal voting. Firstly, there is the blank ballot paper. That to me indicates two things, either total confusion at being able to handle our electoral system or that people deliberately vote with a blank ballot paper. I am sure that there are people who do that, that there are people who say 'a plague on all Houses' and just put in a blank ballot paper so that they do not get fined. There is not much we can do about that with any particular voting system. It is up to the parties to encourage such people to vote for them. The second type of informal vote one finds is the cross or the tick. That is most common amongst migrants to this country. I am not referring just to non-English speaking migrants, but to all groups. People who come from England and who are used to the first past the post voting system just put an X on the ballot paper. I would say that that accounts for about 20 per cent to 30 per cent of all informal votes. </PARA>
<PARA> The third group consists of those people who inadvertently vote informal, who put two 3s or two 4s or, in the case of a Senate election, two 27s. I do not know what the magic thing is about the number 27, but in my scrutineering experience it has come up time and again in Senate elections. I do not know what it is about Australian people that they insist on putting two 27s but that mistake occurs more often than any other. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the extent of this informal voting problem? In House of Representatives elections we usually have a 2 per cent informal voting rate. I am not so sure that optional preferential voting would alter that situation dramatically, but it would at least mean that those people who inadvertently put in the same number twice will have their vote recorded formally. Senate elections are averaging an informal vote of something like 9 per cent. Given the figures I mentioned earlier, we could well have a situation in which government is affected in this chamber, firstly, because 5 per cent of the people do not vote; secondly, because other people are left off the roll; and, thirdly, because some people deliberately do not want to be on the roll. Migrants and 18-year-olds are not on the roll. That reduces quite a few of the potential voters. If we took out another 9 per cent for informal votes, under the proportional representation system we could well have 16 per cent of the people voting for the wasted quota. So we could have a government determined or controlled by this body with only 75 per cent of the Australian community having an effective say in the representation in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a classic case in 1974 in New South Wales where in the electorate of Bradfield 5.6 of the people voted informally. I congratulate the electorate for that low level. But in the electorate of Sydney there was a 20.5 per cent informal vote. Part of the reason for that is the number of candidates who are permitted to run in Senate elections. We are all aware of what happened in 1974 when 73 candidates nominated in New South Wales, 48 in Victoria and 38 in South Australia. One might ask what was the cause of the sudden burst of enthusiasm by people to nominate. To be charitable, one could say that many people heard the call. But the reality, as far as I am concerned, is that a deliberate attempt was made there to fill out the ballot paper. There were probably 40 genuine candidates and 33 bodgie ones who were paid by a political group in this country and who were there to try to increase the informality. It is a fact that informal votes affect two major areas. One is the working class suburbs of major metropolitan areas. The reason that area ia so badly affected is that the people there do not have the same educational achievement as people in other parts of the metropolitan area and find it difficult to handle the voting system. The other area in which we find a very high informal vote is country regions. That is also due to educational deprivation and the unavailability of how-to-vote cards. </PARA>
<PARA> The main argument against optional preferential voting is that people may not express their preferences. But they are given the chance, under optional preferential, either to extend their preferences or not. The Labor Party would not very often allocate preferences in House of Representatives voting because I do not think that there is a seat in this country-perhaps there is one or two- where our preferences are ever distributed. We usually finish first or second so that our preferences are irrelevant. In a Senate election we would always distribute our preferences because there is always a preferred choice as to who sits in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Gietzelt says, we would probably send them anywhere but to a conservative. But that is our right. I think the Liberal Party would send its preferences anywhere but to the Labor Party-other than in South Australia, of course. So, we are not taking preferential voting away; we are giving people the option of exercising a preference or not. Under this system, if people made a minor mistake on the ballot paper, the vote would not become informal. A poll conducted by the Bulletin in 1980 indicated that 60 per cent of people preferred the first past the post system of voting. This was the policy of the Labor Party for many years, mostly as a reaction to what happened with the Democratic Labor Party. We do not support that any more, but we support optional preferential voting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion I mention some of the views of the Liberal Party of some years back. I will go back to 1948 as a matter of fact. Mr Gullett, the then member for the electorate in which I live, said:</PARA>
<PARA> If the elector is required to place all the candidates in the correct order it must result in an increase in the number of informal votes. </PARA>
<PARA>He was quite correct. Another member of parliament said:</PARA>
<PARA> The percentage of informal votes cast at every election is excessive. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Anthony, whose son is now Acting Prime Minister, said that. The final quote from that debate in 1948 comes from Mr Archie Cameron, who went on to be a famous, or infamous, Speaker of the House of Representatives, depending upon which point of view one wants to approach the matter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it seems utterly futile to propose seriously that an elector should be obliged to vote for every candidate on the list in order to record a formal vote . It is hard for electors to express their preference beyond three or four candidates and to compel a man to vote for 30 or 40 candidates-for the Lord knows how many aspirants for office there will be-is to go too far. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the view of the Liberal Party three or four years after its birth. Honourable senators might ask why it does not change that view. The answer to that comes if one looks back to a 1974 Hansard when Senator Withers made the classic statement that no government amends an electoral Act to advantage the Opposition. The reason the electoral legislation has not been altered in the last 17 years is that it currently advantages the Liberal and National parties of Australia. We will have no change to electoral legislation emanating from the Government benches for that reason. The electoral laws favour those parties. I know that every time we propose a change to the Electoral Act the group opposite usually says that the Labor Party is trying to rig the system or that we are trying to work a rort in the system, et cetera. Senator Gietzelt has introduced three amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I think that even in 1974 many aspects of these Bills would have drawn support from members on the opposite side of the chamber. The reason for the rejection of the electoral Bills at that stage was that they tended to be presented in an omnibus form with some aspects being objectionable and some being acceptable to the Liberal Party. We are now putting up Bills relating to separate and distinct areas. The ball is now in the Liberal Party's court either to accept these Bills or to introduce effective reforms. If it does not, all its statements that it accepts a democratic system go down the tube. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bills which are before us this afternoon are private member's Bills. They have been brought in by Senator Gietzelt. I congratulate him for doing that. But it is a pity that they were not Government-initiated Bills because they deserve the support of all honourable senators. This Government has promised electoral reform many times in the past but it never seems to do anything about it. I want to make some brief remarks first about the proposed closing time for polling booths of 6 p.m. That was introduced in New South Wales by a Liberal-Country Party Premier, Mr Tom Lewis. I can understand it if many honourable senators here this afternoon do not remember Mr Lewis. He was one of six leaders of the Liberal Party in New South Wales in seven years. In fact, if honourable senators count the present leader, Mr Dowd, he was one of seven leaders--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Dowd. Mr Lewis was one of seven leaders that the Liberal Party had in eight years. He might not be remembered for doing much at all for the State of New South Wales, but he will certainly be remembered for introducing the early closing time for the polls, as suggested by the Australian Labor Party at the time. The voting stops at 6 p.m. It has not caused a noticeable decline in the number of people voting. It has been of great assistance in enabling the electorate to know with reasonable certainty who has won the election by midnight on the day of polling. I admit that sometimes it takes weeks for the complete results of elections in Australia to be known, but that is a matter with which I shall deal when I discuss optional preferential voting. As Senator Robert Ray said, one cannot expect Commonwealth Electorate Office staff to be fully efficient in counting votes up to, say, 10 p.m. or midnight when they have been on duty since 7 a.m. At least 6 p.m. closing shortens their day, and it improves the efficiency of the staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second of the Bills, which has been dealt with very well by Senator Robert Ray, concerns the drawing for positions on the ballot paper. I support that. However, I wish to make some remarks about party affiliation being listed on the ballot paper. I do so because the Australian Democrats have already made moves in this direction, and it is part and parcel of the Labor Party's electoral reform Bills. I support completely the concept that party affiliation should be shown on the ballot papers. More than 40 countries follow this practice already, including West Germany and Austria, and a case can be made out that those two countries have systems which are among the most democratic electoral systems in the world. It is also in existence in countries such as Italy and Ireland. If this practice were introduced in Australia it would help all voters, but it would be especially useful to the voters who were not born in this country and are not used to the practice of having to fill out every spot on the ballot paper and who, when they get into the booth, do not know for which candidate or which party they are voting. </PARA>
<PARA> That is especially important when one takes into account the ludicrous situation of people having been forced to fill in up to 73 squares on a Senate ballot paper, as happened in New South Wales in 1974. Again, that is something with which I shall deal in more detail during my remarks on optional preferential voting. What we should be doing is investigating the use of voting machines and examining all methods of making it easier for a voter to cast his vote, not making it harder. Surely that is what our democratic system is all about. If a Senate committee, as proposed by Senator Gietzelt and by me many times in the past but always rejected by the Government, could look into this matter in a bipartisan way, and not under pressure, a suitable result could be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to 1975 even the major parties had difficulty in manning polling booths throughout New South Wales, particularly at Federal election level. But since the events of 1975 I have found that, be it at State level or Federal level, the Labor Party in New South Wales has had no difficulty in manning the polling booths, or the vast majority of them. Therefore, if the party affiliation is indicated on the ballot paper, it will not help the Labor Party. It certainly will not help the Labor Party in the same way as it will help the minor parties. However, it will reduce the informal vote and therefore it will be more democratic. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the Bill concerning optional preferential voting, what is needed is a complete overhaul of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This has been promised to us in the past by Senator Withers and Senator Chaney, when they were the appropriate Ministers. It was also promised by Mr John McLeay when he was the appropriate Minister. But all that we have heard from this Government is deafening silence. Optional preferential voting is only one issue, but it would certainly go a long way towards making the Australian electoral system more reasonable. If ever proof were needed as to why our electoral procedures are outdated, we need only look at the Senate election in New South Wales in 1975. The ballot in New South Wales took place on 13 December 1975, and we received the final result on 6 February 1976. That is nearly two months later. Admittedly there were two recounts of the votes cast, but the very task of recounting was complicated by the fact that the voters had to fill in every square on the ballot paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me explain in some detail what happened in that 1975 poll. On the first count, the winning candidate for the last position-who happened to be myself-was elected by the margin of 854 votes out of about 3 million. That is 19 for each Federal division in New South Wales. I believe that that was the closest result in Senate history and it remains so. But when the full recount was taken we found that my winning margin had gone up from 854 votes to 2,016. I suppose people will say that when nearly three million votes have to be counted again it is a reasonable result to find a difference of only that many votes. But if we look at the total formal vote in 1975 we find that the scrutineers found, after recounting the ballot completely, another 12,000 informal votes. Twelve thousand votes is the total decline in the formal vote. What happened was that many votes which had been thrown out the first time went back into the count. Of course this further added to the number of informal votes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the recount in 1975 we found that hundreds of ballot papers had been credited to the wrong candidates. This occurred in every electoral division throughout New South Wales. Scrutineers rang me up and said: 'We have got some good news. We have just found 100 votes in the electorate of St George which were credited to the Liberal Party but which should have been credited to the Labor Party'. I knew that within 10 minutes the telephone would ring with news from another division that another 100 or 150 votes had gone the other way. The votes in the Senate election in New South Wales had been counted on the night of the election and the following week. They were rechecked and then opened up and recounted again. They were counted three times. I am convinced that if they had been counted a fourth time we would have found many more informal votes running into some hundreds at least. The quotas would have been different and we could have even had a different result, not in the elected candidate but certainly in the margin by which the candidate was elected. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is a farcical situation when the election result of the Australian Senate is not known for nearly two months after the election yet the result of an election in Great Britain, which has over 600 seats in the House of Commons, is known within 48 hours. In the United States of America, where literally hundreds of thousands of polling booths are spread over four distinct time zones , we know who is the president within 24 to 48 hours after the poll closes. I believe that our present system of exhaustive preferential voting discriminates heavily against the aged, the infirm, migrants and Aborigines. In those electorates in which there is a high concentration of socially disadvantaged electors one finds by far the highest informal voting figures. Senator Robert Ray gave examples of the fact that in the electorate of Sydney the 1974 Senate election informal vote was in excess of 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to cite figures from the 1977 House of Representatives and Senate elections. In 1977 the electorate of Sydney had an informal vote for the House of Representatives of 4.27 per cent. That was the highest in New South Wales. The electorate of Bradfield had the lowest informal vote in New South Wales; it was 1.3 per cent. Of course the electorate of Bradfield has the highest income per voter of any electorate in Australia. It is also the safest Liberal seat in Australia. In the 1977 Senate election the informal vote in the electorate of Sydney was 12.5 per cent-again that was the highest in the State-and the informal vote in Bradfield was 4.9 per cent, again the lowest of any division in New South Wales. If one were cynical about the matter those figures alone would prove why the Government has never done anything about the electoral system that we are talking about today. I am pleased to say that the electorate of Sydney does not now have the highest informal vote in New South Wales because the party in that electorate determined that it would do something about it and embarked on a very extensive scrutineering campaign. It has now got the informal vote in that electorate down to 10 per cent. It has been able to cut the informal vote dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> The main reason for this high informal vote is that we still have a compulsory preferential voting system. The only possible justification for that system, in my opinion, is that it perhaps reflects in greater detail the wishes of the voters in that electorate. However, I think there are two arguments that one can use against that point. First, as Senator Robert Ray said, if we had an optional preferential system we would still allow electors to express their preferences right through the ballot paper if they so desired. That is the system that operates in the upper House in New South Wales. Secondly, a compulsory preferential system effectively disenfranchises between 9 per cent and 10 per cent of the electors in Senate elections in each State in Australia and results in a donkey vote of up to one per cent or 2 per cent. I well remember in the 1980 Senate election in New South Wales the candidate who got the donkey vote, the Reverend Fred Nile. He was trumpeting in the media in New South Wales what a great vote he had received and what a great endorsement the 135,000 votes were of the policies of the Call to Australia or the Right to Life or whatever the organisation was that he was leading. The bad news for the Reverend Fred Nile came on the last two days of the count. As a result of the Labor Party's scrutineers in every one of the 45 divisions-we concentrated for two full days on his vote alone-his vote was reduced by over 18,000 and we did that in two days. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975 in the Senate election in New South Wales the party which received the donkey vote was the Socialist Workers League, a Trotskyite organisation. It is very interesting to see where its preferences went. It received approximately 26 ,000 votes. Two thousand five hundred voters-that is 2,500 out of 26,000- followed its ticket. Twenty two thousand three hundred votes went straight to the Liberal Party whose members were listed right beside those of the Socialist Workers League. So, the Liberal Party collected 22,500 votes from a Trotskyite organisation and said: 'Thanks very much'. What that means is that candidates can be elected to the Senate purely because people are forced to vote. For instance, as I gave the example in 1974, the electorate had to vote for 73 candidates. There are people sitting in the Senate today who are here not because their election reflects the wishes of the voters in their particular States but because of the position that they occupied on the ballot paper-the luck of the draw out of a hat. I believe it is a scandalous situation when control of the Senate can depend on a lottery as to who draws a particular position on a ballot paper when everybody in a State is forced to vote a certain way and when thousands of donkey votes help to elect a particular candidate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the New South Wales Legislative Council where the Labor Party introduced the first democratic elections ever to be held in that chamber the optional preferential system is in force. To cast a formal vote the person need only vote from one to nine. That does not stop people, if they want, from voting for every person on the ballot paper. It does not stop a party such as the Australian Democrats from putting out a how-to-vote card that has a number in every square. As a result of the optional preferential system in New South Wales the State- wide informal vote was approximately 4 per cent. In my opinion, that is still much too high but certainly much better than the average of 10 per cent that occurs in the Senate in my State. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point that I think should be made is why people should be forced to vote for some of the joke candidates that we have had standing for the Senate in recent years. Again I refer to my own State. We have had rock groups and disc jockeys puting their names on the Senate ballot paper just so they can get publicity. We have had people put their names on the ballot paper purely for tax evasion purposes. I do not believe that it is in the interests of democracy that people should be forced to give these candidates a vote. </PARA>
<PARA> The seriousness of this whole debate is shown by the fact that when voters were forced to fill out every square in 1974 on the Senate ballot paper the resulting informal vote and the position on the ballot paper, I believe, cost the Australian Labor Party the sixth Senate seat in New South Wales and the fifth Senate seat in Queensland. I believe that if one examines the percentage of the State-wide vote that the Labor Party received in New South Wales and in Queensland in 1974 either Westerway, the candidate for the Labor Party in New South Wales, or my colleague, Mal Colston, who was then the candidate in question in Queensland, should have won. If either of those seats had been won by the Labor Party the tragic events of 1975 that still divide this country would not have occurred. I hope that the Senate passes these Bills this afternoon. I believe the Senate should set up a committee on electoral reform as a matter of urgency. I believe that committee could go a long way towards making elections in Australia more democratic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak only briefly on these three Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bills. We have had two very informative and interesting speeches on the Bills from members of the Australian Labor Party. It is good to see that the Labor Party is doing something about electoral reform. Nevertheless, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed that my own Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill, which was introduced in September and which sought, in particular, that party affiliations be placed on the ballot paper, was not listed for debate today. I believe a cognate debate on all four Bills could have been a very useful exercise. Electoral reform in this country has been a painfully slow business. These three Bills are part of a process of gradual change which began shortly after Federation and has continued intermittently ever since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of the three Bills before us now, I will be supporting wholeheartedly the Bill that seeks to have the poll closing time of six o'clock rather than eight o' clock. I will not go over the ground that has already been very well covered by Senator Robert Ray in particular, but the changed closing time is surely a very worthwhile reform. Personally, I support the Bill that deals with optional preferential voting. I think that the democratic process is at risk when candidates can so easily nominate for election to the Senate with the simple objective of confusing the voter through the ballot paper. We have an enlightened process of electing senators by the proportional representation system; we do get a selection of candidates to this chamber which reflects the proportion of votes cast for each party elected. That is a big advance. But the process is being held in some disrepute simply because of the ability of candidates, who have no objective other than to confuse the system, to put their names up as candidates thus making the voting process difficult for electors. Therefore, optional preferential voting, I think, is necessary if we are to continue to have support for our system of voting for candidates for election to the Senate, that is, proportional representation. I think the optional preferential voting would be a step in the right direction from the point of view of giving the elector an option whether he fills in every square. It could then be extended, I believe, to the proportional representation system for the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly want to speak on the Bill that addresses the problem of the donkey vote. In my Bill, I suggested that this problem could best be solved by rotating the placement of the name of each candidate so that each candidate in turn had his name at the top of the ballot paper and the same number of ballot papers had the candidate's name at the top. Such a device would completely neutralise the donkey vote once and for all. The main problem with Senator Gietzelt's proposal is that it does not really tackle the problem. It is still leaving to fate which candidate is to be put at the top of a ballot paper. As we have been told by Senator Robert Ray, this donkey vote could be between two, three or four per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 and the Bills which we are debating cognately to raise a central theme in terms of electoral reform, that is, we wish to make it as easy as possible for every citizen to cast his vote in the most effective way. Therefore, the various proposals that come forward from time to time have to be judged in the light of the way that the citizen is able to be effective democratically. I believe that the three Bills before us provide ways in which that would be able to be obtained. The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 3), relating to time, is probably one of the least contentious. I believe that most State governments-certainly my State has done so for a long time-would agree to closing the polls at the earlier hour of 6 o'clock. There seems to be no problem. It is a matter of voter understanding and habit. It would make for a more effective operation of polling day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We sometimes look at electoral matters in a one-off way. There are many ways in which elections can be streamlined and made more effective. It is a pity that Senator Gietzelt's proposal-I think it was last year-to have a select committee was never able to be implemented. The original intention was to seek a joint committee but that was refused by the House of Representatives. However, I believe advertisements were put in newspapers and some submissions were received . The Senate should again look, perhaps in the few years at activating such a committee to look at a very wide range of proposals that come forward not only from Australia but also from overseas. I mention one which may seem heretical to many people. In Switzerland it is permissible for a voter to use a 'how to vote' card when voting. When one thinks about it at first blush it seems rather odd but, on second thoughts, there seems to be no reason why, provided the normal safeguards in our particular way of voting are applied, a person could not use a 'how to vote' card if that was his or her intention. Many systems operate that we could look at not only in other countries but also in our State governments. Senator Siddons has already mentioned the system that is used currently in Tasmania. Proposals that have been implemented by State governments in Australia may very well be the first ones off the rank in a Federal sphere because we know that they work and that voters will adopt and use them in an effective and useful way. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point to make relates to the points made by Senator Sibraa which I thought were very interesting, particularly those relating to the counting of the Senate vote. Senator Colston has also written fairly extensively on this issue. We must look not only at the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 4 ) which relates to optional preferential voting, but also at the very heart of the way in which the Senate vote is counted. It is counted-most people in Australia probably do not know this-by one of the most idiosyncratic implementations of the method anywhere in the world. I believe that the reason that we have stayed away from and the strength of the argument to stay away from a correct counting method, is that people say it would take an exceptionally long time. Here I recall to honourable senators' minds a point that I made some weeks ago in relation to the annual report of the Australian Electoral Office. I referred to a reply given by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman ) about the possibility of using computers in elections. In part of his answer the Minister referred to computers as giant adding machines. I made the point at that time-I make it again now-that that sort of comment could have been made in the 1960s, it might have been pardoned in the 1970s but it is totally unpardonable in the 1980s. It is certainly unpardonable when given by the Minister in response to a formal question. It is a most extraordinary statement. It will probably go down in the annals as one of the silliest answers given in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of technology in regard to electoral systems is complex. I acknowledge that a lot of arguments must be thrashed out before computers can be used for that purpose. The point I am trying to make is that we ought to be addressing ourselves to the problem. We ought to be acknowledging that other countries are using this technology and are seeking to do so in a more and more refined fashion. As I pointed out in speaking on electoral matters on another occasion, computer technology is used very effectively by our gambling establishment, the Totalisator Agency Board. The facilities offered by the TAB are used by all sectors of the Australian population. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not find it very effective either, Senator, because I do not use those facilities. However, I have looked at the system and it works. It works from the point of view of the user. It is very simple and straightforward and given the various combinations and permutations that are available for betting, the TAB carries out a number of quite sophisticated operations. Such a system would not have to be developed much further in order to be used when elections are held. If the old problem of cost is raised perhaps that could be solved by going into partnership with the TAB. It would also defray part of that organisation's costs. The day on which elections were held would probably have to be changed to Wednesday. We could not possibly hold them on Saturday because the races would be interrupted! Nevertheless, an interlinked, complex computer system has been established all around Australia for the entertainment of our citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that in an area as vital as elections we ought to have examined this possibility before now. Such a system could be employed in a range of areas. Obviously it could be employed at a federal level. It could be employed at the State government level and also at the local government level. It could also be employed by unions, in respect of which this Liberal Party Government is vociferous about holding secret postal ballots. It is a good way of holding such a ballot and overcoming the objections of unionists about the length of time it takes to get the results. In other words, this resource would be available to a variety of people within the community. That particular item was included in the terms of reference specified for the Senate select committee proposed by Senator Gietzelt. If the Government does not see fit to support these Bills, I hope that it will at least support the establishment of a select committee so that we can have a detailed, in-depth, comprehensive view of elections and electoral matters . If we establish such a committee we will be able to say to our citizens in 1982 and in the period to the year 2000 that at least we have made an attempt to update our electoral methods and make them as democratic as we can afford and manage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset that the Government opposes all of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bills before the Senate. Indeed, I am at a loss to know why the Australian Labor Party is rehashing these matters now. They were put before this chamber and were rejected several years ago. Basically, there is nothing new in this legislation. Having said that, I must also draw to the Senate's attention the fact that in April 1980 the Government established the Harders Committee of Inquiry into Disclosure of Electoral Expenses to examine electoral legislation and has given quite a deal of considerations to its report, which has been in its hands for some time. The report is complex and far-ranging and covers many matters which affect every senator and member of the Parliament. In the new year the Government will put before the Parliament recommendations that flow from its consideration of that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer first to Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982, which proposes that candidates' positions on House of Representatives ballot papers be determined by lot. I acknowledge the amendment now foreshadowed by Senator Siddons seeking an alteration to that. Senator Gietzelt argues that this will reduce the effect of the unconsidered vote, normally called the donkey vote, on the national result in House of Representatives elections. Let us look at that argument carefully. In individual electorates the effect of any donkey vote would not be eliminated. Senator Gietzelt's amendment would merely substitute the luck of the draw for the fact that one's surname begins with A or Z. We noted Senator Robert Ray's very interesting explanation and exposition on the number of candidates whose names begin with a letter between A and M. Taken across the whole country in respect of the House of Representatives, not only would the donkey vote not be eliminated but also its effects would not necessarily be reduced. Indeed, if a party had the luck of the draw in the comparatively small number of marginal seats decided by sufficiently few votes for the donkey vote to have had some influence, the possible effect could turn out to be greater than under the present system. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as an illustration, in the draw for positions for groups at the 1975 Senate election the coalition parties' candidates were drawn ahead of the Australian Labor Party candidates on the ballot papers in all six States and in both Territories. Frankly, one is forced to ask whether this is an amendment merely for the sake of an amendment. I must say that I am also not convinced that we should legislate, as Senator Gietzelt seems to think we should, to remove possibilities that political parties in their preselections will seek to choose candidates whose surnames are likely to place them near the top of the ballot paper. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the third Bill, which proposes to close the polls at 6 o'clock instead of 8 o'clock to reduce the hours which polling staff are asked to work. Nowhere in his second reading speech did Senator Gietzelt show any concern whatsoever for the elector. That principle has not been brought out by any speakers. The general principle underlying the current polling hours at Federal elections is that they should enable the largest possible number of voters to record their votes with a minimum of inconvenience. Given that voting is compulsory, it is particularly important that the task of casting a vote be facilitated. For example, extended polling hours give electors in hot climates the chance to vote in the cooler evening. At the 1980 election about 8 per cent of electors nationwide voted between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. and in Western Australia the figure was as high as 11.3 per cent. In the Northern Territory it was 10.4 per cent. Right across the country 680,000 people took advantage of the opportunity to vote between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. There is little doubt that a substantial number of them would have been inconvenienced had the polls closed earlier than they did. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt also seems to think that 6 p.m. closing will somehow enhance the ability of the Australian Electoral Office to conclude the night's count with a firm result in any but a finely balanced situation. This point was drawn out by Senator Robert Ray also. I just draw attention to the fact that in the recent election in South Australia where the polls closed at 6 p.m. there was no noticeable improvement in the delivery of the result. In fact it seemed to be somewhat later than one would have expected. It was 9.30 to 10 o'clock before the result became anywhere near clarified. I suppose that the closeness of the result and the failure of the ALP to do particularly well were the reasons for that. </PARA>

Senator Gietzelt does not seem to realise that already under the current law ordinary votes for the House of Representatives are counted on election night. As honourable senators will be aware, absentee votes are not counted on the night and postal votes can come in up to 10 days after the close of the poll. That is highly relevant to the Senate , as every honourable senator should understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The arrival of absentee and postal votes would determine the time upon which the quota could be finally determined. Furthermore, in Victoria, which has 6 o' clock closing for State elections, experience has been that counts are concluded only marginally earlier. I draw attention to that South Australian result as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It happened also to be a particularly warm day that day so, no doubt, people would have appreciated the booths staying open a little later. It is doubtful whether any great benefits would flow from a reduction in the hours worked by polling staff. The cost savings would be very slight. It is unlikely that there would be any reduction in the hours worked on polling day by permanent staff of the Electoral Office. Casual staff are fully aware of the hours they are to work before they seek positions as polling officials. The alleged reduction in the pressure on party supporters must be set against the inconvenience which could be experienced by a much greater number of electors if the proposal were implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 4), which proposes optional preferential voting and a broader criteria of formality. I interpose here to respond to Senator Robert Ray's point that elections conducted with a form of optional preferential voting are, in fact, easier to count and take considerably less time to count. I think Senator Sibraa referred to this matter also. That does not happen to be the experience in South Australia where optional preferential voting has been applying for the last two elections for the Legislative Council, the upper House. Clearly, in those two elections-in 1979 and in 1982, which has just passed-there was no evidence that the elections were conducted in any quicker time than would otherwise have applied. In fact we are now almost three weeks on from the date of the 1982 South Australian election and there is still no result for the Legislative Council election. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, numbers of defects in the scheme proposed by Senator Geitzelt. These all arise from the fact that the Bill would create a new category of vote-the exhausted vote. Votes would become exhausted at the stage of the count at which the elector did not indicate a preference for any candidate left in the count or where a voter skipped a number or showed the same preference for more than one candidate left in the count. The first possible effect of this is that a party's candidates could get an absolute majority of first preference votes at a Senate election but fail, for example, to get the three seats out of five which it might expect under the current system. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just listen, Senator. This could happen if a party's supporters had failed to indicate sufficient later preferences. Honourable senators will be aware that in order to gain election they must get that quota. Under the Commonwealth Electoral Act as it stands the only exception to this rule arises where there is only one seat left to be filled and only two candidates left. In this situation the candidate with the majority of votes is elected even if he does not have that quota. If Senator Gietzelt's Bill becomes law it would be possible for votes to be exhausted on such a scale that there could be two seats left to fill and only two candidates left with neither having gained a quota. What would happen in that situation? Neither could be elected because under the Act as amended a quota would still be needed to win the second last seat. The Bill just does not take that posibility into account. Even if votes were not exhausted on a large enough scale to give rise to that anomaly the probability of a candidate winning the last position with less than a quota would be increased. Extreme those examples might be but the law must be precise and must cover those kinds of situations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final defect is connected with the random sampling of surplus ballot papers of elected candidates which are to be distributed to the remaining candidates during the Senate count. Honourable senators may recall that in the event of a recount a fresh random sample of ballot papers is taken. I am advised that the probability of the result being changed by the taking of a fresh sample is very small under the current system. This probability would certainly be increased somewhat if Senator Gietzelt's Bills were passed, since the exhausted votes in the system would introduce a new element of variability in the sampling. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal with one or two other points which were mentioned during the debate, in particular the questions raised by Senator Robert Ray concerning new citizens or new enrollees. The Australian Electoral Office writes to every new citizen and advises him of his franchise obligations and entitlements to vote. Senator Robert Ray also drew our attention to the fact that party designations are allowed in some countries on ballot papers. The examples that he gave were, of course, those countries running proportional representation systems of government--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I, like my colleagues, congratulate the Australian Labor Party on at least taking a crack at the essential problem of electoral reform in this country, which reform is very much overdue. But I reiterate what a number of other speakers have said-that the whole system needs a complete reworking from beginning to end. We will not achieve a great deal by simply taking a piecemeal cut at it. That applies particularly to my view of Senator Gietzelt's Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1982, which I will speak to in a minute or two. I would support the No. 2 Bill as amended by Senator Siddons's amendment, and I approve of the No. 3 Bill. These are at least two areas in which I think we can effect an improvement which would be in the interests of the people of this country. I commend those Bills from that point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bill No. 4 worries me greatly. The whole principle of optional preferential voting is something which I think looks good on the face of it but which does not really work when construed into practice. I know all the arguments for it. I tend to agree with all of them. It would be a very good principle. It would be the best of all possible worlds where everybody is decent, where no political party wants to get the numbers and where voters have automatically knowledge and opinions on all candidates. But it is not that kind of world. I know it is tedious for voters to have to fill in all the numbers on their Senate ballot papers but I suggest that it is in their best interests and certainly in the best interests of democracy in this country that they should do so. The point is , of course, that most people follow party how to vote cards. I say to Senator Tate, who is trying to interject, that if he looks at the history of optional preferential voting since it was introduced in New South Wales he will see abundantly demonstrated what I am now about to say-that in practice in Australian politics, and I suggest in politics in most parts of the world, it comes down to a very thinly disguised first past the post system in the lower House and a elitist system in the upper House. In by-elections and other elections in New South Wales for the lower House it has been stressed by the Australian Labor Party that the elector should vote 1 for the Labor candidate. There has been no question of any preferences whatsoever. That is a positive discouragement for any person to distribute preferences at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The optional preferential system is calculated absolutely to perpetuate the two -party system forever, because it will discourage and reduce the chances of the election of gifted Independents and members of emerging parties. I think that is something which is to be greatly deplored, not only because of the effect it would have on the Australian Democrats but also because of our wider belief that more diversity in politics is necessary. We must have a situation which, one way or another, expresses that diversity. Until we have a system which in totality can do better than the one we have now I fear that optional preferential voting for the Senate will not achieve that. The present system does oblige the voter to give consideration to the people who put themselves up for election. That has a certain value in its own right. If people put themselves up for election it is reasonable that they should be considered in some way by the voter. I think that the present system does oblige the voter at least to give some thought to forces in the community which might be new, which might be emerging, which, due to the sheer inertia of human nature, the voter would not consider if a purely optional situation applied. As I say-this can be proved statistically-most people follow major party how-to-vote cards. That being the case there is a complete short circuiting and a reduction virtually to a first-past-the-post system for lower Houses and a list system for upper Houses. On that basis I will oppose the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Senate is considering three Bills to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Having just heard Senator Mason, it appears that at this juncture at least the amendment which seeks to provide for optional preferential voting and the liberalisation of the definition of ' informality' will not be passed. It also appears that the Bill which seeks to reduce the effect of the unconsidered vote, which is normally called the donkey vote, will be heavily amended or perhaps will not be passed. The other Bill which is before us seeks to close the polling booths at 6 p.m. At this point it appears that this Bill may have a chance of passing the Senate. My query is this : Why should the Government and Opposition agree to these measures coming before the Senate at this time? The Bills were introduced into the Parliament last week . They have not had the normal gestation period given to measures of this sort- that is to say, that which is given to private members' Bills. Normally when private members' Bills are introduced into the Parliament a second reading speech is made, the debate is adjourned and perhaps two or three months' later consideration is given to the measures in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Siddons has a Bill before the Parliament. Why is his Bill not being discussed at this time. What is the rush? To my knowledge there is no election around the corner. I thought that we were not having an election at this time because of the bad back of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I cannot understand the rush. Having heard the debate on the Bill which deals with the closing hours of the polling booths, I have no objection to this measure. It seems to merit consideration and support. After all, the polls do close at 6 p.m . in a number of States when State elections are held. To my knowledge there has not been a great scream from voters in those States about the closing time of the polls. That covers that provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The optional preferential voting system certainly has attraction in relation to the Senate. I note the table in the second reading speech which deals with Senate elections. I recognise that there is a difficulty in Senate elections for which there are large numbers of candidates for a valid vote to be determined by reference to the fact that electors must place numerals in consecutive order in the squares opposite each and every one of those candidates. I notice that in the Senate election in 1975 there were 53 candidates for New South Wales. I suggest that there should be some amendments to the current provisions so as to ensure that the elector need not place a consecutive mark against every one of those candidates. I cannot recall the average time involved for the elector to place numbers in sequence against the names of 53 candidates but it was quite considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty with this Bill is the one that was mentioned by Senator Mason, namely, the problem of the numbers of candidates in a Senate election. Having attempted to overcome that problem the Bill transposes that problem to the House of Representatives. As Senator Mason has said, this results in the House of Representatives ultimately having a first-past-the-post system. If there is to be a general acceptance of the provisions allowed for in the Bill and if electors generally opt to proceed along those lines we will see in the House of Representatives a first-past-the-post system. I do not think the honourable senator who introduced the Bill would suggest that but I suggest that that may well be the ultimate result. In any event, Senator Mason has indicated his opposition to the provision. Therefore, at this stage it appears that that will not hit the deck tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 4) seeks to reduce the effect of the unconsidered vote, normally called the donkey vote. The means by which it is proposed that this occur is the drawing by lot of the positions on the ballot paper. My view on this matter is similar to that of Senator Siddons and, to a certain extent, that of the Minister. That does not really get rid of the unconsidered or donkey vote. It only transposes alphabetical considerations to ones of lot. The donkey vote will still be there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concede that it certainly does that. I really support this Bill but I believe it does not go far enough. The amendment proposed by Senator Siddons extends that principle and, therefore, deserves support. Senator Siddons is proposing that there be a rotational system, a system similar to that which is now in operation for elections in Tasmania. This would mean that every candidate would have a chance of being placed on the top of the ballot paper. That also does not eliminate the unconsidered or donkey vote because there will be an unconsidered or donkey vote no matter which way we go about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand what Senator Tate is saying, but if we are talking about an unconsidered vote and we are looking at ways and means of overcoming it then that is one way of doing so. I might mention that this system has been accepted in Tasmania and appears to have worked reasonably well. My own view about it, however, is that this proposal is limited to the House of Representatives. I am certainly not prepared to support the measure as proposed by Senator Siddons, unless it is applicable to the Senate as well. If this were done we would try to eliminate the power of the donkey vote. Also there would be an added advantage in that this proposition would also tend to remove the power exerted by political parties over their own candidates within groups. I would suggest that if the Senate is serious about this desire to eliminate the donkey vote this legislation should apply to both House of Representatives and Senate elections. If that were the case I would support the measure. As it is now, the legislation is to apply only to the House of Representatives, and I see that to be somewhat discriminatory. We are proposing to eliminate the donkey vote for House of Representatives elections but not in respect of Senate elections. Therefore, I do not propose to support the measure at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I suggest that now is not the time to be debating this measure. The Minister has made a statement to the Senate concerning the intentions of the Government. The Minister said that the Government will, in the first session of Parliament next year, introduce legislation after having considered the report of the Harders Committee of Inquiry into Disclosure of Electoral Expenses. It will then be for the Houses of Parliament, both the House of Representatives and the Senate, to consider those measures and, if necessary, to amend them to ensure that the principle which these measures seek to implement are implemented in an adequate and effective manner. So I would have thought that the best means of dealing with this matter at present is for a motion to be moved at some stage that the debate be adjourned. Otherwise, it appears that both of the measures will go down the drain. I would not be happy with that arrangement because some of the proposals in the legislation have merit. Therefore my simple suggestion for anyone who might listen to me in a situation such as this is that if the Opposition wants the legislation passed at some later stage it might consider adjourning the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been suggested by Senator Harradine that the means by which this debate arose this afternoon were somewhat unusual. Perhaps I can put his mind at rest by saying that it was at the request of the Australian Democrats that debate on these Bills was brought on in preference to Bills which had their origin with the Australian Democrats. The Democrats, quite logically and properly, did not want to debate the Bills that were listed next on the Notice Paper as they related to South West Tasmania. I understand that next week some reports dealing with that issue will be presented . Therefore, we were requested to fill the breach. That is why these Bills are being debated this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put to Senator Harradine that one of the few options available to members of Parliament is the introduction of a private member's Bill. That is a very jealously guarded privilege which we should preserve. The Executive largely determines the legislative program. No matter which political party one supports or belongs to, one of the privileges that we have is to have private member's Bills and General Business considered on a Thursday afternoon. In recent months, attempts have been made to have these matters brought forward. The consequence of that action is that we have introduced three pieces of legislation which we hope will have the support of the Senate. When Parliament resumes next year, we will run the gauntlet in the House of Representatives where the Government has the opportunity to amend or reject private member's Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate-and I am sure Senator Messner will agree in relation to the period since he has been a member of Cabinet-that I have asked him and before him Senator Chaney and Senator Peter Baume, numerous questions about the reports that have been compiled by the Commonwealth Electoral Office. Since I have had the responsibility of researching electoral reform for my party, I have spent most of last year and this year endeavouring to get the Government to move in respect of these reports, which have not been made available to the Parliament, and which have now been in the hands of the executive Government for more than two and a half years. I think we are entitled to say that our patience has worn thin while we have been waiting for Government action. The Minister has stated that something will happen early next year. If I were to present the Senate with the replies to my questions honourable senators would see that that is a promise which has been made to me for the last 18 months. The Government says that it has the reports and that it intends to do something about them. If, by putting down our private member's Bills we have prodded the Government to move, that is probably a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit to the Senate that these Bills are designed to simplify the electoral processes, to make every vote effective and to bring about a situation whereby informal voting is considerably reduced and every vote becomes an effective vote . I submit also that another part of the process which I believe the Senate ought to consider seriously is a move towards a degree of uniformity in Australia's electoral voting systems. The situation now is that in five of the voting areas of Australia-four of the States and the Northern Territory-we have 6 o'clock closing of the polls. I have looked at the voting figures in each of those areas, that is, the three main States on the eastern seaboard, South Australia and the Northern Territory. When we compare State elections at which we have 6 o'clock closing with Commonwealth elections and elections in the two States that do not have 6 o'clock closing, we find no evidence to suggest that voters are disadvantaged in any way, shape or form as a result of 6 o'clock closing. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we can probably find at least common ground with the majority of honourable senators in that respect. No argument can be presented, apart from the disadvantages that Senator Messner put forward, that voters will be disadvantaged. He produced no evidence of that. It was purely a hearsay approach . If he is prepared to compare the voting patterns in State and Federal elections, he will find that there is absolutely no difference and no disadvantage to the voters at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The reduction of informal voting is a very important objective and one which the Parliament ought to be considering. I remind the Senate, for example, that there was a 15.2 per cent informal vote-a very large informal vote-for the Senate in the 1980 election in the seat of Melbourne. Thirty per cent of the voters in that electorate are migrants. So one is entitled to say that to the degree that we delay consideration of these matters we are disadvantaging almost one in three of those people insofar as they find it difficult to complete the ballot paper, as Senator Harradine and others have suggested. My colleagues Senator Robert Ray and Senator Sibraa have referred to the fact that people have difficulty, whether there are 40, 50 or 70 candidates on the ballot paper, in filling in the paper. If they fill in No. 27 twice or if they leave out a number the vote becomes invalid. That process ought to be unacceptable to any thinking person. This legislation seeks to create a new definition of an informal vote so that provided the voter's intention is clear the vote shall be regarded as formal to the level at which the informality takes place. If a ballot paper has two No. 13s on it the vote will be valid up to No. 13. </PARA>
<PARA> When we see the extent of the informality in Senate voting, it surely behoves the Senate to take steps to remove the difficulties that obviously face the increasing number of people who come to this country from other parts of the world where the voting systems are entirely different from ours. Some countries have a first-past-the-post system, others have proportional representation and in others voters use a cross to indicate their choice. In Australia different optional preferential systems operate in the States; a different system operates in the Federal sphere and a different system operates in the local government sphere. Can we wonder, therefore, why it is possible that, at the next Federal election, one million people in Australia may lose their votes as a result of their not understanding the voting system? The voting system discriminates against them to the extent that their votes become ineffective because of their failure to understand the system and complete every square on the ballot paper. Enough has been said in the debate to indicate that the Senate has been manipulated by certain unscrupulous political aspirants in a way which is designed to create such confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> The question has been raised by members of the Australian Democrats whether a vote shall be valid if the number of candidates marked exceeds by one the number of candidates to be elected. To appreciate that, the legislation, if adopted, would have the objective of making the ballot effective to the degree that if five candidates were to be elected, a voter could fill in the ballot paper to the extent of the number of candidates who had nominated on the how-to-vote card and if, in fact, he filled it in in respect of one more position, it would be a valid vote. That is a matter of some concern to Senator Mason, but the question how far a voter would fill in the ballot paper from the how-to-vote ticket would be resolved by negotiation between the parties concerned. It is not a question of this system being used to disadvantage minor parties or other candidates in the ballot. Rather, the system is designed to remove the ballot count, rather than the ballot itself. The ballot count would become an effective count when the elector filled one more name than the number of candidates to be elected. Of course, political parties will put out a how-to-vote ticket which has the names of the candidates nominated. But if, by chance, people fail to complete the ballot paper to the extent of the number of candidates nominated, that shall be a valid vote. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the point raised by Senator Siddons, I say that the system of drawing positions on the ballot paper is one that has operated advantageously for the Australian Democrats and independent senators. There is no doubt that whoever draws a key position-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not necessarily talking about this election, I am talking generally. There is no doubt that a person who draws the number one position on the Senate ballot paper has a decided advantage. That point is conceded. It would be foolish for the Parliament to change that system because it is drawn by lot. Therefore, the candidates who group themselves have the opportunity of equality in the way in which they finish up on the ballot paper. I think, it would be true to say that at the last election the Democrats were advantaged in some of the draws that they had. I think Senator Siddons should look at the system for the House of Representatives carefully because the drawing of positions for the ballot to elect a representative there combined with the freedom that is proposed under optional preferential voting, does effect and can have the effect of eliminating any donkey vote at all because, again, it is an option. If four candidates stood for election, votes one and two would be effective votes. In fact, we find that even in the House of Representatives elections, where there are only a small number of candidates, on average two or three percent of the votes are lost. As we have seen in elections in recent times that is sufficient to affect the overall result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine said, if I heard him correctly, that he would support the basic principle of the legislation but would not do so if it were extended to make candidates for the House of Representatives draw by lot in the same way as for the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this debate was interrupted I was summarising some of the Opposition's views about the current Budget. I would like to go back to that and to say that the Budget is basically a receipts and expenditure document for the Government of Australia. On the receipts side of the Budget some grossly inaccurate estimates have been made by the Government. The first of those to which I wish to refer is the amount of tax from pay-as-you-earn income earners which was miscalculated in the Budget of August this year, and it is a miscalculation which is being compounded day after day as unemployment continues to rise. The estimate for receipts from PAYE tax earners did not square, even as at August of this year, with the Government's own estimate of growth in the economy-namely, nil; nor did it square with the likely estimate of unemployed persons which the Government made at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second item of receipts in the Budget which shows very rubbery figures-to use Sir Phillip Lynch's phrase-is that the Budget assumes no loss of revenue from tax avoidance or evasion. That was because at the time it was part of the rhetoric of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to say that the tax evasion or tax avoidance industry had been disposed of by wave of the Treasurer's magic wand or whatever, and that there would be no loss of revenue in those areas. I just wanted to make the point again that that rhetoric and the figures in the Budget just do not square with reality or with the estimates of the Commissioner of Taxation, which have been revealed in his most recent report. I do not know whether the Treasurer has yet got the habit of talking with the Commissioner of Taxation from time to time. They certainly lost it for a number of years while tax avoidance and evasion was flourishing. But one would have hoped that by now the Treasurer, at least on these major matters, and without coming into conflict with the provisions of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, might have got into the habit of talking occasionally with the Commissioner of Taxation, and especially when making estimates in relation to Budget receipts. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area in which the receipts side of the Budget is wrong is in the estimate of company tax receipts. That must be an extremely doubtful estimate. As a result of the falling profitability of companies there is an estimated error of something like $600m in company tax receipts. Another area of receipt estimates in the Budget which seems to have been wrong is that of health rebates . There seems to be a $100m underestimation by the Government in relation to that rebate system. There is also a likely error in the Budget in relation to the amount which the Government will receive from its legislation to obtain tax owing to the Commissioner of Taxation as a result of taxation avoidance in the past few years. The Government's estimates of that are, in the Opposition's view , somewhat wild. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make the point that the Government, in this Budget, offered tax cuts and that offer, of course, is very much affected by the number of people who are likely to be in employment. This week the Government advocated a wages pause as, in the first instance, a method of gaining an additional $700m from the salaries of public servants throughout Australia to finance the growing unemployment benefit claims which have to be paid and as a method of providing money for work which will sop up some of the unemployment figures which are now so disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA> On the expenditure side of the Budget, the estimated expenditure on unemployment benefits was way out at the time of the Budget and every day it gets more and more way out as unemployment rises. I remind the Senate that the cost to this country of a one per cent increase in unemployment in terms of the cost of unemployment benefit and revenue forgone has been estimated as being in the area of $1 billion. That is what unemployment is costing this country in gross terms. It is a matter of great concern when one considers the whole economic strategy of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of estimated expenditure which is doubtful is that relating to drought relief. It is estimated to cost $360m. In the discussion today on the Estimates the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, gave some bases upon which that estimate was made, but there is some doubt about the real expenditure which will be incurred. So there are two items of major significance -the expenditure on drought relief and the expenditure on unemployment benefit- which drastically alter the size of the deficit and the overall strategy of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government was able to find quickly an estimated $360m to assist farmers who are suffering from the drought. We have no objection to that. We supported the legislation. The farmers need relief-although we have some criticisms of the schemes which have been devised for providing that relief. But it was easy to find the money. Apparently it was easy to find the additional $300m which it has been estimated will be required for unemployment benefit. That was to cover up, as it were, a government mistake in estimating the cost of unemployment benefit. It was easy to find that total of $660m, but if one is to find more money to deal with growing unemployment the way now suggested is a wages pause. This is after seven years, of course, of fighting inflation first. It is now suggested that one of the reason for the wages pause is to assist in the reduction of inflation. If it does that, well and good, but there is some very real doubt and uncertainty as to whether that result will follow. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget is a shambles of a document for the reasons which I have suggested. It is a shambles of a document in a sense culminating seven years of Government economic mismanagement of this country and a failure of government strategies. I remind the Senate that this Budget is introduced in a year in which Australia is in the unique economic situation of having rising inflation and rising unemployment at the same time. No other country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, for example, has those two factors operating together. Only the Fraser Government has those two things happening at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> This country has in addition the highest interest rates in the OECD. So we have rising inflation, rising unemployment, and the highest interest rates, no growth in the economy, no real promise of growth in the economy and no prediction of growth in the Budget Papers. We have an enormous overseas debt. We have no wages policy. We have had seven years of gross inaction on industry restructuring- seven years of dreadful inaction on this most important area which is now affecting the economy drastically. For seven years the Australian Government has followed those strat- egies. Added to that, compared with other countries which are better governed, we have falling living standards which are moving Australia down the relative tables of gross domestic product and average incomes in the OECD. We have, in fact, a country which is almost in an economic sense and in the crudest terms, bankrupt. It is bankrupt because it is led by a Government which is bankrupt of ideas and which has been recycling old economic policies and old attitudes without any success in tackling the real issues which face this economy and nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it quite clear, as the Opposition has done from the beginning, that it will not oppose these Appropriation Bills. We will not oppose them for reasons which we enunciated at the time the Budget was brought down. It is the Fraser Government's Budget and the Fraser Government will have to live with the economic and social consequences of this Budget. We will not defeat this Budget in the Senate. But this week, and in the last week, this Government has been spending $2m of taxpayers' money advertising the benefits of this Budget. It is not spending $2m of taxpayers' money or any of its own time trying to redress the ghastly errors in the Budget or pointing to the dreadful mistakes which have been made in it or some of the things to which we have referred in the context of this debate in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that we have here a Budget which was brought down with certain sweeteners with no reference to the real economic needs of this country and with no sense of long term strategy at all but with a few election sweeteners because the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wanted an early election before the holocaust of rising unemployment and inflation and so on really became more and more apparent. So a Budget was brought down and a plan was devised to spend $2m of taxpayers' money advertising the benefits of that Budget with an early election in mind. Of course, the money still has to be spent even though the Government got caught in its little proposals. For reasons we all know and which could only occur in some Alice in Wonderland type of environment normally, this country is not having an early election. But we have the Budget and its consequences. The Opposition is very concerned about those consequences and will not shirk its duty to point them out to the people of Australia. It is in that spirit that we now proceed, I take it, to a vote on the Appropriation Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; (Victoria-Minister for Finance) (6.25)-Before proceeding to the vote on the third reading I respond to some matters that were raised by Senator McLaren yesterday and today. He advised that he would be raising further matters during the third reading debate. Yesterday he raised matters with regard to the egg levy and he requested information on recovery of the outstanding egg levy and enforcement of the hen quota in the Australian Capital Territory. The egg levy is collected by the Department of Primary Industry pursuant to the Poultry Industry Levy Collection Act, which requires producers to submit returns and make levy payments on a fortnightly basis. If a producer fails to submit the required returns or to make levy payments, initial follow-up action is taken by the Department. If this does not achieve compliance with the legislation, the matter is referred to the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office for legal action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the hearing of Estimates Committee H on 16 September Senator McLaren sought information about possible evasion of the poultry industry levy by Bartter, who trades in the Australian Capital Territory as Parkwood Eggs Pty Ltd. By memorandum dated 9 November 1982 the Department amplified and updated the responses given at the Estimates Committee hearing. The position has changed again since that time. The present position is that Parkwood Eggs Pty Ltd has paid the levy on hens owned by it up to 4 February 1982. Further returns have been lodged for prescribed levy days up to 30 September 1982, but the levy due has not been paid. Returns have not been lodged or levy paid for prescribed levy days from 14 October 1982 to date. Legal proceedings have been commenced for the recovery of $123,862.18, being levy outstanding up to 24 June 1982, and $5,468. 41, being penalty for non-payment of that levy up to 13 October 1982. Further action is in course to have the outstanding returns lodged and the levy paid. </PARA>
<PARA> A further matter was raised by Senator McLaren. In answer to his query about hen quotas, I am advised that the Australian Capital Territory has a hen quota of 200,000 hens. Parkwood Eggs is the Territory's major egg producer and is licensed to keep 189,088 hens. The Australian Capital Territory quota and licence arrangements are administered by the Department of the Capital Territory under the Egg Industry Ordinance 1975 and Regulations. The payment of hen levy by Australian Capital Territory producers is administered by the Department of Primary Industry under the poultry industry levy legislation. Both the Australian Capital Territory Ordinance and the Commonwealth Acts require producers to keep and submit records of the number of hens kept and for inspections to be made of farms to count the number of hens being kept. A joint inspection was recently arranged under the provisions of both the Ordinance and the Commonwealth Acts. Inspectors arrived at the Parkwood Eggs property on Wednesday 20 October and were refused admittance. They obtained entry on 21 October by warrant and their report indicates that the hens counted were in excess of the number of hens specified in the licence held by Parkwood Eggs Pty Ltd. Follow-up inspections were arranged on 28 October 1982 and 11 November 1982 . The evidence collected by the inspectors has been forwarded to the Department' s legal advisers for action. Quota surveillance in the Territory is being maintained and prosecutions will be pressed when evidence indicates breaches have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren raised another matter with regard to Mr Anthony and the loan on the house which he has in the Australian Capital Territory. In response to the questions that were raised, the information is given that at the time Mr Anthony was allocated his house in May 1964, and at the time that he purchased his house in November 1964, the eligibility criteria were as follows: Firstly, an applicant had to be employed in Canberra, except in the case of pensioners who were genuinely living in Canberra; secondly, the applicant had to be continuously employed in Canberra during the period on the waiting list unless temporarily absent in the course of employment. The Commissioner for Housing can find no evidence that a 10 per cent discount was available to purchasers of government houses. A check on Mr Anthony's personal file revealed that the purchase price of the house was the same as the value placed on the property by the chief valuer. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren also indicated that he would seek further information on the home bases nominated by Mr Anthony and Mr Sinclair for each month of 1981. The advice from the Department of Administrative Services is that there was no change in the home base by either Mr Anthony or Mr Sinclair during 1981. Their home bases were Murwillumbah and Tamworth respectively. There has been some comment with regard to the definition of home base. The information from the Department is that the definition of home base prior to 1 July 1982 was that ' home base for the purpose of payment of travelling allowance to Ministers shall be the home of a Minister unless he nominates otherwise to the Minister for Administrative Services'. The definition of home base with effect from 1 July 1982 is now that 'home base for the purpose of payment of travelling allowance to a Minister shall be the principal place of residence of the Minister and he shall nominate to the Minister for Administrative Services his principal place of residence'. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter was raised and I take this opportunity to provide information. It relates to a minor correction of the figures that were given in the schedule that was incorporated in Hansard relating to the allowance paid to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The amount paid on that schedule should be amended to read $19,980. This amount related to 59 days, not 56 days as previously indicated. Of the amount of $19,980, $3,768 was paid to the Prime Minister for 30 days' travelling allowance. The remaining $16,212 relates to paid hotel bills covering 29 days. Of this latter amount $9,939 relates to 14 days at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matters that required information related to the inquiry into the financial affairs of Mr Horgan. Senator Walsh raised the matter of the dates on which contact was made with Commissioner Costigan. I regret the imprecision of the earlier briefing that was given. My advice is that contact was made with Commissioner Costigan over the weekend of 18-19 September and that the Secretary to the Department of Administrative Services also spoke with Commissioner Costigan on 23 September. </PARA>

It will be noted that funds were appropriated for Western Australia to assist with the sewerage pipeline at Cockburn Sound. Tasmania has been given assistance for tourist roads. South Australia has been given assistance with its water supply. I would have thought that it is up to the South Australian Government to apply those funds for water supply purposes. I think it is highly unlikely that any commitments had been made prior to the passing of the Bills for the Government to use these funds. I think it is open to the Government of South Australia to apply those funds to water supply facilities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Senate commences its consideration of this Bill, I feel I should point out that the appearance of the Bill is an historic occasion in the development of parliamentary institutions in Australia. This is the first time that the appropriations for the services under the control of the Houses of Parliament have been contained in a separate Bill. The presentation of the Bill is an appropriate recognition of the status of the Houses of the Parliament and of their independence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As was pointed out by the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle , in her second reading speech, the immediate cause of the Bill was the Government's consideration of the report by the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing. The introduction of the Bill, however, may accurately be said to be the result of efforts by senators over many years. The inappropriateness of provisions for the services of the Parliament being contained in a Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government was pointed out in the Senate by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Murphy, as he then was, in 1964. In 1965, a committee of then Government senators appointed to consider the Appropriation Bills and the ordinary annual services of Government recommended that the appropriations for the Parliament should not be included in the Appropriation Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government. The Committee pointed out that it had been suggested that it was inconsistent with the concept of the separation of powers and the supremacy of the Parliament for the two Houses to be treated as an ordinary annual service of the Government. This report is found in Parliamentary Paper No. 55 of 1967.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter was again referred to in the Senate in 1968 in debate on the 1968-69 Budget. In 1972, the Senate House Committee reported on the provision of staff and other facilities for senators and recommended that the appropriation for such staff and other facilities for the Senate, its members and office-bearers should be administered by the President, acting, where necessary, with the advice of the Senate House Committee and subject to any direction of the Senate. In 1974, Senate Estimates Committee A made a recommendation that funds for the Parliament should not be included in the appropriation Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government. The Committee also recommended that there should be an uncommitted contingency fund upon which the President could draw for unanticipated Senate expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1978 and 1979, Estimates Committee A again made the recommendation that the two Houses should make such arrangements for their own resources and facilities as were necessary to achieve the proper constitutional relationship with the Executive. Specific arrangements to enable greater control by the Senate over its own appropriations were suggested by Senator Jessop in a speech during the debate on appropriations in 1979. In 1980, the Senate appointed a select committee to inquire into and report upon Parliament's control of its own appropriations and staffing and related matters. The report of the Committee, brought down on 29 June 1981, recommended, amongst other things, that the appropriations for the Parliament be contained in a separate Bill, that a standing committee on appropriations and staffing determine the estimates for inclusion in the Bill, and that services to the Parliament under the control of executive departments be examined with a view to transferring such services to the Parliament's Appropriation Bill and to the control of the Houses. The Senate has attended to those recommendations within its power, particularly by the establishment of the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. It is as a result of the Government's acceptance of one of the recommendations of the Select Committee that we now have this Bill before us.</PARA>
<PARA> I feel that I should congratulate those senators, both past and present, whose efforts over the years have come to partial fruition with the presentation of this Bill. The history which I have recounted illustrates how well the cause of the Parliament may be served by the persistence and dedication of senators who are determined to see that the two Houses are properly equipped to carry out their respective functions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, at the outset I say that I very much appreciate the historical references embodied in the statement that you have just presented to the Senate. Over the years a lot of work has been done by honourable senators on all sides of this Parliament to bring about a Bill of this nature. If I, during the course of my remarks, recapitulate some of the history that you have outlined it will be mainly for the purpose of correcting an impression that might be gained by anyone reading a statement put down by the Speaker of the House of Representatives when the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives last month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I speak to the second reading of the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill because from the time I first took my seat in the Senate in 1962 I have always maintained a consistent and demonstrated interest in securing greater autonomy and independence on the part of the Parliament. Indeed, that was the theme of my maiden speech in this Senate over 20 years ago. I am pleased that, having been the Deputy Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing-I see the Chairman of that Committee, Senator Jessop , in the chamber-I have seen the introduction of this Bill during the course of my term in Parliament. Mr President, the statement that you have made has pointed to the historical occasion that the introduction of this Bill represents . It is a milestone in parliamentary democracy. Indeed, it is a reassertion of the old doctrine of the supremacy of parliament over the Executive and the bureaucracy. I trust that those who are reporting the proceedings of this Parliament are fully appreciative of the significance and importance of this measure. </PARA>
<PARA> However-I say this with some regret-when the Bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives I rather fear that in the statement made by the Speaker of that House there was an attempt to rewrite the real history of this matter, the history that you, Mr President, have outlined to the Senate today. I think it fair to say that if anyone were to read the Speaker's statement on 26 October that person would be left with the belief only that the Speaker was responsible for the introduction of the new financial and staffing arrangements for the Parliament that are embodied in this Bill. True it is that the Speaker himself was gracious enough to give evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing which, as I have said, was under the chairmanship of Senator Jessop of South Australia. But the real danger inherent in the Speaker's statement to the House of Representatives is that if it is not corrected parliamentary and political history will be wrongly written. One could mistakenly get the impression that it was the Speaker's initiative that indeed caused the establishment of the Senate Committee. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement that you have made, Mr President, summarises the history of the Parliament's appropriations and staffing arrangements. Nevertheless, I commend to all interested persons the detailed statement that is recorded in chapter 2 of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, which was presented to the Senate in June 1981. I particularly commend to the Speaker of the House of Representatives a reading of that chapter of the report. The facts that are set therein show that it was in 1964 that Senator Murphy, as he then was, first pointed out to the Parliament the inappropriateness of the funds provided for the Parliament being included in a Bill for the provision of funds for the annual, ordinary services of the Government. Everyone who served in this Parliament during the period when Senator Murphy served, knows that throughout his political life he argued consistently that the provision for the Parliament on the one hand, and for the Government on the other, should be made in separate appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> After 1964 the matter was taken up by a committee of government senators, which consisted of Senator Cormack, Senator McKellar, Senator Wedgwood and Senator Wright. It was again raised in 1968 by Senator Cormack, in 1972 the Senate House Committee took the matter up. That Committee comprised Senator Cormack, Senator Guilfoyle, Senator Jessop, Senator Laucke, the late Senator Milliner, Senator Murphy and Senator O'Byrne. As an aside, it is probably fitting to note that Senator Jessop, having been a member of that Senate House Committee, was Chairman of the ultimate Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Staffing and Appropriations; also, that Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle who similarly was a member of that House Committee in 1972 and is now the Minister for Finance, has introduced this historic Bill in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter was again raised in 1974 by Senate Estimates Committee A in its report to the Senate. That Committee consisted of Senator Everett, Senator Gietzelt, Senator Greenwood, Senator James McClelland and Senator Missen. I mention all of these names deliberately to show that work over a period of nearly two decades on the part of honourable senators from all sides of the Parliament has been responsible for the introduction of this Bill. That is quite contrary to the assertions of the Speaker of the House of Representatives on 26 October last. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter was again referred to in 1976 by the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System, also by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. It was again referred to in May 1978 by Senate Estimates Committee A. The late Senator Knight, Senator McLaren, Senator Scott, Senator Sibraa, Senator Sim and I were members of that Committee. The matter was again referred to in November 1978 by Senate Estimates Committee A, of which Senator Colston, Senator Davidson, Senator Knight, Senator Martin, Senator McLaren and Senator Wriedt were members. It was again referred to by Senate Estimates Committee A in October 1979. The membership of the Committee was the same, except that Senator Sibraa had gone back to the Committee as a replacement for Senator McLaren. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention these matters in detail to show that a lot of honourable senators, from all sides, in the Parliament were involved in the long political process. Finally the Senate was persuaded to appoint a Senate select committee to inquire into and report upon Parliament's staffing and appropriations. That committee was established in May 1980. It consisted of Senator Jessop, myself, the late Senator Knight, Senator Missen, Senator Robertson, Senator Sim and for a while, our colleague Senator Ryan. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EK7">Senator DOUGLAS McCLELLAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And indeed Senator Mason representing the Australian Democrats. I thank Senator Jessop for his assistance. It is true that the Speaker gave evidence to the select committee, as did a lot of other people. According to his statement on 26 October last year to the House of Representatives, soon after he gave his evidence, the select committee reported and, using his words, recommended sweeping changes incorporating many of those he had been advocating to ensure the independence of the Parliament. But when one reads the evidence given to the Senate select committee by the Speaker one will see that he was quite obsessed with the need for a single line appropriation. Indeed, I think I am fair in saying that he saw a single line appropriation as something of a panacea for autonomy and independence of Parliament generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The select committee's reaction to the Speaker's recommendation for a one-line appropriation is shown by the fact that not one single mention was made in the committee's report of that concept suggested by the Speaker. If one peruses the evidence given to the committee one will see that about the only time the Speaker's mind was distracted from the concept of a one-line appropriation was when he was asked for his attitude or reaction to the ideas and proposals being put forward by members of the committee. So much for the Speaker's statement that the select committee recommended sweeping changes incorporating many of those that he himself had been advocating! I suggest that his statement would have been accurate had he said that the select committee had recommended sweeping changes but had overlooked, ignored or rejected his proposal for a single-line appropriation in favour of a really independent measure-namely, that the appropriations for the Parliament be removed from the ordinary Appropriation Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government and included in a separate parliamentary appropriation Bill. That was the concept and the recommendation of the Senate select committee which was chaired by Senator Jessop. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me look at the other recommendations of the committee. For instance, the committee recommended that the Senate should establish a Senate standing committee on appropriations and staffing and replace the arrangement of discussions between the President and the Leader of the Government in the Senate on matters affecting the Senate. The select committee wanted a cross representation of honourable senators to have an input into the appropriations and staffing of the Parliament. That is what was eventually agreed to. But what did the Speaker have to say about that? Mr President, because of broadcasting arrangements I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week Senator Harradine spoke in the adjournment debate and raised the matter of some information which was given over station 2JJJ which comes to Canberra through station 2CN. He referred to the fact that a disc jockey had given information about a pro-abortion rally which was to be held in Sydney. Senator Harradine said that he wanted to know by this time this week what action the Austtralian Broadcasting Commission had taken with respect to the matter. I have just received a report from the Minister for Communications (Mr N. A. Brown) containing information which has been provided, on my advice, by Mr Keith Mackriell, the Assistant General Manager, Radio, of the ABC. The information provided states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The demonstration held outside Parliament House was not 'encouraged' by the ABC . </PARA>
<PARA> At approximately 1.45 a.m. on 11 November, the duty announcer on 2 Triple Jay read a press release issued by the Women's Abortion Campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The telephone number was given once only. </PARA>
<PARA> The announcer offered no editorial comment on the merits or otherwise of the demonstration. He simply read the press release without comment. </PARA>
<PARA>The advice goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The number of people listening to the station at such an early hour is necessarily small. </PARA>
<PARA> A transcript of the announcement is attached. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the foregoing factors the ABC does not believe that further action is called for in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I have no wish to repeat this valuable community service which is provided by the ABC. Our proceedings are not being broadcast, so that is all right. In any event, rather than take the time of the Senate, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the extract which was provided by the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The extract read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> ''. . . . before that you heard an oldies one from Dexy's Midnight Runners and before that JFK and the Cuban Crisis . . . um . . . in a few moments we have an item of interest for you regarding a rally that's occurring at noon tomorrow, which wishes to raise the issue that a woman's right to legal and safe abortion is possibly endangered by current acts that are occurring, so we'll tell you a bit more about that in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>(MUSIC)</PARA>
<PARA> That's Godley and Creme. Before that you heard Japan and John Cooper Clarke. </PARA>
<PARA> John Cooper Clarke will be in Australia along with New Order in November, playing at the Capital Theatre and that occurs on the 29th November . . . just trying desperately to find the correct information. </PARA>
<PARA> Women's Abortion Action Campaign has some information here and ''Women are in danger of losing the right to legal abortion'', Angela Rose, who is the spokesman for the women's abortion action campaign said today. ''The motion to be introduced by the Rev. Fred Nile MLC into the NSW Legislative Council on 11th November, could mean a return to the days of women dying from backyard abortions '', she said, and she went on to say that Nile's motion intends to establish human status from the moment of conception and this would lead to the outlawing of abortion and the IUD's. So that WAAC has organised a rally at noon on November 11th, which is later today and calls all who wish to maintain a woman's right to a legal, safe abortion to attend it and to write voicing their protest to members of the Legislative Council and you can get further information by ringing Margaret Kirkby during work hours on 660 5051, so if you'd like to find out more about the rally, I imagine tomorrow, or later on this morning during business hours would be the time''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also make the comment that if the announcer was simply reading a Press release it was a very oddly worded Press release, as the extract which I have just had incorporated seems to be in oral rather than written language. I would have thought that the ABC would provide to the Senate, in response to Senator Harradine, advice on the general policy of the ABC with respect to making what might be termed public service announcements. As a regular listener to the ABC, I am aware that the ABC appears to give some publicity to what might be termed community organisations. Clearly, in this case, the ABC has given publicity to a community organisation which arouses very strong feelings both for and against in the community. I will be asking the Minister for Communications to ask the ABC to provide the Senate with that additional information which I think is relevant to any judgment on whether the disc jockey concerned was behaving in a reasonable manner.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Commercial uranium deposits are found in over 30 countries including those mentioned by the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's decision to develop its uranium industry was based inter alia on the need for Australia, as a country with abundant and highly competitve energy resources, to help meet the needs of an energy deficient world. A further important factor in the decision was the Government's recognition that only as a producer and supplier of uranium can Australia be an effective force in support of the international non-proliferation regime and nuclear safeguards and controls over nuclear material.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Australia has low-cost uranium reserves of 294,000 tonnes U, which are the largest of any country in the western world and equivalent to some 19 per cent of the western world's reasonably assured resources capable of being mined at a cost below $US80 per kilogram U.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the production of nuclear weapons, several tonnes, of natural uranium are required to produce the few kilgrams of plutonium or very highly enriched uranium required for use in nuclear weapons. Australia's safeguards policy provides that Australian nuclear material may not be used for non- peaceful or explosive purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The concentration of uranium in sea water is approximately 0.003ppm. In aggregate terms this means that the waters of the world's seas and oceans contain an estimated 4 billion tonnes of uranium. Various reagents have been tested for the recovery of uranium by solvent extraction, ion exchange or absorption.</PARA>
<PARA> Research on extraction of uranium from sea water has been carried out in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy and West Germany. These studies indicate that sea water extraction is technically feasible, but is at present uneconomic. A study in the USA in 1978 estimated that the cost of uranium extracted from sea water would range from $5,000 to $7,000/kg for a plant constructed by 1995. Despite the economic obstacles, the Japanese government has commissioned the Metal Mining Agency of Japan to construct a pilot plant scheduled to commence operation in 1984 with an annual production capacity of 10kg U. The Shikiku Research Agency has reported the successful operation of a different technique, which they claim to be superior to the method employed by the Metal Mining Agency.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Australian Atomic Energy Commission has never conducted research on uranium from sea water and is unaware of any such research by any other institution in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Auditor-General, in his report of 7 September 1982, tabled in the Senate identified some areas where he considered that the Department's established cargo control and accounting procedures were not being stringently applied.</PARA>
<PARA> The report suggests in essence that, based on audits carried out during 1981 in Queensland and Western Australia, attention should be given to:</PARA>
<PARA> the role of container seals as a control measure and apparent inadequacies in departmental policing of the issuing and use of container seals;</PARA>
<PARA> reducing the current level of departmental approvals for the unsupervised unpacking of containers;</PARA>
<PARA> increasing the security requirements for and undertaking the examination of ostensibly empty containers; and</PARA>
<PARA> stricter adherence to certain aspects of the Department's establshed cargo control and accounting procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no legal provision in Australia, nor is there any international convention between Customs administrations that requires or provides for the sealing of containers.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has, however, taken a significant role in promoting a study at the Customs Co-operation Council, Brussels (the international forum of Customs administrations) to determine the effectiveness of container sealing for Customs purposes and to define the role, if any, of the Customs in the sealing of containers. This study is still in progress.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of approvals to unpack containers without supervision, it is physically impossible for the Australian Customs Service, or for that matter any other Customs Service to open and examine all cargo whether it is containerised or conventional cargo.</PARA>
<PARA> The only practical and effective control measure is for the Customs Service to make a risk assessment before permitting the movement of cargo from its place of discharge. Since March 1982, new controls have been introduced and the Customs Service makes a judgement about each importation before permission is granted to move any cargo.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of security over empty containers, the Auditor-General acknowledged that the new procedures mentioned should provide adequate control over empty containers. The list of checks laid down for the guidance of cargo control officers includes examining ostensibly empty containers. These particular checks have been carried out on a continuing non-programmed basis for many years.</PARA>
<PARA> Attention has been and is being given to the additional points of detail mentioned by the Auditor-General in regard to the ongoing application of the current cargo control and accounting procedures. A comprehensive review is being undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs recommended that increased attention and resources should be given to the detection and interception of drugs illegally imported, especialy in containerised cargo. The Royal Commission made a number of recommendations in respect of containerised cargo.</PARA>
<PARA> The following action has been taken in respect of these recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA> drug detector dogs are being used by Customs to examine containerised cargo;</PARA>
<PARA> containerised cargo is selected for inspection on the basis of a risk assessment and supplemented by random examinations;</PARA>
<PARA> development of container search and cargo examination skills are ongoing activities. Any equipment that is needed to enhance searching techniques is acquired. The Customs administration is continually monitoring developments;</PARA>
<PARA> the effectiveness and practicability of seals is under study;</PARA>
<PARA> continuing permissions granted under Section 40AA of the Customs Act for goods to be moved from initial discharge points prior to being released from Customs control have, since March 1982, required the listing of goods to be removed; the Collector responsible at the place of initial discharge to be notified prior to the goods being moved; and the Collector responsible at the destination place to be notified of the movement no later than when the goods arrive there.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The part of the Report of the Royal Commission into the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union to which the honourable senator refers has not been released. Therefore I have no comment on that part of the question.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government has substantially improved, and is continuing to improve, the controls it exercises in respect of containerised and other imported cargo.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 October 1982 (Hansard page 1613) Senator McIntosh asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I preface my question by quoting from a United Nations General Assembly document of October 1981 headed 'Question of East Timor'. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA> The General Assembly . . .</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of East Timor to self- determination and independence, in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV).</PARA>
<PARA> In a recent statement to the United Nations General Assembly the Minister said that the United Nations Security Council was the main organ for maintaining international peace and security, yet many of the resolutions were routinely ignored. He also said that what applies to the Security Council applies even more to the General Assembly and other organs of the United Nations. How can the Minister justify this statement when his Government continues, year after year, to ignore the General Assembly's recommendations over East Timor and to ignore similar recommendations from the Security Council?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The senator refers to the statement delivered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the General Debate at the United Nations General Assembly on 6 October. The theme of the Minister's statement was that the General Assembly was meeting against a background of international tension and at a time when the performance of the United Nations itself was coming under intense and critical scrutiny. The Security Council, the key United Nations body responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security, needed to become more robust and to deal more promptly and effectively with disputes. The Minister committed Australia to support the use of the collective influence of member states to ensure respect for Security Council decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government strongly endorsed United Nations attempts to find a solution to the situation that developed in East Timor following Indonesia's intervention in the territory in December 1975. Australia supported efforts made by the Security Council at that time to reach a solution, including the mission of the Secretary-General's special envoy, Mr Winspeare Guicciardi.</PARA>
<PARA> The Security Council adopted resolutions on the question of East Timor in December 1975 and April 1976. Since then, however, the General Assembly has been the main forum for debate on East Timor. The Government's view is that, in significant respects, resolutions on this matter adopted by the General Assembly have been unrealistic. For this reason, Australia has not supported these resolutions and, since they are recommendatory only, has not been bound by them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 October 1982 (Hansard, page 1844) Senator Townley asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aviation the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware that commercial pilot examinations are held only three times a year and that it takes up to six weeks after such an examination for candidates to receive results from the Department. Whilst I realise that some people take these examinations purely out of a desire to obtain a supplementary licence, most people are wanting to become involved in flying for a livelihood and need the licences before they can do that. As the airlines have an upper limit for the age beyond which they will not accept applicants, the limited number of examinations and the slowness of the publication of the results limits a pilot's chance of being accepted by an airline. Will the Minister ascertain if commercial pilot licence examinations can be held more frequently? If not, why not? Can the marking of such examinations be speeded up?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The normal frequency of commercial pilot examinations is three times a year and results are notified approximately six weeks after the examinations as Senator Townley has pointed out. It is difficult to accept however, that this situation limits pilots' job prospects, particularly when compared to other professional qualifications, which are gained not more frequently than once per year.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, my Department has already commenced preparing new objective-type examinations for the commercial pilot licence as already are used for private licences. Although the involved Section of the Department is experiencing some difficulty in recruiting suitably qualified staff it is hoped to have this project completed and ready for introduction by the end of next year. These new examinations will lead to an increase in their frequency and a reduction in marking time. Because there is only a limited number of experienced examiners available to maintain the present system, it will not be possible to vary it during 1983.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government upgraded arrangements for civil coastal surveillance in 1978 and decided at that time that a further review would be undertaken in 1981. That review, announced in December 1981, led to the Government deciding that further improvements to operational and management systems will be progressively introduced. Improvements include new funding and program budget arrangements and the specification of additional navigation, communications, and radar equipment for civilian charter aircraft performing coastal surveillance tasks under new contract arrangements. These measures are aimed at improving overall accountability and providing greater operational capability and increased margins of safety in the performance of coastal surveillance tasks.</PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Interdepartmental Committee On Civil Coastal Surveillance, by Government direction, is required to keep all elements of the program under continuous review. The Government is currently examining matters brought to its attention by the SIDC in recent weeks and will be reaching a decision shortly.</PARA>
