<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 1306 citizens of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that some single supporting parents are unfairly disadvantaged in having chosen to care for children fulltime during the formative years, believing such care was essential to their well-being; and that women without dependent children, and who are under 50 years of age are not eligible for a continuous pension. These women have devoted their whole lives to their families and do not have skills relevant to the present employment situation. Their future prospects, with increasing age and length of time out of the work force are a deterrent to employers. Skilled workers find it difficult to obtain employment and unskilled workers find it even more difficult. Unemployment benefit was not designed for long term usage and the low rate of payment plus the work tests over a long period of time lead to a general decline in the physical and mental health, with the result that the women are being placed on sickness benefits. Sickness benefits, however, were also designed for short term usage and is unable to provide security for these women.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Amend the Social Services Act to reduce the age of eligibility for a Class B Widow's pension from 50 to 40 years; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Expand existing training schemes to include women taken off Supporting Parent's Benefit.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EJ4">Senator SIBRAA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aviation. Is it true that a multi-million dollar fraud involving international airline tickets has been discovered whereby travel agents in Australia have been importing airline ticket coupons from New Zealand which, because of the exchange rates, are 30 per cent cheaper than the same tickets bought in Australia? The travel agent then fills in the ticket stating that the journey starts and finishes in New Zealand in order to give it legitimacy and consequently sells it at a cheaper price. Apparently, however, the fraud arises when the airline on whose ticketing the flight coupons are written redeems them in New Zealand and gets paid in New Zealand currency which is a lot less than the applicable fare level in Australian dollars. I now ask the Minister whether the travel agent involved is liable for prosecution and whether passengers who, knowingly or otherwise, participate in the scheme run the danger of being charged the full legitimate cost of the ticket or, alternatively, of being offloaded from their flight.</PARA></TALK.START>

There have been examples of this kind of activity in respect of various types of schemes along lines similar to those outlined by Senator Sibraa. I would need to check out the details. If Senator Sibraa has any further information as to the detail of the scheme and how it operates, perhaps he would care to supply it to the Minister. It seems to be one of those schemes which could be used in current circumstances, given the relative values of currencies between this country and others and the changes that occur from time to time. So, the best course is that I should refer the whole matter to the Minister for Aviation and seek an early reply.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I refer to the Government's survey of the experiences of young people entering the job market announced yesterday by Mr Macphee. Is the Minister aware that the shortage of jobs for youth in Tasmania is more acute than in any other State, as indicated by the greater percentage of Tasmanian youth, per head of population, who have never held a job?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to the report referred to by Senator Walters. She is correct. There is a difficult employment situation for youth in Tasmania. The proportion of the youth labour force which has never held a job is 10.8 per cent, as compared with the national average of 4.8 per cent. On the other hand, there has been some preliminary analysis by the Bureau of Labour Market Research that suggests that Commonwealth youth programs have provided greater than average assistance to unemployed youth in Tasmania. Given the general position, I suppose that that is not surprising if those programs are effectively getting to the youth who require them. Two studies are currently being conducted which will also give insight into the Tasmanian youth labour market situation. There is a study on youth employment patterns in Australia and an analysis of youth placed in manpower programs over 1980-81. They may meet the purpose which the honourable senator sought in her question. I will refer the question to the Minister and ask him to keep an eye on the matter as those surveys become available.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Attorney-General aware that there is growing concern among those interested in film culture in Australia about the way in which censorship is now operating in this country? While accepting that the problem stems from the fact that the censorship regulations make no distinction between commercial cinema and the genuine artistic interests of organisations such as film festivals and the Australian Film Institute, is it not true that the arrangements worked satisfactorily for some years under a 1975 agreement which admitted the festival films without censorship provided certain conditions, such as limiting screenings to subscribers and to over 18-year-olds only, were met? Has this fair and workable understanding been unilaterally abrogated by the Film Censorship Board, which now imposes tougher censorship restrictions on film festivals than it does on ordinary commercial cinemas? Will the inevitable consequence be that the Sydney and Melbourne film festivals will lose their formal international recognition-a devastating blow to the development of film culture in this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

The Acting Attorney- General is aware that there is concern among people who are interested in film culture in Australia about the way that censorship is operating. That is a matter which arises from the fact that a number of films which were of interest to festivals have been subjected to censorship. It has always been the case that films which are to be shown at film festivals are subject to the same censorship rules as apply to other films. In other words, if they contain material which would be regarded as offensive generally, the fact that they are exhibition films does not make any difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Hamer said, there was an arrangement in 1975 that related to obtaining entry of films without undue delays but it did not involve any formal exemption from censorship requirements. In any event, because the matter has been one of concern-it is an area which is not solely one of Commonwealth responsibility because the States control what is exhibited in the States; the Commonwealth merely has control over importation-it is currently to be the subject of discussions between Commonwealth and State officials to see whether the concerns which Senator Hamer has raised can be met. I will ensure that the concerns expressed by Senator Hamer are drawn to the attention of the Acting Attorney-General so that he, in turn, can make sure that the matters raised are taken into account in those discussions.</PARA>

But the schedules can be disallowed only in the event of there being safety difficulties. The Government is unable to consider schedules on the basis of public interest along the general lines that Senator Missen outlined in his question relating to the actual scheduling of flights. Of course, that boils down very largely to a question of operational judgment on the part of the individual airlines.

Unless the sickness was the cause of the loss of income, entitlement to benefit does not arise under section 108.

In other words, I do not think advice of the sort that he is suggesting that I might have received would be abroad. I shall check to see that there is no problem in the area that he has raised.

One of the things that we have sought from employees, through the trade union movement, and one of the things we have urged before industrial tribunals is the need for wage restraint. We have, for the same reasons, opposed the extension of shorter working hours. We have endeavoured to follow policies which will maintain Australia's competitive position. It is fair to say that over the last 12 months there was a succession of settlements and decisions which certainly were well outside the indicators which the Commonwealth Government had given as being appropriate to Australia's economic circumstances. The general economic policy of the Federal Government has been to try to maintain a situation that would bring about growing employment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wherever there are existing schools, the effects that the opening of a new school might have on enrolments have to be taken into account. This has been drawn to my attention by the Schools Commission and also by numerous people. It is not something which was discovered in the last report of the Schools Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the third grammar school in Canberra, honourable senators will be aware that the Government has decided to make available some of the funds from an existing vote to help with the capital cost of establishing the third grammar school. We did not allocate extra money; from the vote that was there for non-government schools we have approved that some expenditure be made on a third grammar school. The amount would be something like $250,000, or a bit more , in this financial year and about $800,000 overall.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation in the Belconnen area is that there is a demographic change going on. It is anticipated that enrolments will change. It is thought that the establishment of the third grammar school might bring one of the decision points for a high school in that area forward by two years. It will bring it forward probably from 1995 to 1993. That is the advice I have received from the ACT Schools Authority. The decision point that will be brought forward to that date is not the second decision point, which is one that has to do with closing facilities or reallocating them. It is the first decision point which would require a school to look at rationalisation of its resources as the numbers in the school come down below a level, which I think might be 400 or 500 pupils. I do not recall the exact number.</PARA>
<PARA> What has been missed in the debate, though, is the time frame. The fact is that the third grammar school will have no immediate effects upon high schools in the Australian Capital Territory and upon high schools in the Belconnen area. It is also worth reminding honourable senators of something of which they would be aware if they thought about it, that is, that a third grammar school would not be just a local school. It would not be a school which would serve just north Canberra or Belconnen. It would not be a school which would serve only the Australian Capital Territory. It would in fact have a regional function as it would be the only Anglican school of its kind within the southern half of New South Wales. It would have a very wide regional function.</PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, and after advice from the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority, from the Schools Commission and from the planning and finance committee, it was my decision that we should proceed to fund the third grammar school to assist it with some of its capital costs. Whether the third grammar school is established, whether it comes into being, a school in the Belconnen region will reach one of those decision points in the mid-1990s. There is no way in which that can be avoided while the present population change and demographic movement goes on. It is wrong if the public debate assumes that that point could be avoided if the school were not created. It could not. If I indicate that the change will be from 1995 to 1993, I hope that puts in a different perspective some of the arguments that have been taking place.</PARA>

I indicated the personal involvement of a senior officer of my Department in his personal capacity as a Rotarian. I have made a check and the advice which I gave the Senate yesterday is correct. The Foundation is expected to be financed by corporate sponsorship. The Department has received no request from the Foundation or any statement to indicate that a request will be made to the Government for support. The Department will not be providing any staff or other assistance to the Foundation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today Senator Robertson asked me a question concerning a Warumungu land claim. I have been able to obtain some more information. The hearing of the Warumungu land claim commenced on Monday, 1 November, at Tennant Creek. Late in the afternoon of Wednesday, 3 November, counsel for the Northern Territory Government informed the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Mr Justice Kearney, that some of the blocks of land claimed had been alienated by the Northern Territory Government. These blocks were leased to the Northern Territory Land Development Corporation. They include parts of a stock route, water reserves and the Devil's Marbles Reserves. Only a relatively small portion of the land claimed is affected by this alienation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The hearing of the claim was adjourned on the following day, 4 November, to 13 December, when legal argument will be presented concerning the consequences for the claim of the alienation of the land. The action was foreshadowed by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Everingham, in answer to a question in the Legislative Assembly on 14 October, when he said that his Government had always taken the view that land set aside for the passage of travelling stock, stock quarantine or any other public purposes should not be able to be alienated except by a deliberate decision of government. He regarded the position taken by the Central Land Council in this claim as 'untenable' ' and had instructed officials to put in train action necessary to ensure that these stock routes can be alienated and must retain their present status'.</PARA>
<PARA> The removal of stock routes and certain areas set aside for public purposes from availability for land claims was, of course, part of the package of amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act which we were discussing earlier this year and which have been the subject of negotiation. These amendments, if they are put into place, of course, would prevent much of the tension and dispute which surround claims such as this one. Finally, it is obvious that the resolution of the jurisdictional questions in this claim is a matter for the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. It is to him that we would look first for a ruling.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nobody disputes that the Australian economy has sunk into its deepest slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s which less than 20 per cent of the present population can actually remember. Moreover, it is sinking deeper into recession at an accelerating rate. For the month of September the unemployment rate was 7.4 per cent. Within this week there is no doubt that it will be higher and there is little doubt that it will rise to above 10 per cent by February of next year. Economic growth is negative. The economy is actually contracting for the first time since 1961. Again, most of the people now resident in Australia were not in Australia in 1961. According to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Government, the Australian economy is the victim of external forces entirely beyond Australian control. That statement contradicts the unequivocal view given by the Prime Minister in 1975 at the ANZAAS conference, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped, it is part of a world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership when if they were men of real stature they would be saying, 'we can overcome'.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Prime Minister was saying in 1975. What he says in 1982 is that the deepest slump since the 1930s is caused by external forces about which Australia and his Government can do nothing. But, more important than another prime ministerial contradiction, it is not true that we can do nothing about it. Firstly, it is not true because the opportunities of the late 1970s were wasted. Australia was already deep in recession by historical standards when the present world slump set in. Secondly, although it is undeniably correct that external forces have some influence on the Australian economy, as they must in any trading nation, we are not helpless victims inexorably following the trail blazed before us by countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Indeed, we have not followed the United Kingdom and the United States. The Thatcher and Reagan administrations have almost doubled the unemployment level. But they have almost halved the inflation rate. Only the Australian Government, only our Prime Minister, has managed during his term of office to double unemployment and also push up inflation. That is the end result of seven years of Fraserism. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Prime Minister took office, the number of unemployed people has risen from less than a quarter of a million to more than half a million and it is going up rapidly. The annual inflation rate was 12.1 per cent when he took office, the most recent annual rate recorded was 12.3 per cent. That is the end product of seven years of rhetoric about fighting inflation first. Inflation has risen. The number of unemployed has more than doubled. Interest rates, after a recent blip, are again at record levels-a fact which is a major contributor to the enormous fall in approvals for dwellings which figures for, for the month of September, released just today, indicate are 30 per cent below what they were 12 months earlier. A major slump in the building industry, as revealed by those approvals, has not yet bitten fully. Growth is negative for the first time in more than 20 years and for only the second time since the 1930s. The economy is actually shrinking. </PARA>
<PARA> Faced with that impending reality in July-anybody at all skilled in reading indicators could see that that was the reality that was looming up; it could be seen in July-the Government produced a Budget bereft of any economic strategy. It was a Budget full of gimmicks and shonky estimates. It was an entirely political document set against a four-month time horizon and the intention of a premature election. Our Prime Minister, given in July an opportunity to display real leadership, chose instead political opportunism as he has always done. The most irresponsible and opportunistic facet of all was probably his continual feeding of speculation about an early election when what the country needed was leadership, stability and some coherent policy to arrest the present decline and turn it backwards. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the gimmicks contained in the 1982 Budget was the proposal to ask the Reserve Bank of Australia to release one per cent of bank liquidity presently held in the statutory reserve deposits for the explicit purpose of lending to stimulate residential building. A majority of the Reserve Bank Board, which, over the years, has been a compliant tool of conservative governments, declined to comply. Whether that non-compliance can be attributed to a new Governor or to Mr Stone paying back the Government for ignoring his advice about the Budget, it happened. The Board refused to comply. For three months the question drifted in limbo. The Bank held its ground and the Government refused to issue the directive to the Bank which section 11 of the Reserve Bank Act explicitly authorises it to do. Meanwhile, the entire money market was destabilised for three months. If, in the considered judgment of the Government, that release was essential to policy and to revival of the building industry, it should have instructed the Bank immediately after the first meeting of the Board declined to comply with the request. Failure to issue that instruction constituted an abdication of responsibility by the Government and by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in particular. This is yet another indictment of that Treasurer who prevaricated for three years over taking action against tax evaders and prevaricated for three months over directing the Bank and still refused to grasp the nettle. He deferred the matter indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be remembered that for three months in 1980 the money market was destabilised for what was roughly the reverse reason. On that occasion the Bank improperly succumbed to Government pressure to bear down on interest rates for purely political purposes-to get all the elections that were held towards the end of 1980 out of the way. The present condition of the Australian economy is not a passing aberration induced by a general world recession. Indeed, Australia , compared with the industrialised countries as a whole, has a seven-year record of failure, particularly in the latter half of the 1970s. From 1976 to 1980 inclusive-these are calendar years because the figures are taken from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development publications which are recorded in calendar years-Australia's unemployment rate averaged 5.7 per cent, which was higher than the unemployment rate for the OECD as a whole at 5.3 per cent. It was more than double, indeed triple, the unemployment rate of Austria, more than double the unemployment rate of Japan and almost double the unemployment rate of West Germany. Our economic growth in that period, despite a relatively high population growth, averaged only 2.6 per cent compared with an OECD average almost one per cent higher, an average in Japan double that of ours , and an average in Austria and West Germany which was 50 per cent higher. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government has taken office, Australia has slipped on the table of per capita income from fourth position to twelfth position, and it is still sinking. In addition, for last year, and this year as well, if present indications continue-there is no reason to believe they will not-we will record a deficit on current account, that is, a deficit on the external account, of $9 billion. Australia's current account has more in common with that of a banana republic like Poland and Mexico than it has with what one ought to expect from a traditionally rich industrialised nation. This Government has had its chance. It has blown that chance. Australia could and should have entered the present slump with an employment rate of around 2 per cent instead of 6 per cent. It should have minimised the deterioration from 2 per cent to something like 3 per cent instead of the 10 per cent or 11 per cent which we will see early next year. Other countries have succeeded in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> That, however, as Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle no doubt will remind us in about 10 minutes time, was in the past. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle has said before: 'What of the future?'. That is a legitimate question. What can be done? Firstly, the Government might try telling the truth. The truth is that there is no complete or immediate remedy for seven years of mismanagement. But an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, in particular of a type that is directed towards stimulating dwelling construction, house building, for reasons that I will explain later, and expenditure directed into other works will do a great deal. It will make a very significant contribution to arresting the present decline and turing it around. Yes, that is Keynesian economics. I know that it is not entirely fashionable to be a Keynesian but I leave the Government with the question: What Australian, given the choice, would reject the Keynesianism of Japan and Austria for the mongrelised monetarism of the United Kingdom, Australia or the United States?</PARA>
<PARA> It is correct that Austria and Japan have something to supplement the traditional Keynesian policies which they have followed throughout the second half of the 1970s and follow still. Traditional Keynesian expansionist remedies for economic recession have been supplemented by effective prices and incomes policies, as indeed have the management policies applied in all of those countries which have had satisfactory, indeed, under the circumstances, brilliant economic records throughout the second half of the 1970s. In all of those countries where inflation has been low, growth rates have been high, unemployment has been low and interest rates have been held at moderate levels, countries such as Japan, Austria, West Germany, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries, the common denominator is a prices and incomes policy. The empirical evidence flatly disputes the assertion that Keynesian remedies do not work providing the Keynesian remedies are supplemented by an effective prices and incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, Federal governments have almost no coercive powers in the area of prices and incomes control. It is, therefore, essential that the government which attempts to implement such a policy has a great deal of moral authority, the commodity of which this Government is deservedly bereft. If the Government wanted to establish any moral authority-I suspect it is too late to do that-it should try feeding the truth to the public instead of the tricks and gimmicks which it has fed the public for seven years and with which the public was deluged in the last Budget. For these reasons-the tricks, the gimmickry and the shonky Budget-this Government has no moral authority. It has no moral authority for a number of other reasons, including the sequence of ministerial scandals and shifting prime ministerial standards which we have seen over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister believes in nothing. He judges everything by ephemeral political convenience. All value judgments, and indeed truth itself, is to this Prime Minister, a matter of ephemeral political convenience. The Government has no moral authority because for five years it presided with a full knowledge of massive tax evasion. It responded belatedly and partially with retrospective legislation to recover part of the tax which had been evaded. That legisation has now been watered down in two very significant ways: Firstly, by giving the people who the Prime Minister identified as recipients of stolen money 12 months to pay it back and, secondly, by inserting into the original Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill new clause 3 (12), which exempts a whole class of vendor shareholders from the obligation to repay what the Prime Minister had said was stolen money. It is no coincidence that among the companies exempted by that clause is Tremog Ltd which was 60 per cent owned by Denis Horgan, the chairman of the finance committee of the Western Australian Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has no moral authority because the Prime Minister allows the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) to retain a 4 3/4 per cent government housing loan, which the Deputy Prime Minister granted himself 18 years ago, 82 per cent of which has not been repaid. Any Prime Minister who allows to continue a situation in which his deputy has a 4 3/4 per cent government loan when everybody else buying a house is paying between 13 per cent and 16 per cent cannot expect to have any moral authority. This Government has appropriated, in the Bills now before the Senate, $1.5m-hidden in the Treasury estimates-for a Liberal Party election slush fund for political advertising in respect of an election campaign which the Government had planned to conduct later this month and early next month. It has given us a Budget full of gimmicks and tricks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; It was perhaps a little varied and not quite up to date, in view of some of the things that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has said recently. But if we are to discuss the present economic situation of this country let me state the other side of the story and some other facts which ought to be given. The Government recognises the downturn in the economy. A number of factors need to be taken into account when we look at the results that are self-evident in the economy. Economic activity overseas has been weak over a prolonged period. It was inevitable that this would have a significant impact on Australia. We were able to avoid the main effects of that economic downturn for a very much longer period than were most comparable countries. But the prolonged weakness in overseas demand, the softening of energy markets and high interest rates have had an impact which cannot now be avoided by Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic difficulty on the domestic side of our economy has been an excessive growth in wages which has been well in excess of price increases. Unless that is recognised, we cannot even start to talk about the Australian economy. Over the 12 months to the June quarter the average weekly earnings of male employees increased by 16.4 per cent, whereas the consumer price index increase was 10.7 per cent, and 12.3 per cent over the year to the September quarter. I do not think anyone disputes those figures. If male wages increase by 16.4 per cent as against 10.7 per cent for the same period-or 12.3 per cent for the year to the September quarter-one realises that that wage overhang must have a serious effect on employment prospects. The prime need is to correct the excessive wage levels that have been developed, in order to restore employment and to protect the employment that presently exists. </PARA>
<PARA> The policies of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Opposition, which are based on the maintenance of real wages, are a recipe for continuing deterioration of the economy and worsening unemployment. It ill becomes the Opposition to propose matters of public importance without addressing itself to the central points that need to be accepted. The Government is doing what it can to urge and encourage wage restraint in every forum in which it can do so. In the Budget that is at present before the Senate many indications are given of the Government's concern to encourage wage restraint. Assistance, in a number of ways, has been provided to enable the family situation to be improved and encourage the wage restraint that is so essential. </PARA>
<PARA> Economic recovery depends on overcoming inflation and establishing a domestic economic environment conducive to growth which will enable us to take advantage of an overseas recovery when it occurs. This requires steady, not stop and go, policies, not some of the extravagances that have been outlined from time to time. Perhaps a little later I can refer to those mentioned by Senator Walsh. The honourable senator mentioned some unemployment statistics and compared Australia with some overseas countries. But if we are to look at the present situation we should compare Australia's figures with those for the latest months in a number of countries. We should compare Australia's rate of 7.4 per cent unemployment for September with the 10.4 per cent figure of the United States for October; with 2.3 per cent in Japan for August-the latest figure that I have -with 8.2 per cent in West Germany for September; with 9.1 per cent in France for August; with 12.8 per cent in the United Kingdom for October; with 8.7 per cent in Italy for July; and with 12.2 per cent in Canada for September. Those figures are the most recent that are available. We should compare Australia's rate of 7.4 per cent with a rate of 10.4 per cent in the United States, 12.8 per cent in the United Kingdom and 12.2 per cent in Canada. In other countries, with the exception of Japan, the figures range between 8 per cent and 9 per cent. That is the comparison that we ought to have in front of us-not selective figures for Poland, Austria and other countries with which we would not seek to compare our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal cause of unemployment in Australia-I do not hear this freely acknowledged-continues to be increases in real wages and labour costs which have been in excess of labour productivity growth and the domestic inflation rate, which is well in excess of inflation rates abroad, leading to losses in international competitiveness. We have had a slump in profitability and, as I said earlier, the prolonged international recession. The Government's policies for combating unemployment, particularly those incorporated in the present Budget, ought to be recognised. The only basis for a sustained recovery in employment lies in the adoption of consistent policies aimed at winding down inflation, correcting the imbalance that has emerged between excessive real wages and reduced business profitability, and providing the scope for a sustained expansion of the private sector of the economy. Policies to this end include the maintenance of monetary policy aimed at bearing down on inflationary expectations and the conduct of an exchange rate policy with a view to resisting inflationary pressures, subject to the need to maintain a satisfactory external balance. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to be looking to give support for a decentralised and deregulated wage fixation system which allows scope for wage entitlements to be more directly related to the economic circumstances of particular industries. To ignore that is to ignore the peril that lies ahead of those who presently have employment and to ignore the difficulties of those who are seeking employment. There must be continued emphasis on manpower and training policies aimed at improving the flexibility of those people who are seeking employment to have the widest range of employment opportunities ahead of them. I do not know why we have to continue to debate this matter. We have said from so many different points of view that there was a marked turn round in the Australian economy in 1981-82 with growth in the second half of the year substantially slower than in the first. For anyone to suggest that that has not been acknowledged or stated is to ignore the many occasions on which that has been officially stated. </PARA>
<PARA> The preliminary estimates of our national income and expenditure show that real gross domestic product grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.7 per cent in the second half of 1981-82, following growth of 3.7 per cent in the first half year. Real non-farm GDP grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.2 per cent in the second half of 1981-82, following growth of 2 per cent in the first half year. The preliminary national accounts estimates for the June quarter, which should not be given undue weight, suggest a strengthening in growth, with non-farm GDP estimated to have grown by 0.9 per cent in the quarter . On the other hand, labour market indicators have shown continuing weakness. In the September quarter employment was 0.3 per cent below that in the September quarter of 1981. Since June total employment, however, has remained generally stable. The figures I have just cited have been given officially in Government papers. To suggest that there is no revelation by the Government of the state of the economy seems to me to be somewhat absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> For the period immediately ahead, the prolonged weakness in activity abroad, together with continuing low profitability and a relatively high rate of inflation at home, will constrain economic policy options and impose limits on the pace of domestic economic recovery. The key to lower inflation, improved international competitiveness, enhanced confidence and higher business profitability lies in the achievement of a much lower rate of increase in labour costs than has occurred in recent years. Until a much greater degree of wage restraint is achieved, high inflation, low economic growth and high unemployment are inevitable. I think, as was said by one of my colleagues today, that that sort of situation is not something that can be addressed by government alone. It is a matter of employers, employees, unions and governments recognising these difficulties in our economy and working together to overcome them and achieve much greater employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Wage increases have played a major part in the downturn. Real wage levels remain much too high for any prospects of recovery, but there are various indications of a greater awareness by employers, employees and unions of the damaging effects of excessive wage increases and a willingness to accept lower wage outcomes in order to help maintain employment. Here again, one would like to hear more on this matter from the trade unions. I think individual employees and employers recognise that they need to have a greater awareness of wage restraint. One would like to have some leadership on that approach. The abandonment of wage indexation and the adoption of a more decentralised bargaining approach should facilitate more realistic wage outcomes in the future . We all hope that that will be so. There was some mention of our overseas balances. Foreign capital inflow contributed to an overall balance of payments surplus of $376m in the September quarter of 1982. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I inform Senator Walsh that that was the first surplus in a September quarter since 1972. Private capital inflow in the September quarter of 1982 was $2,069m, double that recorded in the September quarter of 1981. This indicates continued overseas investors' confidence in the Australian economy. Official reserve assets at the end of September 1982 stood at $8,396m compared with $4,495m at the end of September 1981. Again, those are statistics which should not be ignored. The climate in which the 1982-83 Budget was framed was one of international recession. That is still the position. Export markets have shrunk. The high interest rates are hurting many Australians and are causing a number of projects to be shelved. Our economic growth has faltered. These statements were made at the time the Budget was introduced in August. The difficulties are inherited from a number of sources, but some of the factors are local ones. For the year 1981-82 the rate of inflation of 10.7 per cent was almost 2 per cent above the figure for 1980-81 and some 4 per cent above the average of our major Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development trading partners. As I have said, wage increases in excess of productivity gains caused Australian industries to be less competitive. In 1981- 82 average weekly earnings rose by about 14 per cent. That is against the figure I cited earlier for the adult male wage increase.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is a serious drought and one that is causing enormous hardship throughout rural Australia. There is little prospect of rapid world economic recovery. It is unrealistic to expect that there will be a major recovery in the Australian economy in the very near future . The Government, in framing the Budget, endeavoured to balance two major considerations: Firstly, the recognition that present economic conditions are causing hardship to many Australians and, secondly, the need to maintain an economic strategy which is responsible and which effectively addresses those economic developments which have contributed to our present situation. The Government has aimed to provide relief, assistance and incentive within the confines of a responsible economic policy. While this will result in an increase in the size of the overall Budget deficit this year compared with last year, the Government is confident that that deficit can be financed in a non-inflationary manner. </PARA>
<PARA> Principal features of the Budget have had a great deal of discussion, but in some cases still need some explanation. I do not think there is much need now for an explanation of the personal tax relief and the other assistance that was specifically designed to give maximum help to Australian families, especially those on lower and middle incomes. The tax relief was provided on the basis that there would be wage restraint. It is understood that with the tax cuts in the Budget wage restraint can be exercised. Families will now have more in their pay packets and it is hoped that wage restraint will result. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget also provided interest relief for people who are paying off their homes. There was a shift in the Budget towards capital works expenditure, including a special roads program which will have beneficial economic consequences throughout Australia. The Budget also provided industry assistance initiatives, announced in July, which are aimed at making Australian industry as competitive as possible, particularly export oriented industries. </PARA>
<PARA> There was increased assistance in the Budget for pensioners. There was the introduction of a new family income supplement to help certain low income families. There was an increase in job training opportunities and other help for unemployed people. The Budget provided for some increase in indirect taxation and a modest broadening of the indirect tax base. Those measures represented very conscious decisions by the Government at the time of framing the Budget, recognising the economic circumstances of 1982-83. The reductions in personal income tax do not need to be stated in detail because most people are already enjoying the effect of those in their weekly pay packets. Senator Walsh mentioned the statutory reserve deposit release which was mentioned in the Budget and on which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) made an announcement last night. The Treasurer commented:</PARA>
<PARA> Since the time of the Budget housing finance through traditional lending sources has continued to become more readily available. This has been due in part to some improvement in the deposit taking experience of home lenders, particularly the savings banks. In fact, there are some indications that there may not be sufficient eligible applicants to meet the lending targets of some banks implicit in the commitment given to the Government last March that there would be an increase of $400m in the money to be made available for housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the time of the Budget there has been a significant increase in liquidity in the banking system. </PARA>
<PARA> The September quarter of 1982 has seen a significant surplus of private sector foreign exchange transactions, largely due to heavy buying of Australian securities by Japanese institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances-</PARA>
<PARA>The circumstances of liquidity in the economy at present-</PARA>
<PARA>the Government has decided to defer for the time being its request to the Reserve Bank to effect an SRD release of 1 per cent or some $300m. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer commented that he had discussed this matter with the Reserve Bank and with the trading banks, and had a commitment from the trading banks that subject to a sufficient deposit intake and a sufficient number of eligible applicants, they would wish to increase the figure for the year commencing in March 1983 to $500m. That is in contrast with the additional $400m which they are lending in the 12-month period to March 1983. The Government will monitor the situation and if demand does increase and more money for housing is required over and above that now to become available the Government will not hesitate to proceed with the request to the Reserve Bank contained in the Budget Speech. Those are the facts. The position is not as was stated by Senator Walsh. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh mentioned that the Opposition would have an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, expenditure on other works and a prices and incomes policy. The statements that have been made by the Opposition with regard to how it would approach economic management contain nothing but a series of reckless, irresponsible and deceptive proposals, designed mainly to appease its power base , the leadership of the trade union movement, and other bodies to which it feels it ought to be making some statements or arrangements. I go back to the national conference of the Australian Labor Party in July 1982. It is timely to recall what Mr Ferguson, the Deputy Premier in the New South Wales Labor Government, said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Friends, if and when we get a Labor Government, if we adopt some of the policies that have been espoused here and are in our Platform, international capitalism will take away our AAA ruling anyhow and if we are in a position where we have got to worry and please internationalism to retain our AAA rating, then we do not deserve to be in Government.'</PARA>
<PARA>Some of the alternative policies put forward by the Leader of the Opposition give concern to the Government just as all those financial comments that were made following the alternative 1982 Budget of Mr Hayden and the bag of tricks that he also announced on 26 October were cause for concern. The Australian Financial Review stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This leaves the Labor Party with a fiscal program which promises nothing but unemployment and inflation on a larger scale than we have now, and the prospect of further involuntary devaluations of the Australian dollar as we are locked into a devaluation/inflation spiral. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is the bag of tricks that came through from Mr Hayden in October, it is probably time that Senator Walsh stopped bringing forward these proposals and looked at what the reaction to the policies of the Opposition as a whole has been. He should discontinue bringing into the Senate matters on which he undertakes these tirades. He does it only so he can have a forum in which he can engage in the personal abuse which he seems unable to resist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; For the benefit of those who are listening to this debate, the Senate is discussing a matter of public importance introduced by Senator Walsh, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's failure to prevent, or reverse, the catastrophic drift into economic depression. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the claims made by the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), there are signs that the Australian economy is in the worst condition it has been in since the Depression. I noticed that the Minister seemed to blame the unions for all the troubles that we have in Australia. In fact, she said that the unions and the workers were to blame because they had pursued a policy of high wage claims. I do not buy the argument of the Minister but even if one does buy that argument one should remember that the unions must act in this way. They must try to obtain justice for themselves and to maintain their level of real wages because this Government, the government blaming them, is the government that abolished the Prices Justification Tribunal. If we do not have a Prices Justification Tribunal, there is every reason for the unions to try to get what they deserve. It is not up to the unions to take the lead when a government abolishes a tribunal such as the Prices Justification Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that there are signs that the economy is now the worst that it has been since the Depression. Like most honourable senators I did not experience the Depression but I can remember well that my father, who was a building worker, did. He told me many stories of the troubles that he and his fellow workers had during those times. When he was telling me those stories he did not think that I would have to live through a similar situation in Australia . Unfortunately, it looks as though we are now heading along that road towards a depression. That road is being plotted and charted by this Government through its inaction to do anything about the economic direction in which we are heading . No longer can many families be certain that they can continue to pay their mortages. Their interest rates are far too high for the wages being brought in, in the cases where people have jobs. Their mortgages are not like the mortgage mentioned by Senator Walsh a little while ago. I refer to the mortgage of Mr Anthony. His housing interest rate was set at 4 3/4 per cent. He has a government home loan with an interest rate of 4 3/4 per cent, to be repaid over 45 years. How would the people who are having trouble paying their mortgage like to have an interest rate like that? It is despicable that one of the Ministers in this Government has such an interest rate over such a long period for a housing loan when families in Australia cannot afford their mortgages because the interest rates are too high, they are out of work or both. </PARA>
<PARA> No longer can families be sure that their sons and daughters will be able to join the work force when they leave school. Too many students are going through school for 10 or 12 years with the ambition of getting out into the work force but are finding out that when they leave school there are no jobs for them. How sick must they think society is when it treats them like that. What does the Government do in the meantime? What it does-it stated that it would do this-is to maintain its present course. It continues its policy of blaming unions. It continues its policy of fighting inflation first, and it cannot even do that with any degree of success. The policies that it says it will pursue are the very policies that have taken Australia into the mire. Why continue with them when they have brought Australia into the situation it is in at the moment? Why does it not admit defeat? Why does it not admit that it has made a mistake, change direction and reverse the decline that it has caused to the Australian economy?</PARA>
<PARA> This decline in the economy has manifested itself in a number of ways. One of the ways that we can clearly see is the number of unemployed in society. A little over 12 months ago, in September 1981, 391,100 people were unemployed in Australia. That figure of 391,100 was far too high but in 12 months from September 1981 to September 1982 this figure increased massively by 29 per cent. Last month we were told that there were over half a million people unemployed in Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics stated that 504,800 people were unemployed. In fact there was a 10 per cent increase in the month from August 1982 to September 1982. In other words, unemployment is increasing rapidly in Australia. I understand that the October figures are to be released tomorrow. I am fearful of what those figures will show. Perhaps that is the reason for the Government deciding that the House of Representatives should rise tonight for the summer recess. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the September figures, 7.4 per cent of our work force is now unemployed, but no action is taken by this Government, a government which in 1975 pledged that it would provide jobs for all who wanted to work. It is worth mentioning also that the work force is decreasing. In other words, the number of people actually unemployed is probably not the true indication of the number of people in Australia who would like to work if they were given the opportunity. Of the total population looking for work, the participation rate in September 1981 was 61.7 per cent. In other words, 61.7 per cent of the population wanted to be in the work force. By September this year that figure had decreased to 61 per cent. So we have not only an increasing number of unemployed but also a decreasing percentage of our population looking for work. Many people have opted out of the work force. They realise that the possibilities for work are so slight that they might as well not continue looking. </PARA>
<PARA> The decline in the economy for the whole of Australia that I mentioned is also apparent in the State that I represent in this chamber, and it is probably even more marked there. In September 1981-just over 12 months ago-55,300 people were unemployed in Queensland. In September this year that number had increased to 74 ,600. These figures probably do not mean much at first blush but if one realises that there has been a 35 per cent increase in the number of unemployed in Queensland, it gives an indication of the decline in that State. The participation rate in Queensland is falling as well. Over the same period it fell from 59.9 per cent to 59.6 per cent, so people are also opting out of the work force in Queensland. It is not difficult to understand these unemployment figures if one reads the daily newspapers. They contain articles which bear the sorry tale of business in ruin. I will give a few examples. An article appeared in the Courier-Mail 13 of August 1982 headed 'Truck builders close doors'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The bad news on the corporate front continued yesterday with the announcement that the White Motor Corporation (Australia) Pty Ltd manufacturing plant at Coopers Plains, Brisbane, had closed 'until further notice'. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to state that this meant that only 70 employees would remain out of 280. The Age of 24 August 1982 contained an article headed 'Hartley Computer to be sold next week'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Next week, after a four-month struggle to clear its debts, one of Australia's biggest computer manufacturers, Hartley Computer, Brisbane, is to be sold by tender. </PARA>
<PARA>The Hobart Mercury of 28 August contained an article headed 'Builder forced to liquidate'. It told the story of a builder in Hobart who went into liquidation after creditors met the previous day. The Australian Financial Review of 31 August contained an article headed 'ANZ Bank, Citicorp call in the receivers at Protean'. It stated that Protean (Holdings) Ltd was having difficulties which caused the banks to call in the receivers. The Adelaide Advertiser of September contained an article headed 'Coin dealer goes into liquidation', it related a story about an Adelaide coin dealer who had gone into liquidation owing $200,000 . </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on but I would like to mention one case which was mentioned by the previous speaker, the Minister for Finance. A heading in the Australian of 2 October 1982 states 'Drought forces $235m company into receivership'. It contains a story about International Harvester Australia Ltd. Certainly, the drought is creating some of our problems. Certainly, there are a number of problems within Australia's business sector. The point I would like to make, which Senator Walsh made when he introduced this matter of public importance, is that very little, if anything, is being done to remedy the situation in which Australia finds itself. Naturally, as firms go into liquidation or receivership, as I have just outlined, jobs are lost. Again, we can go through the newspapers and find time after time stories about how jobs are being lost not in twenties or thirties but in hundreds. Obviously, we are facing a calamitous position in Australia and action must be taken by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> On 16 September the Government announced that over $350m would be made available for drought aid throughout Australia. The drought in eastern Australia is certainly a national disaster and some aid must go to this sector, but so too is the employment situation a national disaster. So too is there a massive decline in the viability of business. Therefore, if the Government can provide funds for drought relief, why does it not also provide some funds for unemployment relief? It must do this because we will be soon faced with school leavers who will want to join the work force. I mentioned earlier that school leavers go through school full of enthusiasm with the prospect of entering the work force but, unfortunately, many of them now facing that prospect will not find jobs. Shortly, 200,000 school leavers will attempt to join the job market in Australia. Without some increased government assistance many of these young people will become disillusioned with society. In my State of Queensland an additional 30,000 school leavers will soon be looking for work. The unacceptable level of unemployment in Australia is costing us dearly. It is costing us dearly in lost production, in assistance for those who are thrown out of work, however meagre some of that assistance may be, and in the social disruption that it is causing to those who are out of work and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> Before concluding I make the point that one of the actions of this Governmet after it came into power was to stop the collection of local unemployment statistics. Many of us know that statistics used to show unemployment in regional areas in Australia, but no longer are these available and no longer are we able to pinpoint areas of exceptionally low or high unemployment so that we can plan accordingly. Statistics should once again be collected on a local basis . Recently I heard someone say that when the person over the road is out of work we have a recession but when oneself is out of work it is a depression. The way our unemployment statistics are increasing at present we are clearly headed for a depression. It is up to this Government to do something other than to maintain its present course, which has put Australia into this situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all acknowledge that the world today is indeed facing a difficult economic situation but I do not think the debate on the Australian economy is enchanced at all when an Opposition speaker refers to our Government plotting and charting the road to depression. I wish to examine the three basic reasons which have given rise to this economic downturn in Australia. There are international implications in the Australian recession. So far as Australia is concerned, the remarkable thing is that it took this country so long to move into the unfortunate state that we now temporarily face. A second factor is the widespread drought throughout Australia. The third factor is internal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To imply a lack of government action in the subject of this discussion is the height of stupidity. One has only to look at the pre-Budget implementation measures, those in the Budget and finally, measures taken since the Budget. We have to recognise the seriousness of the international difficulties. Australian producers have been faced with declining prices for most agricultural produce and minerals. Australia relies very heavily on products from mining and agriculture to meet its balance of payments commitments. One of the difficulties which Australia has to face is a deficit of about $9 billion on current account. A further inflationary factor is that there has been an effective devaluation, which, between August 1981 and October 1982, amounted to about 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the international problems affect Australia in a major way. The downturn in the international economy has seriously affected our export trade in commodities. I give one outstanding example-the coal industry. The stabilisation in world prices for oil in real terms, which were effectively falling, had a restraining effect on certain decisions of other countries in relation to the importation of Australian coal. I mentioned earlier that it took Australia a fair while to reach our present economic state. This is highlighted by statistics from the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which indicate that from 1978 to the end of last year the real rate of economic growth in Australia, as reflected in total production, gross domestic product and so on , was twice that of the average of the OECD countries. They are some further international problems that we have to face-for instance, problems with balance of payments, having high interest rates to attract capital inflow to meet the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> The severity of drought is realised, when we recognise that 90 per cent of New South Wales farms, 60 per cent of farms in Victoria and 40 per cent of farms in Queensland have been affected by drought. This severity of the effect of the drought has a major effect on the economic condition of our nation. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics estimates that there will be a drop of well over $1, 500m in the net value of rural production this year unless there is a break in the drought almost immediately. But the Opposition's criticism has been that our Government has done nothing about help. Our Government has introduced a massive fodder subsidy costing up to $320m. The fodder subsidy operates in respect of fodder purchased from 1 September 1982 at the rate of 80 cents per sheep per month and $8 per head of cattle per month. When it is recognised that about 14 million cattle and 93 million sheep are involved one gets some idea of the scope of the problem of this Government's generosity and its concern for the people affected by drought. It is nonsense to imply that this Government has done absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition senators interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addition there is also a substantial interest subsidy on eligible debt which covers both eligible new and existing debt. The farmer pays the first 12 per cent and the Commonwealth picks up the excess. It is wrong to say that we have not taken measures aimed at stimulating consumption-type expenditure. We have aimed to put money in the pockets of individuals. Look at some of the Budget measures. The tax-free threshhold was increased by $400. The standard rate of tax was reduced from 32 per cent to 30 per cent. The level at which the 46 per cent tax rate applies was increased from $17,894 to $19,500. Pensioner benefits were raised and there was a whole host of measures affecting disadvantaged individuals and sole parents and the unemployed. So we do have a social conscience. That refutes the interjection a while ago about what we are doing for ordinary people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to our attitude towards imports, it is fashionable to criticise our tariff policy, but that policy is one of the most open in the world. Because it is so open, many people tend to criticise it. However, perhaps it is opportune, at a time of some economic downturn, to give consideration to reintroducing Australian preference. The Government should consider reintroducing the former Australian government preference to assist Australian manufacturing industry. One of the unfortunate victims of the downturn has been manufacturing in Australia. The re-establishment of Australian preference would be a good way to help to make Australian industry competitive. In the event of some industries being forced to close, we have to recognise that additional costs would be incurred in the form of unemployment benefits, which are not real stimulants to the economy as is manufacturing. If measures such as the restoration of preference could be taken, we may save a number of industries and prevent lay- offs. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian industry is facing a number of hidden costs. Perhaps this is the time to evaluate some of its problems. The payroll tax involves a cost of one job in 20 of the work force. Is this appropriate? I address these remarks to State governments as well, because they have a responsibility in this payroll tax area. I sometimes believe that employers are asked to contribute far too much by way of the scope of workers compensation liabilities. Many of the costs and problems that have been encompassed within the workers compensation parameters should be more directly attributable to social welfare rather than as a direct cost to the manufacturing sector. Maybe this is the time for a review. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people in our society are saying that because of the severity of youth unemployment, new measures may have to be taken. It was not the Government's fault that the unions pushed for such very high starting rates for juniors, young boys and girls just leaving school. It is a tragedy that junior rates have been forced up to such an extent that, effectively, it pays employers to employ married women who have experience. We all know the high costs of employing young people-some costs are incurred through their inexperience. This is one of the tragedies of our time. Someone must be bold enough to say that we have to have a realistic approach to youth unemployment, because if these young people cannot get a job within two or three years of leaving school, their chances of ever entering the work force in this competitive climate will be difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other people have been suggesting that to help the young unemployed we should, perhaps, introduce some form of national service along the lines of that which has been applied in Switzerland, where the emphasis has been on service to the community. Perhaps this can be investigated at an appropriate level in Australia. Some of the best brains in this country could be directed to educating people in socially desirable work-type projects. This would enhance the ability of people to get jobs and it would benefit the community. One of the big problems in the world today is that the manufacturing capacity exceeds demand for manufactured products. Increasingly, multinational companies have tended to go into low-cost countries and produce for a world market. In such circumstances the goods are sent to developed countries, such as Australia, effectively at dumped prices. I believe we should be looking at this matter of imports. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the tragedies of our time is that the Third World has failed to develop according to the expectations of the 1970s. The debt structure of the Third World is giving rise to many problems experienced around the world at present. We see the possibility of major banking institutions failing and countries reneging on their debt obligations. We have failed on an international basis to raise the standards of living sufficiently within Third World countries so that they can utilise the goods and services which the world can offer. I think politicians have to set an example of restraints, then we can ask people on wages standards of living to forgo penalty rates for, say, working on Saturdays, overtime and that sort of thing so that a greater number of people can enter the work force. But we, as parliamentarians, should offer something. There is wide criticism in the community about the generosity, for example, pension scheme for parliamentarians. Perhaps we should further examine that area. We have spoken at great length in this chamber about tax rip-offs and overpayments to certain sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> One of Australia's major problems is that wage costs are exceeding productivity gains. Until that relationship is put in proper perspective we will experience problems. For example, the average weekly earnings for male employees increased by 16.4 per cent whereas the consumer price index increased by 10.7 per cent over the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us now look at the good news. The fortnightly bulletin issued by the management consultants W. D. Scott and Co. Pty Ltd, points out that W. D. Scott believed that price inflation had peaked. The good news was that it believed that the statistical ballooning in the inflation rate for the September quarter would be removed by December. It believed that the recession had materially eased wage pressures and forced absorption of cost increases across a wide spectrum of business and that many industries had been able to pass on some of those increases. It said that international export and import prices were rising very slowly compared with the domestic price levels. That is good news for Australia. It said also that excess of stocks, predominantly of imported finished goods, were being actively liquidated with price concessions. It stated also that consumer expectations probably had swung towards inflation reduction. After analysing all those factors its conclusion was that by the end of 1983 the Australian inflation rate could be down to 8 per cent. It believes that this would improve our international competitiveness and would be the start of a sustained period of inflation reduction. I believe that this would be long term good news for our Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I normally listen to Senator Watson with some anticipation and interest because he seems to be one of the few Government senators opposite who have some sensitivity to the problems of the manufacturing industry. He disappointed me greatly in the remarks he made. He seemed to be much more concerned about sheep and the Government's efforts in the agricultural area than worrying about the Government doing something to alleviate the problems of the unemployed workers of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are debating 'the Government's failure to prevent, or reverse, the catastrophic drift into economic depression'. The Australian Democrats believe that Australia's manufacturing industry is at crisis point. Thousands of workers have had to accept a four-day working week. Thousands more will probably soon be faced with the alternatives of a four-day week or losing their jobs. Over the next three months we face the Christmas parliamentary recess. The Government will not be able to do anything to alleviate this critical problem until the Parliament resumes some time in February. We believe that some action has to be taken now before the Christmas period. The market is dead at a time when it should be picking up for the normal Christmas shopping spree. </PARA>
<PARA> After very careful consideration the Australian Democrats are advocating a short, sharp shock to the economy to halt the slide into depression and to help to overcome the very worrying trade deficit. The overseas deficit on current account last year was $9.1 billion. Australia will face international insolvency within a few years unless we face up to this very critical problem. Therefore, the Australian Democrats are advocating import restrictions as the only initiative now open to the Government-import restrictions in the form of import quotas. We say that they have to be introduced with urgency. In many cases imported goods can be replaced by products from efficient local manufacturers. It is reasonable that industries which are competitive with imports should be protected. We believe that industries in which productivity can be improved by the introduction of high technology should be temporarily protected from import competition. Such a policy should be seen only as a temporary measure. It should not be imposed for longer than three years. We are suggesting this initiative to give industry a breathing space in which to restructure and so allow time for new industries to provide sufficient job opportunities for full employment. As I said, the Australian Democrats do not advocate this measure lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> For the last 18 months the Australian Democrats have been imploring the Government to change direction. We have pointed to the need for a modest and selective stimulation of the economy. We have suggested that the Government should get industry representatives together to try to work out a few long term objectives and to make clear to industry the sorts of enterprises that the Government wishes to encourage in this country. We have said that there is need for some long term indicative planning. The Government has to make choices. We cannot have everything. If we choose more of this we have to choose less of that . </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats have advocated that the Government has to stop tightening the economic screws. We have pointed out that billions of dollars are being lost in potential output and that living standards are falling dramatically. Over the last three years the Government has adopted an economic policy which has been remarkably consistent. It has been a policy of creating domestic surpluses and paying scant regard to a critical deficit in our balance of payments on current account. We have heard a lot recently about the Government's new Budget. The facts of the matter are that despite the much heralded tax cuts, taxes, expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, are still up. Because of the Government's stubborn refusal to change direction, the economy is now in a tailspin. The time has come for the Government to abandon the thought of bailing out in the form of a snap election, to get back on to the flight deck and do something about the situation. If it does not, I believe we will face this catastrophe before the new year is far gone. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are advocating import quotas on those imports that can be replaced by efficient local industry as an emergency measure. We are not a free trade party. We are not a protectionist party. We certainly do not believe that inefficient industry should be protected behind tariff barriers. As a party , we can go along with the last Industries Assistance Commission report which pointed to very large discrepancies between the levels of protection for our industries, some in excess of 60 per cent. On the other hand we have the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd with tariff protection levels of only 5 per cent. This large disparity is unnecessary, it is unfair, and we are all for the Government, through the IAC, addressing the problem. But we cannot expect to implement a more rational approach to protection while we have these levels of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines, the Democrat senator from South Australia, has been pointing out repeatedly, particularly over the last six months, the critical problem facing manufacturing industries in South Australia. Now, of course, it is becoming very obvious that unless the Government acts now the whitegoods industry and the car industry in South Australia face a catastrophe. In essence, we are saying that the time has come for a major new initiative by the Government. The present economic situation is due to the fact that the economic initiatives which could have been adopted over the last three years have not been adopted. The approach has been remarkably consistent, one of tight money, tightening the economic screws, a disregard for unemployment until we now have to look for emergency measures. </PARA>

The law of the land is that before government can act it has to consider a reference from either the IAC or the TAA. Therefore, it is critically important that reference be given to either of these authorities. We suggest that the reference go to the Temporary Assistance Authority because it would probably have a lighter work load and could come up with a report more quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would depend on the urgency with which the Government addresses the problem. That is entirely in the hands of the Government. Both the IAC and the TAA report to the Government. They are both instrumentalities of the Government and the Government can ask for a quick report, I would imagine, if it were called for in an emergency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The critical and appalling problem of youth unemployment has been raised. In the few minutes left to me I also want to draw the Senate's attention to this problem. The youth unemployment problem has to be solved now, not in six months or 12 months time. We have to do something about it immediately. Young people are looking for work. They are applying for jobs up to 40 times and they are being knocked back up to 40 times. We cannot expect that sort of situation to continue without it damaging permanently their outlook and their personalities. We have one of the highest youth unemployment rates in the Western world. What can be done about it? The Government could ask industry and union representatives to get together to make one work station per enterprise available, to be worked on a roster basis to give young people an opportunity at least to get some experience in the work place on a permanent basis, while they look around for permanent work or while they seek to continue their part time studies. This is one practical approach to youth unemployment that does work. I have seen cases in which young people have worked on a two hour a day roster basis over a considerable period. They have kept to the roster times very carefully and it has not been any great hardship to an organisation to make one work place available on this basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I make this last point. Debate has raged in this country between free traders and protectionists. It has been a very interesting debate. For many people it has been an armchair debate. The time has passed when we can debate this matter any longer for the simple reason that last year we had a $9.1 billion deficit on current account. We are spending money with gay abandon. If we continue to do that, we will go broke. The sheer economic facts of the matter are that we cannot afford any longer to spend $9.1 billion a year on imports. Certainly we cannot afford to spend that sort of money this year when the Government knows that its export revenue, particularly from primary production, will fall dramatically; when it knows that its export contracts for coal and iron ore to Japan have been cut dramatically; when it knows that its revenue will fall dramatically. We must do something about our level of spending. That is an economic fact of life. It is as clear as a family saying: 'Well, we have some money to spend today but we do not care what happens tomorrow'. That is exactly the position the Government is in in relation to its external deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is a lot of confusion when we talk about deficits. We should make it clear whether we are talking about an external deficit or surplus or an internal domestic deficit or surplus. They are really two quite separate things. I am pointing now to the external deficit and saying that we do not have the money to pay for the level of imports; so that sooner or later we have to do something about it. How much better to sit down and plan the strategy now and make reference to the IAC or the TAA on the basis that we have to reduce our level of imports. Then we can solve two problems at once. We can solve our critical unemployment problem and we can solve our critical balance of payments problem on current account. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to Senator Siddons with some interest. I have noted his suggestion that on the one hand the Government is spending too much money at present, and on the other hand that it is necessary for the Government to assist manufacturing industry to get out of its problems. That is fair enough. The Government recognises the need to assist manufacturing industry. There are many ways in which that can be done. I have said for a long time that manufacturing industry should have been encouraged over the years to increase its productivity through improved technology. I certainly think that we have spent billions of dollars in the past on artificially supporting industry over many years. Perhaps we are now paying the price for that. We may well have been better advised over the years to have encouraged industry, through tax incentives and research and development programs, to help itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not to deny there is a problem at present within that sector of our economy. Certainly the Government is looking at imports. That is the commonsense thing to do in this situation. I noticed that Senator Watson, despite what Senator Siddons said, was talking about Australian preference in manufacturing industry. He demonstrated his interest in that area also. It is about time that we all realised that Australia is under the influence of an international recession. It is probably the worst world-wide economic downturn since the Depression years. That is quite clear. We recognise that. Every government in the world, irrespective of its type, is experiencing the same difficulties. Everyone, except, apparently the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, recognises that we are under the influence of a world-wide depression . In the Treasury publication Round Up of Economic Statistics for October 1982 it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Economic activity in the major industrialised economies remains depressed. The major seven OECD countries have been in recession since the first half of 1980 making it the longest recession in the post-war period. In contrast, the international recession following the 1973-74 oil price rises was of less than two years duration although it was considerably deeper than the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Labor Party seeks to criticise this Government in its efforts to come to terms with the international recession we need only to recall the success of its administration from 1972 to 1975. It is very important for people to remember how Australia suffered under that Administration, when the inflation rate reached about 18 per cent, an all time record, and also unemployment hit an all time record. That Administration also managed to expand vastly our social welfare program so that our Government has to spend in that area about 31 per cent of the $48 billion appropriated in the current Budget. Members of the Labor Party should be the last ones to criticise the Government for its economic management. The downturn is recognised by nearly everyone as a fact of life. Only last Thursday in an editorial in the Australian Financial Review dealing with Australia's manufacturing industry it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The duration of the recession is largely dependent upon the reflation of the US economy, to state the obvious. The switch in the supply-side economic proposals of the Reagan Administration and the initial tentative signs that the worst may be over provides some hope. But the recent jolt to the falling interest rates locally tends to indicate either that the direct influence of US rates is now weak or that the money market is expecting any falls to be only short-lived. More likely a combination of the two. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, in a recent speech, the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) said:</PARA>
<PARA> The world today is experiencing the most difficult economic conditions it has seen for a very long time. No amount of political argument-of which we've seen such a lot in the past few days-can disguise that fact. Words like 'crisis' and 'catastrophe' come easily to the lips of those who seek to describe the current condition of the world economy. Not since the Great Depression of the 1930s has the downturn in the world economy spread its tentacles so widely and so deeply. With all kinds of nations being affected-strong nations and weak; rich nations and poor, capitalist democracies and communist dictatorships. The world is suffering the worst unemployment it has ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very true and it was borne out recently in a discussion on that subject that was held at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meeting in Nassau. All the countries demonstrated the same problems and in that discussion we tried to find some solutions to them. Australia certainly has to restore its international credibility. At last the trade union movement in Australia is starting to realise that it also has a responsibility in this area. It is at last resisting the urges of its militant left wing agitators to cry out for more and more. If we can get that message to flow right through the whole trade union movement, it will be a great thing for Australia. It will secure the jobs of its members and ultimately it will enable industry to pick up to a degree where further industrial expansion may be able to be--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is another thing. I think people will buy goods from us if we can ensure that those goods are able to be delivered in the international market on time. That is another area where the trade union movement must examine itself. The situation is unacceptable. No government can put up indefinitely with a situation that keeps our goods on the wharves of Australia or on ships lying off shore for up to two months or longer. It is no wonder that people overseas are looking elsewhere to purchase their raw materials. I assure the Senate that our goods on the overseas market have customers. It is up to us to ensure that we service those customers in a much more effective way. I believe that is an area where the trade union movement can help the government and its fellow workers in restoring economic prosperity to Australia. The current downturn is a fact of life throughout the world. As a major exporter, Australia is intricately linked to other nations' economies and, as a result, downturns in other countries are bound to have a marked effect here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What an Australian government can seek to achieve is an enactment of responsible policies to lessen the impact of the economic downturn. This is what the present Government is doing. The Government has taken extensive action to help meet the difficulties facing the economy and the community. In March the Government's housing package provided additional assistance to home buyers, with particular assistance to those having real difficulty maintaining repayments and with extra help to low income families seeking to become home buyers. At the June Premiers Conference we increased the tax sharing grants by over 16 per cent . We gave borrowing freedom to electricity authorities throughout Australia and extra borrowing authority to other semi-government authorities, large and small. Extra funds were provided for State borrowing programs, especially in housing. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times other measures have been taken by the Government as a result of the Budget. From 1 November personal income tax dropped. The tax free threshold rose by $400. A home loan tax rebate has become available. The amount that a taxpayer with dependent children can claim for a dependent spouse, daughter- housekeeper or housekeeper has risen. The sole parent rebate has risen. Family allowance payments have increased. Those measures have been and will be of assistance to the families of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, in the terms of Senator Walsh's motion, the Australian Labor Party believes it can do better. A number of weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) presented his alternative Budget. By examining that we gain some idea of how a Labor government would deal with the current economic downturn being experienced world-wide. Mr Hayden came up with artificial job schemes which are estimated to cost something like $1 billion. He came up with increased government spending on capital works although the present Government has already done that. I endorse that element because I believe that capital works programs should be entered into and that this Government ought to proceed very strongly along that path to ensure that power stations are built around Australia. That is a vital necessity in New South Wales and Victoria. Capital works such as coal handling facilities, water storage facilities and so on should be proceeded with . All things that are necessary for future national development ought to be proceeded with. But Mr Hayden said that there should be more tax cuts on top of the $2.9 billion that have already been allowed for in the full year by this Government in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hayden's alternative Budget would require a deficit of at least $4.5 billion . His alternative Budget was replete with vague, uncosted generalisations which amounted to the inevitable socialist response to economic difficulties-spend more money. On 27 August this year the Age described Mr Hayden's efforts in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> And in all the twists and turns that Mr Hayden's economies have undergone since he won esteem as Treasurer in 1975, the one constant appears to be a belief that the voters can be fooled, that the hard options can be fobbed off, and that it is unnecessary for a party preparing for government to have a credible economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA>On 29 October, the Adelaide Advertiser editorial, referring to the same subject, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hayden's own recipe for economic survival-by stimulating spending through tax cuts or higher benefits, by increased capital works spending, by freezing State Government charges, by capital grants to provide jobs and by maintaining real wages-is unrealistically expansionary in the present climate. There is no knowing where Labor would find the money for such schemes, and no guarantee that Labor could persuade the unions to curb wages. </PARA>
<PARA>A Labor government would be bound by the ALP platform. The people of Australia would do well to note Labor's overall objective which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti- social features of these fields. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite clear. The Labor Party would nationalise industry. It would run the country into tremendous difficulty. The Labor Party has a record of dismal failure. The Opposition accuses us of failure. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill relates to two important areas of the affairs of federally registered organisations of employers and employees. The first area concerns the fitness for office of officers of those organisations or of individuals who aspire to office. The second area involves the use of the financial resources of such organisations to make loans, grants or donations. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions take account of and develop recommendations made in the report by the Royal Commission into the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation (The Winneke Report). The Royal Commission was established in 1981 and reported to the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments in May of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Report of the Royal Commission identified serious shortcomings in the affairs of the Federation and in the conduct of certain of its officers, about which I do not propose to speak now. </PARA>
<PARA> I need only inform honourable senators that these matters, which have been widely reported and achieved considerable notoriety, led the Royal Commission to make certain recommendations as to action to be taken by the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> One recommendation was for the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to be amended to disqualify an officer of an organisation who was convicted of an indictable offence involving an abuse of that office, from holding that or any office in the organisation, and for that person to remain ineligible for such office or offices for a period of five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation was made for an amendment to the Act to provide that the funds of any registered organisation, or any branch, should not be applied in the granting of loans to any officer or member of the organisation or branch unless the terms and conditions upon which the loan is to be granted have been fully disclosed to and approved by the membership of the organisation or branch in general meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> Both of these recommendations highlight the need for the honest administration of registered organisations. These bodies play a vital role in Australian society. It is plainly against the interests of the community and the members of registered organisations if their administration is not competent and honest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not doubt that by far the majority of registered organisations are honestly run, but not only the Royal Commission into the Builders Labourers Federation but also that into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union has shown that there is an urgent requirement for legislation to combat corruption in the management of registered organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> In framing this Bill, the Government has had regard to the longstanding prohibition in the Uniform Companies Acts on certain persons managing corporations. Similarly, the requirements in that legislation about loans to directors of companies and certain other individuals have been noted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government does not consider that a close comparison can be drawn between companies and registered organisations, nonetheless the community and the members of these bodies are entitled to expect an equally high standard of integrity to be set for those who are entrusted with the management of their affairs. Indeed, the Royal Commission into the Activities of the Builders Labourers Federation in making its recommendation concerning disqualification also drew attention to the standards required of company directors in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> So, as I have said, this Bill contains provisions based on those contained in the co-operative companies legislation which disqualify certain persons from being involved in the management of a corporation. I would, in this regard, draw the attention of the Senate particularly to sections 227 and 562 of the Companies Act 1981. The policy in relation to these companies provisions is under consideration in the context of the planned exposure draft of the Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1983. It is hoped that the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities will later this year agree to this exposure draft being made available for public comment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) has directed his Department to ensure that when the public comments on the exposure draft are being examined, consideration is given to the question whether the companies provisions need any amendment so that, as far as possible, they cover the same range of offences as those set out in proposed sub-section 132F (1) contained in this Bill and to the question whether any other adjustments would be desirable to the companies legislation to bring it into line with the relevant provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also inform honourable senators that this present legislation has been the subject of detailed discussion with the members of the National Labour Consulative Council and takes account of their most helpful observations. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me outline the Bill for honourable senators. The Bill will disqualify a person from holding office or being eligible to become a candidate for election or to be elected or appointed to an office within any organisation unless a period of 5 years has elapsed since he was convicted of an offence of a specified type or released from prison for the conviction as set out in clause 4 of the Bill by a proposed new section 132F. The categories of offences are:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) an offence involving fraud and dishonesty punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period of not less than 3 months;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) specific and serious offences against the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and Regulations;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) an offence in connection with the formation, registration or management of an association or organisation other than those covered by (ii) above; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) any other offence involving the intentional or reckless use of violence towards another person or the intentional or reckless causing of death or injury to another person or the intentional or reckless damaging or destruction of property. </PARA>
<PARA> The first three of these categories are derived from the Companies Act. The fourth arises from our consideration of what Royal Commissioner Costigan had to say in his various reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises, of course, that there is a wide range of activities which will come within the scope of these categories. There have to be opportunities for convicted persons holding or seeking office in organisations to have what they have done measured against the holding of or standing for office. Accordingly, the Bill provides an office holder or a candidate for election or appointment to any office who has been convicted of one of the classes of offence I have referred to with the right to seek leave from the Federal Court of Australia to continue to hold office or to be eligible for election or appointment. If the Court grants the application, the applicant will not be disqualified under the legislation. Where the Court refuses the application, the disqualification will continue to operate but it may, if the Court thinks fit, be reduced to a period less than 5 years. There is provision in the Bill to enable the disqualification provisions to be enforced in the Court on application by the organisation, a member of the organisation or the Industrial Relations Bureau. The Bill will permit certain financial assistance to some individuals concerned in leave and enforcement proceedings before the Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will not apply to existing office holders who committed an offence before the date on which the Act comes into operation. It will apply to all office holders who commit a prescribed offence after the Act comes into operation unless within 28 days after being so convicted the office holder seeks the leave of the Court to continue in office. </PARA>
<PARA> All persons who have been convicted of a class of offence such as I have referred to, whether before or after the commencement of the Act and who wish to become a candidate for election to an office within any organisation, or to be elected or appointed to an office within any organisation will come within the scope of the Bill unless a period of 5 years has elapsed since that conviction. Such a person will be able to seek the leave of the Court to become a candidate for election or appointment to office. Where the leave of the Court is sought, the Court will be empowered to:</PARA>
<PARA> grant the person leave to continuee in office; to become a candidate for election or be appointed to office as the case may be; or</PARA>
<PARA> refuse leave to that person to continue in office or to become a candidate for election or be appointed to office as the case may be; and</PARA>
<PARA> if the Court thinks fit, specify a period of less than 5 years during which the person concerned may not seek election or be appointed to or hold office. </PARA>
<PARA> Criteria to guide the Court in dealing with cases before it are set out in clause 4 of the Bill by a proposed new section 132E. They are modelled on pronouncements by the Courts in this country when they have been called upon to deal with similar types of cases arising from the operation of companies legislation. I turn now, Mr President, to what the Bill contains about the making of loans, grants and donations by organisations. There are already detailed provisions in the Act and the Regulations designed to give persons having a genuine interest access to certain information about decisions taken by organisations to make loans, grants and donations. However in light of what the report of Mr Winneke, Q.C., brought forth, the Government has decided that these provisions do not go quite far enough. And, as I have said, we have taken note of and developed a recommendation which Royal Commissioner Winneke make on this subject. The upshot is that, by the provisions of the Bill, all loans, grants or donations of $1,000 or more will have to be approved by the committee of management of an organisation or branch, as appropriate. Moreover the Bill requires that the rules of organisations provide for the committee of management concerned to satisfy itself before it makes a loan, grant or donation that it is in accordance with the rules and, in the case of a loan, that, in the circumstances, any security is adequate and repayment arrangements are satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the provisions in the companies legislation, the requirements relating to loans, grants or donations will not include anything done by the organisation to provide a person with funds to meet expenditure incurred or to be incurred for the purposes of the organisation or the purpose of enabling him to properly perform his duties as an officer of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of all loans, grants or donations of $1,000 or more will have to be filed annually with the Industrial Registrar along with the other financial returns an organisation is required to file. However an organisation will be able to file these details of loans, grants or donations separately. Consistent with norms of privacy, when an organisation certifies that a loan, grant or donation has been made to relieve a member or a dependant of a member from severe financial hardship it will not be necessary for the organisation to include in material it files with the Registrar the name and address of the member or dependant. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Mr President, details of all loans, grants or donations filed with the Registrar will be available for inspection by a member of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this is responsible and reasonable legislation. It is legislation which, I believe, the community expects. It is legislation which any self- respecting organisation will welcome. Organisations run competently and honestly have nothing to fear from it. It will protect a high standard of administration in organisations. I want to emphasise that the legislation does not single out the trade union movement for attention. The Bill applies equally to organisations of employers registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act . </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate to say the least that the behaviour of some notorious trade union officials may have done a grave disservice to the reputations for honest administration enjoyed by so many other officials of organisations in this country. However the members of organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are entitled to have protection against untoward activities that might be engaged in by officials. At the same time, as I have pointed out to the Senate, there are safeguards in the Bill to protect the individual officials of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is certainly not intended as a reflection on the probity of the great majority of hard working officials of employer and union bodies in this country. Such officials should not see it as an adverse reflection upon them any more than the great majority of company directors should see similar provisions applying to them as reflecting upon their integrity. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for implementation of proposals put forward by the Australian Wheat Growers' Federation and the Australian Wheat Board for variations to the existing wheat marketing and pricing arrangements embodied in the Wheat Marketing Act 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>Overview</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In June of this year the Minister for Primary Industry announced that the Government had agreed to proposals by the Australian Wheat Growers' Federation aimed at improving the efficiency and flexibility of AWB operations. The proposals empower the Board to operate on wheat futures and financial futures markets, to establish financial reserves, and to introduce options in arrangements for the payment of the Guaranteed Minimum Price (GMP). They also cover machinery aspects of the existing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also accommodates a proposal put forward by the Australian Wheat Board , in the context of current severe drought conditions, that the Board be empowered to import and market domestically foreign wheat, should the need arise . Additionally the Bill enables the AWB to act on behalf of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau to secure foreign wheat for Australia's food aid program. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity has also been taken to introduce modern standard provisions into the Wheat Marketing Act relating to disclosure of interests by members of statutory bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing marketing and pricing arrangements rely on complementary Commonwealth/State legislation and each of the States intends to amend its legislation to put the revised arrangements into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The revised arrangements will apply for the 1982/83 season, beginning on 1 October 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The marketing of Australia's wheat will experience particular difficulties in the period ahead. The drought has drastically reduced the national crop and will compound the difficulties of the Board in supplying the requirements of food aid ; the regular and major markets that have been developed over past years; and the domestic needs for human consumption, industrial usage, feed compounders, and for feeding of livestock in drought affected areas. The revised arrangements , particularly the authorising of the Board to import wheat and to hedge transactions on futures markets will give it increased flexibility in its complex marketing task. </PARA>
<PARA> The wheat marketing and pricing arrangements to apply beyond the 1983-84 season are currently the subject of inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission, which is expected to report by 30 September 1983. Experience with the revised arrangements embodied in this Bill will be taken into account in considering new arrangements which might apply beyond 1983-84. Consideration will also need to be given to the views expressed by other interest groups, notably the Flour Millers Council, concerning the appropriateness of existing arrangements including existing domestic pricing arrangements for wheat for human consumption . </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the specific proposals encompassed by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Futures Operations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will empower the Board to hedge wheat and financial transactions on futures markets thus enabling the Board to secure price assurances for its unsold wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts the view of the Australian Wheat Growers' Federation that the Board should be authorised to hedge on futures markets at this time. The authorising of the Board to hedge transactions on futures markets will enable it to use a marketing mechanism that is accepted in international commercial trading of grain. Experience has shown that the hedging of transactions on futures markets facilitates grain trading. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the proposed arrangements the Board will be able to hedge on wheat futures markets, currency futures markets, and financial futures markets to protect its wheat sales and also its commercial borrowings used to finance payments to growers. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I emphasise that the Bill carefully defines what is meant by hedging purposes in order to preclude any suggestion of speculation on futures markets. It also provides that the various types of futures transactions will be subject to separate guidelines approved by the Minister for Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Reserves</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill enables the Board to deduct moneys from the proceeds of the sale of wheat and wheat products and create reserves that can be used for specific purposes, consistent with the powers of the Board under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board will be required to disclose the details of each reserve in its financial statements which will be published in its annual report to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> Provisions have been made in the Bill so that the Government's financial liability under the Guaranteed Minimum Price arrangements will not be increased as a result of deductions made for reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>Advance Payment Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under existing legislation the Board is required to pay the Guaranteed Minimum Price to growers on delivery of wheat at the beginning of the season. As growers may not always wish to receive that payment at that time the Bill provides for deferment of all or part of that payment until later in the season. </PARA>
<PARA> Payment of the advance payment to growers will be on the basis of arrangements worked out between the grower and the Board, subject to equity being preserved between growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Any additional costs arising from the optional payment arrangements will be excluded from the excess commercial borrowing cost reimbursement arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>Allowances and Charges</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The advance payment made to growers on delivery of the wheat consists of the Guaranteed Minimum Price adjusted to take account of quality allowances and certain transport, handling, and storage charges. These allowances and charges can vary significantly between growers and States and appropriate deductions for individual growers can be difficult to determine at the beginning of the season.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Act is being amended to ensure that provisional and final adjustments can be made for these charges and allowances and that the full amounts will be brought to the account of individual growers. </PARA>
<PARA>Finalisation of Pools</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Presently the Board is obliged to hold wheat against the season for which it has been received until its ultimate disposal. This can delay the finalisation of a season's pool and impair the efficient management of the Board's operations . The cost cannot be justified on equity grounds when the volume is small. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wheat Growers' Federation has proposed that when the stock of wheat held in respect of a season is reduced to a residual level the Board should be enabled to transfer it from one season to another. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the Board should only transfer residual stocks from one pool to another when it has priced the wheat and such a transfer could not potentially cause or add to a call on the Government's commitment under the Guaranteed Minimum Price arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry will be taking up with the Board the desirability of it determining and announcing each season its policy in respect of the residual stock which is intended to be transferred to a later pool. </PARA>
<PARA>Redeliveries</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Sales of wheat by the Board for stockfeed use are provided for under Section 26 of the Act. It is proposed that the section be broadened to enable growers to take redelivery of a quantity of wheat delivered by them during the season at a price determined by the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The price charged for the redelivered wheat will be equitable between growers and will be based primarily on recovering the guaranteed minimum price plus any adjustments for quality and storage and handling costs. The redelivered wheat will only be able to be used for stockfeed purposes and may be of a different quality to that delivered initially by the grower. </PARA>
<PARA>Remuneration of Authorised Receivers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The AWF has proposed that the existing legislative provision be removed requiring the Board to negotiate agreements on the rates of charge with its authorised receivers for services they provide. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, it is proposed that the Act be amended to provide for the Board to make payments on the basis of rates determined by the Authorised receiver in each State and in accordance with the remuneration agreements in force at the time. </PARA>
<PARA>Approval of Progress Payments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also removes the legislative constraint that advance payments by the Board, other than the initial advance, be approved by the Minister. Should the occasion arise where growers are dissatisfied with the rate at which progress payments are made then the appropriate course of action will be for the Minister to take up any representations with the Chairman of the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>Consistency of Season and Accounting Year</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The AWF has proposed that the Board's accounting year be brought into line with the crop year. The Bill provides that the accounting year be brought forward three months from 1 December to 1 October which will be consistent with the ' season' used in other sections of the Wheat Marketing Act 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> Following on from this change it is intended that the Board's annual report be submitted to the Minister for Primary Industry by 31 March of each year instead of 30 June, unless a later date is approved by the Minister. In the next reporting period there are likely to be practical problems for the authorised receivers and the Board in fitting in with this new schedule, and it may be necessary for the Minister for primary Industry to extend the Board's reporting period. </PARA>
<PARA>Authority to Import</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill enables the AWB to import and market domestically foreign wheat, should the need arise. </PARA>
<PARA> Any specific proposal by the AWB to import wheat will need to comply with quarantine restrictions and will also be subject to my approval under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. Requests will be considered on a case by case basis and an import need will have to be substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA> The domestic marketing of Australian wheat is subject to the Wheat Marketing Act 1979 and any foreign wheat marketing on the domestic market will need to be consistent with the provisions for Australian wheat especially in respect of pricing. </PARA>
<PARA>Agency for ADAB</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In the context of the current reduced wheat supplies, the Board will also be empowered to act on behalf of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau to secure foreign wheat for Australia's food aid program. The Board's expertise will be used in negotiating shipments of foreign wheat direct to Australia's food aid recipients. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments contained in this Bill arise essentially from proposals put forward by the Australia Wheat Growers' Federation and the Australian Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The revised arrangements take account of changed circumstances for the marketing of wheat since the current five year plan as introduced in 1979. These proposals, especially in respect of imports and hedging, will assist the Australian Wheat Board in its complex task of marketing the Australian crop to the best advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience with the revised arrangements will be reviewed in the context of consideration of wheat marketing arrangements beyond 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.20)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have looked at the estimates for the departments which are dealt with in this group. What surprises me in respect of the Attorney-General's Department, as distinct from some of the other departments, is the considerably increased provision that we are being asked to vote for. For example, the average increase for departments is about 10 per cent , a couple of percentage points below the projected inflation rate for the current year, which could well be in excess of 12 per cent. Most departments have been able to keep down the increase in the estimates to about 10 per cent, whereas for the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Defence Support the increase has been 100 per cent greater. One is therefore entitled to raise this matter as a generality, even though the Committee is now dealing with only group A of Appropriation Bill (No. 1).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish at some stage to make reference also to our review of group C. The additional material that was made available to us by the Minister for Finance ( Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) on departmental information activities suggested that there was considerable difficulty in obtaining precise figures on departmental information programs. The material supplied shows that there has been a substantial increase in Government publicity activities, some of which have been referred to in Press statements by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and Senator Button. I would like to be advised how much of the increased expenditure on publicity generally, from $3.9m during the last Labor Government' s term of office to in excess of $20m-as shown on page 4 of the material supplied-is devoted to the Attorney-General's Department? One gets the impression that it is not possible to obtain a very clear picture of what each department is spending on publicity blurbs. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the fact that the increase in the estimates for the Attorney- General's Department is 16 per cent higher than is generally the case with most departments. Having regard to the fact that these estimates were prepared in the June-July period, before the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes came to light, and the indication, following Opposition probing, that additional staff will be made available, can the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) advise whether the Department will have available funds for the appointment of the additional research and legal officers who are to put into effect the legislation which sooner or later will be ratified by the Senate?</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I concede that there is probably a need for an increase in spending by the Attorney-General's Department, can we be given an explanation for the extent of the increase in the estimates, having regard to the fact that they were prepared prior to the tabling of the Costigan report. Also, where will the money come from to provide the additional staff that will be required to carry out the work of the Parliament in the post-Costigan period?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Gietzelt will recall that the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs was disbanded and considerable sections of the Department were transferred to the Attorney-General's Department and other sections to the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Attorney-General's Department gained the Bankruptcy Branch, the Australian Capital Territory Corporate Affairs Office , the Trade Practices Commission and the National Companies and Securities Commission. There was a transfer of functions and, therefore, a transfer of expenditure; it was not necessarily a gain. Senator Gietzelt spoke about the Department of Defence Support. Although that is not related to these estimates, a similar thing happened there. There was a dividing of the Department of Defence into two and the creation of a new department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the latter moments of the last day on which these estimates were considered, a number of questions were raised. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an answer to a question asked by Senator Robert Ray and a lengthy answer to a question asked by Senator Haines. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The answers read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Answer to question asked by Senator Robert Ray on 9 November:</PARA>
<PARA> Movements and fluctuations in tribunal sittings cause considerable daily peaks and troughs in the workload of each CRS office. It is neither practical nor economic to staff any office to meet the peak workloads and in order to give tribunals an assured and timely transcript service, the Commonwealth Reporting Service has had a system of transferring work from the larger to the smaller offices in operation for nearly three years. To avoid delays and difficulties caused by day-to-day erratic transfers, the practice of transferring transcription for certain appropriate jurisdictions was introduced early this year and not in August as suggested. This practice also enables the employment of an appropriate level of staff and a better use of accommodation, equipment and supervision resources in the smaller offices to which work is transferred. </PARA>
<PARA> To conserve reporting resources, it is Government policy to encourage tribunals to limit their demand for transcript and to leave as much as possible of their proceedings untranscribed. However, for the year 1 July 1981 to 30 June 1982, of the tapes originating in Victoria that were transcribed by casual typists, 20% was sent interstate and the remaining 80% transcribed in Melbourne. For the calendar year to date, those percentages have been 30% and 70%. </PARA>
<PARA> The re-distribution of work will not mean that, on average, individual typists will be employed to any lesser extent in Melbourne than in other offices. Although the previous practice of transcribing at the point of origin resulted in individual casual staff at some offices being employed at consistently higher levels than at present, that does not in my view oblige the CRS to continue that system. </PARA>
<PARA> Answer to question asked by Senator Haines on 9 November:</PARA>
<PARA> In the course of yesterday's consideration of the Estimates for the Attorney- General's Department, Senator Haines asked some questions as to why action to obtain payment of income tax-I gather in relation to companies stripped of pre- tax profits-had not been taken under nominated sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The sections referred to were section 26A, which I have taken to be a reference to paragraph (a) of section 26, and sections 166, 167, 170 and 201. </PARA>
<PARA> I first of all make the point that decisions about these matters are ones for the Commissioner of Taxation in the exercise of his responsibility for the administration of the income tax law. The answers that I now give are therefore ones that are based on advice to me from the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (a) of section 26 includes in a person's assessable income profit arising from the sale by the person of any property that the person acquired for the purpose of profit-making by sale, as well as from the carrying on or carrying out of any profit-making undertaking or scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Commissioner's view, there could be no basis for using paragraph 26 (a) to make a vendor-shareholder in a pre-tax profit strip case liable for the company's unpaid tax or, at least in the ordinary run of cases, for any personal tax arising from the vendor-shareholder's connection with the company. The Commissioner believes that paragraph 26 (a) is of little, if any, relevance in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The other sections referred to by the Honourable Senator are of a machinery kind to do with the making and amendment of assessments and the recovery of assessed tax. They do not create liabilities to tax so can only be of assistance where there are other provisions of the income tax law that make the persons concerned liable to income tax in the circumstances. As to section 201, which seems to confer powers of collection where tax is in dispute, the Acting Chief Justice of the High Court has as recently as a couple of weeks ago, in a case involving Peter Clyne having indicated that it does not in practice have that effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that these further comments will be of assistance to Senator Haines. If , having heard me, she wishes to pursue the matter further, it would help me to answer her questions more fully if she would give me some additional detail, particularly of the precise circumstances that lie behind her queries. If she were to do that I would have the matter looked into and a fuller response given when the proposed Recoupment Tax legislation is being debated in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A generalised statement was made by Senator Evans in a critical capacity during the earlier consideration of the estimates for the Attorney-General's department.

Brown) issued a statement regarding the appointment of Mr John von Doussa to conduct an inquiry into transactions involving Mr Horgan. Earlier a statement had been made by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) regarding the same inquiry, although not concerning Mr von Doussa, which left me a little confused as to whether the approaches on behalf of the Government were being made by the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of the Treasury, the Treasurer or, as the Treasurer suggested, the Department of Administrative Services. After that preamble I would like to know-if it is within the knowledge of the officers -whether the Attorney-General's Department, the Acting Attorney-General or the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) was involved in any way with contacts with either Mr Costigan or Mr von Doussa.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise one or two questions in relation to communications. The first one I would like to pursue is the delay in the Department of Communications in planning for the allocation of new licences for radio and television stations. I refer the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) to the fact that I asked in the Senate when Mr Sinclair was the Minister for Communications a question as to what was the backlog or delay in the Department of Communication in planning for the provision of new licences. The answer was 10 years. I pursue that question and ask what the estimate of the current delay or backlog in planning is. Is it a fact that the Department sought an additional appropriation in order to assist with speeding up the process of applications and that that assistance was not forthcoming in terms of an additional appropriation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I am on my feet it is appropriate to mention other matters relating to the Department of Communications. The first is the series of inquiries into the communications system in which this Government is engaged. I refer particularly to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal inquiry into cable television and radiated subscription television services and to the Davidson Committee of Inquiry into Communications Services in Australia, which includes the Australian Telecommunications Commission. In relation to those two inquiries I would like to pursue some questions which are of concern to people who have an interest in the telecommunications system generally. First of all, I would like to establish whether it is a fact that the Government proposes to set up a task force, which would include not only members of the Public Service but also representatives of private industry, of some 60 people, to examine the implications of the Davidson inquiry? I think also it was envisaged that the task force, appropriately enough after five years of mucking about with a badly planned satellite endeavour, would look into the function of the satellite in relation to the communications system. I would like the Minister to tell me in particular whether that task force is being proceeded with and whether it is a fact that the Government has announced that interested parties will have three months in which to provide comment and response to the Davidson Committee of Inquiry report which was tabled in the Senate some 10 days or a fortnight ago. How will that time for public response relate to the work of the task force if that task force goes ahead?</PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to ask whether it is a fact that a month was given for public response to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal report on cable television and radiated subscription television. Has that month expired and what public responses have been received? I do not know whether I am creating difficulties for the Minister by asking these questions. I am sure I am in relation to the answers; I mean by asking them all together. They do form part of a package, the implicit suggestion in what I have been saying being that the Government's communications policy is in an awful mess as a result of all these inquiries which have been set up, many of them inconsistent one with the other in respect of their terms of reference. An enormous process is involved in sorting out the relationship between the operation of the satellite, the recommendations of the Davidson inquiry and the functions of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission . These matters have to be resolved with some firm decision making based on the issues involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in relation to the satellite, it is widely rumoured that the Government is considering moving from a 51 per cent Government shareholding of the satellite company, Aussat Pty Ltd, to a 49 per cent Government shareholding. I would like to know whether that is being done because Aussat has been unsuccessful in attracting sufficient private capital. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is widely rumoured in the Press and elsewhere that the Government is considering abandoning the 51 per cent Government shareholding in Aussat Pty Ltd, the management company of the domestic satellite, and moving to a 49 per cent Government ownership. I appreciate that no decision has been made on that. I am concerned to pursue the level of private capital which has been attracted to the satellite. Has the lack of interest in both investing in the satellite and using it led the Government to give further consideration to this matter, and is it hoped that by having a 49 per cent equity in the satellite rather than a 51 per cent equity the Government will attract further private participation and interest in the satellite, a concept which has been mismanaged from its initial gestation, if I might use that word without causing Senator Lewis to frown?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not venture into the confusion of obstetric terms, as to whether or not one mismanages gestation. That is a problem about which I refer Senator Button to the clinical text books; nor do I seek to take him aside in any such discussion. Senator Button has asked a whole series of questions. He asked first about a backlog which he said he had been advised was of some 10 years. I am advised that the current backlog is some 700 applications and that the overtaking of that backlog is at the rate of about 100 a year; so it would be about seven years. There has been a post-Budget increase in staff ceilings of some 27 people and that overtaking should proceed far more satisfactorily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button asked about the Davidson inquiry task force. There is some suggestion that we would draw on some 60 people, including some from outside government. I am advised that a departmental task force of some eight people has been established, none of whom are outsiders. I think it is true that it has a three-month time fuse for the lodging of submissions. Reference was made to the period of one month regarding the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I understand it is true that that time has expired. A task force is to be set up to inquire into cable television. The final question related to the percentage holding in the satellite. That is a policy matter on which no decision has yet been made and therefore I cannot comment on it. </PARA>

If it is not a fact, is it not true that such a task force was sought to be established in relation to the various inquiries into telecommunications or communications? What has happened to that proposal? The other matter I raise concerns the Minister's declining to answer the question about the satellite on the grounds that it is a matter of government policy. I did not ask what the Government policy was. I asked: What has led the Government to re-examine this matter and is it a fact-I am not asking what conclusion the Government will reach-that the Government has been led to re-examine the matter because of a lack of commitment to invest in and use of the satellite?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish firstly to respond to something said by Senator Button. I was not frowning at the use of the word 'gestation' but the use of the word 'mismanagement'. I direct a question to the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) in relation to Aussat Pty Ltd, a matter which Senator Button raised. It concerns the amount of capital which will be raised publicly. It seems to me that whether the Government holds a 51 per cent or a 49 per cent shareholding, and the significance of that shareholding, depend upon the range of private capital. If, for example, there is only one other shareholder the question of a 51 per cent or 49 per cent shareholding is absolutely vital. If there were two other shareholders it would not be quite so vital. If there were many thousands of shareholders-if the public were involved in the shareholding-it seems to me that it would not matter if the Government held only 30 per cent of the shares in the organisation. If any proposals which were being put forward by the government nominated directors were not satisfactory to at least 50 per cent of the public shareholders I suggest that the proposals would not be worth while. In that event it would be quite reasonable for the Government shareholding to be relatively insignificant. It could be as little as 30 per cent or perhaps 33 per cent in order to block winding up resolutions which may be able to be put through. Apart from that, it seems to me to be insignificant whether the Government is holding 49 per cent or 51 per cent of the shares depending upon the range of public shareholding. It is for that reason that I ask the Minister whether he can tell us whether there will be wideranging public shareholding in Aussat Pty Ltd or whether it may be limited to just a few shareholders, perhaps very large companies or banks or even multinationals?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not a very satisfactory answer because I have floated this question around for two years. It is strange to me that the Department of Communications has had no forewarning that there is some concern in the community about this telephone connection. Even though the question was posed to the Department of Primary Industry, surely that Department , in supplying the answer to the question asking whether it had picked up the tab for the connection, must have had some communication with the Department of Communications to find out about the telephone connection. It seems very strange to me that the officers now say that the question came without warning. As I said, it is a matter which has been floating around for quite some time. I have said in this place on many occasions that it is just about impossible to follow up all these leads when two or three Estimates committees sit at the one time. I cannot run from one to the other if I want to do my job properly. If the information is not forthcoming I do not know how I will pursue the matter further. Perhaps I will suggest that the appropriations for the Department of Communications be postponed-as we had to do last year in a similar case in order to get some information-until a later hour of the day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise briefly an issue that arose in Estimates Committee B. It is not a new issue for the Senate but, nevertheless , I think that it should be raised, if only briefly. It is the subject of junk mail. This matter has been raised on several occasions in the Senate and in other places. In the course of the Estimates Committee some questions were asked about it and there was an indication that an inquiry was under way into a number of matters in relation to Australia Post and that this, too, would be considered . From the answers that we got I am not sure that it would be a very thorough investigation of junk mail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I, and possibly others, have received correspondence from at least one organisation which is involved in the distribution of the so-called junk mail. The junk mail to which I am referring is unsolicited articles, whether they come in an envelope into ones letter-box, or in pamphlet form, in folded newspaper form, or however. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time a number of people have been annoyed by the fact that their letter-box has become cluttered with these items. However, more and more people are becoming upset by it, because what used to be a minor irritation-two or three pieces of paper maybe weekly-has become a positive avalanche. The reason it has become an avalanche is revealed in the letters that I have received from people who are commercially involved in this exercise. They claim that this is a very effective way of communicating to the public in general what goods or services are available. I am aware that surveys have been done in recent times which indicate that this is a quite effective form of advertising-more effective than some of the old and more traditional forms of advertising. So, clearly, people who have goods or services to advertise are being persuaded to use this method. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is not only commercial operators who use this means of distributing information. Australia Post itself makes money out of the distribution of unsolicited material which is placed in letter-boxes, on the basis of a contract of some sort. I am a little disturbed that the report that might cover this matter is being undertaken by those who are fairly close to Australia Post. I am not suggesting that they would produce a dishonest report; I am suggesting that there is little opportunity or reason for them to produce a very negative report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very good. Perhaps I may continue on the subject. For some time people have expressed annoyance about the fact that unsolicited articles are placed in their letter-boxes, basically on the ground that they do not want these articles. However, such is the volume of junk mail now that it has become a positive danger to the property of the owner of the letter-box. It is without doubt an advertisement to any would-be burglar as to whether or not people are at home. The police exhort people from time to time, but especially in the summer holiday period, to make sure that they cancel newspaper deliveries and the delivery of milk and that they make arrangements with the post office for the retention of their mail at the post office for a period. However, no one can make an arrangement to keep other articles out of their letter-boxes. For example, I live in a block of home units. All our letter-boxes are grouped in a square brick edifice next to the footpath. When I return to Brisbane from Canberra at the end of a week it is very apparent which unit in the block is the one which has been unoccupied during the week. It is my letter-box, clearly marked according to number, which is the one which is stuffed with these pamphlets and advertising material whereas other residents who are home at the time can clear their boxes. It should not be suggested that anyone who is absent from his or her home for any period needs to ask others to clear the letter-box. The simple point is that this material has no business in the letter-boxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some citizens are making available stickers which can be affixed to their letter-boxes saying that they do not want unsolicited mail articles. However, those stickers have absolutely no force in law. They have no standing so far as anyone delivering these articles is concerned. I have been informed by people who have bought such stickers and placed them on their letter-boxes that they still receive the unsolicited articles in their boxes. The reason they receive them is that people who are paid to distribute these articles are paid according to how many they distribute. The less the distance they have to walk to distribute them the better. When they know that there is no sanction they ignore such a notice on someone's letter-box. There is nothing constraining them from putting articles in it. I have been informed by some people also, that when they have seen people putting articles into their letter-boxes, despite the signs, and have asked for them to be removed the requests have not always been acceded to. Invariably such requests are not acceded to. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly government action is necessary on this matter. When I raised this matter with the Minister for Communications (Mr N. A. Brown) he indicted that there were legislative difficulties. Where there is a will there is a way. If the Government decided it wanted to stop this practice to protect the property of householders then it could do so. At present under the law if anyone wants mail delivered to a certain address, let us say his private address, he is obliged to provide a receptacle for that mail. If it is not provided the mail will not be delivered to the address shown on the postal articles. If people are required by law to provide letter-boxes in which the Post Office can place properly addressed stamped articles then I do not believe it would be very difficult for someone to find a way of devising a by-law or something similar which would require that only articles of a certain type went into letter-boxes.</PARA>
<PARA> By the way, I do not take the totally extreme view that all unsolicited articles should be prohibited from private letter-boxes. I am aware that a number of people in the community appreciate receiving advertising material. I suggest that the Post Office should print and make available a sticker of a standard size which people could place on their letter-boxes. If the sticker were ignored then a penalty could be incurred. Those who want to receive advertising material-people who are interested in what this week's specials are at Woolworths or K-Mart stores-are given the option of receiving this material. It gives others who do not like receiving such mail or who are afraid of the consequence to their property if they cannot prevent such mail being deposited in their letter-boxes the option of preventing its delivery. I believe what I suggest is possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government to consider this matter. From evidence given at hearings of Estimates Committee B I am not satisfied that this matter is being considered seriously through the report procedure about which we heard. If no strong recommendations or if, indeed, no recommendations are put forward in that report -it was not clearly indicated to members of Estimates Committee B that there would necessarily be any recommendations in relation to this matter-then I would like the Government to consider it as a matter of urgency. Every year at Christmas time-the Christmas holidays are not far away, I am sorry to say-we have a spate of burglaries throughout Australia when people are away on holidays . I would be very interested to know-perhaps the police can do some sort of pilot study in some of the suburbs of our cities-how many people who discovered that their homes had been burglarised when they returned from holidays had taken action to cancel their newspaper and milk deliveries and to have their mail withheld but had letter-boxes jammed to overflowing with this type of advertising indicating that they were on holidays. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to turn to another matter which falls within the purview of the Department of Communications-the Special Broadcasting Service. I refer to the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs review of the Galbally recommendations for 1982-83 and the suggestion that an amount of $650,000 for support for ethnic broadcasting over public radio be expended. I ask the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) whether it is a fact that the Institute of Multicultural Affairs, for some reason, does not concern itself with Aboriginal matters and that of the $650,000 appropriated for ethnic broadcasting some $52,000 has now been extracted, as it were, for the purposes of Aboriginal broadcasting? Is that not inconsistent with the recommendation of the Institute of Multicultural Affairs? Has not the sum of money available for ethnic broadcasting, as that Institute recommended, effectively been reduced by that amount to $598,000?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the work of the Special Broadcasting Service, I would like the Minister to tell the Senate, if he can, what happened to the special migrant advisory panel which was to be set up to advise Channel 0-28 regarding program matters. Did the Government first indicate that it was to be established in May 1981 or thereabouts? Was the panel to be established under the chairmanship of Mr Frank Galbally, the Melbourne criminal lawyer? Why has that panel not been established? Has it anything to do with Mr Galbally's involvement with the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union? Does that have anything to do with the fact that the panel has never been set up?</PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I wish to raise is slightly different. It relates to captions on television for the hearing impaired. Did the Government in 1981, during the International Year of Disabled Persons, announce that one of its special initiatives would be to provide captions on television for the hearing impaired? Was $650,000 appropriated in that year for that purpose? If it is a fact that that sum of money was appropriated for that purpose as a gesture in the International Year of Disabled Persons, why has the Government in fact done nothing about this matter other than successfully push the unfortunate Australian Broadcasting Commission into providing that service? What is the current state of the proposal to provide captions on Australian television for the hearing impaired? Is it a fact that the Government has now appointed a further inquiry into the matter with the possibility that the $650,000 spent in the International Year of Disabled Persons has effectively gone down the spout? If it has appointed a further inquiry, why has that been necessary? Is it because the Government is a little timorous about leaning on the commercial networks in Australia to do what their counterparts in the United States did voluntarily in providing captions on United States television for the deaf?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) asked a series of questions. His first question concerned the sum of $650,000 out of which he said an amount of $52,000 was earmarked for Aborigines. The advice I have from the departmental officers is that the Budget decision specifically earmarked funds for Aboriginal broadcasting. The second question related to the establishment of the advisory council of the Special Broadcasting Service I am advised that the membership is currently under consideration by Cabinet. I know of no reason why Mr Galbally, whose excellent work in the migrant field has been commended by migrants generally, should have any connection at all to the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. I stress that Mr Galbally has been widely commended throughout the whole of the migrant community for the work that he has done. I hope that that would be acknowledged in a bipartisan fashion by all in this Parliament, as it is in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to captioning for the hearing impaired, I am advised that the Government funded the establishment of the Australian Caption Centre in the International Year of Disabled Persons. It has subsequently funded the Australian Broadcasting Commission service and is now discussing the terms of reference of an inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal into the provisions of this service by commercial television stations. The commercial stations can use the services of the Australian Caption Centre. If one looks to the Estimates of the current year , one will see that an amount has been earmarked in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the advisory council to Channel 0-28, I should like the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick), in view of his answer, to tell the Senate why, if it is a fact that that proposal was announced in May 1981 and was greeted with wide acclaim by Cannel 0-28 viewers and ethnic communities, it has taken nearly 19 months for the Government to appoint the members of the panel when it was able to anounce the chairman of that panel in May 1981. Why can it not find two or three other people to sit on the panel if it could so easily appoint the chairman in May 1981?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, I should like to pursue the question of captioning of television programs for the deaf. I ask the Minister again: Did not the Prime Minister of this country in 1980, when he was making a big thing of the International Year of Disabled Persons and a big fellow of himself about what this Government would do for the disabled, announce that the Government would see that captions were provided on television for the hearing impaired in Australia? I seek to pursue why it is only the Australian Broadcasting Commission which will offer this facility. Why is there now a need for an inquiry? Why is the Government, two years later, mucking about trying to get terms of reference to an inquiry into why the commercial networks should provide this facility? Why, in view of that specific undertaking, has nothing happened? Is it that the Government is just not prepared to lean on the commercial networks to see that this service is provided for disabled people in Australia? I make the point that it was not necessary for any government to lean on the networks in the United States of America; they voluntarily did it. If the commercial stations are not prepared to provide this service in Australia, why does not the Government do something about it instead of setting up yet another inquiry?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two questions raised. Senator Button has reverted to his question on the Special Broadcastling Service advisory council and has made comments about the delay. He has sought to make some comment about the delay being associated with Mr Galbally. I remind Senator Button that on the one hand he is talking about a delay of a year or more. On the other hand he is talking about the Costigan Royal Commission report that is only a few months old; so the two cannot be considered together. The basic delay has covered a longer period than that. It has been due to deliberation on the general composition and structure of the council. Recently the Government has decided to expedite this matter and there should be an announcement soon. But I make the clear point that whatever the other reasons for the delay, they had nothing to do with either Mr Galbally or with the Costigan Royal Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the captions for the hearing impaired, the Australian Broadcasting Commission will begin a closed caption service in this year. The commercial stations have not agreed to participate in that service because of concern over technical matters. The additional funding sought this year will maintain the Australian captions centre until the ABC service begins. However, I stress what I have said, that is, that the Government is pursuing this matter in terms of the commercial stations. It has set up an inquiry and will persist in endeavouring to ensure that the best possible arrangements are made with all television stations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) for his answer about the Australian captions service. I hope I will not have to be asking about it next year. Insofar as I was pursing the question of delay in relation to the advisory panel on Channel 0-28, the multicultural television station, I asked why this panel, which was announced in May 1981 under the chairmanship of Mr Galbally, had not been appointed. The Minister has now given an answer. But of course it is an unsatisfactory answer to me because in the course of giving his answer he tried to suggest that the delay could not have anything to do with the Costigan Royal Commission because that report was published only two or three months ago. But I ask the Minister whether he is not aware that within weeks of the announcement by the Government that it would appoint Mr Galbally as chairman of this committee and appoint the committee, Mr Galbally was featuring in all Australian newspapers as a witness before the Costigan Royal Commission and being asked why he put $11,000 in the boot of his Mercedes Benz after a court hearing, a sum which had not been, in the view of the Commission, properly accounted for. I am merely seeking to make it clear to the Minister that I did not confuse the issue. It is not a question of the publication of the Costigan report. It is a question of whether the delay has occurred because of Mr Galbally's involvement before the Costigan Royal Commission. I am not suggesting that the Costigan report has found anything reprehensible about Mr Galbally. He does rate a chapter, I admit. But the question is whether the delay was occasioned by his appearances before that Royal Commission and evidence which was a matter of public knowledge about the time that the Government made this particular announcement.</PARA></TALK.START>

The point I seek to make is simply this. This committee was promised in May 1981. It was a very popular promise and it has concerned many ethnic communities that the promise has not been honoured. There is nothing new about that with this Government. But the point I make is that there is widespread speculation that this is the reason why the committee has never been appointed. If Senator Sir John Carrick wants to say that I should not mention Frank Galbally's name in this place because of some specious view that he has about the niceties of politics, that is fine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask some questions about a particular matter concerning Telecom Australia. I doubt whether I will be able to receive answers tonight but it may be possible for the answers to be obtained during the dinner break. If not, I am hopeful that they will be provided to me at some time in the near future. When I was a young teacher-in fact before I was 21 years of age-I received a transfer to go to a school at Gallangowan. At that stage I did not know where Gallangowan was so I took out the preference sheet that we used to have in schools. I looked it up and it stated: 'Gallangowan, 35 miles from Goomeri by coach'. It was a very old preference list and it did not really mean by motor coach. It gave an indication that it was a very isolated area and when I arrived there I found that, indeed, it was quite isolated. By road it is 35 miles from Goomeri and 36 miles from Murgon. Those are the two closest centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A little while ago I had the opportunity of revisiting Gallangowan. It has not changed much since I was there. It is still very isolated and, in terms of telephone connections probably even more so than it was in those days. Years ago when I was there people could, at a pinch, travel about five miles to the local exchange to make a telephone call. But now the local exchange has been removed because subscriber trunk dialling has come to the area. So there is no local telephone for the people at Gallangowan. I suppose the only major improvement since I was there as a teacher is that electricity is now available through the area. I remember that when I was there 20-odd years ago we made efforts to obtain a public telephone for the settlement. Those efforts were not successful. Some time ago a public telephone was introduced into the place. However, when I went there a few weeks ago I was astounded to find that the public telephone had been taken out. The public telephone box was still there but the telephone had been removed. I understand that it was removed because a new telephone had to be supplied as a result of the introduction of STD in the area. Telecom apparently decided that the telephone was not warranted. It took out the old telephone but did not put in a new one. I subsequently wrote to the State Manager for Telecom about this matter. I would like to read to the Senate his reply because I think it is pertinent to the matters that I raise. The letter read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your recent inquiry about public telephone facilities at the Gallangowan Forest Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Telecom recognises the need to provide public telephones as widely as possible throughout the community, priority must be given to locations where the usage will be sufficient to at least partially compensate for the high installation and maintenance costs involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was talking about the tiny settlement of Gallangowan in south-east Queensland and how, after some time, a public telephone had been installed at the settlement. But when subscriber trunk dialling facilities were provided to the area the phone was removed and a new telephone was not installed. I outlined that this is an isolated place which needs a telephone. Before the suspension of the sitting I was reading a letter that I had received from the State manager of Telecom Australia after I had written to him about the removal of the telephone. I will read that letter again. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to your recent enquiry about public telephone facilities at the Gallangowan Forest Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Telecom recognises the need to provide public telephones as widely as possible throughout the community, priority must be given to locations where the usage will be sufficient to at least partially compensate for the high installation and maintenance costs involved. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Gallangowan Forest Reserve, a thorough survey which was carried out before the area was converted to automatic working, revealed that only limited use had been made of the public telephone facility during recent years. The survey also showed that the Department of Forestry employees and their families, rather than the travelling public, made most use of the facility . </PARA>
<PARA> Despite sympathetic consideration of all the circumstances, therefore, it was not possible to justify the additional cost of replacing the Gallangowan public telephone with an S.T.D. type when the area was converted to automatic working on 9 June 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Department of Forestry recently decided to lease an S.T.D . type coin telephone for the use of their employees at Gallangowan. These S.T.D . units are presently in very short supply but in recognition of the relative isolation of the area, one will be made available for installation within six weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>I make two comments about that letter. Firstly, it said that a survey had revealed that only limited use had been made of the public telephone facility during recent years. It is possible that only limited use was made because there are about 80 people living at the settlement. But I was informed when I was there a few weeks ago that, because of the isolation, the coin box was not emptied very often and that the phone was out of order for some time because the coin box was full. That would have something to do with the limited use being made of the public telephone. When that happened the residents had to go to the forestry office or the forestry ranger's residence or the school to make their telephone calls. It would not need a survey to show that Department of Forestry employees and their families used the telephone rather than the travelling public as stated in the letter because very few members of the travelling public go through Gallangowan. They would have to make a detour of several kilometres off a main road to get to the settlement. It appears therefore that the people of Gallangowan will have a public telephone. They will not have a public telephone because Telecom Australia will reinstall a public telephone in the box that was left after the telephone was removed, but they will have a telephone because the Department of Forestry will install that public telephone after having leased it from Telecom Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted the departmental officers to obtain information, but because the Senate suspended its sitting for dinner it will probably be hard to obtain that information tonight. I am hopeful that the Minister will ask officers of the Department of Communications to provide answers to these questions. Firstly, how much will the Forestry Department pay for the lease of the telephone? Who will retain the moneys for calls made from the public telephone once it is installed? Is Telecom not interested in providing public telephone facilities for people in isolated areas? It seems strange that there was a public telephone in that area and when the changeover to STD facilities was made it was removed. If it had not been for the Department of Forestry offering to lease a telephone the facility would not have been available. I saw the telephone box when I was at Gallangowan and it was intact. There seemed to be wires which could be connected to a telephone. It did not seem to require anything to be done other than for the telephone cabinet to be installed. Is it the policy that in settlements like this, where there are few people and where there is a telephone which is changed over to STD, the telephone is removed or is it policy that in a forestry settlement such as this it is up to the State Department of Forestry to install and supply a public telephone? Finally, where else in Queensland does a similar situation prevail? Where else in Queensland is a public telephone leased by one of the Queensland Government departments rather than supplied by Telecom?</PARA>

<PARA> Before we leave the consideration of the estimates for the Department of Communications, I have some further comments to make. During the recent hearing of the Senate Estimates Committee B concerning proposed expenditure for 1982-83 for the Department of Communications, some honourable senators expressed interest in the progress of the 1981-82 annual reports produced by the Department of Communications and the statutory authorities encompassed by the Communications portfolio. Before outlining the position regarding the progress of these reports I would like to mention that the Minister for Communications ( Mr N. A. Brown) has taken a specific interest in the preparation of the annual reports within his portfolio. Shortly after his appointment the Minister requested his Department to convey to the statutory bodies within the portfolio his concern to see that annual reports were tabled promptly. </PARA>
<PARA> He has since received information, as have I, on the satisfactory progress of the production of the 1981-82 annual reports for the Department of Communications and authorities. In all instances it is anticipated that the 1981 -82 annual reports, or interim reports where necessary, for the Communications portfolio will be tabled during the current session of Parliament. Extensive details on this matter relating to the Department and each statutory authority have been made available to the Senate Estimates Committee and I believe that should resolve any matters of concern individual senators may have in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise an item in relation to the Australian Theatre Board's allocations to various theatre companies around Australia and, in particular, to the Popular Theatre Troupe in my State of Queensland. The funding of that troupe by the Theatre Board of the Australia Council has been continuous for the past eight years, but recently an announcement was made that as at 30 December of this year funding would be cut. Under normal circumstances, of course, the troupe could reapply for funding by next February. But since it is a fully professional body and obviously has continuing commitments to both staff and actors, this hiatus in its funding, even if it were successful in having funding restored next year, would mean the destruction of the troupe. The fact is that in Australia there are no unsubsidised professional theatre companies. Indeed, theatre companies require a subsidy either by way of Federal or State government grant or grant from private enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subsidy for the Popular Theatre Troupe had been under review during the whole of last year. The reasons given by the Theatre Board were a high turnover of actors and administrators, a lack of artistic innovation, and the fact that it had no alternative funding. The last reason is not unexceptional, since the nature of the productions of the Popular Theatre Troupe could be expected in most cases to be antithetical to the State Government, which is not necessarily entirely sympathetic to such didactic theatre. </PARA>
<PARA> From my knowledge of theatre companies around Australia, it would be very difficult to substantiate, even on an objective basis, a denial of funds on the ground of a high turnover of actors and administrators. Fairly obviously, the low level of the troupe's funding meant that it was exceptionally difficult, financially, to keep it operating at a viable level. Hence, the cost to the people involved was often the sacrificing of their career. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Popular Theatre Troupe has made a solid contribution to theatre in Queensland in regard to its written material, its productions and its generating of what has been recognised in other States also as a worthwhile theatre of social criticism. Of course, it is well known that the productions of the troupe tend to have a political bent that is not acceptable to the government of the day. I expect that exactly the same view would be taken whether if the government were a National Party, Liberal Party or Australian Labor Party government. A theatre of social criticism is not readily acceptable in my State of Queensland but I would have thought that it be one which the Theatre Board would have seen as worth supporting and continuing to support. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike stable theatre companies of the conventional kind, the troupe's performance of drama in such places as prisons, factories, hospitals, schools, handicapped persons' institutions, workers' clubs, mental institutions, alcohol rehabilitation centres, conferences, senior citizens clubs and, of course, the street itself shows that it has been willing to provide theatre for the citizens of my State and other States in places in which the more conventional theatre companies do not undertake that task. </PARA>

The State Government has not, in the eight years of the Popular Theatre Troupe's existence, supported it by way of financial grant except in those cases in which the troupe undertook a particular program as part of normal school theatre operations. The point I raise is that in the past few years a number of decisions taken by the Theatre Board have later been reversed by the Government through its providing increased funds. I hope that the Government will be able to indicate its intentions and state whether the Theatre Board's decision in this case was prompted-as we were told last year when funds for a number of theatre groups in Queensland were cut off- by lack of finance. Can the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) indicate whether that is again the case in regard to Theatre Board allocations around Australia, or whether some other reason can be advanced?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macklin's speech is a very good example of what concerns me about our present system of arts funding. The Australian Theatre Board was set up to distribute the available funds, taking into account the quality of the company, the quality of its productions, its fund raising efforts in other areas, the amount of local support it can raise and its audiences. This is a very detailed assessment and one which needs to be decided by professionals. It is not an easy task. Whenever funds to a body are cut off, it will have a thousand reasons why it, rather than some other body, should be funded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What must not happen, in my view, is for the Parliament or the Cabinet to be involved in these decisions. The job of the Government and this Parliament is to decide what sort of funds we should allocate to the Australia Council and, through it, to the Theatre Board. The professionals are able to weigh all the factors and the competing demands for funds and it should be left to them to decide. Disgruntled people should not be able to come to the Parliament or to the Government and expect redress. We should tell them-as I think Senator Macklin has told people who have contacted him-that the decision has been made by the Theatre Board. If they have further arguments they should be put to that body. They should not go to the Government or to the Parliament to have that decision reversed. That is the very negation of the system of arts administration set up by successive governments-an arms length system which involves establishing a body such as the Australia Council with experts in the various arts fields to undertake decision making. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this does not affect the Popular Theatre Troupe at all-it falls directly under the Theatre Board-the way in which the present Government has departed from the arms length principle in a number of areas is a source of worry to me. I refer to the way in which specific arts grants are made to the Australian Opera, the Australian Ballet Foundation and the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust orchestras. This is very undesirable. I spoke at length about it in the Senate last year and find myself obliged to say almost exactly the same things this year. I have spoken to successive Ministers about it in the interval but so far there has been no change. It is highly undesirable and very damaging to the arts for these sorts of direct negotiations to be conducted with Cabinet. Members of the Cabinet, with the best will in the world- they are in no sense arts experts-are making arbitrary decisions without professional advice on what allocations are to be made to a particular body such as the Ballet, the Opera or the Trust orchestras. What we must do is implement our principles with regard to the decentralisation of arts funds and the arm's length principle. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to individual items in the estimates which should, in my view, come under the Australia Council and should not be directly decided by the Cabinet. The first item is Artbank, which is part of division 330. Artbank was established three years ago to co-ordinate all government art lending and to acquire works of art for placement on hire in public places. This year its allocation is $430,000. That is all very well, but the Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council has an identical role. Surely it should be the body to decide whether out of the available arts funds $430,000 is appropriate for this function. By approving the estimates we are pre-empting a decision of the expert body which we have appointed. I think this is quite wrong. I would recommend that this function be brought back under the Australia Council. As I understand it, Artbank comes under the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. Therefore, it would not be possible for the Australia Council to make a grant to its own parent department. I think the simple answer would be to abolish Artbank and turn that function over to the Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Another body that should come under the Australia Council is the Australian National Gallery, which was opened recently. The Gallery is now completed. It has a budget this year of $15.4m for administration, including $4.667m for acquisitions. The balance between what is spent on the Gallery and what is spent on other areas of the arts, again, is a matter of expert judgment. The decision is made arbitrarily-I have no doubt after due thought -by Cabinet. I do not think that Cabinet is appropriately qualified to make this sort of judgment. Nothing can happen before 1988, because the forward commitments for acquisitions by the National Gallery must remain, but after that I think the Australian National Gallery should come under the Australia Council and should receive its funding in competition with alternative ways of spending on other art forms. One very great advantage of that is that acquisitions form a sort of buffer that can be used by the Australia Council. If the Council has a temporary restriction on its funds, with salaries being the main component of the companies which it supports, it has no buffer. Acquisitions of the National Gallery could be delayed or advanced and provide a financial buffer to make the working of the Australia Council funding more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> The votes which I particularly dislike all come under the Australia Council Act . Having set up the Australia Council, we might think that it had discretion to spend its funds in the way in which it chooses. That is not the case. The Council is directed to give the Australian Ballet Foundation $1.772m. It is directed to give the Australian Opera $3.692m. It is directed to give the Elizabethan Theatre Trust orchestras $3.032m. Those are not discretionary decisions by the Australia Council. It is ordered by Cabinet-as far as I can determine, on no professional advice-that that is the appropriate amount to go to those bodies. I find that very disturbing indeed. There are other defects which I will come to in a moment. The only areas of discretionary expenditure by the Australia Council are allocations of $20.017m for general support for the arts and $5.087m for administration. Large chunks of its grant are pre-empted and directed by the Cabinet without proper professional consideration. I do not consider that an acceptable way to give support to the arts in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation poses a number of problems. The first is-I do not suppose honourable senators on the other side of the chamber would attach too much importance to this-that it is contrary to the platform of the Liberal Party. We have, in our platform, an expression on the arts that particular judgments should be made by those having specialist knowledge. I do not think anyone would pretend that members of the Cabinet have specialist knowledge in the field of the arts. The second problem is that it is bad administration to have these arbitrary decisions made by people without professional knowledge, and it is bad politics. We may think in our early days in politics that it is wonderful to be a latter day Medici giving out funds for the arts but, in fact, it is terrible politics because for every grant that we give we make one friend and 10 enemies are made. That is bad politics in anyone's terms. We should give the responsibility to the Australia Council, let it make the decisions and let it take the objections. If Senator Macklin had an objection about the Popular Theatre Troupe, he would go straight to the Australia Council and not the Government. The Australia Council would make the decision as to whether the Theatre Troupe was an appropriate body to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most serious objection to this method of funding is that it damages the bodies which it is supposed to favour. For instance, the Australian Ballet has been an artistic disaster area for several years. There are serious structural problems with the orchestras-one in Sydney and one in Melbourne. The Australian Opera must be the only major opera company that changes its orchestra when it goes from one city to another. This is a ridiculous procedure. There are serious problems regarding relations between the Australian Opera and the regional operas. The trouble is that with a method of funding directly from Cabinet to these organisations no one is in a position to take the necessary sorting out of administrative action to make these organisations function sensibly. We have given away the power of the purse. No one is in a position to exercise it. I think this is a very serious defect in our arts administration. Last year I said that I would, and I was ready to do it, move a request for an amendment to the estimates to bring all these separate directed votes back under a one-line appropriation, giving the discretion and the responsibility where it should be-that is, with the Australia Council. </PARA>

Actually, I have the request here but I will not distribute it because I fear that it might be carried. If it were carried it would pose a serious structural problem for the Government. I have had substantial words of support on this side of the chamber. I think that a majority of people on this side of the chamber would support it. I hope that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) have noted that. I fear that the Opposition, not out of principle but out of mischief, might also support it. That would cause very great difficulties because, as I think we are all aware, the House of Representatives is getting up tonight and may not sit again this year. The money available to the Government is rapidly diminishing and I think that to delay the passing of the Appropriation Bills over a relatively minor issue such as this would not be acceptable. Nevertheless, to the people involved in the arts community this is a very important issue. Last year I fired what might be called a blank shot. This year I fire the live shot across the bows.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that honourable senators opposite can even spell the word, so there is not much point in discussing the matter-and I am not referring to the word 'mischievous'. I am not going to bow to the little lecture that Senator Hamer issued in the general direction of these benches about whether we should or should not take up a particular issue for a particular theatre company. I remind Senator Hamer, as piously as he reminded us of certain issues, that we are senators representing particular States and if an organisation in a State is threatened, and that threat could affect the education and the entertainment of in the vicinity of 30,000 school children, we would be derelict in our duty if we did not take up the cudgels either directly by representation to the Australia Council or indirectly via this chamber to it. I am wielding the cudgel tonight on behalf of the Little Patch theatre company which was established in 1972 by Morna Jones, who unfortunately, died early this year, a death which, removing as it did the artistic director, precipitated some of the problems which arose later in the year. She established the company specifically to provide entertainment and education to young people through theatre. In 1977 it became a general grant company. As one of our newspapers noted early in October of this year, the Little Patch theatre company received a $48,000 grant last year. On 30 September this year it was informed that the Theatre Board had withdrawn the grant. The Director of the Theatre Board, Mr Michael Fitzgerald, said from Sydney that other companies had stronger claims to the limited funds available. I acknowledge Senator Hamer's point, that because of the line division limited funds are available to the Australia Council. Notwithstanding that, the Theatre Board felt that it had to take money from existing companies because it had no flexibility. It seems somewhat draconian to take away the entire grant from one of the few organisations in South Australia that was providing educational and entertaining theatre to school children. Senator Macklin raised the question of the Popular Theatre Troupe in Queensland. As I understood it, he said amongst other things that it had been refused funding because it had a high staff turnover and it had received no other funding.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Keeffe said, the Board took the lot from that group, too. Clearly that is not the case with the Little Patch. It had received private funding from the Brighton Lions Club, the Brighton City Council, the State Government and the Department of Community Welfare. It also received one-off grants from the State Government's Department of the Arts, and the Education Department of South Australia has continued to provide a seconded teaching position at the Little Patch. Clearly it has the support not only of various private organisations in South Australia but also of various State Government departments. As far as I am aware there has not been a high staff turnover in the Little Patch. It employs five full time staff who, according to the administrator, have been specifically chosen because of their multiple skills. There is a writer-actor-puppeteer, a musician-actor-puppeteer, a technical person who also does acting and puppeteer work, an artistic director and an administrator-secretary. Unfortunately these people have been placed in a rather unstable situation, as the Department of the Arts in South Australia has told them that no money is available for them before this time next year and the Australia Council has told them that, whilst they may resubmit, any application will not be looked at before a special meeting to be held in February. That means that the company will have to get yet more private funding, since no State funding or Commonwealth funding is available before February, or its staff cannot be maintained. It does seem a shame that simply because the originator of the company, its original director, died earlier this year and was replaced by someone who, I point out for Senator Hamer's particular interest, had the approval of the Australia Council but was found to be not adequate, not to have the personality to deal with the sorts of things required by this particular theatre, the Theatre Board has decided that it cannot get their act together sufficiently to warrant funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This theatre company was established in the beginning of the 1970s by Morna Jones simply because of the belief that many adults were unaware of live theatre and would therefore be unlikely to encourage their children to attend live theatre. She believed that those school children should be given the opportunity of coming into contact with something which was both educational and entertaining, which would then lead them to a love of the theatre and would take them on to an adult lifetime of enjoying professional productions, and for that matter amateur productions. It seems a shame that this innovative theatre, which was directed at a specific audience with specific aims-exactly the sort of people to which Senator Hamer was referring-and which had a particular sort of staff, after a decade of providing entertainment through 300 performances a year , catering for some 30,000 children each year, should be forced to fold up simply because the Theatre Board has seen fit to cut its grant. I suggest that it is my role as a senator for South Australia, notwithstanding the fact that Senator Hamer sees the decisions as being the sole preserve of the Theatre Board on the grounds that it has some highly constituted, intuitive claim to being omniscient in this regard, to step in on behalf of this organisation and not to say that Parliament should keep at arm's length from theatre funding. I ask the Australia Council through this chamber at least to consider reallocating money to the Little Patch theatre before February of next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like briefly to support what Senator Hamer had to say in relation to the principle of arts funding. I supported Senator Hamer on the last occasion he raised this subject. I appreciate the difficulties we have been put into in terms of time this year mainly because the House of Representatives has held up the Senate's program and we have had a late passing through to us of the Appropriation Bills. They are practical difficulties. I am pleased to get an indication from the Opposition that perhaps this year it has moved some distance towards the thinking of Senator Hamer and me because certainly it was not of that mind when this matter was raised in the debate on the Appropriation Bills last year. I certainly hope also that the Government will take note of the matter and reconsider this situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to debate the ins and outs of the Popular Theatre Troupe or the organisation about which Senator Haines was concerned. I just reiterate that the purpose of the Australian Council is arm's length funding for artistic groups. When the Theatre Board, which has on it qualified people who have a well known set of criteria for determining funding to organisations, makes a recommendation it may be a sorry state of affairs according to some honourable senators, that they cannot debate and change that decision in the Senate. They must realise that the other side of the coin is one that they should applaud; that is, that politicians should not decide where this type of funding is to go. The fact that the Popular Theatre Troupe was not to receive any funding for 1983 was something I knew of only after the Popular Theatre Troupe informed me of it. Whilst it has been alleging that this has happened for political reasons, I do not think it has any justification at all for that. Certainly it has had its altercations with the State Government but that has not affected its Federal funding. I am obliged, as on previous occasions, to accept the ruling of the Theatre Board as to the priorities of demands of theatre groups for public funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Two items that I want to raise in a separate way relate to matters that arose in Estimates Committee B. I asked a series of questions in relation to grants in aid to certain organisations when we were considering the estimates of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. I asked about the priorities that determine the level of funding for certain organisations, the criteria that government uses to draw its conclusions independently and I also asked for an indication of what importance is given to the public or group activities of certain organisations. Two organisations I was particularly interested in at that stage, and still am, were the National Council of Women of Australia and the Country Women's Association. </PARA>
<PARA> In the response that came in printed replies, which were recently tabled in the Senate, my questions have not been answered. I am given a description of the method of consideration of grants and of all the grants in aid groups that were listed in the Estimates. They are divided into two groups and a description is given of the way the different groupings of organisations are treated. My questions on priorities and criteria and the importance attached to public or group activities of organisations have not been answered. I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) whether that information can be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> My reason for asking those questions was this: Amongst the groups referred to in the written response, are group B organisations which include the two women's organisations I have referred to, as well as some other organisations. I do not want to suggest that any of these other groups should have got less, but what I am about to say might give some indication of why I was interested in criteria. For example, the National Council of Women of Australia which is an organisation which speaks for over one million women in various women's organisations in Australia, receives for 1982-83 exactly the same grant as it received for 1981- 82, and that is the breathtaking sum of $8,000. The Country Women's Association which, I would hazard a guess, is the largest women's organisation in Australia and a very significant one, received also for 1982-83 the same amount of money as for 1981-82, and that was the astonishing figure of $3,500. I have to say that those figures are puzzling. One wonders what the Government thinks an organisation such as the National Council of Women of Australia could possibly achieve with $8,000. It would obviously achieve more than it would with nothing, but very little more. In fact it receives next to nothing. Certainly one wonders what sort of a contribution to the Country Women's Association is $3,500. </PARA>
<PARA> The latter organisation does a great deal of essential good works in the community, works that would not be done if that organisation were not doing them . It takes a particular interest in providing facilities to assist children in very isolated areas to have access to schools. It has had various projects that have had a very strong health bent. At one stage it raised very large sums of money so that hospitals in country areas could have provided to them technical equipment which meant that information on heart patients could be transmitted instantaneously to specialist hospitals in capital cities, and assistance in diagnosis on the basis of the information transmitted could be sent back instantaneously to those country hospitals and to the country town doctors who were attempting to help patients needing immediate assistance in those towns. That is just one example of a number of extremely worthwhile projects that the CWA has involved itself in. It provides a vital service in our country towns in remote areas. The women in that organisation, working in their own individually modest way, provide essential assistance to the social fabric of our country areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Against the appropriations to those organisations, I contrast the amount of $ 400,000 granted to the Surf Life Saving Association of Australia. This is a very worthwhile association and I was one who last year pressed for some increased assistance. The grant last year was $330,000, so the Surf Life Saving Association has received an increase. The Royal Life Saving Society Australia receives in 1982-83 $200,000 as against $110,000 in 1981-82. So some organisations have received substantial increases and are receiving substantial sums of money. I would not suggest for a minute that any of the money going to the Surf Life Saving Association or to the Royal Life Saving Society should be taken from them and given to another organisation, but I have to query as strongly as I can those pitiful sums of money that go to the National Council of Women and the Country Women's Association, both of which are doing very worthy work. I suggest that the CWA, is doing work equally worthy of those other two organisations which receive very substantial sums of money. I reiterate what I said at the beginning of my speech, they were the reasons for my asking questions about priorities and, the criteria and importance that is attached to the public or group activities of organisations in this category. I reiterate that I have not received an answer to those questions although I have received a description of the administrative way in which the determination on the amounts of grants for those organisations is handled. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to speak briefly on another matter that arose in relation to the estimates for the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. I asked a series of questions in relation to a superannuation scheme that is being set up for employees of the Australian Bicentennial Authority. I received a quite detailed answer. I cannot and would not attempt to go through all the details but I think the Senate should know some basic facts about the proposed superannuation scheme for this Authority. I shall read just one section of the reply. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Employee contributions will be mandatory; staff members may elect to contribute at the rate of 2.5 per cent, 5 per cent or 7.5 per cent of annual salary. Employer contributions will be made at the rate of 15 per cent of salary for staff other than a limited number of senior staff whose appointments are subject to the approval of the Chairman, for whom the proposed rate of contribution is 20 per cent of salary. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, to put it mildly, a very generous superannuation scheme. For employee contributions of 2.5 per cent, 5 per cent or 7.5 per cent employer contributions -that is, contributions from public funds-will be at least 15 per cent and possibly 20 per cent. I had heard that this Authority was setting itself up an extraordinarily generous superannuation scheme. Those facts support that. Whilst I am not going through all the details of the answer, I am not in any way not doing justice to the answer that was given to me by leaving out all those other details. The Authority will obviously be only a short lived one. As I understand it will exist only until 1990, and what will happen then to the contributions? The position of anyone on leaving the Authority is perfectly adequate and satisfactory and it would be so if the contributions by the employer, that is, the public purse, were a lower rate. The answer also contains the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The finer details of the scheme are still being considered by officers of the Department of Finance and the scheme has yet to be approved by the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA>I urge the Minister for Finance to take a long time approving this scheme and to be thoroughly satisfied that it is a proper way to be treating public funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments about the Australia Council and to reflect somewhat on the comments of Senator Hamer. I am not certain whether Senator Hamer was here-perhaps even Senator Martin was not here-when the Senate took up the debate on the Australia Council and the problems that the Australia Council posed early in its establishment. If I recall correctly, what Senator Hamer proposes was the method by which the Australia Council operated. It received a sum of money, some $20m, and further to that, another $3m, I think, to administer the $20m. Some of us considered that $3m to be an enormous amount for administrative costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite a number of criticisms arose in the Senate, both in committees and in the Senate as a whole, concerning the Australia Council and its operation in its early years. One of the main points was that the Australia Council, in its operation, opened itself to a wide range of criticisms in that it extended patronage in a rather elegant and elitist way, a patronage which seemed to direct the moneys made available to it in directions which suited the administrators of the Council. The patronage exposed itself in a variety of ways . The abuses were substantial. I think that the abuses eventually led, perhaps unfortunately, to Dr Battersby being moved to one side. That was to be regretted . But the Australia Council took upon itself the role of being patron of the arts, with all the problems and the abuses which followed. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not very encouraging to hear, in the committees of the Senate and in the Senate as a whole, about the manner in which moneys were used and misused, about the extremely lengthy lunch hour working parties, about the opening nights with extensive guest lists, about patronage to important people and patronage to some senators. I remember in particular patronage to a former senator, Senator Davidson, who happend to be chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, which was carrying out an investigation of the Australia Council. To our horror, we found that he was a guest of the Australia Council at an opening night, and the costs of that were met out of the funds of the Australia Council. The area of abuse was substantial, to the point that the Senate determined that there should be some supervision. I think that the Government came to that conclusion and restructured the Australia Council. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is now some itemised accountability on the part of the Australia Council which enables some political supervision to take place, it is as a result of what occurred in those early days, and what will again occur if what Senator Hamer proposes comes to pass. So I suggest that we are here not just to sign the cheques, as Mr Mollison expects us to do. I say that because he took a similar approach-that we were just philistines; we had no idea; it was an area in which we had no talent at all; we had no instinct in any of these directions; we just signed the cheques. We objected strongly to that patronising attitude of the members of the Australia Council and the members of the Australian National Gallery Council. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what I think led to the desire to have an accountability of funding. It was not suggested that we should enter into the area of direct gifting, but it was important that the Parliament should determine certain policy matters. One of the policy matters was that funding should be directed in such a way that it flowed to the very roots of the community; that ordinary people gathering in ordinary places to participate in cultural pursuits should be encouraged and assisted. A sum of $20m was not given merely for the purpose of supplying funds to the great organised companies so that those of us who are better able financially and perhaps by way of some educational background could enjoy what they have to present. I believe that it was not the Parliament's intention that the funds should be so directed as to be limited only in this particular area, as they appear to be now and as they increasingly appear to be. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to support Senator Macklin and the Popular Theatre Troupe. It is a small, grass-roots group which has become, more so at some times than at others, expert in political satire. Its members give us the benefit of their wit and their sharp criticisms. Some of that wit and criticism no doubt hurt the Bjelke- Petersen Government, and in particular that part of the Government which Bjelke- Petersen represents. So, what happened to the Popular Theatre Troupe as a result of its satirical activities? Going back several thousand years, ancient artists and dramatists were superb in this field. These young artists, in their own way, were carrying out something similar, cutting to the very heart of certain political problems and hurting politicians, as they needed to be hurt from time to time, especially in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> So, what has happened in Queensland? Instead of the Australian Council continuing its support, in spite of criticisms from Queensland and the action of the Department of Education in Queensland in banning this group from various schools, instead of persisting to fund, the Australia Council withdrew the total funding of the group. The Council withdrew it for a reason which I find places that group completely at the mercy of the Bjelke-Petersen reaction, because what the Council did was to say: 'This group has no local funding and, because it has no local funding, we do not fund'. So immediately the group was placed at the mercy of Bjelke-Petersen, because his Government will not fund. In no way will it fund the Popular Theatre Troupe. In no way will it allow that group in some way to contaminate the minds of young school students. So the group is banned from the State schools by the Education Department in Queensland-but not, incidentally, from the private schools, to which it is still invited. </PARA>
<PARA> However, because the group received no local funding, the Australia Council did not fund. So when the group says that this was for political reasons, in a way that is correct. The Australia Council has not appreciated the fact that the banning of this groups' activities in Queensland is a political act, and that is why the group gets no funds, and because the Australia Council then refuses to fund it plays the game of Bjelke-Petersen. I am suggesting that while the Australia Council takes decisions of this sort then there has to be some participation by this Parliament. Taking into account the record of the Australia Council and its accountability not only financially but also in relation to policies which it applies, I think we should insist on some participation by this Parliament. I am not suggesting that we should open up the area so that politicians can impose their political weight in order to influence funding in a particular direction. All I am suggesting is that we cannot free the Australia Council from the supervision of this Parliament. Its record shows that we cannot do that. Its action in refusing to fund the Popular Theatre Troupe seems to support what I am saying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Georges misunderstood a couple of points I was making. First of all, there is no question that the Australia Council should not be under the supervision of Parliament in regard to its expenditure. It is subject to ordinary audit requirements. We are entitled to ask any questions we like about what it is doing and why it has done it. Senator Georges appears to me to agree that we should not try to tell the Australia Council that it should support a particular organisation in a particular way. If he feels that way-I understood him to say that with regard to the Popular Theatre Troupe although the appeared to contradict himself two or three times- then certainly I agree with him. This suspicion of the Australia Council is a worry. It has led to the problem I referred to earlier. The Government was also suspicious. I understand the Government felt in 1967-77 that the Australia Council was trying to underfund the major national ballet and opera companies as a means of blackmailing the Government into increasing funding for the arts. Whether that was true or not I do not know. That was five years ago. We now have new members of the Australia Council and it has a new structure. Every member of the Council and every member of its boards has been appointed by his Government. I think this Government, at least, should be able to trust the Australia Council .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is proper for the Government to give such directives as it likes. Rather than saying that the Australian Ballet should get so much money or the Australian Opera should get specific grants what the Government should do if it wishes is to issue a directive, for example, that the first priority for the Australia Council should be to produce a national opera company of international standard and a national classical ballet company of international standard. That is the sort of directive the Government should give if that is what it wants. That is much more appropriate than giving a specific grant for a purpose. In practice that means that there is no proper check on the funding; it is not looked at for padding; and, there is no accountability by that company for its performance to anyone who is capable of assessing its performance. Maybe we should establish a national drama company. I note that one company in Sydney has declared itself a national drama company. There may well be a case for establishing a national drama company although such a decision should not be made unilaterally by the company itself. These days the ordinary professional funded company cannot take on plays with large casts; they cannot afford to. Maybe there is a case that we should fund one company in Australia that could put on any play that might be reasonable on an Australian stage. That would be a national company. It would not necessarily have to travel but it could be a centre of excellence in that field of the arts. Again, if that is what is required, that would be an appropriate directive for the Government to give to the Australia Council. What it must beware of though is direct political interference in particular grants to particular organisations. That is what I oppose. That is what I understand Senator Georges to oppose too. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to address a few remarks to another area of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment, and particularly to certain very important environmental issues which face Australia at present. They include salinity in the River Murray and the general question of land degradation in Australia. Some 55 per cent of the arable land in this country is subject to land degradation of one form or another. They are the sorts of issues which are ongoing, which concern the environment and which concern those engaged in primary industry and so on. I hope we can discuss them further during the estimates of the Department of Primary Industry. They are very important issues in Australia. Governments ought to be doing a little more than they are to alleviate those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The most popular issues in environmental terms at the moment are the future of the Great Barrier Reef, the question of rain forests in Australia and the future of the wilderness area of South West Tasmania. We have been very critical of the time which this Government has taken to declare in full the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. But we do not have any quarrels in principle with the Government over its expressed intentions in relation to the Barrier Reef. The Barrier Reef is one of Australia's greatest natural assets. It is on the World Heritage List. It has enormous potential not only in terms of its intrinsic natural beauty but also in terms of its potential as a resource for Australia. The Australian Labor Party is very anxious to see much greater progress in the declaration of the full marine park. However, we are more currently concerned about the Government' s apparent reluctance, for what I can only assume to be rather sordid political reasons, to adopt the same attitude towards the South West region of Tasmania as has essentially been adopted by the Commonwealth Government towards the Great Barrier Reef. That, of course, involved the question of whether the Government is prepared to have some disagreements with State governments in relation to matters which involve the national heritage of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think in a sense the Fraser Government has shown courage in some respects-for example, in respect of Fraser Island-in determining a stance on an important environmental issue contrary to the wishes of a particular State government. We argue that the obligations of the Federal Government in relation to South West Tasmania and the proposed dam on the Franklin River are obligations which a national government should assume for very good reasons. Essentially, those reasons spring from the unique nature of the region and the anticipated inclusion of that region on the World Heritage List-a listing which the present Government supports, the Opposition supports and, I am certain, the Australian Democrats support. The Opposition thought that certain consequences and obligations would flow from that expressed intention in relation to South West Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> In a sense, this is an important political debate which should be joined not only by people on the mainland of Australia but also by more people in Tasmania. The position of the Tasmanian Government is that it is exclusively for the Tasmanian Government and the Tasmanian people to determine the issue. Of course, I fully understand that position. Tasmanians should not normally be told what they should do in respect of their future plans for the development or otherwise of their State. But unfortunately there are far more important issues involved in this question than that. </PARA>
<PARA> What the current government of Tasmania is in fact saying is that it recognises that there is an enormous economic problem in this State. I am glad that it recognises that there is a problem. I am not sure it realises the full extent of it. It is an enormous economic problem, a problem which involves very high levels of unemployment in Tasmania and, in a sense, the daming of the Franklin River has become perhaps a symbolic solution for Tasmanians to that problem of unemployment. Because the problem of unemployment is so great, the issues relating to the environmental value of the area have been overlooked except by the Tasmanian Government Tourist Bureau. It still advertises in its office windows in Collins Street, Melbourne, 'Come to Tasmania, Australia's last wild region'. The Tasmanian Government is quite prepared to make a quid out of mainland tourists while it can by attracting them to South West Tasmania, and 27 per cent of its tourists go to the South West area. </PARA>

The fact of the matter is that there is declining demand for energy in Tasmania. If it is seriously believed that in Tasmania in the 1990s there will be a rush of blood to the head and industry to Tasmania which will be consuming high quantities of energy and that the employment problem in that State will then be solved as a result of that process, I want very seriously to challenge that assumption. If we look at what is happening in manufacturing industry in Australia as a whole, let alone Tasmania, we will see that over the last 15 years there has been a decline of employment in manufacturing industry from something in the order of 28 per cent to 19 per cent. Any industries that are likely to be established in Tasmania in the foreseeable or long distance future will be industries which have minor or relatively minor consumption of energy compared with those industries that are now based there, industries that are closing, such as the Tasmanian Electro-Metallurgical Co. Pty Ltd, Comalco Ltd, which is closing its smelter day by day as it closes down the pot line, Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd, and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to join in the debate this evening but the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) makes my entry into this debate mandatory. He, as Leader of the Opposition, was talking about a matter of great importance and great significance to my State and, indeed, to the nation. I do not take the view that the question of South West Tasmania is one for the State of Tasmania only. I believe that it is a very important question indeed. I agree with Senator Button that consideration of these matters ought to take place in an environment free from political point scoring. Yet what have we had over the past 20 minutes? We have had a political point scoring speech. I do not know whether Senator Button was point scoring against the Gray Government or the Wriedt Opposition but they both copped it and everybody in Tasmania copped it. I believe it is for me to stand up and defend some of the people who have been under attack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Persons such as Senator Button cannot have it both ways. He, the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and some members of the Liberal Party supported the establishment of a select committee to inquire into the South West . The Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania is in fact undertaking that inquiry. I did not support the establishment of that select committee because I was under the impression, having studied the documentation, that the various inquiries that had been undertaken had established certain incontrovertible facts. Of course, there have been changes in the economy since then and those changes have affected some estimates of the amount of power that will be required within the foreseeable future. But surely the responsibility is on the people of Tasmania to find the power that is required for the industries which employ the bulk of labour in the State of Tasmania? For anybody such as Senator Button to try to enact a reverse onus of proof angle is totally unfair. The onus of proof is well and truly on the likes of Senator Button and those who take a head in the sand approach to employment in Tasmania to say how the power will be generated for the industries that now employ the bulk of people in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not leave aside the environmental question. It is a very important question to which I have certainly addressed my mind over a period and been concerned about. Again, how is that environmental question to be solved? Is it suggested by Senator Button, the ALP, the Democrats and some of the Liberals who are a bit queasy about this matter that Tasmanians do not care for their environment? If that is the accusation, I hurl it back into their teeth. The fact is that Tasmanians, particularly those who are involved in the South West, are very concerned about the environment. Senator Button had one of his facts correct. According to Tasmanian Government Tourist Bureau figures, 27 per cent of tourists go to the South West. Where do they go? Twenty-seven per cent of them do not raft down the Franklin River. The 27 per cent go to the hydro development in Strathgordon. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Button is suggesting that the new road that is being mooted for South West Tasmania will bring another 27 per cent of tourists to the South West , I do not necessarily go along with that. I am concerned about the environment also. But if figures are to be bandied about like that, let us analyse them and see where those 27 per cent of tourists go. I imagine that the majority of them go to see the enlarged Lake Pedder. When we are considering job opportunities, tourism and the like we have to ask ourselves whether those 27 per cent of tourists would go to Lake Pedder if Lake Pedder were as it was 10 years ago. I saw Lake Pedder as it was at that time. It was a marvel. It is a marvel now. It has been opened up to a much larger group of people for their enjoyment. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the nomination of the South West to the World Heritage List, I wonder whether the Opposition and Senator Button-I am sorry he is not here- will support Senator Mason's World Heritage (Properties Protection) Bill. I say this because I know that Senator Mason will speak after me. If they do, they had better look at what other forms of heritage will be trampled on if that sort of legislation is supported. </PARA>
<PARA> Central to a consideration of these issues is the responsibility of the democratic processes to determine what the current generation wants to be done with a particular area, let alone what a future generation wants done with it. Of course, it is important to know what the current generation wants and to decide what is best for and what can be preserved for future generations. But that must be done by people who are answerable to the people of Australia, not by some sub-committee of a committee of the United Nations with residency in Paris. That is ludicrous. But that is where the Opposition is heading with regard to questions of world heritage if it supports the Bill being brought forward by Senator Mason. I have considerable reservations about this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Button did not mention is probably more important than the mistakes he made. He did not mention the referendum that was held in our island. He did not mention the subsequent election that was held in our island. He did not mention that, living in our island with completely clean air, we as members of that community are not prepared to forego our hydroelectric scheme for a coal-fired one. This is what is being put to us by mainland conservationists. It is being put to us by conservationists on our island that we should go for a coal-fired power scheme in the Fingal Valley. Anyone who suggests that should not go to the Fingal Valley. The Fingal Valley people feel very sensitive about anyone from the mainland, where the air is very polluted, coming and telling them that they should put up with the same pollution that mainland people put up with just because mainland people say that we should place nearly a quarter of our island on the World Heritage List; that we should ensure that a quarter of our island is not touched and that no one will enter that area except those who are fit enough and young enough to go in on foot. It is an absolutely ludicrous suggestion. I believe, as opposed to Senator Harradine's statement, that this is a State issue. What we do with a quarter of our State has nothing to do with the mainland constitutional situation. People have likened this area to the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is not part of the Queensland mainland as is this quarter of our State which it is suggested should be handed over to Commonwealth domination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the referendum, it was the Labor Party Government which set the terms for the referendum. The Liberal Party wanted a no-dam question asked in that referendum. A no-dam question was not asked. I believe it should have been asked. The publicity given to the no-dam question was great. It was given publicity on the Australian Broadcasting Commission every night and on every station. Indeed, Bob Brown received more coverage on which section of the river to dam than the Liberal Party and the Labor Party put together received. The result of the referendum was a good result. There was a considerable no-dam vote , but it was nowhere near enough for a decision to be made in that regard. Sixty -four per cent of voters voted for a dam. A percentage voted for the Gordon- below-Franklin scheme and they carried the day. I remind the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats that we live in a democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Following that referendum an election was held in Tasmania. Not one no-dam candidate won anywhere near the required number of votes to gain a seat. The conservationists stood candidates in every electorate yet not one got up. Surely the claim by the conservationists that the dams were not an issue is a ludicrous claim. If candidates stood in every electorate how could it possibly not be an issue at that election? As I said, not one candidate got up. Consequently the State voted as we believe it should have-that the State Government should have the power to go ahead with the dam. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as I am aware the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has reiterated time and again that this is a State issue. Last time I spoke to the Prime Minister, a fortnight ago-indeed, after the answer by Mr McVeigh to a question from Mr Groom-the Prime Minister reiterated, as I have said before, that it is a State issue. That is where the situation lies at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button spoke in his usual way about a Labor Party plan. Let us have a look at the power needs of the State at the moment. The Labor Party says that at the moment Tasmania does not need a dam so do not build one. That is good farsighted planning. It is typical of the Opposition's normal planning. But we do not consider that sort of planning. The Government of Tasmania is planning for an economic upturn, not the economic downturn that the Federal Opposition, at least, is trying to persuade the Premier will occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not keep the Committee any longer. I believe that people who live outside Tasmania who want to enter this debate should realise that their State would object very strongly if the Federal Government told them what to do with a quarter of their State. This is the situation that has arisen in Tasmania. Tasmanians disagree entirely with the Federal Government having any say over what should happen to a quarter of their island. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate briefly to comment on a few points made by Tasmanian senators in this place. I say at the outset that I respect their points of view. I believe that Tasmania ought to run its own affairs. But I think that Tasmania ought to run its own affairs with reasonable consideration to the fact that they are Australians as well as being Tasmanians. I think that is all anybody asks in this matter. Senator Harradine and others raised the point that I, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, introduced the World Heritage (Properties Protection) Bill 1982. I make the point that that Bill merely seeks to put into legislation the undertakings we gave when we entered the International Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage-the World Heritage Convention. When we entered the World Heritage Convention, presumably we did so for a reason or were we just playing games? Do we say that it is all very well for the rest of the world to converve great treasures of the human race so that we can go as tourists and see them but when we have to do it the boot is on the other foot? It appears that when the chips are down we are not prepared to do it. That is what the people of Tasmania are saying now. That is what Tasmanian senators in this place are saying now. They are saying that it is all very well to have human rights conventions and heritage conventions until they are affected. When they are affected they say they propose to tear those conventions up regardless of the opinions of other people of this nation. I hope that we are one nation and that this is something that can be approached in a way which shows us to be one nation and not a discreditable ragtag of small groups, an attitude which has done us considerable harm in many areas in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I and the Australian Democrats want to see this matter proceed on a basis of proper consultation between the governments concerned. We hope to see a reasonable, cool assessment of what is needed and what is required and, particularly, a reasonable assessment of what the Tasmanian Government and the Tasmanian people need and could properly ask for to see that the Gordon-below- Franklin scheme does not proceed and that alternatives for it which already have been canvassed-if, indeed, they were necessary and that I dispute-should be costed and provided in a dispassionate way. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, perhaps, one new thought that I want to contribute to this debate at this time. A great deal of heat is being put into this debate by the fact that, rather perversely, the Hydro-Electric Commission, on instructions from the Tasmanian Liberal Government, is pressing ahead with work in South West Tasmania . It is doing that at a time when it knows it is controversial. It is a deliberate, perverse attempt to provoke other people in Australia who may wish to see South West Tasmania preserved. I appeal at this stage to the Tasmanian Government to please stop that work now. That is a reasonable point of view. This is an issue of great controversy in the community. Why should we not have a cooling-off period? Why should we not have a few months or a year in which to cool off? What difference will it make in the long term whether that is done or not? I will tell the Senate what difference it might make. If we do take that break of a year all of us may avoid making a terrible mistake for political and other reasons. If it is shown at the end of that year that the scheme should proceed, that it is justifiable, then let it proceed at that stage. All I am saying is that in the meantime there should be a halt to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The point has been made that the economics are very suspect. The bill will be as high as $1 billion for under 200 megawatts of power. That is something like $ 5m to $6m for a generated megawatt. That is enormously expensive. In the United States solar technolgy is only slightly above that figure. The economies of scale will take it below that figure almost certainly within the next decade. I have had undertakings from people in the United States who know better than I that it will be cheaper and while this dam is being built it will be overtaken by events. We live in a world in which technology in the use of metal is changing. Ceramics and plastics will play an enormous part in the world of the future. The aluminium downturn is not a temporary thing. It is something that will continue. I have checked with the Mitsui company in Tokyo. Representatives of the company have said that within 10 years-it is about the time that this new Gordon-below-Franklin dam will come on stream-they expect to have perfected a process for smelting aluminium in a blast furnace which will use something like 10 per cent to 11 per cent of the power that the present electrolytic system uses. Why should the Government of Tasmania go ahead with this scheme knowing that other methods are being developed? Does it not know about anything going on outside of Tasmania? It would not be a bad idea to see what is going on. This matter has become heated politically and has become a political football. It is a tragedy, because a lot of the ideas we discuss in this place are ephemeral and a lot of them have been created by politicians. This is not one of them. This is an issue of great basic importance. We are discussing something which we cannot correct. If we make this mistake, if we destroy the valuable assets in South West Tasmania, nothing can put them together again. Because of that literally millions of Australians are interested in it. Some weeks ago I walked in a procession in Sydney in the most appalling weather, in rain and wind. Ten thousand people took part. That is not an inconsiderable expression of opinion. I do not think any of those people wanted to 'heavy' the Tasmanian Government or the Tasmanian people. They merely wanted to show Tasmanians that a huge number of people felt strongly about something in Tasmania which is unique and beautiful. I would have thought that Tasmanians would appreciate that their island was thought of by other people as something of great value to society. It seems to me that we do not have that point of view at all. Recent polls have shown that the majority of people in Tasmania do not want the dam. But the politicians in Canberra including, with all respect, some of my colleagues in this place, do not seem to see any of that beauty themselves. To me, that is the greatest tragedy of all. Some people who live in that place do not seem to appreciate this, or if they do, they seem not to want to take any kind of step to protect it. </PARA>

I know that we have some coal. I am not talking about a scheme which would run for a few years only, but something that will last for 50 to 60 years. That is the life of a dam. I doubt that there is enough coal easily obtainable in Tasmania to run a station for that length of time. We could talk about a cable from the mainland to Tasmania. It would have to be twice as long as anything that has been built in the world. It would have to be built in situ.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least I am not a lawyer. The problems regarding effluents and pollutants from a smelting process, which would admittedly use less power, would be such that we would not want that process in Tasmania. We certainly do not want the pollution that we would get from a coal fired station, irrespective of whether we could get the coal in Tasmania. I agree with Senator Harradine. He said that most of the people in the Government Tourist Bureau figures who go down to the South West use the Hydro-Electric Commission road. They go down the Strathgordon road to the new Lake Pedder. This is a very interesting place to see. I hope that all honourable senators at one stage or another get a chance to see it. As time goes by, and as this other dam is built, I believe more people will be able to go down into that area and see things that they would not otherwise be able to see. If the roads are properly constructed they will help tourism in that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning, I am a little of two minds about this matter. I hoped that the area would not need to be dammed and that it could be left in its natural state. If at some stage we are going to need additional power, as I believe we are, I would prefer a hydro scheme to any of the alternatives I have mentioned. I have spoken to many people about this matter. I have spoken to some of the conservation groups and individuals in Tasmania and other places. I believe they are very genuine. The people who have written to me have been quite numerous. I have had more letters on this matter than on anything else from any people, except the Right to Life Association. The people are genuine. Nearly all the letters I have received are hand written and are of a reasonable length. They show a deal of concern. I thank the people for sending me those letters. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this issue was very much decided at the last State election. Perhaps Senator Button was right when he said earlier that the people of Tasmania voted the way they did because they saw the establishment of a dam in southern Tasmania as a means of obtaining a job or helping to keep jobs in that State. I believe that is true. The State Parliament now has the right to make its own decision. I think it would be an impertinence for honourable senators and members of parliament from other States to try to tell the State Government of Tasmania what it should do. I for one will not help them do that. If it is found that I have to come to odds with the Federal Government because of some statement of which I have no knowledge at the moment but which could be made in the future, saying that the Federal Government will interfere, I can assure honourable senators that I will put my State ahead of any allegiance that I have to any party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator would let me make my remarks he will find out. That is why I am standing in the chamber at the moment. Senator Harradine said that industrial users in Tasmania, dependent as they are on hydroelectric power, employ the great bulk of the Tasmanian work force. I understand that to have been his statement. That is incorrect. The fact is that the bulk of the Tasmanian work force is not employed in the mining or timber using industries which provide manufacturing employment. In fact, manufacturing employment declined from 36,000 in 1968 to some 26,000 in 1980. The 18 bulk consumers employ about only 7 per cent of the work force. I emphasise that the employment fears which are generated in the Tasmanian community really have to be addressed by any of the national parliament in an attempt to come to some sensible assessment of the conflicting claims made about South West Tasmania. I believe we have to be very careful in the sorts of claims we make about users of electricity in the manufacturing sector in Tasmania being great employers of the Tasmanian people. They are not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Intemperate remarks were made by Senator Mason. He stated that the Tasmanian Government was pressing ahead with developments in South West Tasmania as part of a deliberate and perverse policy to provoke movements on the mainland in favour of the conservation of the area. The Tasmanian Government is acting in accordance with legislation passed by the Tasmanian Parliament. I believe the Tasmanian Parliament was constituted after an election in which the issues were such that one could say that the Parliament was constituted by a majority of pesons who favoured the construction of the dam. To that extent the Tasmanian Government is quite properly carrying out the wishes of the Tasmanian people. The question is whether that is a sufficient perspective to bring to bear on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I think even Senator Townley would concede that we must look to the future and try to make some projections about the type of power, the scope and the necessary increase in the availability of power that Tasmania might need in order to secure the economic future of Tasmanians, and when it will be needed. I entirely agree with Senator Townley. This has to be understood by people on the mainland. If further power is required to be generated for the future of the Tasmanian economy and those dependent on it, then it has to be hydro power because no solution will be acceptable within the Tasmanian community unless it deals with the very real fears of those involved in the Hydro-Electric Commission as engineers or as part of the construction work force or in the industries and towns which are dependent on hydroelectric activity. For that reason I think it will be extremely important that as we search for an economically viable alternative project to that put forward in relation to the Lower Gordon scheme, we look for a project which employs the skills and the work force which can be assembled by the Hydro-Electric Commission. Therefore, I warn people on the mainland that they ought to put out of consideration altogether any thought of a thermal power station being acceptable to Tasmanians. If we are to seek, as responsibly we must, an alternative to the present scheme, it must be a project which employs those skills. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be, for example, that the Arthur River project in north-west Tasmania could be such a project. It would provide 80 megawatts of power and would employ those skills and a considerable work force. It would have spin-off effects in the economy of Braddon electorate on the north-west coast of Tasmania, which would be extremely important as employment opportunities in that area become more depressed day by day. At the same time, it would relieve the stress on the environment of South West Tasmania which is of concern to others in the community. In other words, if we are to have a sensible, moderate discussion I believe that it should proceed, and would proceed, to a much better degree in the light of the report of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania which will be with us shortly. It should take into account the very real considerations which I have put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is also that there needs to be a realisation that the present Fraser Federal Liberal Government has taken such steps that it is incumbent upon it to indicate what the consequences of the steps it has initiated are in relation to Tasmania. It is the present Fraser Liberal Government which has pressed for the listing of South West Tasmania on the World Heritage List. The nomination has gone forward. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has refused to withdraw that nomination. The consequence of that identification and listing is that there is an obligation on the national Government of Australia, whether it be Liberal or Labor, to do what is within its power to preserve that area listed on the World Heritage List. </PARA>
<PARA> That step having been taken by the Fraser Liberal Government, the Labor Party has only been acting responsibly and honestly in relation to the Tasmanian people in saying that as a consequence of that it will explore with the Tasmanian Government alternative economically viable power generation projects with the aim of their funding on terms comparable to those which would have applied for the proposed South West Tasmanian power generation development project. It is incumbent on a national Government, whether Labor or Liberal, to indicate clearly to the Tasmanian people that if an alternative hydroelectric scheme is to be developed-I say if power is to be provided it must be a hydro scheme-it must be provided on such terms that the Tasmanian consumer of electricity will not bear a greater burden in loan repayments than that consumer would bear if the Gordon-below-Franklin scheme were to go ahead. That is the absolute minimum basis for any responsible national Government to take to this question. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is quite true that one would need a further contextual package of proposals in order to ensure that Tasmania's regional economic and industrial development is enhanced considerably. That requires perhaps a general approach and also a more particular one. The general approach would be to ensure that total Federal payments to Tasmania do not fall in real terms because at the moment the real threat to the employment of Tasmanians lies in the decision of the Grants Commission, to be implemented over time by the national Government, which will see a diminution in the percentage of revenues available to Tasmania and corresponding increase in the revenues available to New South Wales and Victoria. That is where the real danger to the future employment of Tasmanians lies. </PARA>

<PARA> Ensure that total Federal payments to Tasmania do not fall in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Parliamentary Labor Party is committed to maintaining those real payments to Tasmania from the Federal Treasury. The surrounding context for the maintenance of employment within the Tasmanian economy is the crucial key. On the more particular aspect it will be incumbent on the national Government to encourage the Tasmanian Government in co-operation with the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, to establish a South West Tasmanian management authority that will be responsible for managing the area in a way which creates employment opportunities and enables Tasmanians and Australians to move into that area for the recreational and other attractions it has. This is where the Labor Party will not be supporting in its present form the Australian Democrats' Bill concerning the World Heritage List areas. It is too extreme and seems to place any area on that list, whether it be the Great Barrier Reef, the Kakadu National Park or South West Tasmania, outside the scope of human activity altogether. We would see a very real place for a co-operative management authority, as is the case with the Great Barrier Reef and the Kakadu National Park, which would have a capacity to create a situation within which tourist accommodation could be built and other steps taken in order to assist, particularly on the west coast of Tasmania, in developments which would create employment through the spin-off effects of tourist activity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be very remiss of me, as a Tasmanian senator, not to participate in this debate because the implications of the listing of South West Tasmania on the World Heritage List could be very serious within Tasmania. It is unfortunate that this issue of listing and the problems associated with the locations of the dams and the generation of electricity in the South West wilderness area have been so divisive in our society, not only in Tasmania but throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When this issue was first raised in the very early days of the formulation of a plan to provide sufficient power for Tasmania's industries, I could see some benefits in distributing the available limited sources of finance as widely as possible. I am on the record as having said in those days that I could see some benefits in some small dams. In politics one puts forward a view but it is not always accepted. The Tasmanian Government has made a decision. It held a referendum on the issue. It is continuing to pursue a major project. I fully support what Mr Gray and his Government are trying to do. It would be tragic for Tasmania, from an economic point of view, if the project were not to go ahead. Tasmania has the highest unemployment in Australia. The Opposition is trying to pull the rug out economically from under a State which is finding it difficult to provide adequate jobs for so many young people. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people lose sight of the economic plight and difficulties facing many Tasmanian families. We all know of the major exodus of young people to the mainland. I think this is a tragedy. We have to try to find jobs for these young people in Tasmania. It has been reported that in the next few years we will have to find an additional 30,000 jobs. One of the problems in the past has been that so many industries have not been able to get a block of power at a reasonable price from the Hydro-Electric Commission of Tasmania. Consequently, many decisions have been made not to extend Tasmanian operations. In other words, the development has taken place on the mainland and not in Tasmania. Mr Gray and his Government are seeking to reverse that situation. Many people are trying to stop that development. If they do so it will adversely affect Tasmania's economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already heard many comments that Tasmania is getting more than its fair share. Whilst some people say that Tasmania should be compensated if these plans do not go ahead, the compensation might be held in good faith for a few years but, in the long term, can we be assured that it would continue? I believe we have to follow the path which will lead to something constructive, so that we can offer power with some assurance that it will be available for those industries that wish to come to Tasmania and for those that wish to expand. Hydroelectric power is non-polluting. Some of the options that have been put up by some of its opponents are quite frightening. They have suggested bringing coal from the mainland, with all the attendant problems of maritime strikes, and sighting a thermal station in the Tamar Valley. The Tamar Valley is well known for its problems of fog. What would we have then? We would have smog in that area. Many of these people call themselves conservationists. We are trying to keep our State beautiful. One way to do that is to have a non-pollutant source of hydro-electric power. We should be aiming to try to harmonise this scheme as well as we possibly can with the whole landscape. </PARA>
<PARA> One conservationist put a very constructive suggestion to me. He suggested that the road system should follow the valley which will subsequently be flooded and, in that event, when the scheme is completed there would not be a scar on the landscape. In future the station would be serviced by barge or motor boat. I think this is a manner in which the conservationists could play a very constructive role in harmonising the site of the power scheme with nature. I believe that the scheme will actually increase the percentage of tourists going to Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the unfortunate features of this whole debate is that there has not been a great deal of accuracy in the reporting of the extent to which damage will be caused to the South West of Tasmania. As has been pointed out, the claims have been extravagant. I think this is one of the unfortunate features. If this debate does anything, I hope it will bring a greater degree of honesty to all those people participating to make sure that the facts are accurate. I appeal to everybody to try to harmonise the scheme which is now well under way rather than fight a sabotage or rearguard action which will have detrimental effects on the people of Tasmania and their employment opportunities. I think at this time when we are trying to create jobs-we had a debate on that issue this afternoon-it is important that we go ahead and create jobs for Tasmanians who want to live in Tasmania. </PARA>

Once these decisions have been taken through the normal democratic process they should say: 'Well, if there is another avenue, this is that other avenue and it will be cheaper, more convenient and more effective than the one that is proposed'. They should then outline clearly how that is to be done.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two matters I wanted to raise briefly relate to reports to Parliament and to the Hansards for Estimates committee reports. In Estimates Committee B a great deal of information was sought and was obtained from all the departments relative to reports. The information sought related to time that was taken, both for reports for 1981-82 and 1980-81, for approval of form of accounts from the Minister for Finance, time that was taken for approval of accounts by the Auditor-General, time that was taken by the printer, and then dates on which the report was given to a Minister and tabled in Parliament. I thank the departments for the full information provided on these matters, but I want to comment briefly because the timing of tabling of reports has been a matter of concern to the Senate for some time. However, I believe that it has a particular relevance to Estimates committees and it would be useful to have a number of these reports before Estimates committees commence their deliberations . One reason that it would be useful is that it would save a great deal of time in Estimates committees if senators had received the reports and could read certain matters relating to the departments' activities, the statutory authorities' activities and other bodies' activities for the previous year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make a couple of points. In the information that has been provided, very clearly, different departments and authorities have different ideas of when it would be desirable for reports to be tabled in Parliament. For example, Telecom Australia, in the summary that it provided, shows that it expects that its reports would be tabled in October or November, whereas the schedule provided by the Australian Broadcasting Commission shows that it would be possible, adhering to the schedule set for this year, for a report to be tabled in September. As I have gone through all these summaries of the reports it has seemed to me that there is very rarely a case for reports to be quite as late as they are. It seems that some departments and authorities have the idea that so long as the report for, say, the 1981-82 financial year is tabled before Parliament rises at the end of November, they have met the necessary objective. That is certainly preferable to tabling it much later, but I think that it would be more useful to the Parliament if we had them a little earlier. In the past the issue of interim reports has been raised with the purpose that reports should not be delayed in their tabling in Parliament just pending the Auditor- General's final certificate. Not very many departments or authorities do this. I should like to say again that I think that the Senate should press the issue that there are more reports that could be tabled in this manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make about this is that there seem to be some extraordinary discrepancies in the time various reports take to be printed. I give as an instance the Cocos (Keeling) Island report for 1980-81. It was submitted to the printer on 7 August 1981 and received back from the printer on 10 December 1981. That is more than three months for printing, and it meant that the report was not tabled in Parliament until February 1982. A report which I believe would be comparable, the Norfolk Island report, was submitted to the printer on 30 September 1981 and received back from the printer on 13 October 1981-only two weeks later-and consequently was able to be tabled in Parliament by 22 October 1981, which is a far handier tabling time. </PARA>
<PARA> As I went through these summaries it appeared that the average length of time for receiving reports from the printer was about a month but that the variation could be as wide as from two weeks to three months. There is, unfortunately, no indication of where these reports were printed, or whether any priority on an early delivery of a report was placed. But if it is that certain printers-I am not sure how many reports the Government Printer prints-are faster than others, that would be interesting, although I think that it is not feasible to get all that information back. What could be done is that this matter might be drawn to the attention of those responsible for the printing of reports to indicate that a speedy return of reports is something that Parliament would appreciate and that it would serve some useful purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The other item that I wanted to raise-and it is raised in the report of Estimates Committee B-was the delay this year in senators receiving copies of Estimates committees Hansards. Estimates Committee B met on four occasions, and I was not aware of the delay that now happens with Estimates committees Hansards so I did not keep a note of how much later the report arrived after the first meeting of the Committee, which was on, I think, either 6 or 7 September. The Hansard for the Estimates Committee B meeting of 13 September was not received until 21 September, eight days later. The Hansard for the hearing on 14 September was not received until 22 September, again a delay of eight days. I did not receive my copy of the Hansard for the hearing of 16 September until 12 October. Part of the reason for that long interval was the fact that the Senate had been in recess for two weeks. My receiving it was delayed by two weeks. Nevertheless, there was still a substantial delay between 16 September and the date on which the Senate adjourned for that two-week recess. </PARA>
<PARA> That four-week delay and the other lengthy delays had two effects. One was that neither I nor the other members of the Committee could check, first, whether the Hansard was accurate, and secondly, just what items were raised. There were items about which I wanted further information. The third effect was that departments did not have the Hansard record available to them so they were delayed in getting information to the Committee. Estimates Committee B was in the position that by the time it was required to report to the Senate in September it did not have available to it the Hansard for its hearing of 16 September. Items were raised at that meeting which I, for one, would have liked included in the report. I think they should have gone into the report. I made some unofficial inquiries as to the reasons for the delays in Senate Estimates Committee Hansards. I was told that it was at least partly attributable to the fact that the Government Printing Office has changed its method of printing. A report was tabled in this Parliament, I think two or three weeks ago, relating to changes in the Government Printing Office. Some rather bland assurances were contained in the report that the changes would not upset the printing system. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like whoever is responsible for this matter-I suspect that it is Mr President rather than a Minister-to investigate the delays in the publishing of Hansard for Senate Estimates committees and to find out whether we can get them with the promptness that we used to. Admittedly, they never came out quite as promptly as the daily Hansards but they were not far behind. Two days was the most we ever had to wait, so far as I can remember. I believe this delay has been a disadvantage to members of Estimates committees because proper follow- through action on issues they raised could not take place. The fact that the Hansards have not been available has disadvantaged not only members of the committees but also the departments which need to have the Hansards available to them to find out the precise nature of questions raised by senators in response to which they were required to provide further information. It is only in the last few days that the last lot of answers to questions raised in Estimates Committee B hearings were made available to members of that Committee and tabled in the Senate. I believe that has had a very deleterious effect on the operations of certain Estimates committees. I certainly claim that this is so in relation to Estimates Committee B. Since Estimates committees are an important function of the Senate, I believe this is a matter of some urgency. It should be given prompt attention and this place should be given a reply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I want to do so in the context of some comments made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Peacock) on 28 April 1981 regarding the operation of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I do so in the spirit of trying to elicit whether any major changes have been made to the system of operation of the Department since Mr Peacock made that speech and, if no changes have been made, to inquire whether the system is operating in the same way now and whether the Minister in charge of this debate, the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), agrees with the comments made by Mr Peacock on that date. I refer the Committee to the Hansard of 28 April last year. Mr Peacock, who had formerly been Minister for Industrial Relations, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over recent months I have concluded that the Prime Minister is fracturing Cabinet government and the parliamentary system as we know it. Our system of government will operate only if there is a responsble relationship between the Cabinet and the Parliament. Our present system has deteriorated because that relationship has foundered. It has foundered because the Prime Minister increasingly centralised power around himself. Any erosion of the Cabinet system goes to the heart of the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to that passage of the Minister's speech because it is always a matter of concern here when we discuss, as we sometimes do, the role of the Senate in acting as some check on the Executive Government of the day. It is possible that what was said by the former Minister for Industrial Relations, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, was in some respects incorrect. What I am more concerned to find out is whether there have been any changes in some of the processes which were described on that day by the Minister. At page 1609 of the Hansard, of the same date, Mr Peacock said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's role in having decisions reversed in the absence of the responsible Minister is totally contrary to the principles of Cabinet government . It is inexplicable, save by reference to the Prime Minister's obstinate determination to get his own way although undermining the authority of a senior Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> On the day I resigned I said the Prime Minister had by-passed the system of Government. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to make some comments about the structure of so-called Cabinet government evolved by the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He referred to the formation of various formal committees and the existence of a powerful new element, the Co-ordination Committee. He referred to the desirability of a Prime Minister consulting with Cabinet, particularly with the Cabinet Ministers directly concerned. At page 1610, in describing the system which operates in the Government according to Mr Peacock, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> This is not just a kitchen Cabinet; it is a formal structure crushing the Cabinet system. Added to this, individual Ministers are lobbied by the Prime Minister. That is a principle of proper Cabinet government that should not happen. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on at the same page, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Liberalism distrusts concentration of power . . . Therefore, the ever increasing centralisation of power is striking at the heart and core of liberalism . . . I believe the growth of centralised power within our Government today is restricting effective formulation of policies required by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we in the Opposition frequently are accused of being critical about these matters when we say that a very grave restriction has been imposed on the effective formulation of policies required by Australia; in fact there has been the absence of formulation of policies required by Australia. If we spend a lot of time debating those issues in the Senate then maybe we are wasting our time if the allegations made by Mr Peacock regarding the operation of the Cabinet system in Australia are correct. It is for that reason I want to pursue this matter. It would be wrong for the Senate to continue to debate policies if the entire fault can be corrected by alterations to the way in which the Cabinet system operates under the present Prime Minister and by alterations to some of the committee systems which the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Peacock,-I must add he is my own member of Parliament-has raised from time to time. In considering the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, I would merely ask whether any significant changes have been made to the operation of the Cabinet system, whether the Government or Ministers in the Government are still of the view that liberalism distrusts concentration of power, whether, in fact, under this Government there has been a centralisation of power which strikes at the core of liberalism and whether the consequence of that is restricting effective formulation of policies required by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps it might be said that these questions are not relevant to the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Of course, they are relevant in the sense that the Prime Minister has a well known penchant for hiring consultants. In his own office he has a significantly high level of staff turnover which involves costs being imposed on the Department and on the taxpayer. If the advice which the Prime Minister gets is from outside consultants who are paid high salaries and there is a high turnover of those consultants, they are matters which are of concern or should be of concern to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. More importantly, of course, it would be nice to have some statement from the Government about whether the allegations which were made in April 1981 and not, as I understand it, denied by anybody except the Prime Minister in a rather oblique sort of way, are in fact correct-that government in Australia still suffers from the great disabilities and inhibitions described by Mr Peacock at that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a couple of matters in relation to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in terms of what Senator Button was saying a moment ago. I asked at the hearings of Senate Estimates Committee C, based on the annual report of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, whether possibly a 31.9 per cent staff turnover per year was a bad thing in terms of cohesive administration. I think the general reply was along the lines that the reason for that turnover is that they like a turnover in terms of cross-fertilisation of ideas. I realise that the Government has been fairly bankrupt in ideas and that maybe some cross-fertilisation would be a good thing. But it probably also leads to the introduction of the many new schemes of the Government which are inconsistent with the previous ones. It is probably the reason why we have had six health schemes in seven years and why there is so much turnaround in government performance. Senator Button has already indicated just how important the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, with its mini-Cabinet system, is in the formulation of policy. Therefore, I think that staff turnover is not a good thing, but I will leave it at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other question I wanted to raise tonight relates to the fact that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet employs 59 consultants at an average cost of $6,500. This is the biggest growth industry in the Estimates, apart from computers. In total the Government is currently employing 2,699 consultants. The total cost of the consultants for the Government-this information has been provided by another department-works out at $52,051,213. I think we are getting to a stage at which the Government will be hiring consultants to determine which consultant it should hire. The average cost of those 2,699 consultants is $19,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some examples I should like to quote. The National Gallery has 10 consultants, at an average cost of $45,000; the Department of Social Security has seven consultants at an average cost of $35,000; the National Capital Development Commission has 314 consultants at an average cost of $27,000. We can go through every department, down to the Institute of Multicultural Affairs which has 50 consultants at an average cost of $4,000 each. I have also noticed that the Department of Aviation has eight consultants at an average cost of $88, 000. This raises the question of why the Government is hiring so many consultants when in fact it is trying to institute staff ceilings at other levels. I ask the question: Why cannot the Government use the expertise in the Public Service without constantly having to go outside the Service? I believe there is a case for occasional use of consultants, but 2,699 seems a lot. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet uses consultants in the following manner: the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, three; the Office of National Assessment, one; Commonwealth Ombudsman, nil; the Australian Science and Technology Council, five; the Advisory Council for Intergovernment Relations, four; the Auditor-General's Office, two; the Public Service Office, 45. I suppose the real question is why the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet uses so few consultants compared with other departments. Its record is not particularly bad in the use of consultants compared with, say, the Department of Transport and Construction, which uses 1,400 consultants. There are many other departments which use consultants and if honourable senators want further information on this matter they can look at the additional information provided to Estimates Committee C. I raise the question of consultants because it is a worry to those of us who served on Estimates Committee C. Every department, every section, is hiring more and more consultants at an ever increasing cost. I do not think this is a particularly good trend. I believe that the expertise could be developed in the Public Service to minimise the number of consultants being hired. I would hate to think that the staff freeze in government departments is forcing those departments to use consultants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button raised some matters relating to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. He quoted at length from a statement of a former Minister. I do not know that what was quoted was of any great relevance. The former Minister is now the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Peacock). I have no comment to make on something that Senator Button quoted from 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, Senator Button raised the matter of the staff of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. He stated that the staff of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet had increased by 79 per cent over a period of three or four years. I think the figures ought to be placed on record. If we look at the year ended 30 June 1977, the core staff of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet-this figure relates to the Department itself and not to some of the other bodies attached to it-was 473. In 1978 the figure was 456; in 1979, 448; in 1980, 442; in 1981, 441 and in 1982, 431. For 1983 the projected figure is 421. Those figures show a reduction over the period from 1977 to 1983 of about 10 per cent. I think perhaps Senator Button had some other information which was not accurate. I simply place on record those figures of the staff ceilings of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet during that period. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Robert Ray raised matters that he raised at the Estimates Committee hearings. With regard to the consultants for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, as he later commented, he was interested in the very few consultants who are engaged by that Department. But could I say that in general the consultants that are used by government for its services are sometimes required because of a need for expertise outside the Public Service. Before consultants are appointed, there is a general practice of consulting with the Public Service Board and agreement by it to such appointment. Of course, as part of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, a number of decisions were taken that may have required consultants to be appointed for particular reasons. In general the range of expertise within the Public Service is very wide indeed. But from time to time, for instance to service an inquiry or a committee, there may be a requirement for consultants to be appointed. This is done in a prescribed way which maximises the use of the expertise within the Public Service and, with the consultation that is undertaken with the Board, I think is conducted in a satisfactory manner. I have no further comment to make on matters that were raised on this Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) will recall that a number of questions were raised in Estimates Committee C about the sum of $1.5 billion that was set aside by the Government for Treasury to spend in respect of matters relevant to the 1982-83 Budget. The Committee extracted some assurances from the Minister that very close attention would be given to the way in which this money would be spent. A considerable amount of attention in the survey which was carried out was directed to obtaining a public reaction to the Budget. It would be a fair comment to say that members of the Senate Estimates Committee felt that there was a direct relationship between the survey being carried out and the premature election that was mooted at that time. One has only to recall that for the last two or three months the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has kept the Parliament and the nation on tenterhooks about an early election. In more recent times the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) has refused to confirm or deny the Government's intention to call an unnecessarily early election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned that this survey was prepared with the direct intention of obtaining voter reaction to the Budget to see whether the political climate would be favourable to the Government with a view to making a decision to call a November or December election. We were equally concerned about the unspecified nature of an allocation of $1.5m to Treasury for the purposes of publicity associated with the 1982-83 Budget. There seems to be a link between the survey funding and the $1.5m. The Committee was not given any indication of how that money was to be spent or for what purpose it was sought. Such a large sum of money was set aside without any planning or any reasons being given for that sort of vote. It is true that the Minister finally made available a statement. But it has been somewhat alarming to find that the Treasury has been rather reluctant to be caught in a party political slanging match about the $1. 5m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was finally forced to make a decision that the campaign to spend the $1.5m would proceed only after the South Australian election because it was clearly a very sensitive area. Of course, now it can be said that it is still a very sensitive area in view of the fact that in a few weeks time the people in the Federal electorate of Flinders will be called upon to record a vote in a by- election there. Clearly, the senior public servants in Treasury felt some sensitivity about this matter. That was echoed by the Estimates Committee. One would have thought we could have been provided with the program and the schedule of how such moneys would be spent. In a period when we were told that there needed to be a cut-back in public sector spending and there needed to be restraint, we were asked to give an open cheque to Treasury, about which Treasury was clearly unhappy. Press reports indicate that the Government was the body that made the decision and that the Public Service heads had serious misgivings about this sum of money being spent in this way. In other words, taxpayers' money was seen by the Treasury officials as being used for party political purposes. Indeed, that was the view of members of the Opposition on the Senate Estimates Committee. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Section 107K of the Repatriation Act defines a regular serviceman in terms as outlined by the honourable senator, but it does not follow that there is no such thing as a period of 'eligible service'. Eligibility for pension under the Repatriation Act arises under section 107M and that eligibility is only in respect of incapacity or death that has arisen out of or is attributable to defence service. Defence service is defined in section 107J as continuous full time service as a member of the Defence Force on or after 7 December 1972 and, therefore, 'eligible service', as used administratively within the Repatriation system, applies only to service on or after that date.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No, while the Repatriation boards, the Commission and the Tribunal apply the principle of 'eligible service' only in respect of a period on or after 7 December 1972, in accordance with the definition of 'defence service' in section 107J, it is only necessary that a regular serviceman with a continuous period of service of three years or more has served on or after 7 December 1972 to be eligible for consideration. There is no requirement as implied in the question that the whole qualifying period of three years of service itself be completed on or after that date.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Repatriation boards, the Commission and the Tribunal apply the above principles which, I am advised, represent the correct application of the provisions of the Act.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) and (3) In response to representations from Australian fishermen the matter of conflict between the operations of Japanese longliners and Australian prawn trawlers off the north coast of New South Wales was taken up with the Embassy of Japan in Canberra. The Embassy was advised of the nature of the problem and their co-operation was sought to ensure that Japanese longliners avoided operating in the area where the conflict was reported.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently special surveillance operations were undertaken and an official of the Department of Primary Industry travelled to the area to further investigate the extent of the problem. The matter was then raised with Japanese officials and industry representatives during the course of the recently concluded negotiations on a new 12 month tuna access Agreement to come into force from 1 November 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of these discussions the Japanese Government has now agreed to an expansion of existing full year closures off the north coast of New South Wales to avoid further conflict with local trawl and trap fishermen. The area in which further closures will apply extends from Smoky Cape to Byron Bay out to a distance generally between 20 and 30 nautical miles from the coast.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Prior to negotiations on any arrangement involving foreign commercial fishing vessels operating in the Australian fishing zone the relevant State and Territory governments as well as fishing industry representatives, are consulted . These consultations are undertaken to ensure, as far as possible, that the operations of foreign fishing vessels do not conflict or compete with those of Australian fishermen. In addition representatives of State and Territory Governments and the Australian Fishing Industry Council are invited to attend the negotiations as observers.</PARA>
<PARA> As a general rule foreign fishing vessels are prohibited from operating within 12 nautical miles of the Australian coast and are therefore not permitted to operate in Australia's three-mile territorial sea.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The following applications were received:</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland in respect of financial years 1975-76 to 1981-82. The application relating to 1981-82 was treated as withdrawn under the terms of the agreement reached at the June 1981 Premiers' Conference for providing additional grants to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland in the light of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's 'Report on State Tax Sharing Entitlements 1981'. That agreement provided that there would be no applications for special grants by any State in respect of 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania in respect of 1977-78 (later withdrawn).</PARA>
<PARA> Northern Territory (which became eligible to apply after becoming self- governing on 1 July 1978) in respect of each of the years 1979-80 to 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The amounts of special grants recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and the amounts paid by the Commonwealth are shown in the table below.</PARA>
<PARA> The figures of amounts recommended consist of the sum total of advance grants normally recommended for payment in the year to which they relate, and completion grants (either positive or negative) recommended two years later after the Commission has compared in detail the financial position in that year of the claimant State (or the Northern Territory) and standard States.</PARA>
<PARA> The payment of special grants to the Northern Territory in the first six years of operation of State-type financial arrangements (i.e. 1979-80 to 1984-85 inclusive) is governed by paragraphs 32 and 33 of the Memorandum of Understanding in respect of financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory. These paragraphs provide that the Northern Territory will receive either a special grant or an additional assistance grant whichever is the larger. The level of the additional assistance grant was $20m each year for the first three years, i.e. 1979-80 to 1981-82, decreasing by $5m annually thereafter to zero in 1985-86. In the years 1979-80 to 1981-82, additional assistance grants were payable in lieu of special grants.</PARA>

Their attempt to sell the mines in Melbourne failed and the mines were dumped in Waranga Basin. The eleven mines were recovered complete on 13 May 1978. Following the theft, an SIS investigation was conducted and as a result, Victorian State Police were notified and subsequently interviewed a civilian in relation to the theft in June 1978.

The institution applying for importation may be inspected by quarantine staff prior to approval to ensure that adequate security precautions exist and that staff are aware of virus containment procedures. Restrictions are placed upon the use of the virus depending upon its nature, and set procedures which are contingent upon a licence being granted must be observed in disposing of the virus when no longer required.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Commonwealth funding under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act is not allocated to specific ethnic or other groups as such but is available to any organisation which is approved as eligible for the purposes of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> An estimated grant of $60,500 was approved in principle, under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act, in the 1980-81 year for an Aboriginal organisation in Western Australia to assist with the cost of constructing five self-contained units at Strelley Station. This project has not yet proceeded.

<PARA> In 1979, a firm of design and image consultants was engaged specifically for the purpose of designing a logo. This work was related to the National Energy Conservation Program, which has as its major objective the encouragement of energy conservation within the community. The development of a program identity was an integral but very minor part of the implementation of the Program. The design consultancy of Morris Slazenger Graphic Concept was engaged to develop the program logo and fees totalling $2,500 were paid for this.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 September 1981 (Hansard, page 721) Senator Martyr asked the Attorney-General the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Attorney-General. It is in four parts. Firstly, is it correct that the Australian Capital Territory Ordinance relating to the registration of births and deaths does not concern itself with the birth or death of children of less than 20 weeks gestation or weighing less than 400 grams? Secondly, is it correct that children of less than 20 weeks gestation are capable of being born alive? If delivered alive, is there any legal obligation placed on medical staff in the Australian Capital Territory to attempt to maintain and save the lives of such children? Thirdly, does the Australian Capital Territory have any Ordinance similar in purpose and effect to the Infant Life Preservation Act of the United Kingdom? Finally, does the Australian Capital Territory Transplantation and Anatomy Ordinance 1978 exclude from its control human ova, human embryos, human foetuses and tissue or organs obtained from them? Is there any Australian Capital Territory Ordinance or law which exercises control over such material?</PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question, divided into its constituent parts:</PARA>
<PARA> Part 1-Section 5 of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages Ordinance 1963 defines a child to include a child not born alive, being a child-if the period of gestation is reliably ascertainable-of not less than 22 weeks gestation or, in any other case weighing not less than 500 grammes at birth. All provisions in the Ordinance concerning the birth and death of children are limited by this definition.</PARA>
<PARA> Part 2 (a)-Foetuses of less than 20 weeks gestation can be born alive but they do not survive. The shortest known gestation period for a baby which has survived is 25 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> Part 2 (b)-There may well be a legal obligation on medical staff in the ACT to undertake reasonable efforts to maintain and save them as living beings. The extent of the obligation would depend upon the current state of medical knowledge and the medical facilities available. The obligation may arise otherwise than under statute. It is not my function to give legal advice to private individuals, or private Senators and Members, and for that reason I decline to answer this question more specifically.</PARA>
<PARA> Part 3-There is no Australian Capital Territory legislation in terms similar to the Infant Life (Preservation) Act (UK). However, section 82 and 83 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in its application to the Australian Capital Territory make it a felony, punishable by penal servitude for ten years, to unlawfully procure a miscarriage.</PARA>
<PARA> Part 4 (a)-The Ordinance excludes tissue which is foetal tissue, spermatozoa or ova only from the provisions of Part II of the Ordinance. That Part regulates donations of tissue by living persons. The remaining provisions of the Ordinance apply to all material within the definition of 'tissue', which is defined in section 4 of the Ordinance as including 'an organ, or part, of a human body or a substance extracted from, or from a part of, the human body'.</PARA>
<PARA> Part 4 (b)-Human ova, human embryos, human foetuses and tissue or organs obtained from them would fall within the definition of 'tissue' in the Transplantation and Anatomy Ordinance 1978. Other laws of the Australian Capital Territory may have application to this material, for example, as noted in the reply to question 3, there are circumstances in which some provisions of the criminal law may be applicable. There is, however, no other statute law which is expressly concerned with this material.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 May 1982 (Hansard, page 1910) Senator Childs asked me , as the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, by saying that having a telephonist with local knowledge is vital to country people when they ring their local telephone exchange in emergency and natural disaster situations. Is it a fact that the Tweed Heads telephone exchange is due to be closed on 3 November? Is this one of the 16 telephone exchanges in New South Wales due to be closed in the near future? Did the Prime Minister intervene to prevent the Hamilton exchange in his electorate in Victoria being closed? Will special consideration be given to the Tweed Heads exchange which is in the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister? Will the Minister give urgent consideration to providing special assistance to Telecom in order that 16 country exchanges in New South Wales will not be closed?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although a number of manual assistance centres will be closed over the next three years there will be no decline in service. Introduction of new equipment will mean that a call for assistance will often be handled by an operator some distance away from the areas from which the call originates, but in such cases, the operator will have access to all the information necessary to process the enquiry. Emergency 000 calls will not be handled in this way but will be directed to the nearest available manual assistance centre where operators will be able to reach the required emergency authority.</PARA>
<PARA>And more specifically,</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The answer to the first question is Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The answer to the second question is Yes. However, as a result of a Telecom review, only 14 of the previously designated 16 manual assistance centres will now be closed in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) The answer to the third question is No. What the Prime Minister did do was to pass on to the Minister for Communications the Hamilton community's concern about possible job losses and reduced services. This, together with similar expressions of concern from other areas led to Telecom being asked to re-examine its original plans. Nine additional centres will now be retained as a result of this review and the Hamilton exchange is one of these.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 September 1982 (Hansard, page 774) Senator MacGibbon asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware that the management of Telecom Australia is proposing to close the public terminal for telegram and telex services at the Brisbane General Post Office? Is the Minister aware that in the whole of Queensland this is the only public facility where a telegram or a telex can be sent 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and that this service has existed for the benefit of the people of Queensland since Federation? In view of the great importance to individuals in times of family crises and of national disasters, whose only means of communication is a public facility, will the Minister ensure that at least this one facility remains in Brisbane? Furthermore, with the Commonwealth Games imminent, will the Minister ensure that action is taken immediately to retain this facility? Will he also see that adequate ISD telephone services, which are not available at present, become available in Brisbane before the Games?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provide the following answer to the honourable senator's question based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission:</PARA>
<PARA> In an effort to reduce the loss being experienced with the public telegram service-currently about $20m annually-Telecom is conducting an on-going program of reviews aimed at ensuring that public telegram rates reflect the costs of operating the service and that these costs are kept to the minimum consistent with the maintenance of an acceptable standard of service for customers.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of this program, consideration is being given to the feasibility of centralising in a few telegraph offices the handling of after-hours telegrams currently being handled at some of the smaller 24-hour telegraph offices. Any such proposal would only change the way in which the service was provided and would have minimal effect on customer service. However, in accordance with a previous undertaking, Telecom will be discussing the outcome of this review with the Minister for Communications.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator may be assured that Telecom appreciates the importance of the telegram service, both under emergency conditions and to those who do not have readily available alternative means of communication.</PARA>
<PARA> During the Commonwealth Games Telecom provided a comprehensive range of telecommunications services to ensure the success of the Games. The facilities provided by Telecom were commented upon very favourably by the organisers and visitors to the various Games sites.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 September 1982, (Hansard, page 860) Senator Primmer asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources , the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the interests of the Australian canned fruit industry and having regard to that industry's declining export markets, will the Government give consideration to lifting the ban on cruise vessels of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Is not the Government's action having a detrimental effect on the Australian canning fruit industry and its growers in particular.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is well aware of the proposition that sales of canned fruits could be made to the Soviet Union should Australia relax its ban on Soviet cruise ships. These reports appear to have originated from an Australian trading company.</PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union does not normally purchase canned fruit from hard currency sources. I am advised that the latest statistics available suggest that Soviet imports in the last few years came almost exclusively from Bulgaria and Hungary -that is COMECON partners of the USSR. It is therefore open to question as to why the USSR should wish to import canned fruit from a hard currency source like Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The measures adopted subsequent to events in Afghanistan and Poland do not in any way preclude Australian firms from establishing contractual arrangements with the Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the difficult circumstances being experienced by the Australian canned fruits industry. In this regard the Government is providing short-term assistance to growers in the 1982 season by way of carry-on finance and tree-pull assistance. The Government, through the Trade Commissioner Service will also provide the industry with all possible assistance to find commercial export markets.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 September 1982 (Hansard, page 1039) Senator Lajovic asked me, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In view of the announcement by the Treasurer that the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) will resume the collection of statistics on foreign ownership and control, will the Minister ask the Treasurer to ensure that the ABS improves, clarifies and refines those terms in order to prevent the confusion, obscurity and controversy contained in the previous interpretation of what is foreign ownership or control, which totally misinformed the general public.</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The ABS has examined a number of matters related to the resumption of foreign participation studies, including the most appropriate statistical definitions of foreign ownership and control. In this examination, the ABS sought the views of major private and public sector users of the foreign participation statistics and, as far as possible, took their views into account.</PARA>
<PARA> The ABS concluded that, for statistical purposes, it was unavoidable for the definitions of both foreign ownership and control to be based mainly on specified degrees of ownership. While the decisions of an enterprise can be influenced by a variety of means other than voting rights directly associated with ownership, it is not practicable to introduce such considerations into the definition of foreign control. Consequently, the definitions of foreign ownership and control will be similar to those used in previously published statistics.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, in response to requests and comments regarding the statistics, the Statistician has decided to provide separate figures wherever possible in future for the following two categories of enterprises which would otherwise be classified as foreign-controlled:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) joint Australian/foreign-controlled enterprises, i.e. enterprises in which a single foreign resident individual or foreign-controlled enterprise holds at least 25 per cent of the number of voting shares but where this holding is equalled by a single Australian resident or Australian-controlled enterprise; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Companies publicly announced by the Commonwealth Government as being ' naturalised' or 'naturalising' for foreign investment policy purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that confidentially restrictions preclude separate figures being published for each of these categories, they will be combined for publication purposes with the foreign control category. It is hoped that recent amendments to the Census and Statistics Act will facilitate minimisation of such confidentiality restrictions by means of companies giving consent to publication of specified data.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 September 1982 (Hansard, page 1113) Senator McLaren asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. It refers to Government claims that ministerial power to dismiss members of the various statutory bodies for impropriety applies only to impropriety committed as a board member. Does section 19 (2) (e) of the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act give the Treasurer power to terminate an appointment on the ground that it is not in the best interests of the Corporation that the director continue in office? Did the Prime Minister say on 2 June that the dismissal of tax evaders from Government positions was a matter for the relevant Ministers? Given that the Treasurer has both the statutory power and prime ministerial sanction, why has he failed to remove Mr Denis Horgan from his position in the Australian Industry Development Corporation?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren's reference to the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act is correct.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister did not say on 2 June 1982 that the dismissal of tax evaders from government positions was a matter for the relevant Ministers. What he did say was that matters in relation to the public offices held by any such person should be referred to the Minister concerned. The Prime Minister went on to add that it was also a question of the accuracy of the particular allegation and this should not necessarily be assumed.</PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in the House of Representatives on 23 September, 1982 the mere naming of people in reports is not of itself a reason why somebody should be removed from a particular body.</PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned in my joint statement also on 23 September 1982 with Mr Horgan, firm arrangements have been made between the Government and Mr Horgan for an inquiry to be undertaken by a leading counsel, nominated independently by the President of the Law Council of Australia, into transactions involving the sale of companies which have been referred to in tax allegations made against Mr Horgan under parliamentary privilege. This inquiry will determine whether any action of Mr Horgan's in respect of those transactions was illegal, dishonest or a conflict of private interest and public duty.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied me with the following additional information:</PARA>
<PARA> The current severe drought in the eastern States of Australia has increased demand for stock feed. At the same time drought conditions have reduced supply. Under these circumstances there is bound to be some increase in prices. The Fodder Subsidy Scheme initiated by the Commonwealth has been designed so that fodder prices do not escalate as a result of its introduction. The subsidy is based on the nutritive value of fodder relative to wheat, the price of which is primarily the result of conditions in the international wheat market. If prices of non-wheat fodders increase then farmers will logically turn to wheat or lesser priced grains for drought feeding.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourble senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1)-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Special units have been established in each branch office of the Australian Taxation Office to deal with objections as expeditiously as possible after the objections have been lodged. Some 90 per cent of all objections received are resolved by these special units.</PARA>
<PARA> The remaining 10 per cent of objections which lead to references to a Board of Review or appeals to a court are handled in specialist appeals sections in each of the branch offices. Again, only a very small proportion of these cases ever reaches the taxation Boards of Review or the courts.</PARA>
<PARA> Once a case is referred to a Board of Review or a court the time at which that case will be heard is a matter to be determined by the Board or court.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) It is true that under the new provisions relating to the payment of tax, provision is made for an increase in the rate of penalty tax for late payment to increase from 10 per cent to 20 per cent per annum. This increase is part of a general review of the level of penalties imposed for breaches of the taxation laws and which have remained unchanged for many years. The new rate of 20 per cent per annum will apply to a taxpayer who does not pay his tax by the due date for payment notwithstanding that all or part of the tax may be in dispute. However, where a taxpayer pays tax that is the subject of a dispute and subsequently succeeds in his objection or appeal against a disputed assessment, he will be paid interest on the disputed amount that is required to be repaid to him by the Commissioner. This matter was canvassed in the Treasurer's Press release number 151 of 10 August 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In his Press release number 151 of 10 August 1982 the Treasurer announced that he was having discussions with the Commissioner of Taxation into ways in which the time taken in settlement of disputes with taxpayers might be reduced. Those discussions are continuing. It is not accepted that the increase in workload of the Boards of Review is due in any way to the inexperience of staff of the Australian Taxation Office. It is due to a very large extent to the adoption of the dispute procedures of the income tax law by a number of taxpayers who see these as an opportunity to artificially delay the payment of tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 March 1982 (Hansard, page 570) Senator MacGibbon asked me as the Minister representing the Treasurer, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Have any estimates been made of the cost in man hours, supervision, computer time, printing, postage and the like in assessing a taxation return from a pensioner who is $2.60 a week above the tax threshold? Would the tax levied in this case come near to covering the costs involved?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has advised me that costs of processing various types of return are not maintained by the Taxation Office. Estimates of the cost of collecting income tax are provided in the Commissioner's Annual Report to Parliament. In recent years costs have represented less than one per cent of revenue collected . It would be possible to express total outlays on a cost per return basis but the resulting figure would not be particularly meaningful in the context of the honourable senator's question as it would of necessity be an average cost covering many different types of returns.</PARA>
<PARA> I might also point out that all individuals with incomes exceeding the minimum taxable amount are required to lodge income tax returns. Consequently the Commissioner of Taxation has no discretion but to process the return and issue any resulting assessment regardless of the revenue involved. Obviously it is inherent in a system incorporating a minimum taxable amount that some taxable incomes will be very close to that amount and some far in excess of it.</PARA>

How has the Federal Government allowed this situation to develop? Has any investigation been made of the tax dodging schemes outlined in the Sunday Mail article? If so, has any action been taken against these schemes?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The newspaper article referred to by Senator Colston pointed out that Queensland's tax haven status is based on limited partnerships.</PARA>
<PARA> Limited partnerships, as provided for in the Mercantile Act of Queensland, have for many years been an accepted means by which groups of individuals or companies with a common interest can establish and conduct legitimate business. The use of limited partnerships therefore does not necessarily raise tax avoidance implications.</PARA>
<PARA> There is cause for concern, however, when the special feasures of limited partnerships are exploited for tax avoidance purposes. The Commissioner of Taxation is well aware of the manner in which this exploitation can occur and his officers carefully scrutinize the affairs of limited partnerships. The kinds of arrangements mentioned in the article have been the subject of the Commissioner's inquiries. Where a tax avoidance scheme is identified, it is the practice of the Commissioner to take all administrative steps necessary to contest its effectiveness and where appropriate to bring to the Government's attention any weaknesses in the law that are being exploited to the detriment of the revenue.</PARA>

<PARA> The basic health insurance rebate applied only to premiums which secure entitlement to basic benefits for the taxpayer on his/her legally married spouse.</PARA>
<PARA> Will the Minister advise when we can expect amending legislation to remove such phrases as 'legally married spouse' from the Income Tax Assessment Act, thereby avoiding the current confusion which exists in other legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the health insurance rebate provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act, a partner in a de facto relationship is excluded from the category of dependants in respect of whom a taxpayer is eligible to claim the rebate. A taxpayer with children who obtains family health insurance cover is, however, still entitled to the rebate for the total amount paid for basic hospital and/ or medical benefits. Where a taxpayer does not have children, each party in the de facto relationship can claim the rebate in respect of individual health insurance cover obtained.

<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National Gallery has advised that there is an established practice amongst European institutions which charge admission for there to be one day per week when entry is free for everyone. The experience in those institutions has been such that these free days place considerable pressures on security staff. It is also relevant to note that most galleries which have free days are closed to the public for one day a week, whereas the Australian National Gallery is open seven days a week.</PARA>

<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that 'cheques' drawn by banks (including savings banks) will not give rise to a liability to bank account debits tax while 'cheques' drawn by credit unions, building societies and, where relevant, other non-bank financial institutions will do so. To see this position in proper perspective, however, it is necessary to have regard for the general context of the tax and the operating modes of all the institutions concerned. I have given assurances to the credit union movement that the Government does not wish the tax to cause serious disadvantage to credit unions (or, for that matter, to other non-bank financial institutions). The Government accordingly will be closely monitoring the situation and keeping the legislation under review.</PARA>
