<PARA> Senator Missen-I take a point of order relating to the proceedings of the Senate. I was informed this morning that the proceedings of this House will not be broadcast in Victoria today. If that is so, on a quick investigation of the matter it would be a breach of the privileges of this House and it would offend against the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act. Section 4 of that Act requires, subject to the Joint Statutory Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, which I do not know to have met, that such proceedings be broadcast throughout capital cities notwithstanding anything contained in the Broadcasting and Television Act. Mr President, I ask whether you are aware of this. If I am correct will action be taken immediately to ensure that no such breach of the privileges of this House takes place?</PARA>

If you, Mr President, did not give the order I find it incomprehensible that someone else might have given the order that the proceedings of this Parliament not be broadcast. I ask how long it will be before the Senate is informed about this matter. If it is going to be some considerable time I would consider moving the suspension of Standing Orders so as to allow me to move that the Senate adjourn until the matter is resolved. In the event that you discover that the proceedings are not being broadcast in Victoria and that somebody has ordered that that be so, I give notice that I will move immediately for the suspension of so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent the order that was given to not broadcast these proceedings in Victoria today being rescinded.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, refers to a question I asked him yesterday which in essence was whether he agreed with the statement of the Treasurer that any proposed wages freeze would not apply to over-award payments, which would continue to be the subject of collective bargaining during any wages freeze. In answer to that question the Minister said: 'I am not familiar with the statement of the Treasurer'. Is the Minister yet familiar with the statement of the Treasurer? Is that Government policy? If it is Government policy will that not have the consequence that further disparities in the wage structure will emerge during the period of any freeze? Will it not have a further consequence that companies which are profitable and successful will be penalised by wages claims in respect of those who are entitled to make them under decentralisation-collective bargaining systems?</PARA></TALK.START>

I have been led to believe that Mr Alan Ramsey, Press Secretary to Mr Bill Hayden, the Leader of the Opposition, has been outposted-to use the kindest possible word I can think of-to Flinders for the past three weeks so that he can assist the Australian Labor Party in its campaigning for the by-election there. Can the Minister confirm this suggestion which has been put to me?

I certainly will make inquiries and will let the Senate know what the situation is. But of course, based upon the Labor Party's consistent assertions in this Senate, any person paid by the taxpayers would not in any sense of propriety be used in a by-election. One would hope, therefore, that my answer would be that he is not so employed. Since I do not know I will seek out that information and let the Senate know.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources. I ask: Amid calls not to increase protection, how does the Government intend to stem the flow of cheap subsidised imports, increasing Australian unemployment and increasing balance of payments deficit? Further, are not calls for increased industry competitiveness, though valid, no real answer against a situation in which Australian industry finds itself in a world over-supply situation, with many foreign countries and their firms determined to get cash flow in Australia, regardless of profits and regardless of disturbing their traditional markets?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3046" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has been, on the world scene and at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade meetings, advocating that there is inherent danger to the whole world if the world moves towards more protection with more boundaries placed around each nation. The Government has been advocating that the way to get more employment in the world, the way to stimulate recovery, is for the world multilaterally to cease its increased protection, to put down its boundaries and to get trade flowing. It is to the dismay of this country and, I hope, of all Australians, that that move has failed at this moment, and that indeed there is a likelihood that there will be increased protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator has asked what Australia will do. The first thing that we have to do with all the intensity at our command is to stop dumping into this country. We have taken action and we will take further action if it is necessary . One of the tragedies of a recession is that countries seeking to gain valuable foreign exchange will enormously subsidise their goods just to get foreign currency. For instance, the Americans, I think, have asserted that in order to get foreign currency, South Korea is subsidising its steel to the extent of 32 per cent of cost. I pointed out that from oil alone it is alleged that South Korea has a trade deficit of $35 billion. The dumping situation is of very real significance as, of course, dumping of dairy products would be on the world.</PARA>
<PARA> As to individual industries in Australia, it is clear that in the long run what is needed is cost efficiency in order that we can compete. That is why we are moving into the Premiers Conference discussions. But equally so we would be very keen to study, industry by industry, anything which threatens a particular industry which is making a genuine case for survival. The Government has this matter quite clearly before it. It is this Government's keen desire that there should be in Australia a virile manufacturing industry which will employ Australians in skilled jobs. We will not see that destroyed by dumping or other underhand methods. We will act very rapidly in that regard.</PARA>

Is it correct that the Department had a number of tenders from Australian companies within 10 per cent of the New Zealand price, including one from a small enterprise in a drought stricken area in Victoria employing six people, at a price of $6.58 net per pack and that that price was not the lowest Australian tender? Is the Minister aware that this tender would have provided approxi- mately 20,000 hours of work for Australian workers?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw in a newspaper article that the State Opposition Leader, Mr Burke, had indicated that his party-the State Labor Party-was embarrassed by the fact that statements had been made by the Federal Opposition purporting, as I understand it, to oppose any sugar production on the Ord. I can quite understand that embarrassment because the people of Western Australia are interested in job creation and the development of their State and, indeed, in the right of their State to make particular determinations concerning agriculture. Naturally Mr Burke would be very concerned to find that the Federal ALP had indicated that it was taking these kinds of decisions out of the Western Australian Labor Party's hands. It therefore follows that, if indeed the exchanges that we have seen reported in the newspaper and the opposition we have seen registered here are in fact in line with Federal Labor Party policy, if by any mischance a State Labor government were brought into power in Western Australia the development of such an industry on the Ord could not be expected. Apparently it is developing Labor Party policy to oppose such an industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have seen that other governments have. For example, I think I am right in saying that the New South Wales Labor Government, whilst it did not accept for its parliamentarians the full increases granted in decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal, accepted modified wage increases; so I think there has been such a common practice. I am not aware of a widespread attempt to act to get major wage increases before the freeze. One would hope that at the government levels, in the private sector and in the arbitration system this would be resisted. The aim is, of course, to overcome that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry, who no doubt is aware that this country faces a $7,500m loss in income next year because of the drought which is currently killing this nation's rural economy. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the fact that over 100,000 farmers are being affected by the drought and that gross domestic product in 1982-83 will be cut by 4 per cent as a result? Can the Minister give any indication whether his Department has studied the findings of the recently released Balderstone report and whether it is likely that the recommendations contained therein will be adopted?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the Government is very much aware of the severity of the drought affecting Australia. The legislation which passed through the Senate a few weeks ago providing for new measures of drought relief is a measure of the seriousness with which the Government regards the situation. There are various estimates of the cost of the drought, including that made by the National Farmers Federation which was cited by Senator Bjelke-Petersen in her question. There is, of course, some difficulty in making estimates of that sort because we are dealing with an uncertain period. It is not known to the Government, to the National Farmers Federation or, indeed, to any other commentator just how long we will be afflicted with the drought from which we are presently suffering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has issued its estimate of a total reduction in the Australian gross national product for 1982-83 of about $2.4 billion-that is, $2,400m. Again that must be subject to some uncertainty because of the seasonal uncertainties involved. Having listened to AM this morning I can say only that I hope the seasonal uncertainty will be reduced by the prayer campaign in which the honourable senator's husband is participating and that we will see some breaking of the drought in December under the influences of the Almighty urged on by the church-goers of Queensland and, I hope, of other States .</PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the eventual cost, there is no doubt that the drought is having a very serious effect on agricultural Australia and on rural Australia generally and hence on the whole Australian economy. We have taken the major measures which have been through the Senate. The Balderstone Committee report contains some recommendations relevant to drought relief. I think those and other recommendations will be subject to considerable debate in the rural community and elsewhere before final decisions are taken by the Government with respect to it. I would not expect the recommendations in that report to affect the drought relief measures currently being applied. I think there is some indication, certainly judging from the response of the meat industry, that there will be a diversity of opinion on some of the recommendations of the Balderstone Committee . I do not believe it is likely that the Minister for Primary Industry will commit himself to a particular stance on those recommendations until more of that debate has taken place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw the article. It is extremely hard to follow what is the policy of the Wran Government on electricity generation. On the one hand the Wran Government forced county councils to put up prices for both domestic and industrial power, completely in defiance of its election policy. The Wran Government had said that it had the cheapest electricity in Australia and that it would maintain that position. Industrial tariffs reached a point at which they were not only the dearest in Australia but also, as indicated by specialist authorities, the dearest in world terms. I note now that the Australian Labor Party is panicking because there has been a severe fall-off in consumption of electricity, particularly by manufacturing industry and commerce. It is now seeking to put the blame on others and to get a reduction in price. The Wran Government is not blaming itself. Honourable senators will recall that when the New South Wales Government retrospectively increased electricity charges it blamed the county councils and not itself. Now it is asking county councils to absorb money. It is true that this is a very similar situation to the 'hollow log' exercise. It is a typical situation of the Wran Government. It promised the electors that it would provide ample and abundant electricity at the cheapest rate in Australia. However a few weeks later it was not able to supply the ordinary demands. It suddenly put up prices enormously, thus driving industry away from New South Wales, and now it is blaming others for this situation. This is a classic situation and it is one that, of course, all Australians condemn.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall respond to the second part of the question first. The Fraser Government has an arrangement with the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries to produce over a period of some nine years progressively more fuel efficient vehicles. Taking as the bench-mark the concept of a vehicle in 1978-79 consuming an average of 11.2 litres of petrol for every 100 kilometres, the aim was that by 1983 consumption should be reduced to nine litres for every 100 kilometres-that would be a very big reduction-and by 1987 to eight litres. If we could achieve that goal it would save up to 20 per cent of fuel. As to the progress, by this year the fuel consumption had fallen from 11.2 litres to 10 litres and it is now below 10 litres and moving towards nine litres. The industry is optimistic that we will achieve the 1983 goal. We will then be in the more difficult situation of getting consumption down to eight litres by 1987. The saving of between 12 per cent and 20 per cent of petrol will be of enormous benefit to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have seen the Bulletin article; indeed, I have a copy of it with me. The fact is that the Commonwealth Government's pricing policy for LPG, whereby it seeks to price LPG at 50 per cent of the wholesale price of oil, is starting to have a major result. The industries concerned are very busy converting. It is true that this process has been slow and that there is still a great distance to be travelled. We hope that by 1985-1987 a saving of something like 14 per cent in petrol usage can be achieved by conversion to LPG. I noticed that the Shell-BHP Gogas marketing manager stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We are pouring millions into the market place-and the response has been tremendous. Next year's sales will be 38 per cent better than this year. From then on, the industry expects to grow by 22 per cent each year.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> About 7,000 cabs, commercial vehicles and private cars are being converted each year (Australia wide). Our own conversion workshop is fully booked for the next three months.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an enormously healthy situation. The Commonwealth Government has a program for the conversion of its own fleets. The main thing that commerce and industry in Australia should understand is this: For vehicles that are used for extensive mileage LPG represents an enormous saving. It can be a very significant saving indeed and, therefore, for fleet vehicles, particularly in capital cities, this should be urged. With fuel efficient vehicles we are making savings--</PARA>

We hope that in this decade we will achieve a further 14 per cent saving by converting from petrol to LPG.

As employers would not inform the Taxation Office until about a month after the claims were made by their employees, I think it is a little early yet to see the take-up or the number of claims that are being made. I understand that the number of inquiries related to the scheme the Australian Taxation Office has received from financial institutions and from individuals indicates that there is a fair knowledge of the scheme and that this is relatively widely spread. Another aspect that could be taken into account is that a number of people prefer not to claim month by month pay-as-you-earn deductions but rather to retain the concession in order to make a bulk claim at the end of the taxation year. For all of these reasons I believe there is no need to be concerned whether there is knowledge of the scheme or whether anything further needs to be done by the Australian Taxation Office or any other department.</PARA></TALK.START>

A similar issue was raised earlier by Senator Lajovic as to whether the Minister's attention has been drawn to the New South Wales Government's ordering the reduction of electricity charges by councils to domestic consumers following reductions previously made to industrial and commercial tariffs. Is the Minister aware that electricity charges in the Australian Capital Territory have risen with New South Wales charge increases? Can the Minister say whether these cuts will now be passed to Australian Capital Territory consumers? Is the Minister aware that both the supply and price of electricity in the Austalian Capital Territory are controlled by New South Wales ?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that the Minister for the Capital Territory has not been advised in any way of any announcements by the New South Wales Government ordering a reduction of electricity charges to domestic consumers. It is known that the Premier of New South Wales has announced a freeze in respect of bulk supply electricity charges until April 1983, but in fact, not a reduction. The Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority has received no notification at all of a reduction in bulk electricity charges from the Electricity Commission of New South Wales. The supply of electricity from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme to the Australian Capital Territory is the subject of agreements and legislation as outlined by Senator Reid; that is, agreements between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria. The price of power from the scheme is determined according to those agreements and that legislation. I naturally acknowledge the concerns of Senator Reid in connection with her constituents within the Australian Capital Territory.

I state categorically that under Australia's bilateral safeguards agreement with France there can be no transfer of this material to third parties without prior consent from Australia. I make it clear that Australia's consent would not be forthcoming in the case of India as she neither is a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation tract nor has concluded a bilateral safeguards agreement with Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

So the uranium supplied to France will be constantly monitored to see where it goes, to follow it in its changing forms as it is enriched and made into fuel rods and to see that it is reprocessed and disposed of so that it cannot in any way offend the rules that Australia has laid down in conjunction with the International Atomic Energy Agency.

That was followed by a visit to Canberra of leaders of the Cocos Islands community. The Minister is discussing the people's progress towards self-determination, which is the goal towards which they and the Australian Government have been working. The Australian Government considers that the people of the Cocos Islands should be fully informed of the options available to them in the exercise of their right to self-determination, and it is with this in mind that the Minister is conducting many consultations. Any act of self-determination will need to be endorsed by the United Nations. General Assembly Resolution 1541 (xv) of 15 December 1960 sets out three options which should be presented to the people: Firstly, emergence as a sovereign independent state; secondly, free association with an independent state; and, thirdly, integration with an independent state.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the particular remarks in the ANL's annual report to which Senator Lewis has drawn our attention. It is true that there is much concern in this country about the iron ore trade and the cost of shipping between Australia and Japan and, of course, throughout other parts of the world as well. There has been a considerable demarcation dispute involving the Merchant Service Guild of Australia and the Seamen's Union of Australia. The ANL 's vessel River Boyne has been delayed at Darwin for about five weeks. I understand that subject to the agreement of Queensland Alumina Ltd it is the ANL 's intention to order the River Boyne to sail for Sydney today to be laid up. A second ship of this class, the River Embley, is not due for delivery until April 1983 so I am unable to comment upon its condition at this stage. Naturally that would be a matter of commercial judgment at any time. I understand that the arrangements under which the River Boyne is chartered to Queensland Alumina Ltd provide for the operating costs of the ship to be met by the charterer. I am unable to provide any information as to the cost of the vessel each day at this stage but I will try to find out something for Senator Lewis in that regard. There is also, of course, the question of the costs of the vessel being laid up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is significant that Senator Lewis draws this matter to our attention at a time when there is a very considerable downturn in world trade, particularly our trade with Japan in respect of products such as iron ore, alumina and coal. Consquently this is a matter of great importance. Senator Lewis mentioned the intervention of Soviet bloc vessels in this area. I am not sure of the background but I will try to find out something about that matter. As to the activities of the Seamen's Union, it is particularly difficult to understand the reasoning behind the activities of such a union, which is affiliated with both the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, at a time when there is such a downturn in world trade, one which is leading to a decrease of job opportunities in this country. Consequently it would not seem that that union is acting in the best interests of the nation, its own members, the Australian Labor Party or, for that matter, the ACTU.</PARA>

I have given the matter close consideration and have received the views of the Principal Parliamentary Reporter. The Senate should be aware that, following a request from Senator McLaren in respect of the use of titles in questions in his name on the Senate Notice Paper, that aspect of the matter was raised with my predecessor who discussed it with the Senate Standing Orders Committee.

The Department of Communications has communicated with the Senate and with the committees of the Senate to draw attention to what it sees as a failure to transmit this information to Senator Colston at an earlier date.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Dear Mr Evans</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your recent letter concerning election campaign advertising.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned to ensure that all electors are able to exercise their right to vote for the candidate of their choice without interference. It is also important that freedom of speech not be unduly restricted especially during an election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA> The High Court unanimously held that section 161 (e) of the Electoral Act-which declares the publishing of misleading electoral advertising to be illegal-refers to the act of recording or expressing the political judgment which the elector has made rather than to the formation of that judgment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Court itself recognised the very real practical difficulties which might result from a law which had wider application. As noted by the Court, in a campaign ranging over a wide variety of matters, many of the issues canvassed are likely to be unsuited to resolution in legal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> Campaign advertising is an important and legitimate means of informing electors of the policies of the various political parties.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-At the first opportunity this morning I raised a matter concerning information I had received from the Government Whip's Office that the proceedings of the Senate would not be broadcast in Victoria today. I have since had the opportunity of ascertaining the source of that information which was given to me very shortly before the commencement of the sitting this morning. I then checked rapidly with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act and came to the conclusion that it would be quite wrong and illegal if the Senate's proceedings were not broadcast. The position is that apparently the Government Whip's Office-not the Government Whip but a member of his staff-checked with the Department of Communications last week to ascertain whether the Senate would be broadcast today and was then given the quite mistaken advice that the Senate would not be broadcast today. It was as a result of that that the officer of the Whip's Office approached me this morning and told me that it would not be broadcast. Accordingly, I made the objection in the Senate. It appears the mistake was made by some officer in the Department of Communications advising the Whip's Office. That was the source of the mistaken information that came to me.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A few weeks ago President Reagan in a rare moment of honesty said that the United States economy was in a hell of a mess. He was speaking about an economy with an inflation rate of 5.9 per cent-which was falling-and an unemployment rate of 9.6 per cent. By contrast Australia has a current inflation rate of 12.3 per cent and an unemployment rate of 8.2 per cent-both are rising. We are unique among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries as a whole in having high inflation and high unemployment at the same time. One can also add to this high interest rates, no growth and increases in both inflation and unemployment levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is doing nothing to remedy these ills. It confessed failure in its Budget. It has thrown up its hands on most of these issues and relies on stunts. The latest of those stunts is an ill-conceived wages pause or freeze in isolation from a number of other remedies. The Government has proposed this policy of a wages freeze but does not understand it. One has only to ask questions in the Senate to find out that the implications of this have not been considered. One can look at Question Time on either of the last two days and see that those implications have not been considered. I again remind the Government that it is its proposal and because it is its proposal it is its obligation to explain how it will work. If sceptics say that it may not work I think that that is a matter for legitimate debate, for legitimate concern, and something which should be appropriately discussed in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent Budget was a confession of failure in relation to the Australian economy. Page 56 of Budget Paper No. 1 shows that there will be no growth in the Australian economy this financial year. The Budget also predicts increasing unemployment and continued high rates of inflation. The Budget is already in tatters. The Budget forecast of a deficit of $1,674m is already wildly wrong. In some respects, there are legitimate reasons for that. Drought relief has made increased demands on the Budget but the unemployment benefit increases are also making increased demands on the Budget deficit. Tax receipt provisions, in conjunction with drought relief and unemployment benefit increases, have pushed up the Budget deficit to $2.7 billion. So less than four months after the Budget was brought down all this is happening. On top of this there is the record of appalling economic management and the stark fact that the recession burden is not being borne equally between sectors of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Australia is in the middle of a recession. Not everybody is going to bear the brunt of that recession. The fact is that low and middle income earners in Australia, and particularly the unemployed, are shouldering the burden of the Government's economic policies. The gulf between rich and poor, between the privileged and the rest of the community, has widened dramatically in the last six years. Unemployment is being used by the Government as a cynical tool in its futile pursuit of a discredited strategy of fighting inflation first. I say discredited because it is, in a sense, a quite legitimate strategy. But it is clear from answers which have been given in the Senate by Ministers this week that the Government no longer has any idea whether it is fighting inflation first or, because of panic, it is now trying to fight unemployment first. Is the strategy announced in the last week or so just being seen to be doing something about unemployment-in the immortal words of Mr Michael Baume, the Liberal member for Macarthur-or is it in fact a genuine and prime target of the Government's strategy?</PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government doing in terms of the so-called wages pause or freeze? One gets different answers from every Minister when one asks them about these things. Some Ministers, such as the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, say that the purpose of the Government's strategy is to reduce inflation; something on which this Government has had a monumentally unsuccessfully record. Other Ministers say that its purpose is to create employment or to retain employment. There is no consistency. As it is the Government strategy there should be some consistency, amongst Ministers at least , about what it is all about. The rapid growth in unemployment, which has been predicted and expected by some commentators or anybody who is in touch with the business community in Australia, has of course accelerated. That has caused a degree of panic. But over the last year or so the Government has been quite prepared to watch unemployment rise to record levels with the disastrous social consequences and it has done so in pursuit of an economic myth. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of this matter of public importance today is to emphasise that since 1975-it is not just a matter of recent invention-this Government has continued to foster these kinds of inequities, which will be exacerbated by the current policies of the Government. On the expenditure side the Government has fostered inequities in its health, housing and education policies. On the receipts side it has fostered inequities in its taxation policy and its incomes policy-or should I say its lack of an incomes or wages policy. Of course, the Government's usual reaction to these things is to blame somebody else, but let us look to what extent it can do that. I want to deal specifically with two areas-taxation and the wages pause proposal. Both are indicative of the Government's record of fostering inequalities and dressing them up as reforms or 'economic realities'. I remind the Senate that in 1975 the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the most significant contributions to prosperity will be our personal income tax reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> We will reduce the tax burden. We will put an end to Labor's tax rip off. </PARA>
<PARA> This reform-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, tax indexation-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . will make government more honest with your money. They will be no longer able to rely on the secret tax increase of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Every sentence in that statement has turned out to be a lie. In the last year of the Labor Government-1975-23.3 per cent of gross domestic product was taken up with Commonwealth taxes. This year the figure is 25.5 per cent, a very significant increase amounting to an extra $3.5 billion in taxes. Most significantly, though, it is a significant percentage increase in Commonwealth tax revenue from wage earners. The promise of tax indexation has disappeared like all the other promises. Inflation now is higher than it was in September 1975. Worse, the overall result of personal income tax changes has been to place a greater relative burden upon lower and middle income earners. These taxpayers have suffered an increase in average tax rates over the period. High income earners, on the other hand, have enjoyed a relative decrease in the taxation burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me illustrate that with two examples. I wish to incorporate in Hansard some documents which illustrate these points. Let us take, first of all, a single taxpayer earning about $10,700 a year. The proportion of income tax which he or she paid rose by 21 per cent between 1975-76 and 1981-82. For a person earning the average wage the increase in taxation between 1975-76 and 1981-82 was of the order of 11 per cent. People on average weekly earnings as distinct from the average wage-that is, those in a higher income group-experienced a 5 per cent increase in their tax burden. But those on high incomes-those in receipt of $32, 000, for example-have experienced no increase at all in their taxation burden in the last six or seven years. The average rate of tax paid by persons earning more than $30,000 a year has actually declined. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar example is that of a male or female taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children. Taxpayers in that category who are on the average wage have had an increase of the order of 70 per cent in the proportion of income which they pay in tax, while those on high incomes have had to bear only a 3 per cent increase. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which explains these changes in the taxation burden. The table is headed 'The Changing Tax Burden'. It is taken from the Current Affairs Bulletin of July 1982. It shows essentially that high income earners now pay less of their income in tax and that all those on middle incomes and below have paid significant increases-up to 21 per cent- since 1976. </PARA>

<PARA> (a) Income is expressed in 1981-82 dollars. These income levels were deflated by average weekly earnings to find net tax as proportion of income for a person on an equivalent real income in 1975-76. (This approach takes account of changes in both inflation and real earnings). </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The conclusion to be drawn from all of this is that the taxation burden has shifted from the wealthy sections of the community to the poorer sections. The distribution of income has shifted in favour of the wealthy sections as against the poorer sections of the community. In this way inequalities in the tax system have been fostered and maintained by the Government. Those inequalities are more acute because of indirect tax increases which are generally regressive in the sense that they bear more on lower incomes . They have increased by over one per cent in the last two years. There have been changes in health arrangements under which most taxpayers are now worse off and, of course, there has been the incidence of tax evasion and avoidance-a privilege for the rich; one which is not available to middle and lower income earners, particularly pay-as-you-earn workers. Professor Russell Mathews, a government adviser, as we pointed out before, estimates that about $5 billion is lost to revenue each year, thus heightening the inequities in the Australian system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to dwell on the matter of tax indexation except to say that it has been a total sham in terms of the Government's promises, and that it has had a significant impact on the equity of the tax system over the last few years. The indirect tax rises which have been imposed in the last two Budgets also ensure that tax cuts for personal incomes, as promised in the current Budget, are illusory. Similarly, if the wages pause or freeze goes ahead, it will be absolute hypocrisy to claim that this Budget has introduced real tax cuts- absolute hypocrisy! Look at what the Government does. When it expects an election it gives with one hand. It uses some magic mechanism such as the dial-a -tax-cut mechanism of 1977, a tax cut which disappeared the moment the election was out of the way. These cuts too will be taken away. Once this year is over, the disposable income of wage earners affected by the proposed freeze or pause will be significantly less even though tax cuts were offered in the Budget. In summary, in the last seven years massive inequities have developed in the Australian taxation system. I again quote Professor Mathews who summarised that view in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian taxation and social welfare system, far from contributing to greater equality in the distribution of income and wealth, has become a major instrument for redistributing incomes from the poor to the rich and from wage and salary earners to other income recipients, as well as a major cause of the budgetary problems of all Australian governments and a source of growing social, business and economic instability. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the taxation system under the present Government. I wish to talk briefly about the wages pause. Everybody with any sense in this country agrees that there should be wage moderation. There is no argument about that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us come to that point. Wage moderation is recognised as important at present. This Government, which has no wages policy-I quote Mr Andrew Peacock; it is not my own expression-has got itself into a very real bind on this issue. The wages pause is akin to pulling a rabbit out of a hat and picking up a slogan that Australian industry is uncompetitive because of wage rises. There is very little evidence for that proposition. As revealed by the Government's own Budget Papers, the unit cost of labour in Australia has not increased since 1976. I inform Senator Chaney, in case he is unfamiliar with the term, that to arrive at the unit cost of labour one divides wages increases by productivity increases. I repeat that, according to the Government's own Budget, the unit cost of labour has not risen since 1976.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the honourable senator to wait a moment. Having looked at the Budget statement on unit labour cost, it is important to consider, in the context of a wage freeze proposal, what has happened to wages in this country in that period. We find that people who receive more than the median wage have enjoyed significant wage increases, that people who receive less than that wage have suffered significant decreases in real terms. Senator Chaney asked about the maintenance of real wages. That is the problem. If one imposes a wage freeze across the board one imposes on people with low incomes, those who are close to the poverty level, an enormous burden compared with the sort of burden that is imposed on persons whose wage levels are above the median. One of the real difficulties, given the total absence of a wages policy, is that very little consideration seems to have been given to what is to be done about that question .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer, Mr Howard, has stated-apparently Senator Chaney is unaware of the fact-that the freeze will apply to award wages only. Basically that means that it will apply to the wages of the weak, not to those of the relatively well off. According to Mr Howard, they will be able to continue to bargain in the market place for higher wages. They will do that all right because they will be bargaining with employers who have been successful, who have a high rate of productivity and a relatively high degree of profitability. Those industries will be penalised by relatively wealthy wage earners while the incomes of poor wage earners will be frozen. These are points of very serious concern-they are not political debating points-which must be considered. Otherwise, the call for wage moderation, which we all share-some government spokesmen have turned it into a wage freeze-will turn out to be a disaster for the living standards of the poorer section of the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the latter part of Senator Button's speech he touched on some of the very real issues which need careful consideration in the Australian community at a time of economic difficulty. I was pleased that he indicated that everyone agreed with the need for wage moderation. Everyone agrees that that is important. I believe that if we are successfully to improve the economic position in Australia we need both to isolate and expand the areas of agreement between the Government, the Opposition, employers and employees. I welcome that agreement and welcome also the serious points raised by the honourable senator in regard to a wages policy and its management to ensure a fair sharing of burdens. They are objectives that I believe we should attempt to pursue in common and I take seriously the suggestions made by the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course I cannot be as agreeable with respect to some of the earlier parts of his speech. In particular, on behalf of the Government I must reject the general allegation which is contained in the matter of public importance we are discussing; that the Government is in some way fostering increasing inequities in the Australian community. I would like to make it quite clear that it is not the intention of this Government to foster inequities. In a sense, I suppose, that does not need saying. It is hard to visualise an Australian government that would wish to do that. The wording of the matter of public importance we are discussing leaves it open to suggest that in some way this Government is pursuing a situation of inequity. Clearly, that is not so. In one sense, I suppose, that can be demonstrated very simply by the omission from the early part of Senator Button's speech. He referred to the fact that if one looked at certain items of expenditure one could see evidence of increasing inequity. He mentioned health, education and so on. Time does not permit me to go into those matters in detail, but the significant omission from what he had to say about figures which illustrate inequity was the expenditure of my own Department and, indeed, of the Department of my colleague, Senator Messner, that of Veterans' Affairs. The expenditures of those departments are normally lumped together and regarded as the welfare expenditure of the Commonwealth. If one looks at the record over the last 10 years it is quite clear that there has been a very significant shift in favour of expenditure in the welfare field, that that expenditure has increased considerably under the Government of which I am now a part, and that there have been very substantial shifts in favour of distribution in that sense. I will deal with my own Department in more detail a little later but I think it is quite evident that this Government has not moved towards a situation of inequity; rather the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> The point which really lies behind the matter which has been brought before the Senate today is that Australia has some fundamental economic difficulties at present. Those difficulties arise from both external and internal factors. The external factors I simply mention: It is broadly understood in the community that world trade is down, that there is a general economic recession around the world and that Australia, as a very considerable trading nation, is affected by that recession. We are not powerless in that situation, but our ability to influence the world economic situation is limited. I suppose that Mr Anthony's expedition to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs meeting in Geneva is an illustration of the limits that are upon us. We have sought to encourage world trade. To some extent our efforts have been rebuffed by the European Economic Community. We face a more difficult domestic situation with the reduction of international activity. There are, however, important internal factors. They are the factors which we control as a nation and to which we have a responsibility to pay special attention. I do not think that there is any doubt at all in the Australian community now that one of the important factors which lie within our control is the level of wages in this country. The important point was made in an interjection by Senator Hamer during Senator Button's speech that in comparative terms Australian wage costs have rendered Australia very uncompetitive in many ways. I quote a non-government observer, the business editor of the Age. His article on 25 November stated very pithily what I am trying to say:</PARA>
<PARA> At a time when the average Australian is coming to realise, often through unhappy personal experience, that direct links do exist between excess wage rises, falling corporate profits and disappearing jobs, it is distressing that the nation's current alternative Prime Minister appears unable to accept this reality or the necessary consequences that flow from it. </PARA>
<PARA>So what the Government is pursuing at the moment reflects the reality which is widely understood by the Australian population, that the direct and very high wage rises which have occurred recently in Australia are a fundamental part of the difficulty which we face. </PARA>
<PARA> There are inequities in Australia. That is the subject of today's discussion of a matter of public importance. I for one concede that all Australians do not get an even deal. The greatest inequity which exists in our community at the moment is unemployment. The greatest inequity is the differential between those Australians who are able to get a job-that is, the great majority-and the minority who are unable to get employment. I believe that matter needs to be seriously addressed not only by the Government but also by all of us. We are pursuing economic policies which will reduce that great inequity to the minimum proportions which are possible. We are offering, we believe, economic policies which are the best option available to us at the moment. We are inviting the States, industry and the trade union movement to join with us to ensure that that great inequity is reduced to a minimum. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be said that the removal of the inequities of unemployment by the promotion of economic growth is not an easy matter. We have had considerable discussion in this Senate about some of the alternatives being followed in other countries-some of them alternatives of the Left and some of them alternatives of the Right. There are few examples to which one can point with confidence as charting a certain course for Australia, but I believe there is a growing consensus that we can reduce the inequity of unemployment by those who are in employment sharing some of the burden. That is an appeal which the Government is currently making to the community, to the States and to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has endeavoured to respond in a flexible way to the changing situation which Australia faces. Until the last Budget we prepared Budgets in the context of likely increased private investment activity in Australia. Some time after the 1981 Budget it became apparent that that situation was changing markedly. I wish to point briefly to the fact that in a series of ways we have responded to that changing reality to reduce the difficulties which are being suffered here in Australia. I point to the housing package of March which recognised the difficulties which were being faced by many Australians and the home building industry. I point to the Premiers Conference of June where, in our increased allocations for welfare housing and in our freeing up of the capital programs of the States, one finds evidence of a desire on the part of the Government to promote activity in areas where activity was declining. With respect to the recent Budget I would point to the increased allocations for capital works in all fields-in welfare housing, as I have already mentioned, in airports and roads. I point to the introduction of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program where an effort has been made to increase government activity in fields where private activity is reduced. In other words, the Government has not blindly applied the same economic policy to changed circumstances; rather it has applied its economic policies to the changing circumstances that Australia faces both externally and internally. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the overall situation in Australia over a 10-year period, the argument that there has been an increasing inequity holds very little water. The reason is that if one looks at the figures over that 10-year period, one finds that wages and salaries still hold a very high percentage of our gross domestic product. One finds that profits hold a lower share of our GDP. I believe most economic commentators-if not all economic commentators-would say that if we are to restore economic growth to Australia and if we are to restore employment growth what is needed is a growth in the profitability of industry, because it is only where industry is profitable that one will get investment and the creation of employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to my own department, the Department of Social Security, which is the most substantial expenditure department of the Commonwealth. The Government' s record in expenditure was referred to by the Opposition as being an indicator of the inequity which is being permitted to occur under this Government. I believe the record of the Government with respect to social security is a very good indicator of the concern of the Government to maintain a situation of equity in the community. In opening I mentioned the gross figures which apply. I will go into more detail in a moment. If one looks at the gross figures and takes them in percentage terms so that one can relate them to the total level of activity in the community at any time and goes back to the year 1972-73, the year in which Labor assumed office, one finds that 20.6 per cent of the Federal Budget was related to what was called social security and welfare; that is, the activities of the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Labor that figure remained fairly constant at first. It represented 20.3 per cent of the Budget in 1973-74 and 20.8 per cent in 1974-75. There was a considerable jump to 23 per cent in 1975-76. However, one finds that in the first year of the Fraser Government the figure rose to 26.4 per cent. In the following year it rose to 27.8 per cent. There are some very minor dips but in the current year the estimate is for something over 28 per cent of the Federal Budget to be devoted to social security and welfare expenditure. In other words, over the 10-year period the figure goes from 20.6 per cent of the Budget to over 28 per cent. If one lumps together the other elements of social expenditure that were mentioned by Senator Button in his speech one finds that the figure has gone from 32 per cent to 43 per cent of the Federal Budget over that period. In other words, in those gross terms there has been a considerable move or shift of resources into those areas. Those figures do not take into account the recent very large increase which has been predicted in the payment of the unemployment benefit. In response to Senator Button, the additional $600m which has been recently forecast because of the jump of unemployment figures is not taken into account in the figures to which I have just referred. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks in more detail at what the Government has done in its period in office to change the social security system one finds the exact reverse, I believe, of the claim of growing inequity. I suppose the most significant example of that is the system of assistance to families which applied in 1975. In 1975, and for a very considerable period of Australia's history, the assistance to families was given by two means; firstly, by a comparatively modest level which was called child endowment and, secondly, by a tax concession to people with dependent children. That had the effect of delivering a certain amount of money support to families. But it had the extremely inequitable effect of delivering more support to well-off families than to poorer families. That was so because poorer families with low incomes-perhaps they were not paying tax or were paying very little tax-did not get benefit from the tax deductions. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the first measures taken by this Government was to introduce the family allowance which for the first time in Australia's history gave the same level of assistance to poorer families as was available to well-off families. I think that is a significant step in favour of equity. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent decisions by this Government in the welfare field reveal an interesting development of that aim at equity in the proposal that we are to introduce a family income supplement for employed families. One of the very odd inequities in Australia at the moment is that a man or a woman with a large number of dependent children who is capable of earning only a low wage may well be better off unemployed than employed. There are actual situations in which people find that their personal income is higher unemployed than employed. I think everyone would agree that that is inequitable and socially undesirable. The proposal that we should provide an income supplement to those low income working families to ensure that they are better off employed than unemployed represents a further step in trying to get a higher degree of equity into our assistance to families. I regard those as very good indicators of the concern that this Government has to try to get some fairness into the very large system of social security which we operate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another fundamental change which we have made in the welfare area. The great bulk of pensions and benefits are automatically adjusted for inflation twice a year. Many recommendations have been made to the Government by Professor Henderson and others who are concerned with the alleviation of hardship. One of the fundamental changes that were urged by Professor Henderson was that we should index basic benefits as a fundamental protection against hardship for those who are reliant on benefits. Under this Government we have moved, in respect of almost all pensions and benefits, to a system of automatic indexation . That is a very expensive commitment; it is a commitment to trying to have an essential fairness in the social security system. In respect of those elements of the system which have not been automatically indexed and which are the subject of some controversy as a result-for example, the single rate of unemployment benefit-I simply point to the fact that over the last three Budgets the Commonwealth has amended those benefits by an adjustment equivalent to indexation. So there has been that basic commitment to maintaining the purchasing power of pensions and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the debate has now shifted. It is said now at a time of rising earned incomes and average weekly earnings going up faster than inflation that we should make greater adjustments to maintain the relative purchasing power of pensions and benefits. I and the Government understand that argument. The difficulty is to find through taxes the very large additional amounts which would be required to institute that further, certainly very desirable, reform.</PARA>
<PARA> The other sorts of changes to which I would like to refer to illustrate the concern for fairness which I believe has motivated the Government to make changes to the social security system include the introduction of the supporting parents benefit and its extension to single male parents. That was a matter of concern in the community and it reflects a desire to ensure that those people who for reasons of having to care for children are unable to earn a living get some income maintenance from the Government. Over the course of the years following that further benefits have been extended. For example, pensioner health cover has been extended and if one looks at the position of the unemployed-sadly, a growing part of our social security system-one finds an extension of benefits in a way which tries to reduce what I have conceded is the unfairness involved in the distinctions between those in employment and those unemployed in our community. I point to the extension of health cover to that group and I point to the easing of the income test for the unemployed, which enables them to earn more in part time work without a reduction of benefit than was previously the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The record of increased social activity in social security is not merely a record of increased numbers; it is a record of changes which are aimed at producing a more equitable society. I suppose the most notable feature of the recent Budget was the attempt made by the Government to come to grips with some of the great inequities faced by the disabled in their attempt to share equally in the advantages of living in Australia. I point with some satisfaction to the steps-I describe them as steps only-along the road that we are to take in that area. I point to the introduction of a mobility allowance for the working or would be working disabled, to the experiment we are conducting with respect to attendant care and to the fact that we have tried to remove some of the disincentives which severely disabled Australians have with respect to entering employment as indicators of the concern of the present Government to have a society which is equitable, a society which is fair and a society which deals reasonably with those in the community who have least. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat in closing what I said earlier-the greatest single inequity is that we are not able to offer employment to all those who would seek it. We pursue economic objectives which remove that inequity but the pursuit of those objectives is not easy. We seek the co-operation of the whole community in pursuing that course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard the extraordinary claim by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in defence of his Government that because its policies, relentlessly pursued over seven years, have created massive unemployment and dependence on social security and have therefore required a great increase in spending by his Department, that increase is somehow a measure of the equity and fairness of this Government's policies. On the contrary, it is a measure of the growing inequities flowing from the failure of this Government to do as well as any comparable government running a comparable economy to ameliorate the effect of the world recession. Therefore, it is without any hesitation that I support this matter of public importance brought before the Senate by Senator Button.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to direct my remarks to those areas of concern to so many Australians, such as housing, health and education. The seven years of Fraser Government have led to glaring inequities in the access of Australians to those very basic services. In the area of housing, we see inequalities spawned and condoned by this Government which has failed utterly in its national responsibility to ensure decent, affordable housing for all Australians. Indeed, this Government abolished the Ministry for Housing in May of this year. It has failed to appoint a Minister since May to accept responsibility for ensuring that Australians have a fair and equal deal in getting access to housing. What sort of unequal society is condoned by this Government in that action? What sort of unequal society do we have when Mrs Sangster can purchase a $6m home on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour while hundreds of thousands of Australians live in the caravan parks which are becoming the permanent shanty settlements of many Australian families? They are mobile monuments to the indifference of this Government, which has not appointed a Minister of Housing to look after the concerns of these people. What sort of society of unequal dispersal of basic shelter is it when one-fifth of Australians live in the precarious world of dependence on the private rental accommodation market, not by choice but out of a necessity not comprehended by this Government? A letter to the Brisbane Courier-Mail earlier this year, among other things, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Recently, a block of flats, occupied mostly by old age pensioners, was bought by a group of young men, who promptly raised the rent three times in as many months. The tenants were told that if they didn't pay up, someone else would, and if they didn't like it they could get out. </PARA>
<PARA>That is happening time and again in Australia's private rental sector. The whole character of inner city areas throughout Australia is being changed. For example , in Waverley in Sydney 237 boarding houses have been demolished over the past seven years, displacing some 1,000 boarders, including unemployed people, poor, aged and disabled. They have been forced to flee that area in favour of the strata unit developments, with all their attendant high costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party will not shirk its responsibility. It will promote vigorously a higher level of security for private renters through initiatives to expand rental accommodation and through income assistance to renters who may be on social security or adult unemployment benefits for a period of over six weeks . A Labor government will ensure that those one in five Australians in the private rental market have their needs properly attended to. In regard to the diminishing public housing sector, we have a crippling contraction of funds from this Government to the States for this essential segment of the housing of Australians. In real terms moneys available from this Government have been reduced by over 70 per cent. We find that applications to rent public housing were up 15 per cent last year whereas the finance given by this Government to the States for that sector was only enough to build about half the number built some seven or eight years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We see a need for a 10-year program in order to get a decent level of national funding into this most important resource. Whilst the Government deals with the banking sector to increase the interest rates on housing loans-that is what was agreed to by this Government in March of this year; that is the March package about which Senator Chaney spoke-it backs down from its Budget promise to require the Reserve Bank of Australia to make available several hundreds of millions of dollars in order to move that money into the housing sector for all Australians. Just in the last two years of this Government home loan interest rates have increased from 9.5 per cent to 13.5 per cent, so that families who borrowed moneys at the margin of their income are now finding that they have to go without the necessities of life or abandon their homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney has the nerve to come into this chamber-it is to be entirely expected from this Government-and talk about a wages freeze. There is not a word about a freeze on rents, whether they are paid in the private or public sector. Of course this Government believes in market rents. There is not a word about a freeze on interest rates, which are harming the possibility of so many Australian families to get decent, affordable family homes. There is not a word about all the charges associated with housing, whether they be for rates, electricity or water, all of which make from a shelter a real home. That is the record of this callous and indifferent Government in relation to housing. Labor will certainly reverse that situation. It will accept its national responsibility and ensure that all Australians have an equal share in that essential social asset. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to health and this Government's record in creating inequity in relation to health care for all Australians. 'Surely', I hear honourable senators around the chamber saying, 'no Australian government would wish for anything except the most equal access by all its people to medical and hospital care'. But this Government bent its energies towards dismantling Medibank, the universal health scheme, the monument to Bill Hayden's toughminded compassion when Labor was in government. This Government blundered through four or five medibungles before finally destroying Medibank. Of course, it destroyed Medibank in contradiction of a promise made and a mandate gained from the Australian people to maintain it. Now a confused population finds itself confronted with the slogan: 'Healthy while wealthy'. </PARA>
<PARA> What would be a fair, equitable and even-handed scheme to raise Commonwealth funds to aid Australians seeking to consult their doctors, requiring hospital treatment for a severe illness, requiring hospital treatment after an accident at work or out on the highway, or trying to cope with a chronic disease such as asthma, arthritis or rheumatism? The answer to any fairminded observer would be some sort of universal health scheme with people or families paying at the rate of about 75c in every $100 of income. Thus a family on $300 a week might pay $2. 25 a week by way of levy, or a family with a household income of $300 a week might be required to pay $3.75 a week by way of levy. In this way all Australians earning a reasonable income, be it by way of wages or some other method, would pay the levy. We, as a society, would all contribute to the health care costs of one another. That would be fair and equitable. That is what the Australian Labor Party proposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, what do we have from this Fraser Government? This Government has devised a plan and it has said: 'Unless you are a pensioner and unless you hold a health benefit card, you must insure at rates of $14 or $15 a week to look after your family'. Of course those rates are continually rising. The Government has also said: 'If you do not privately insure, the Government will not assist you with the payment of your medical or hospital bills. Forget the fact that you are one of Australia's many taxpayers paying week by week out of your hard- earned moneys. None of the moneys that you so honestly contribute to the Treasury will come back to you should you have an ailment, should you have a traumatic accident or should you contract a chronic illness. You have to insure your family at $15 a week, be your income $100, $200 or $500 a week'. In other words, we have a flat rate premium system which is manifestly inequitable because one has to pay the same amount to insure one's family whatever one's income. I notice that even Government senators are nodding their heads in assent to that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In March this year over one-third of Australians did not have health insurance cover. The health card system itself is not covering those whom it ought to cover. An analysis in August this year revealed that only about 32,000 disadvantaged low income married couples were covered by the card system-for whatever reason, be it the stigma attached or the difficulty which can confront some people in filling out the forms. The result is that Australians are not receiving the health care that they should receive because they cannot afford either the health insurance or the outpatient charges. Honourable senators should not make any mistake; that is the situation under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Hospital Association records a dramatic fall in outpatients and casualty attendances. That is not due to a sudden upsurge in community health; it is because of this Government's ideological insistence that the user pays for health care. Of course, in adopting that principle the Government, until very recent times, has entirely neglected the fact that it is not the users of the health care system who determine the frequency and types of services of which they avail themselves; it is the providers, the dispensers, of those health services-the medical profession itself-who determine the level of the provision of those services. It is no surprise to learn that doctors have been milking the Australian community of about $100m a year through deliberate fraud and overservicing of patients. That is where the attention of the Government should be, and latterly has been, directed. But, unfortunately, it was hooked earlier on its ideological slogan 'The user pays' and the ordinary Australian has suffered. As a result, inequities have crept into our health care system. The Australian public is sighing for a return to the certainty, the simplicity, the compassion of Bill Hayden's Medibank. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the education of young Australians. If ever there were a facet of our social life which demanded equality of opportunity education is that area. Here the inequalities of parental income, ethnic background, sexist attitudes and geography should be swallowed up in the provision of educational resources of an accepted and common community standard. It should not matter which system of schooling-government or non-government-parents choose. That choice should not carry penalties for any Australian child in the availability to that child of adequate resources, be they in the form of capital works or recurrent expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the situation in relation to government schooling? Under the Fraser Government the Commonwealth commitment to government schools has nose-dived with the Commonwealth's contribution to the recurrent costs of those schools falling from 10 per cent to 7 per cent. Government schools are now receiving $111m a year less under this Government. The Australian Labor Party, on coming to government, will negotiate with the States and the State education authorities to ensure that an additional $111m over three years flows to improve the conditions in government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that some 80 per cent of non-government schools are in the most needy category and operate at unacceptably low levels of resources. On average they have access to only one-half of the resources available to the wealthiest non-government schools. The Labor Party is most insistent that, in government, it will work co-operatively with the non-government sector to assist with the improvement of those most needy schools. An additional $16m will be made available in the first full year of this program. That is one measure of the assistance that a Labor government will make available to ensure the equality of all our children, whichever educational institution their parents choose for them. That choice, which all parties in Australia respect, should not carry with it a consignment to a school with a low level of educational resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The Schools Commission will be called upon by the incoming Labor Government to establish that community standard for school resources based on the level of resources available in comparable government schools. I could go on and give further examples of how an incoming Labor government will ensure that, for example, all Australian school children have a full grounding in the new technology-technology which will give them access to jobs and, indeed, fuller social and leisure time activities by ensuring that they are all capable of handling computers. For example, a Labor government will initiate a new program to ensure that all government secondary schools have computer equipment within three years. Following discussions with the non-government sector the program will be extended to needy non-government schools. We will also make a valiant effort to halt the drop-out rate in secondary schools which has grown alarmingly in the panic to get a shrinking number of jobs. I do not have time to outline our positive proposals in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I have made it very clear that fairness and equality of opportunity in access to housing, health care and education is what it is all about. The people of Australia, the people in the public gallery-I notice that they are from all parts of Australia, including Western Australia-understand that that is what it is all about. Most Australians sense that this Government is not concerned with achieving those objectives. This Government believes that market forces and the user-pays principle should determine the access of Australians to decent and affordable homes, to caring and timely health care, to education for their children. After seven years of this Government's social program it all rings terribly hollow. The Government's proposal for a 12-month wages freeze will aggravate those inequities. Of course, there are international factors at work, but this Government is manifestly doing the worst of all comparable countries in seeking to soften the impact of that recession on its people. The Labor Party, on coming to office, will reverse that trend and will help to rebuild the egalitarian Australia in which most of us, against the odds of the last seven years, still believe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is probably no worse factor that works towards inequity in any society than unemployment. At present we all face the very considerable problem of unemployment. This is caused by many factors. That has been acknowledged very clearly in the course of the debate today. It is absolutely certain-this was well acknowledged by Senator Button in his introductory remarks-that one of the chief causes of unemployment has been the vast rises in real wages in this country in recent years which have led to an outstripping of wage rises in other countries, and an inability of this country to compete on world markets. That has two effects. It not only makes it more difficult for Australians to sell their goods on world markets but also opens the possibility of other countries being able to sell their goods on Australian markets in competition with Australian-produced products. We are facing that sort of competition today. It has been brought about clearly, indirectly perhaps , by our own actions in simply overpaying ourselves so considerably. I draw the attention of honourable senators to an editorial on page one of yesterday's Australian Financial Review. It is an unusual editorial for the Australian Financial Review. The paper saw fit to draw attention to the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is simply the truth that the only way in which Australia can cope with falling real income per head and move to a return to growing per capita income is by combining effective policies to promote growth with an acceptance of the inevitability of a fall in real wages. </PARA>
<PARA>The point at issue is clear; that is, whether we are prepared to take short term cuts in our standard of living in order to provide and pay for jobs for the unemployed. There is no clearer way in which we can solve the current difficulties of inequity for the unemployed-those who are clearly without jobs as against those who have jobs-than to try, by this means, to solve the very important problem of unemployment that affects so many Australians. What is this Government doing about that? Some very major steps have been taken by the Government in the last few months to meet that problem. At present we advocate a wage pause. We are going to a Premiers Conference next Tuesday in order to encourage the Premiers to join with the Commonwealth Government, private employers and trade unions in seeking a 12-month pause in wage growth in order to ensure that there is a decrease in the rate of increase in our cost structure . This will lead to a better competitive position on world markets, thereby providing more jobs for Australians. That is the Government's objective. It is clearly spelled out in our correspondence with the various States and in Press statements. The Premiers, by and large, are accepting these propositions. The chambers of manufactures, the employer organisations, and to a guarded but significant extent, the workers' organisations, the unions and particularly the Australian Council of Trade Unions are taking a very real interest in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It was acknowledged here today by Senator Button on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that in fact wage moderation will be a significant contribution to the improvement of the job situation in this country. I will quote one other comment, which was made by the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. We received its newsletter only this week. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> More than 936,000 Australians-one in every eight people in the workforce-will be unemployed by 1990 unless there is a wages pause in the months ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important issue which needs to be taken up. There is no better way of re-establishing equity for the unemployed in this country than by adopting this most reasonable approach. In order to support this approach, to assist further families who may be having considerable difficulties and to provide further equity within the tax structure, the Budget has provided significant tax benefits to the net effect of the home interest rebate of a round $17 a week, the expansion of the dependent spouse rebate where families are involved and the changes in the tax rate structure, including the reduction in the tax rate from 32 per cent to 30 per cent for incomes between $4,595 and about $19,500 and, of course, the lifting of the levels at which higher tax rates are paid. The Government is contributing to families' incomes in a real way so that they will be able to cope better with the difficulties ahead. This applies to those people who will experience significant difficulties in coping with the cost of living increases in the current year. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button has drawn our attention to certain difficulties within the tax structure. He has drawn our attention to the increasing burden of tax which is being carried by the pay-as-you-earn income earner. That is a significant point to make. Indeed he knows, as do all honourable senators, the very considerable problems that have arisen in this country in the last 10 years or so in respect of tax avoidance and tax evasion. It was only yesterday that we debated significant government legislation which was aimed at increasing the amount of tax that may be recouped from those who have fraudulently evaded tax. I think it is significant that we should place on record the Government's measures in this regard over the years. There has been a very significant effort on the part of this Government to ensure that the tax legislation is tightened up in such a way as to place significant limitations on the ability of people to pay what might be called 'optional taxation'. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a list of legislative amendments that have been made to the income tax legislation in recent years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The list is very considerable. Included on it are the significant measures relating to Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act which sought to get around the very real difficulties that have been raised in recent years in respect of section 260 of that Act which had been interpreted by courts in various places as not applying in situations in which, to that time, it might have been sought to have done so. That list shows very clearly what has been done by this Government. There has been very significant correspondence between this Government, private senators and the taxation industry and the tax evasion industry has been very largely killed as a result of the activities of the Government in recent times. In no way can the Government be accused of fostering inequity in the terms of the matter of public importance which was submitted by the Opposition in this place. The Government has taken action in order to ensure that inequities in the income tax legislation are closed to ensure that people carry the true share of their burden and contribute to the total wealth of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us just consider the argument Senator Button put forward in respect of indirect taxation. He sought to make the point that there was a considerable growth in indirect taxation in recent years compared with direct taxation. In 1976-77, some five years ago, 28.8 per cent of taxation was being contributed from indirect sources. But this amount has risen only to a very minor extent to 29.9 per cent. It is an increase of a little over one per cent in that five-year period. This is notwithstanding that over this period there have been very significant changes in the way in which we have assessed taxation on oil profits . Any honourable senator will acknowledge that there has been significant growth in the amount of money sought from the oil producers in this country. Consequently, the greatest part of even that relatively small rise of 1.1 per cent stems from the oil levy. It is certainly not a direct tax upon the people by way of sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> One can see then that, significantly, that argument falls to the ground. If one takes time to compare the direct taxation that has been levied against individuals since 1976-77 with this year one will see that the proportion of tax being collected has in fact decreased slightly, from 56.3 per cent to 56.2 per cent of total revenues. On that ground again there is no demonstrable evidence that significant inequities are occurring as a result of Government activity in the way in which it is expressed in the matter of public importance before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that the Commonwealth Government is not the only source of indirect taxes or the only body raising taxes generally. State governments are very active in this area. I draw attention to the recent Budget in Victoria in which the Cain Government sought to increase taxation, as it is officially described-and there are some problems in relation to this description in State Budgets. In that Budget the amount of taxation as such for families increased by $7 a week. In addition to that, there have been significant additions to costs for levies and contributions to State authorities, amounting to $9 a week. Those things represent very significant costs to the community and to individual families. The cost of the Cain Budget to industry in Victoria was estimated to be of the order of $450m. Can anybody say that that will improve the capacity of industry in Victoria to compete with overseas nations or with other States? Will that help to employ more people in Victoria? Clearly the Cain Government has a very definite responsibility in this area which it seems to be denying. But in any case I make the point that, if indirect taxes are the guide as to what is a reasonable way in which to raise revenue without affecting the equity of individuals in the community, the Cain Government sees no reason why it should digress from charging taxes of the kinds that it does across the board. It has done so very significantly in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the total scene that we see before us in Australia at present, we acknowledged, in the first place, that there has been significant growth in the amount of wages paid in this country. In fact, male employees on award wages have had increases of 14.5 per cent in recent times. That figure applies to the last financial year. Compare that with the inflation rate of 10.4 per cent. So there has been a very significant gain in real wages for wage earners. In 1980- 81 there was a wage increase of 13.5 per cent as against 9.4 per cent inflation. I make the point that wage earners have been doing very well in recent times. The problem now is how we address our difficulties by ensuring that wage increases will not continue at such a high rate. Rather we should seek to ensure that our efforts and our major thrusts are directed towards getting jobs for the unemployed. This Government remains committed to ensuring that equity within this country is maintained. We will be seeking equity for the unemployed by the very measures that we have outlined, through the wages pause and what we introduced in the Budget this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see from this morning's Press that the Minister for Trade and Resources, Mr Anthony, thinks we are in for a major 1930s type depression. That is certainly a view coming from very near the top in the Government. I suppose that had to be said at some stage. None of us like that thought. But if indeed it comes to that situation I think we had best face up to it and make sure that, as a united community, we trim our sails to the storm. That, I think, makes the matter of public importance that the Australian Labor Party has brought forward today of considerable significance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like Senator Messner I read the lengthy editorial in the Australian Financial Review yesterday. I thought it was a very thoughtful piece. It is rather interesting that when two people read something in a newspaper they take different things from it. I thought that one of the most significant points in that editorial was the statement that a major task ahead of us all is to share equally among the community the burden of perhaps an inevitable fall in the national standard of living. That of course is not the case now. I believe that also justifies support for this debate on the increasing inequities in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats see two urgent requirements. The first and most important is to do the best we can to maintain prosperity in this country. No assumption should be made that because the world sinks into deeper depression we must also do so and to the same extent. Fundamentally we are a wealthy nation in the things that count. Although we are oppressed by drought at the moment, when the drought ends, as it must do and, it is hoped, soon, our natural position as a major primary producer will re-emerge. Of course, whatever the demand for our minerals might be overseas, the fact is not altered that we are a resource rich country and certainly are better equipped than most world communities to weather out any kind of economic storm that lies ahead. Our basic infrastructure is certainly lavish in world terms. Hence, one can only deplore any tendency towards a mood of abject pessimism, either in the Government or the community. What is needed is a constructive mood of optimism. We must see that our internal , social and economic structure is maintained as best we can and accept the fact that our income from foreign trade will be down. That may be regrettable but it is not a disaster. It is something to which we can adapt intelligently and the challenge is on the Government to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the first and most urgent necessities in this task of adapting is an effective approach to the problem of growing unemployment. This is a matter that a number of speakers in this debate have touched on. I do not believe that it is good enough to say that there will be a continuous period, as far ahead as we can see, in which there will not be jobs for everybody who wants them and then use this as some sort of weird justification for doing nothing or very little about unemployment, for throwing up one's hands and saying that it is something that is inevitable in the circumstances. We should have learned from experience that unemployment, especially the much higher youth unemployment that is now a world problem, is a social cancer of enormous significance and with enormous shadows cast forward into the future. We cannot have a situation in which even one person who might have got work does not have work because that one person may be yet another who is compelled by desperation or fear or disappointment to adopt some sort of twisted, warped life in the future which will contribute to that person's misery and also to the social problems of the community. The rising crime rate and the rising suicide rate among the young unemployed is already marked and it is probably much more important than the economic consequences of unemployment which, at the moment, this country can still afford . Yes, we can afford to pay the dole to these people. There is still plenty of money around. But that, I suggest, is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that everyone who wants work should be given work, even if it is part time work or a shared job. Every individual should then be seen not as a statistic but as an individual with an individual's problem to solve. The unions , the Government and the employers should co-operate urgently now, not later, to see that social and legal mechanisms are made as flexible as possible to permit sharing of jobs by two people, if they wish, and part time work if they wish. These are very much two aspects of the same thing but I think there is a great demand for them in the community. I have talked many times, while travelling around the country in several States, to young married women working on production lines in factories. I have found that what most of them hate most about their work is the fact that they are compelled to work for five days a week. They say that their children suffer for it and that their husbands do not like it because they are never there to get the work done. The employers of the women to whom I have spoken say that they would much prefer a situation in which the women could work for a shorter time because those young women do not last in the job. They work only for two or three months and buy their refrigerator or washing machine or whatever it is they want. They do not go on with the job because they are exhausted. The employer has the task of again training a new person. The whole situation is crazy and uneconomic. It does not work out and it is not wanted by any of the participants. One would have thought that this being the case, it would not have been beyond the capacity of unions, government and employers to see that something is done to correct it, thereby giving people some hope. It is much better for a person to work some of the time than not at all; it is much better for a person's morale; it is much better for the country now and in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I have been pressing recently, as the Democrats spokesman in this field of employment, for an urgent re-assessment of some of the conditions under which the dole is paid. I believe this must come quickly and would be beneficial . I suggested to Senator Chaney earlier this week by way of a question-I reiterate it today-that it is wrong and unfair that persons on the dole can earn only $10 a week before they start being financially penalised. In his speech earlier in this debate Senator Chaney made much of the fact that there had been some liberalisation of this situation. He did not mention the figures, nor that they had been increased from $6 to $10 a week. I recall that was done in 1980. I think when the situation is fairly stated it can be seen as one which is very bad for the community and for the people concerned. For instance, a single age pensioner is allowed to earn $30 a week before there is any penalty and loss of pension. That is a much more realistic figure. Nobody will do even a single day' s work for $10. I think it is incredible and unrealistic that anybody should expect that, but a person might do a day's work for $30 or $40. I suggest that in practice this liberalisation would cost Consolidated Revenue very little. I think that people just do not bother to go out now to the work and the dole is paid regardless. If they were allowed to work, the cost to Revenue, I think, would be very small indeed. On the other side of the coin, the incentive to make a little more money would significantly increase the spending power of the 500, 000 unemployed who are a major economic factor in the community. The fact that they are on the bread line to the extent that they can afford only the barest of possible necessities is having a deleterious effect on business throughout the country. One would have thought that those with the most limited intelligence in the Government would be capable of appreciating this. Certainly the businessmen I have spoken to are capable of appreciating it and they would want something like this. There is an indication of how far the Government is out of touch, even with the people it believes are supporting it. The Government might have some surprises in store for it there too. All business would benefit from that liberalisation, especially small business; so we ask the Goverment to look at that matter as soon as it can. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which I raised with Senator Chaney by way of question, and which I will raise again, is what I see as the appalling continuing situation in which the dole supplement for each child in a family remains at only $10. I ask any mother or father or anyone who has had anything to do with the upbringing of children, especially these days, to consider how well they are going to feed, house and clothe a child-housing is a problem because one has to have more rooms in a unit and so on because all the children cannot be put into one big room-on $10 a week. Any mother or father knows it is not possible to buy the barest necessities for a child for that amount. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats are greatly concerned that the health of a generation of our children who, after all, are not to blame for this economic problem, will suffer if families, especially large families, are forced to go on existing in this dreadful fashion of absolute penury. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that many welfare agencies which helped these families in the past with food-they had to help them with food to make sure that they even got enough to eat-now do not have the means to do so. This is an increasing problem in the community which I believe the Government should take into account when it is looking at this question of how much more a person can earn. I think it is important to the self-respect of those people who are unemployed that they feel they are allowed to contribute something material to their own welfare and that of their families. </PARA>
<PARA> To revert to the question of the health of the children concerned, there is an interesting article in this morning's Canberra Times on one of the very good surveys being presented at the Australian Nutrition Society's annual conference. It is a survey conducted by two lecturers from the Queensland Institute of Technology which has found:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that a substantial percentage of schoolchildren have no meat, milk or eggs in their daily diet and their chief source of food is high-sugar breakfast cereal. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that cereal is cheap. The point is made in this article that a good deal of this is possibly due to the fact that parents are not informed about what is good nutrition. But it is a fact also that the shortage of money, especially among the unemployed, is contributing. One of the persons mentioned in this survey said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that as a result the children were underweight, with a large proportion of the older children grossly underweight, and many were under-achieving at school. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Forty per cent of the children were from single-parent families, so obviously meat is too expensive for them to buy, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of society which we are now beginning to take for granted. Forty per cent of our children are from single parent families and many of them find it impossible to afford meat. This is the case in Australia. We are not talking about Singapore or Thailand-this is Australia. That is a situation which we apparently are prepared to tolerate. This person, who has done this responsible survey of 265 children, said as a considered statement:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government should consider re-introducing free milk for children in primary schools and could look at the possibility of subsidising cheaper meat for those in need. </PARA>
<PARA>It is grossly inhumane to allow the situation to continue. The Democrats, like other parties, are gravely concerned at the mounting bill for unemployment benefits, but we feel that this is a special case which needs attention. We believe it is an investment in the future if we are not to have a completely crooked and unhealthy generation growing up in this way through no fault of its own. </PARA>
<PARA> I return briefly to the problem of a special and fast growing group, those young people who have never worked simply because they have no work experience and who find that the jobs always go to people who have work experience-a catch- 22 situation which is not good enough. Tens of thousands of this year's school leavers will join hundreds of thousands of young people in this position. I have many reservations about the value of job creation schemes, which are good public relations and perhaps give the impression that something is being done. But unless they are very carefully devised and directed to basic development of a vital nature I think their economics can well be seen to be suspect. But the young unemployed who have never worked, I believe to be a special case. I have talked with many of them at drop-in centres around the country about this problem. Virtually all of them have said that they do not feel they can get jobs . Even if they could, they feel that their self-esteem has been depressed to the extent that they could not compete in the ordinary private enterprise market. They feel that they are not good enough. They would, however, like to do work within their own peer group-where there is some training element, even on low wages-that was of some importance and value and which would allow them to get work experience so they could go on and do something else. I believe some sort of job creation scheme in this area is urgently necessary in Australia. It should have been introduced years ago for these young people and given them some hope rather than allowing them to remain permanently in a state of pessimism, depression and despair, which has driven many, as we know, to suicide. It is a gross indictment of the Government that it has not done anything like that, either because it does not care, or because it is indifferent or too lazy to do it. It is one of those three things; no other possibility exists. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned before the gifted and brilliant scheme introduced by President Roosevelt-his 'New deal program for unemployed youth-a model for today'. I quote briefly from Contemporary Review, an article by Anne Lanyer, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> Roosevelt was elected in November 1932 and took office on March 4 1933. Twenty- seven days later only his Bill creating the Civilian Conservation Corps passed Congress. The CCC proved to be a design capable of dealing with the normal by- products of doing business in modern industrial society, unemployment and pollution. The CCC fought dust bowl conditions on the Great Plains and helped restore the bread basket of the world fertility. It planted two billion trees, half the number ever planted in the US, in an ambitious reafforestation shelter belt project. It built or improved Federal, State, municipal parks including such familiar landmarks as Central Park in New York, Yellowstone, Yosemite, the Petrified Forest, the Grand Canyon. Ultimately the Corps became an all-purpose work force working under some 25 different Federal agencies and carrying out a wide range of tasks, fighting forest fires, flood relief, restoring old forts, anything in the public interest which the profit and wages sector of the economy could not get done or would not provide for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that Senator Mason, in discussing the matter of public importance today alleging inequities under the Fraser Government, did not get around to a subject dear to the heart of one of his party colleagues-protectionism. He was talking about other matters. I would have been interested to hear his views on protectionism, especially as he referred to yesterday's editorial in the Australian Financial Review. I was very interested in today's editorial in the Australian Financial Review. However, Senator Mason, belonging to the Australian Democrats, a party whose policies are determined by the lobbyists of the day, might be prepared to listen to the warning which I sound for him and which is from the Australian Financial Review editorial of today, 2 December. I will extract passages from the editorial. The editorial, in talking about unemployment rates, states that they provide:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . a tailor-made opportunity for the advocates of a quick protection fix, with the chance to blame Australia's current economic ills on a flood of cheap manufactures from low-cost countries, or of dumped manufactured items from high- cost ones. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial continues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . these protection panaceas need to be firmly resisted, as short term, counter-productive and inadequate responses to the worsening situation in which the Australian economy finds itself. </PARA>

<PARA>Today I was pleased to hear Senator Button, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, agreeing that there should be a wages pause. I commend this editorial to his perusal. For Senator Mason's interest I quote from the finish of the editorial:</PARA>

<PARA>I quote that with approval. Earlier today Senator Tate referred to poverty in Australia. I quote with approval from another editorial in the Australian Financial Review. On 12 August it stated:</PARA>

<PARA>As we run into the situation of four elections being held in Victoria this weekend, I hope that the people of Victoria are listening to what I am saying. I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is the common belief of the Australian electorate that somebody else can be made to pay. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial continued:</PARA>
<PARA> But the hard truth is that unemployment is the fault, for the most part, of those who enjoy secure employment and demand higher remuneration; and poverty is the fault of those who will not accept that a high income imposes a social obligation to pay taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate spent 90 per cent of his time talking about ALP policies. I do not think he gave the people of Australia a real analysis of the ALP's policies. Therefore, I give them my analysis of the policies adopted in July 1982. The first point is that the Labor Party has maintained its socialist objective. The Labor policy stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange-</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, words were added to modify the statement, for example the word ' democratic' in talking about the extent of the socialisation. In fact, that is more verbiage; the Labor Party has maintained its socialist objective. The ALP went further in talking about adopting 'an expanded interventionist role by Government'. The word 'interventionist' indicates that the Labor Party believes that governments know best and that people do not know how to manage their own affairs, that people need to be controlled. The Labor Party in its platform went on to say that it would intervene and use instruments which include consultation . I do not suppose there would be any objection to consultation. However, the Labor Party was not satisfied with that. The platform statement continued:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . regulation, government procurement programs, public-private sector competition-</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this would involve setting up a public government instrumentality such as Trans Australia Airlines in competition with the private sector. Of course, that means that taxpayers would have to subsidise the public competition. The policy statement continued:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . joint public-private sector ownership and public ownership, including nationalisation. </PARA>
<PARA>This is regulation and control expanded at length. The Labor Party talks about adopting a social wage. The only experience I know of in relation to a social wage is that of Great Britain in the period 1974 to 1979. I will quote from a book by Joel Barnett, who was the Labour Chief Secretary to the Treasury in the 1974 to 1979 period, called Inside the Treasury which I thoroughly recommend to all interested in politics. At page 49 he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . we co-operated-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, with the trade union movement-</PARA>
<PARA>under the terms of the quaintly titled Social Contract-</PARA>
<PARA>This is very similar to what the ALP is talking about in Australia today, very similar to the ALP policy. I repeat, Mr Barnett stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . we co-operated under the terms of the quaintly titled Social Contract, supposedly enshrining a new relationship between government and unions. To my mind the only give and take in the contract was that the Government gave and the unions took. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Barnett continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to recall the employment situation in the autumn of 1974, as we prepared for the Budget. Unemployment-</PARA>
<PARA>In Great Britain-</PARA>
<PARA>then was a little under 640,000 . . . It rose at one point to 1.5 million, and was kept to around that level only by spending huge sums of money on so-called special employment measures-a euphemism for subsidies to firms so that they should keep on staff they would otherwise have made redundant. It was estimated by 1978 that those subsidies were preventing-</PARA>
<PARA>An additional 400,000 people joining the unemployment scene. As if that is not bad enough, on page 51 he referred to an average earnings growth of 27 per cent. In other words, inflation was sky-rocketing in Great Britain under the social contract scheme. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We were, after all, still in the middle of the disastrous 'Social Contract'. </PARA>
<PARA>This is interesting. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It may have helped to secure our election victory but it did nothing to prevent -some would argue that it ensured-the 27 per cent growth in earnings. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the sort of policy which the Labor Party adopted in its platform in July of this year. It is the sort of policy which it would inflict on Australia if it were elected. I hope that the people of Victoria understand that if they elect ALP candidates to form a Federal government this is the sort of proposal they can expect to be implemented in this nation. I continue by saying that the ALP policy adopts a proposal of automatic full quarterly indexation of wages-in other words, built-in inflation. That has failed in France and in the United Kingdom and it has failed previously in Australia. If the ALP ever gets into government in this country we will again see that fail in Australia. Yet it is part of the Labor Party's platform which it is bound to adopt if it ever gets into government. As far as personal taxation is concerned, the ALP is committed to an increase in the progessivity of the personal income tax system-in other words, more personal income tax. It is committed also to reducing the relative incidence of indirect taxation-the very opposite of what my side of politics thinks is right for the people of Australia. If the Labor Party got into office it would increase personal income tax and reduce indirect taxation. I ask the ALP: Where would the revenue come from to provide the welfare and services that this nation requires when all Australians finally decide it is not worth earning anything more than some basic sum and that profitability has become a dirty word once again? The Labor Party, of course, proposes a capital gains tax. One of these days it will tell us what that will be. But much more significant at this stage is that it proposes immunity of unions and unionists from the law. Its platform states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . this right entails the right to take industrial action without pains and penalties . . . </PARA>
<PARA> An ALP government would take immediate action to repeal penalties for industrial action. I know that the Labor Party does not like to hear these things quoted because it does not want the people of Australia to understand--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I said before, the Australian Labor Party does not wish the people of Victoria, who are coming up to an election, to understand what its policies are. The ALP is quite satisfied that the trade union movement believes that the political strike is acceptable. Its platform states that it would recognise that the legitimate role of the trade union is not limited to legally defined industrial matters. In other words , it is quite happy for the trade union movement to strike about matters which do not concern pay, conditions and safety. School teachers could strike about the building of a bridge. All sorts of nonsense is quite acceptable to the ALP and, as I said, these matters are immune from the law. The ALP has a proposal which provides that the Senate may delay legislation for up to six months but not reject any other proposed law. Who is going to control the ALP when it gets into government? Certainly no one if it gets its opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ALP, which carries its flag all over the place, has proposed a new flag and other measures to divide the nation. It proposes a nationalist socialist newspaper which would be paid for with taxpayers' funds. The ALP member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) estimates the creation of about 120 new statutory authorities which would control every aspect of the daily lives of the people of Australia. I thoroughly reject the proposal before us and I hope that the people of Victoria have heard the matters which I have raised today about the ALP's policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise the question of the Omega navigation station in Gippsland which, as all honourable senators are aware, was the scene of disgraceful riots on 21 November. The so-called peaceful demonstration involved people arriving with grappling hooks and trying to tear down the fences surrounding the station. Their objective was quite clearly violence. This incident brought up two quite separate issues. One was the way in which, as justification for their behaviour, the demonstrators brought up allegations about the role of Omega which, I thought, had been disproved convincingly years ago. They repeated them despite evidence that they were quite false accusations, and they seemed unable to comprehend reality. Of course none are so blind as those who will not see.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second issue the demonstration brought up was that some of the people campaigning against Omega appeared to be doing it on a tax deductible basis, paid for by the taxpayer with donations to these organisations channelled through the Australian Conservation Foundation. I have asked the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to give me information of the organisations to which the Australian Conservation Foundation is channelling tax deductible donations. When I have the list I will have more to say on the matter. It does bring up whether the Australian Conservation Foundation is a sufficiently responsible organisation to continue to be allowed to receive tax deductible donations. As I say, I will examine that matter further when I have all the information on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the issue of Omega, a navigational device. It is necessary, because of the allegations that are being made, to restate some of the facts about this system. In the Omega network eight stations provide world wide coverage. In order to fix a ship or aircraft it is necessary to receive transmissions from three of the stations. A fix achieved by these methods will give an accuracy, to a ship or an aircraft using an Omega receiver, of about 2 kilometres varying slightly depending on the propagation conditions. The Omega systems use very low frequencies. The reason for this is a physical one. It is the only frequency which can give the necessary fadeless, world-wide cover. One of the features of low frequency has caused a great deal of confusion, and some accusations have been made about it by the rioters. One of the physical features of very low frequency is that, in addition to its ability to provide fadeless cover, it will penetrate the surface of the sea. A submerged submarine at a depth of about 30 feet can receive VLF signals. That has been the basis for some of the wild accusations that have been made, but I will deal with those in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Omega system is a great advance in navigation. A child, after one hour's instruction, could fix a ship or an aircraft with an accuracy of 2 kilometres. Receivers are cheap; they cost only a few thousand dollars. A fix can be attained at any time of the day or night. Compare Omega with the system that it superseded, the old sextant; which fixed on stars or the sun. A ship could get a star fix only at sunset or sunrise if there was no cloud cover. Using the sun it takes several hours for a ship to obtain a fix. The Omega system is an enormous advance in ocean navigation, nevertheless it has its limitations. Its accuracy of two kilometres roughly, means that it can be used only for ocean navigation. It cannot be used in confined waters where there are many dangers. Of course warships and military aircraft use Omega. It is a very good navigational device. Any competent navigator uses whatever navigational aids he can find. Satellites, lighthouses, radar, echo-sounders, astronomical fixes with sextants and passive bearings on radio beacons are all used. They are all navigational aids and Omega is only another one of them. It is a very good one, but only another one of them . It is not intended for use in war. It might remain operational in war but that , I think, is doubtful. Of the eight stations three must be within range so that a fix can be obtained. Normally in any part of the world there would be three and sometimes four. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the locations in which the stations are set. They are set in Argentina, Japan, Liberia, Norway, Reunion-a French territory in the Indian Ocean-Australia, Hawaii and North Dakota. They are all nationally manned. They could, of course, if the country concerned decided to do so, be switched off. I do not think they would be. Navigational aids in war have normally been left running but one could never be sure, if one were using them for military planning purposes, that one would have the necessary cover. In the case of Australia, for instance the manning of the Omega station in Gippsland is done by six radio technicians, all Australian. No Americans are in any way involved with the manning or control of the Omega station in Gippsland. The six radio technical employees-that is, all the employees there-work for the Department of Transport and Construction and report to the State regional office of that Department. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of this, by what methods have people tried to raise fears about the Omega navigation station? How have they tried to argue that it might be or would be, as some of them have done, a nuclear target? The first way in which they have tried is by using the fact that a submarine can use Omega. I was a member of the joint committee that heard some evidence about this matter. Some people who were remarkably ignorant of navigation tried to use the argument that ballistic missile firing submarines-American ones particularly-would use Omega as a integral part of the missile delivery system from nuclear submarines. I would have thought that this argument was adequately destroyed by the report of the joint committee. The fact is that ballistic missile firing submarines would not use Omega for missile launch. The two kilometre accuracy is quite inadequate for their purpose and very much more sophisticated navigational devices are used for missile launch. There is no way in which anyone with any technical knowledge would regard Omega as an integral part of the missile launching system of nuclear submarines of the United States of America or any other country. </PARA>
<PARA> Faced with what I would have thought was incontrovertible evidence on this issue the people, desperate to try to find some way in which Omega could be dangerous and could be a target, shifted their argument to the American attack submarines which are designed to deal with the Russian missile firing submarines . They argued that these attack submarines used Omega stations-of course they do -and therefore the Russians might take out the Omega system in order to eliminate the risk to the Russian missile firing submarines of these American attack submarines. This again shows a most extraordinary ignorance of the way in which these submarines would be operating. The Russian misile firing submarines would be in danger only if an American attack submarine were in contact with it at the critical moment when the Russians proposed to launch an attack. Now, if that submarine were in contact with a Russian missile firing submarine its navigational position would be irrelevant. The only significant thing would be its relationship to the Russian submarine. Whether or not Omega was attacked would make not the slightest difference to the effectiveness of that American attack submarine in that role. Of course, the Russians know all this. They have their own Omega-type chain. Nevertheless, the argument, which I think is a very discreditable one, is frequently advanced and accepted, apparently, by some gullible people. </PARA>
<PARA> The third line of attack, the third way of trying to find some way in which this Omega navigation station is sinister is to say: 'Ah, but it is used as a communications station. It communicates with submarines'. It is technically feasible for an Omega station which has a very low frequency transmitter to transmit messages. It is not designed to do so but possibly it could be secretly modified to do so although certainly the people operating at the station would know about it. The problems of doing this are so enormous that it would be quite absurd to contemplate its being done. First of all, all people using Omega receivers could or would be aware that messages were being transmitted on them. Secondly, if we want to use a communications station we have to have arrangements whereby the message we wish to be sent arrives promptly, is encrypted and re-transmitted. Anyone who went to a station such as the one at the North-West Cape which is designed to communicate with submarines would see the elaborate arrangements that are necessary before one can use such a place as an efficient relay for communications, for messages. There are no such arrangements at Gippsland. The Gippsland station is wide open. Anyone can visit it if he wants to. There is no way in which it could be used as a useful relay station for messages. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of all this, why is the campaign going on? It is damaging because if it were believed it would cause unnecessary fears for the people who live in that area of Gippsland. It is, as I think I have established, although I could go into more detail if I had time, patent technical nonsense to say that these roles, which I have suggested are being put forward, are in any way credible. I do not believe that the leaders of this campaign believe all this nonsense. The only basis I can find for their campaign is anti-American feeling. That is what they are on about. They think Omega is in some way American and that therefore they must campaign against it. They use these arguments to convince the gullible . They do not believe them themselves. That is what is behind the campaign. It is solely a sort of mindless anti-Americanism. This is where one is concerned about the strong left wing element in the Labor Party in Victoria which is causing this trouble. We saw it some time ago when the new Premier of Victoria, Mr Cain, in a very weird intervention into foreign policy, tried to ban the visits of American ships. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He might have got good ratings from the gullible, but it was a very foolish action. For one thing the Premier of Victoria has no responsibility for foreign affairs, as he ultimately admitted. Secondly, he tried to ban a ship because the Americans would not tell him whether it was carrying nuclear weapons . If we are going to carry on that line, we would be banning the ships from Britain, France, India and, I suppose, the Soviet Union, although honourable senators opposite probably would not ban the Soviet ships. This was an absurd intervention by an ignorant State Premier into matters that had nothing to do with him. I think it was very damaging to our reputation as a country with good common sense. This is the real danger of this campaign against Omega. It is a mindless campaign built solely around a few people who are viciously anti- American. Their aim is merely to be destructive. They damage Australia's reputation as a stable and sensible country. After all, Australia is one of the great overseas trading nations of the world. Omega is a valuable navigational aid for people involved in international traffic. I think, as a country which lives and prospers by international trade, we should be delighted to be a home for such a valuable international navigational system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity on the first reading of these money Bills to refer again to the question of the embezzlement of Australian taxpayers' funds in Australian embassies. I am brought to this point again by a Press release which the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) published last weekend. It was carried in the Melbourne Age. I wish to quote a couple of paragraphs from the Press release. He states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Street, said yesterday that continued attacks in the Senate on senior members of his department were an abuse of parliamentary privilege. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Street said yesterday that smearing the reputation of public servants under the protection of parliamentary privilege was contrary to the spirit of the Westminster system. </PARA>
<PARA>I deny that. I deny that at any time I smeared public servants. All I have sought from public servants have been the facts of the issue. So many conflicting stories have appeared before me that I am convinced that as yet I do not have the facts on this matter. Furthermore, if public servants will not come clean on the issue they can only expect further attacks. If public servants such as Mr Henderson, the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, can come into this place and use parliamentary privilege to distort the facts about the Tehran Embassy case and question the integrity of other officers, I shall continue to use my privilege in this place to air the matter, and all of Mr Street's Press releases, which I see as an attempt to sidetrack the issue, will be in vain. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Henderson told Estimates Committee D on 10 September that only one officer-namely, Mr Witheford-was involved in the exposure of this matter he, Mr Henderson, told a lie. That lie is nailed in the letter signed by two Foreign Affairs officers-namely, Messrs Witheford and Henne-which Senator McIntosh had incorporated in the Senate Hansard of 16 November. The letter is dated 22 September of this year and is addressed to Senator Gordon McIntosh, Parliament House. The third paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> To deal briefly with each of the allegations Mr Henderson has made:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Many serving and retired officers contributed to the evidence Mr Witheford passed to Mr Street on 8 April 1982, at his request. </PARA>
<PARA>At Mr Street's request, that is. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Messrs Witheford, Henne, F. Sergi and Johns were numbered amongst them. Extreme care was taken to check with informants in detail as the evidence was being prepared for submission to Mr Street. In consultation with Mr Street's staff, detailed independent professional legal consideration was given to the allegations. </PARA>
<PARA>On 10 September Mr Henderson went on to state that the officers mentioned by me had made it clear that they did not support Mr Witheford's allegations. I believe that is a further untruth. Further, Mr Henderson said, in relation to the Department of Finance and police investigations into this matter:</PARA>
<PARA> All the documents and all the information that they sought was made available. </PARA>
<PARA>Does this mean there were other documents and information those investigators did not seek? That is the inference one can draw from those words. Interestingly , in paragraph 4 of Messrs Witheford and Henne's letter to Senator McIntosh we read this:</PARA>
<PARA> Important files and other documents are admitted by the Department of Foreign Affairs to be missing. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask: What does Mr Henderson have to say about that? When can I expect an answer to my question on notice of 17 November relating to that matter? There is an inference in an earlier answer that Mr Witheford or someone else may have those documents in his possession. That also is a false inference on behalf of senior officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather interesting to note that Mr Street in his Press statement of 27 November-that is, last Saturday-no longer told us that the allegations relating to this matter had been thoroughly investigated, that both Messrs Bowden and Henderson were cleared or that he had full confidence in Mr Henderson's administration of the Department. I am grateful that Mr Street is no longer taking his previous line. I remind the Senate about the pressure put on Mr Henne by Mr Henderson's security staff in relation to that letter written by Mr Henne and Mr Witheford to Senator McIntosh. I am reliably informed of a number of horror stories around the corridors of the Department of Foreign Affairs concerning the use of security staff by Mr Henderson and what has happened to junior staff in that regard. In one rather outrageous case a long-serving officer who is now admitted by all concerned to be totally innocent had the police put on to him by Mr Henderson, a man who, in my view, is not lily white. This officer had his house and office searched by police who totally disregarded the rights of the man and his family-that was at the behest of Mr Henderson and his cohorts who, it appears, will use any means to gain their objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> I informed the Senate last week that the dogs in the Department of Foreign Affairs were barking and that new evidence concerning Mr Bowden's financial activities was at hand. This week the rumour mills in that Department have it, despite all the previous exposures, that Mr Henderson, who is currently in South Africa-for what purpose I wonder-and his management offsider, Mr Smith, have been hard at work seeking to reverse or sidetrack new evidence against Mr Bowden . My mind boggles when I ponder the ingenious attempts these people have made in the past in preparing answers to questions I have raised on the matter. In that regard, when can I expect an answer to the further questions I placed on the Notice Paper relating to both Tehran and, latterly, Ambassador Loveday, late of West Germany?</PARA>
<PARA> The allegations of police misconduct during the investigations into this matter are in the hands of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. When he will report on that matter I have no way of knowing, but I believe his report will reveal serious misconduct and threats made by junior police officers in an attempt to clear Messrs Henderson and Bowden. I believe that the pressure on the investigation police was applied at two levels: Firstly, by Mr Henderson on Sir Peter Lawler, the Secretary of the Department of Administrative Services; and, secondly, by Mr R. J. Smith from the Department of Foreign Affairs. In that regard I should mention that about an hour and a half ago Mr Street rang me to say that he had written to Mr Newman asking him to take up with the police some matters in relation to those previous investigations. Mr Street also asked for my co- operation in getting this matter cleared up. I promised to give that co- operation. But, thinking about that, I can only come back to my earlier call; that is, that Mr Street must stand down both Mr Henderson and Mr Bowden, along with those other officers high up in the Department who, in my view, to this point have forced him to lie to the Parliament, while a completely independent inquiry into these matters is carried out. On their past performance I will have absolutely no faith in any investigation conducted while they retain their positions of authority within the Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity of this first reading debate on a money Bill to discuss matters which I think are of extreme importance and of great interest to the citizens of Australia. I am concerned particularly with the no-dams campaign in respect of South-West Tasmania and with the extent of public interest which is being displayed on the eastern seaboard, as every Liberal member knows. I am concerned also with the effect of the report of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania which, of course, I have not yet had an opportunity to debate because another senator endeavoured to speak ahead of the Committee members the other day. Therefore, my views on that report have not yet been aired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also, I am concerned about the effect which that report and this whole campaign will have on the Flinders by-election, which will take place on Saturday. I believe we will find a most remarkable turnabout in voting by reason of the fact that throughout the community there is an enormous feeling that something should and can be done to stop the destruction taking place in South West Tasmania at present. I am not saying that this is the most important issue in the whole community; of course, matters concerning the downturn in trade, the economy and unemployment are of great importance to the community. But, as far as I can tell , throughout eastern Australia Liberal members of parliament are receiving more correspondence on the dams issue than they are receiving on all other subjects put together. That is because the citizens see that they can do something about this issue. They see that it is something on which they can bring pressure to bear, and I commend them on their judgment. I do not say this in any party political sense; I believe this demonstrates the sincere feeling of the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been customary to say that in by-elections there is a traditional protest vote. When times are bad, when there is awkwardness and economic difficulty, it is easy for the Australian Labor Party in Opposition to say: 'Let 's blame the Government as much as possible in this. Let's not put up positive solutions; let's rely upon a protest vote which generally leads to a loss of support for the Government'. The real problem is that if the by-election were merely to show that in the next few days it would merely make the same demonstration. It would not help the situation one iota. In my opinion, the best thing that could happen to the Australian Labor Party in the by-election would be for it to lose. Then it would realise that government will not fall into its hands like a ripe plum, that it has to prove, by offering alternative policies, that it has the answers to our problems. Thus, in a negative sense, the success of the Liberal candidate in the by-election will be a shot in the arm, or somewhere else in the physiognomy, of the Labor Party and will therefore do it some good. </PARA>
<PARA> To put the matter more positively, the Liberal candidate, Peter Reith, was the first declared 'No Dams' candidate. He is not alone in that respect. The Democrats candidate is totally opposed to the proposed dam. The Labor Party candidate, although he has not made a special feature of the matter, is committed to 'No Dams'. Peter Reith, the Liberal candidate, has from the word go made it clear that he is for 'No Dams'. He has also campaigned strongly-as I certainly do and I am sure Senator Haines and others do-that people should write 'No Dams' on their ballot papers in the by-election on Saturday. Australian people very often have a feeling that they must not scribble on ballot papers, that there is danger in so doing. There is not, provided one does not obscure one's vote, provided one clearly writes 'No Dams' high up or low down on the ballot paper and makes one's intention clear. Then one is effectively doing something that will be counted and will provide a good indication to governments that action is expected. Therefore I urge people, as does Peter Reith, to write 'No Dams' on their ballot papers, irrespective of the party for which they are voting. I urge that they do so in order to provide a demonstration such as was provided in the municipal elections in the Australian Capital Territory, when some 40 per cent of voters wrote in 'No Dams'. </PARA>

In addition to Peter Reith's advocacy that 'No Dams' be written on ballot papers, as honourable senators probably know, and as I mentioned in a question yesterday, a couple of days ago he sent a telegram to Mr Anthony, the Acting Prime Minister, as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>PETER REITH</PARA>
<PARA>He made a judgment, well before the Senate Committee report came out, that what was needed was a determination to stop the destruction along the Franklin. Now he has been backed by the Senate Committee's report, which has provided economic justification for the stand which he has taken. Following the sending of that telegram to Mr Anthony, he received a telegram from Senator Chipp, which asked: 'What are you doing about our Democrats Bill?'. Today Peter Reith sent the following telegram to Senator Chipp. It is important that I read it so that people will know exactly what he has said. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Mr President, you will be delighted to learn, I am sure, that I have no intention of mentioning South West Tasmania or the Flinders by-election. I want to take the opportunity of this first reading debate to raise some matters of concern to defence widows, few of whom, I am sure, live in the electorate we have all been discussing so recently. These concerns include the difficulties some of them have in applying for repatriation benefits, the erosion that they see annually in their pensions because they are granted only partial consumer price index increases, the difference in the percentage of defence widows' pensions or the percentage that they receive of their late husbands' pension compared with the percentage received by the widows of Commonwealth public servants, and the treatment they receive at the hands of the Department of Defence following the deaths of their husbands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I start with the last matter. I hasten to say that most of these women realise that such treatment by the Department, which they see as somewhat appalling, is not deliberate insensitivity but rather is caused by a lack of awareness on the part of the men running the Department of Defence and most of the service personnel of the problems facing widows. I would like to begin by referring to the newspaper simply entitled Army of 18 November 1982. On page 8 of that newspaper is an article headed 'What happens to your family if you die?' It begins with this hypothesis:</PARA>
<PARA> You have just died, and the first letter your widow gets is from her landlord giving her 90 days to quit her home. </PARA>
<PARA> She has $64.93 in the cheque account, and the landlord wants the rent in advance--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the next 90 days rent in advance-</PARA>
<PARA> Enough to make you turn in your grave?</PARA>
<PARA> But what if that same landlord owes her thousands of dollars? Incredible, you say-he wouldn't have a leg to stand on. And anyway, who would be so callous?</PARA>
<PARA> But that is exactly what happened to Cpl Paul Needs' widow, Monica, and it has and will to hundreds of other service widows like her. </PARA>
<PARA> The 'callous landlord' is the army-or other service-and it can take up to two months for a dead soldier's long service, holiday or back pay to reach his widow . </PARA>
<PARA> But it's a routine matter for the services to give widows 90 days' notice to quit married quarters, and to ask for the rent in advance, because it can no longer be a pay deduction. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason it cannot be a pay deduction is that the person whose pay it was previously being deducted from is now dead. When her husband died Mrs Needs was left with three quite young children-one being only one year old. She said that she spent the first week after his death crying, which is hardly surprising. At the end of that week she attempted to make something of her life. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . she was widowed, she had three small children to support, she had to pay three months rent on the married quarter, she had to look for somewhere else to live, she had no job, no income, and just $64.93 in her cheque account . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 'If it wasn't for Paul's mates taking the blanket around on the day of his funeral, I couldn't have paid the rent.'</PARA>
<PARA>This clearly is not an unusual circumstance. The report goes on to quote another woman who was in a similar situation. Her children were teenagers. She was swamped by paper work-settlement of the estate, changing documents to her name, claiming insurance, compensation and pensions. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> She found out that few people were ready to volunteer information on all service widows' entitlements, and when she did discover what they were, she had to chase them herself-a heartbreaking task compounded by the grief and loneliness that followed the death of her husband. She eventually went to a solicitor who took his $1,000 cut before sending her the balance of her claims. </PARA>
<PARA>Four months later she was still filling out forms consequential to her husband's death. As I said, that appears to be a fairly normal situation. When widows do settle down and get around to applying for repatriation benefits they find they are again faced with an almost impossible task in completing applications to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, for instance, for a war or defence widow's pension. I understand that this problem is compounded if the husband died during service and there has been some effluxion of time since his death. </PARA>
<PARA> According to a paper put out by the Regular Defence Forces Welfare Association, the medical records required to support a widow's application are held within a service health record section and until these can be obtained and examined by a medical practitioner who is prepared to write up a case for her there is virtually no evidence available to support her application. The RDFWA asks for a fairly simple solution. I ask the Government to take this on board and to give it consideration. It is considered, according to this paper, that there is a need for a simple, preliminary application form on which the widow can request a summary of her late husband's service medical records prepared in a form ready for attachment to the application for a war or defence widow's benefit. That does not seem to be too much to ask of a department which has in its employ men who fought, or who are prepared to fight, for their country. Another paper put out by the RDFWA entitled 'The Elimination of Inequities suffered by Defence Widows' has as its first statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of Defence Widows living on pensions obtained under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-73 receive an income below the current level of the poverty line. During their husbands' service in the Defence Forces a significant portion of the family income was a mandatory contribution to the DFRB Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Their present situation is widely regarded within the Defence community as evidence of Government neglect and disinterest in the welfare of Service families. These widows need an increase in thir pensions of about thirty per cent to provide some measure of justice. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that ought not to be impossible given the commitment that their husbands had to this country. A further problem faced by defence widows is the practice of consumer price index adjustments to the pensions of the widows of servicemen who have retired under the DFR and DB scheme. Apparently these adjustments are not made at the full rate of the declared CPI percentage increases. This produces an erosion in pension values which is compounded annually. During a first reading debate I do not have the time to go into great detail about this. In October 1981 the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman, requested that some figures be provided and that a table be drawn up to show a comparison between the pensions of widows, some of whose husbands had retired at the same time on the same rate of DFR and DB pay compared with some who died 10 years later; that is, those who died immediately and those who died 10 years later. I have shown that table to the Minister and I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The table read as follows-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table shows that if two servicemen of the same age and length of service retire on the same day with the same annual rate of DFR and DB pay and one dies almost immediately after retirement and the other dies 10 years later the widow of the first man to die is on a reduced pension compared with the second widow. That erosion of her pension is regarded with some resentment and bitterness, quite understandably, among the defence widows concerned. Many of these problems could be solved by fairly simple means, the most obvious being the Government incorporating two recommendations of the Jess Committee. I was not a member of the Parliament in 1972 when the Jess Committee report was tabled . The Committee proposed, among other things, that the future Defence Force Retirement Benefits Scheme should be administered by the Department of Defence and not by the Department of the Treasury as had been the case for the discredited DFRB scheme. The Committee recommended also that an advisory board be established to consult with the Minister for Defence and considered that this board should be comprosed of representatives of each Service through whom the views of contributing members could be expressed. The Committee noted also that it would be desirable, if practicable, for an elected representative of recipient members to be a member of the board. In effect, this is what the defence widows are asking for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority is composed of two senior male public servants-the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman -who are permanent members, and three senior male officers who are constantly changing and, therefore, must be regarded, at least in a de facto manner, as temporary members. The defence widows consider that the fact that there is an increasing number of successful appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal coming out of the Authority's decisions is good justification for putting on to that Authority somebody who does represent recipients, who knows what the needs are and who can add a permanence to that Authority which is not there, when one considers the transfer rate of the senior male Service personnel. It is not their fault; it is just part of Service life. If a representative from a defence widow's organisation were placed on that Authority there would be somebody there to speak for pension recipients and to provide a continuity and a permanence for Service personnel and their next of kin, or survivors, which is not there at present. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I ask the Government to take note of the requests by the defence widows that something be done to accord them parity with Australian Public Service widows who get 67 per cent of their husband's pension in comparison with the 62.5 per cent that defence widows get, that something be done with regard to the erosion of their pensions caused by the only partial CPI increases and that the membership of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority be enlarged to include a defence widow as a member of the Authority. </PARA>

We do have considerable difficulties in Australia at present. Without being too long winded about it, we have simply priced ourselves out of the market. I think all of us probably get paid too much. Like it or not, there has to be some redress of payments made in the form of salaries and wages to the Australian working community if we are to survive and be employed. It is not simply a matter, as members of the Australian Labor Party have said, of redistributing income and dealing with the situation in that way. It is a matter of increasing the productivity of people and paying them what they are worth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I feel that we do not appreciate the true cost of labour in Australia. Many people look at an average weekly pay cheque or pay packet and think that that is all that a person is paid. But in Australia, more than in any other country, the additional benefits are very considerable. While I have not been able to get an industry figure, probably close to 50 per cent more than what is paid is derived by many people by way of benefits in support of their weekly pay. My concern is that some of those people, particularly public servants and unionists, are immune from the operations of market forces. A re-evaluation is going on at the moment in private industry. People are taking cuts in salaries; they are having their wages and salaries revised downwards but public servants and members of strong trade unions are immune to these pressures. While they can be deferred for a while, in the end those pressures will become irresistible. Public servants have a compounded problem in that most of them are one or two grades higher than they should be; so they are on a higher rate of pay than they should be, quite apart from the base rates. I am quite happy to talk about that on another day when I have more time. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing with the need to reduce wages or bring them more into line with productivity, I refer to an article in the Australian Financial Review yesterday which pointed out quite correctly the misconception that exists with regard to Keynesian economics in the 1930s. The popular belief is that the Depression of the 1930s was prolonged because people were not paid enough; they could not buy enough goods and, therefore, companies were unprofitable. That was not what Keynes said at all. There is no argument at present for not looking carefully at wages and salaries and relating those to what people are actually worth and what they are producing. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of example of the point I raised earlier of benefits other than the weekly pay cheque, I wish to look at the combined mining unions and the conditions which apply to their members at present. This is particularly important for Australia because the combined mining unions are largely involved in the export industry-with the export of coal. The industry is now looking increasingly vulnerable. It was a great market a few years ago but it is now under intense competition from producers all around the world-from South Africa, China and South American countries. Our competitive power is being severely restricted by the wages that are paid to the work force of the combined mining unions. It is relevant to look at this, even though it is the most extreme example of benefits beyond the weekly pay packet, because there is a tendency for what one union gets to flow on through the whole of the work force. The base rate for workers in the combined mining unions last year was $315 a week for a 35-hour week, giving them a 7-hour shift each day. But, of that 7 hours, half an hour is spent travelling to the job, half an hour going from it and half an hour for crib, so they are being paid for a 5 1/2 hour working day. To that base rate of $315 is added an average production bonus of $70 a week, taking the lowest rate of pay up to $385 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Not content with that, the miners get a 5 week annual leave entitlement, not at the 17 1/2 per cent loading that the rest of the workforce receives but at a 20 per cent loading. Very few countries are so generous as to give their work force a five week annual loading. I lived in America for a while. There one was lucky to get one week's leave for the first two or three years of service with a company. Thereafter the industry average was 2 weeks leave a year. Here, the miners get five weeks and, with a 20 per cent holiday loading at the base rate, the benefit to a worker totals $2,310. On top of that they get 10 days sick leave a year which can be accrued without limit until their time of retirement. Again that is a debit against their employers. There are 10 days of statutory holidays or public holidays a year, so in aggregate, with the five weeks leave, the 10 days sick leave and 10 days statutory holidays, nine weeks of the year is lost and has to be paid for. That time is unproductive to the company. Long service leave accrues at the rate of 13 weeks for every eight years. When the workers go on to penalty rates, there is a 15 per cent loading for afternoon and night shifts. A permanent night shift attracts a 25 per cent loading. Sundays are paid at double time; public holidays at treble time. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads to the whole question of penalty rates. I have been trying to research the question of penalty rates and what they cost Australia in jobs and money. I find that no statistic is available. It is one that I would be very interested to see because until we get rid of penalty rates the economic recovery of this country will be severely delayed, if not denied. On top of these high rates of pay and fringe benefits members of the combined mining unions in Queensland get virtually no-cost accommodation because the housing with which they are provided is made available at between $7.50 and $23 a week. The conditions under which they live are better than many urban dwellers in the large capital cities enjoy. I was in one of the mining towns in Queensland last year and was shown a pay slip which listed all the deductions from the pay of a truck driver. At the end of the list it was shown that the deduction for union dues was around 25 per cent higher a week than the amount paid for his house. I suppose workers have to be grateful if someone gets for them a goose that lays a golden egg like that, but I think there is something wrong with a society when a union due is about 25 per cent more than the average weekly rental for a house. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this, we have the matter of severance pay. The recent claim in the courts by the mining unions was for three months notice on severance and 12 weeks pay for every year worked, with an automatic pay-out for long service leave. The present award conditions provide for one week's notice and, after five years, one week's pay for every year worked. It has to be borne in mind that in addition to all these benefits a quite generous pension scheme is available after 25 or 30 years service, which provides a lump sum payment at the age of 55 years. That includes 12 weeks pay for every year of service. I think we are getting to the stage where it is quite impossible for business to pay both holiday and severance pay. Companies will go bankrupt. They cannot survive with the terms and conditions now given to the work force. Our prime need is to preserve jobs, not to pay a few at the expense of many. The position taken by the unions at present is counterproductive. They are interested only in those who have jobs; they are not at all interested in the half a million people in Australia who do not have any employment at all and who, given the present conditions, have very little chance of getting employment because they simply cannot be employed at an economic rate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time for us to look at the whole of the industrial relations field and to do something which I referred to earlier in this chamber; that is, establish a market in labour. We have done everything we can to control the monopoly position of capital. Bodies such as the Trade Practices Commission and the monopolies commission exist so that people with capital cannot exploit their position to the detriment of the Australian community. But we have done nothing at all to take on the monopoly position over the supply of labour held by the union movement. We have to allow competition between those who wish to work and the union forces. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator D. S. JessopChairmanSenate Standing Committee on Science and EnvironmentParliament HouseCanberra, A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA> Dear Senator Jessop</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the November 1981 report of your Committee on the River Murray, following an inspection of the Murray mouth at Goolwa on 15 May 1981, and a public hearing in Adelaide on 22 and 23 June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to your Committee's earlier progress reports, I commented on some of the issues which have been raised again in your November 1981 report. However , in relation to Recommendations 1 and 3, there have been recent developments of particular interest to your Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer in particular to the introduction of the River Murray Waters Bill 1982 into the House of Representatives on 28 October 1982. A similar Bill was introduced into the South Australian Parliament before the recent change in government in that State, and corresponding action will be taken by the other two States. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Agreement provides a realistic and practical basis for co-operation between the three States in River Murray matters. There is already clear evidence of the States' goodwill in this regard, and I believe that the action which has been taken meets the principal objectives of Recommendation 1 (a). </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to Recommendation 1 (b), a similar proposal for a national body by the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution in its 1970 report was rejected by the States, and I have had no indication of any change in the States' veiws. The Australian Water Resources Council was seen as the most appropriate organisation to co-ordinate State policies to achieve common objectives in this regard. For example, the Council has already agreed to guidelines for drinking water, guidelines for the reuse of waste water for irrigation and public recreation areas, etc. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to appropriate incentives to irrigators referred to in your Committee's Recommendation 3, I am pleased to advise that a report has now been completed by a Commonwealth/States working group set up by the Prime Minister and three State Premiers at their meeting in Melbourne on 16 October 1981. The report deals mainly with areas of State responsibility and has been referred to the States for their comment, prior to detemining what action may be appropriate on a co-ordinated Commonwealth/States basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that it is not uncommon for a sandbar to develop at the mouth of the River Murray in late summer or autumn, when practically all available flows in the river are used for urban and agricultural supplies. This, combined with particular prevailing meteorological conditions-smooth seas, no wind action and relatively low tides-is conducive to the deposition of suspended sand load at the mouth of the Murray. </PARA>
<PARA> You will be interested to know that, despite low flow conditions in the river at the present time, the Murray mouth is still open, with the channel some three metres deep. The situation has been closely monitored by a task force since the last closure in April last year. </PARA>
<PARA> In a broader context, I am sure you were pleased to hear of the Government's decision to establish a National Water Research Council to advise me on national research needs, priorities, projects and levels of funding. I have no doubt that research will now be accelerated into inland water quality problems of relevance to the River Murray system. I also think that the current Commonwealth study on Australia's water needs and problems to the Year 2000 will provide a special focus on salinity and other problems affecting water resources in the Murray Valley. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Government is proposing to amend the Social Services Act 1947 in two areas. These amendments are proposed to provide an extension of income support for parents of unemployed school leavers, and to provide an extension of eligibility for sickness benefits. They respond to anomalies in the operation of the Act that have been brought to my attention recently. At present the Social Services Act provides that when a child ceases to be a student, family allowance for that child is stopped from the following family allowance period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because there is a six-week waiting period before a school leaver can qualify for an unemployment benefit, this has meant that the parents of a job-seeking school leaver have not been receiving any assistance for the child during some or all of that six weeks. This has created difficulties for families where the parents are on low incomes. To help the parents of school leavers during this period the Government now proposes to extend the family allowance payment over that six week period in cases where the child remains unemployed. Similarly, the amendment will provide that, in the case of pensioners and beneficiaries with children leaving school and seeking work, additional pension or benefit for a child will continue until the child obtains work or receives unemployment benefit. The scheme will operate from the family allowance pay period starting 15 October 1982 and, in relation to pension and benefit instalments falling due on or after 1 November 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment will be supported by another Government initiative to assist students which provides for an increase in the income which a student may have while remaining eligible for family allowance or additional pension or benefit. The Government has increased these income limits from $1,800 for those living at home to $2,500. For students living away from home the limit has been raised from $2,600 to $3,600. Legislation is not required to affect this change. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area of the legislation for which the Government is proposing changes concerns the payment of sickness benefit. Under the Social Servies Act a person may qualify for a sickness benefit if he or she, firstly, is temporarily incapacitated for work because of sickness or accident and, secondly, has thereby suffered a loss of salary, wages or other income. Legal advice provided to my Department has indicated that the loss of income requirement is met only where a claimant was actually receiving income immediately before the incapacity occurred or where he would have definitely received an income if the incapacity had not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> To overcome these anomalies and to extend eligibility for sickness benefit the Government proposes to amend the Social Services Act to extend eligibility for sickness benefit, firstly, to people able to show that, but for their incapacity , they would have been qualified to receive unemployment benefit-the rate for these people will be determined having regard to the rate of unemployment benefit-and, secondly, to former invalid pensioners and former recipients of sheltered employment allowance and rehabilitation allowance, who are incapacitated for work. The rate for these people will be determined having regard to the rate of pension or allowance. Amendments will also be made so that supplementary allowance can be paid to people who, but for the incapacity, would have qualified for unemployment benefit. Additionally, amendments are proposed to provide that supplementary allowance can be paid to people who have transferred from unemployment benefit to sickness benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, amendments are proposed to permit pensioners in receipt of supplementary assistance to receive supplementary allowance immediately on transfer to sickness benefit rather than wait for the six-week qualifying period required at present. I have advised the Opposition spokesman on social security matters, Senator Grimes, of the Government's intention to legislate this session and have sought the co-operation of the Opposition in obtaining speedy passage of the legislation. I am sorry that I have not mentioned it to the Australian Democrats but it was done on the run. I was anxious to get the administrative things moving in the knowledge that we would get co-operation in getting the legislation through the Parliament, co-operation which I would confidently expect from all honourable senators. I am optimistic that the necessary legislation will be able to be put in place before the Parliament rises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Australian Labor Party welcomes this statement of intent by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) because the amendments to the Social Services Act that he foreshadows are changes that the Labor Party has advocated for a long time. The changes certainly are belated but, as I have said, they are welcome. We will not impede their passage although I am sure that we, like everybody else, will reserve our judgment until we have seen the legislation to be presented in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer first to the proposed changes to the family allowance scheme. Just how belated this is can be demonstrated by looking at the history of the position which we are now in. In 1976 the Government and the then Minister for Social Security, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, stopped the payment of the unemployment benefit to school leavers for six weeks after their final examinations or after they left school, whichever was the later. At that time and later the then Minister, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, undertook to pay the family allowance to the parents of these unemployed school leavers for that six-week period. I quote, for instance, what she said on 7 November 1977:</PARA>
<PARA> If it were a family allowance for a student child that would be continued until the period of non-payment of the unemployment benefit was covered. </PARA>
<PARA>This was done in the 1976-77 Christmas period. But since then the family allowance has ceased at the time the child ceased to be a student. Families on low incomes, pensioners and beneficiaries and, in particular, an increasing number of bread-winners who were unemployed, have had their incomes cut in this arbitrary way for the six weeks over the Christmas and holiday period. Both the unemployment benefit and the family allowance were denied by statute. We have repeatedly pointed out that this is a harsh and unfair provision. The matter has been brought to the attention of the Government, as has the promise and the assurance made by the then Minister for Social Security by Press statements and debates in this House since then. It is not a new thing. It is certainly not new to the officers of the Department of Social Security and it should not be new to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I pointed out on 17 November this year that, in a period of rocketing unemployment when youth unemployment is at catastrophic levels, at a time when these young people need money for transport, telephone calls and food to sustain them while they hunt for jobs, this situation still applied. It is in great contrast to the previous four years of inaction by the previous Minister that the present Minister for Social Security has been sufficiently moved to convince his Government of the necessity for this change. Similarly, we welcome the right of the additional pension or benefit for children to be sustained over this period. </PARA>
<PARA> We also welcome the second main change; that is, the need to revert to the interpretation of income in the determination of eligibility of the sickness benefit. This situation has arisen because of another difficulty within the Department. It has arisen because income from sources such as invalid pensions is not counted as income when considering qualifications for the sickness benefit. Therefore, some people have found themselves ineligible for any support . Similarly, people who for one reason or another have not received benefits or income or other types before becoming sick or injured were likely to be ineligible. This situation arose because some unthinking staff lawyers in the Department of Social Security decided on a new interpretation of the relevant section of the Social Services Act. This was manifestly unjust and went against the interpretation which has been put on this Act by governments since 1947. We now have the situation where an unknown number of people have been refused benefits of this type since at least June this year. We believe that not only should the Act be changed to ensure that this sort of arbitrary change in interpretation does not occur again but also those people who are affected should be notified and should be given backpayments for the time they have been receiving no benefits or insufficient benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, both these changes are necessary. The necessity for these changes has been repeatedly pointed out by the Opposition. We welcome the intention of the Government to make these changes. We consider it justification for the campaign that we have waged to introduce these changes. But all this, of course, is with the proviso that we will need to see the legislation to check its effectiveness and its adequacy. Therefore, we welcome the Minister's statement. We hope that he gets the legislation in as quickly as possible. I hope that both the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have an adequate time to look at this legislation before it is debated in this place. Provided it is satisfactory, of course, it will receive a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I will assume that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) overlooked the presence of the Australian Democrats in this matter less because it was done on the run than that he had some confidence in our support for the matter. Perhaps he realised that it takes less time for the Democrats to make up their minds on these matters than it takes the Australian Labor Party, and he believed that we would not need quite the time that the official Opposition was given. I would like to add to Senator Grimes's comments that providing the legislation is strictly in keeping with the ministerial statement that the Minister has brought down, he is assured of our support. However used, as we are, to the odd bit of sneakiness emanating from the Government I, too, will reserve unqualified support for this matter until we have seen the legislation. It is always good to see the Government end an anomaly which is placing an additional financial burden on people who are already disadvantaged one way or another although I, too, deplore the fact that the anomalies were allowed to appear in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I hope this is the first in a long line of anomaly ending statements and suggest that the Government may like now to turn its attention perhaps to some other anomalies that affect the aged in particular and specifically those relating to subsidies for care of the aged, nursing home subsidies vis-a-vis extended domiciliary care subsidies and so on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In the course of the debate on the Appropriation Bills answers were provided to a number of matters raised by Senator McLaren relating to the payment of travelling allowance to Ministers and Opposition office holders in respect of the calendar year 1981. It was noted then that during that year and prior to 1 July 1982, the home base of a Minister for the purposes of travelling allowance was determined by the Remuneration Tribunal as being the home of the Minister unless he nominated otherwise to the Minister for Administrative Services. However, with effect from 1 July 1982 the Remuneration Tribunal determined that Ministers, office holders and members of parliament nominate to the Minister for Administrative Services or the Presiding Officers their home base which shall be their principal place of residence. This introduced an element of uncertainty into the process for claiming and determining amounts of travelling allowance. Different people could attach different meanings to the term 'principal place of residence'. With a view to removing this uncertainty, the Chairman of the Remuneration Tribunal was recently asked for the Tribunal's interpretation of the term 'principal place of residence'. The Chairman wrote to the Secretary of the Department of Administrative Services.

<PARA>Dear Sir Peter,</PARA>
<PARA> I am in receipt of your letter dated 16th November 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Your letter refers to the 'definition' of the term 'principal place of residence' as used in the Conditions of Payment relating to Travelling Allowances in Australia for Ministers, Office Holders, and Members of Parliament . The term is used in paragraph 4 (which relates to Ministers) and paragraph 5 ( which relates to Senators and Members) of the Tribunal's Determination No. 10 of 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> As you will understand, the Tribunal's functions relate to the making of Determinations and those Determinations have effect by virtue of the Remuneration Tribunals Act, 1973 (as amended). The act does not commit to the Tribunal the function of the interpretation of those Determinations and I am therefore not able to advise you formally upon the 'definition' of the term. The Determination itself contains no definition of it and accordingly its meaning is to be taken from what the words, understood according to their ordinary meaning, convey. Whether a particular place is the principal place of residence of a Minister, Senator or Member, within the meaning of the Determination, must be determined in the light of all the circumstances of the particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, there have, I understand, been informal discussions from time to time with officers of your Department as to the application of the various parts of the Tribunal's Determinations in particular circumstances and no doubt the present letter has been written in that context. On that basis, I would add only this comment. I doubt that there is any single factor that can be said to be determinative or definitive of what is a principal place of residence in all cases. The present letter refers to the fact that a Minister may have more than one residence and asks whether, in such a case, the principal place of residence is where a Minister spends the most time, where his wife and children live, or the place he considers his home. Each of those matters is a matter which will no doubt be relevant in determining what, in a particular case, is the principal place of residence of a Minister (or indeed, of a Senator or Member). But, in the end, the question whether a particular place is the principal place of residence must be determined according to the ordinary meaning of the term and the facts of the particular case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will see the Chairman's comment, at the foot of the first page, that he doubts 'that there is any single factor that can be said to be determinative or definitive of what is a principal place of residence in all cases'. The Chairman refers to a number of matters that are relevant but concludes that 'the question whether a particular place is the principal place of residence must be determined according to the ordinary meaning of the term and the facts of the particular case'. The circumstances of individual Ministers, office holders and other parliamentarians vary considerably, having regard to places of residence in their home States and arrangements they make to accommodate the demands and needs of their parliamentary and other official duties, their constituents and their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the light of the letter from the Chairman of the Tribunal, and of the Government's further consideration of this issue, Ministers will nominate anew to the Minister for Administrative Services their principal place of residence for the purposes of travelling allowance claims lodged after this date. The Government has decided that Ministers should nominate as their principal place of residence for travelling allowance purposes the place at which they reside for most of the time or where their family is normally based. If those places do not coincide, Ministers will nominate which of those places they would normally reside in when not engaged in official business. The Government draws the attention of office holders and other members of parliament to the practice which Ministers will be following and commends it to them also. The Government is bringing to the attention of the Remuneration Tribunal the approach it is taking. The Tribunal may take account of this approach and consider whether the approach gives rise to anomalies or unreasonable consequences in the case of any Minister, office holder or member of parliament. I commend the statement to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That at 4.30 p.m. this day, and notwithstanding anything contained in the Sessional Orders, business be considered in the following order:</PARA>

<PARA> 3. General Business, Order of the Day No. 127 (Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill 1982)</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Government Business, Orders of the Day</PARA>
<PARA>The order of business is, firstly, consideration of papers and, secondly, that we finish the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill which was commenced last Thursday. The third order of business is unusual inasmuch as there is a general agreement within the Senate that only one Bill be dealt with in General Business time. The reason for seeking a determination from the Senate is that I believe it is urgent that we discuss the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill and vote on it so that it may go to the House of Representatives when it meets next week. From time to time we have by-elections in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators to consider that in the last couple of days, immediately prior to the electronic blackout, a particular candidate in the by- election of Flinders was in fact attacked in the Press and yet he did not have a chance, in the time available to him before the electronic blackout came into being, to actually put his case to the electors. I believe if that situation were to arise it would be a gross infringement of not only his rights but also the rights of the electors to know the truth of the matter, whether it be as he presents it or otherwise. The fact that we do not at the moment have another by- election in the offing does not lessen the urgency because we may have one at any time. I believe it is appropriate that we discuss and dispose of these rather absurd blackouts in the electronic media as soon as possible. I believe that there is an overwhelming majority of honourable senators and indeed members of the House of Representatives who would like that particular media blackout disposed of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will oppose the motion moved by the Australian Democrats . It will do so basically because there are now well-established sessional orders agreed upon by the Senate and by the various parties. Thursdays now have a very tightly knit agenda which it has been agreed should be observed. One of the principles in that agreement is that each Thursday time shall be given for one and one only private member's Bill to be debated. Quite clearly, if there were more the whole of the business paper of the day would be distorted. We have commenced debate on the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill. The Government has given a clear understanding-that is accepted-that the World Heritage Bill will continue to be debated this afternoon. Therefore, under the ordinary agreements under sessional orders, any other Bill will not be available to be debated today. Furthermore, the nature of the Bill is quite irrelevant to the situation. It cannot affect the coming by-election. If indeed there were urgency for it to be debated, that urgency should have given rise to the Democrats giving it priority weeks ago. As I said, there having been a clear agreement under the sessional orders as to what private member's Bill should be debated today-that is, the World Heritage Bill-under those arrangements a second member's Bill cannot be debated today.

It is proposed that all these matters be debated between half past four and seven o'clock.

<PARA> It was understood last week that the World Heritage Bill would be due for reconsideration this week. Again, as has been stated in this chamber by both honourable senators speaking in favour of and honourable senators speaking against the dam proposal, it is not necessary that the World Heritage Bill introduced by the Australian Democrats be passed for the Commonwealth to intervene in that area. Therefore, I would be more inclined to support a proposition that the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill be advanced and considered today as that is far more relevant than is the World Heritage Bill, if we are talking about the Flinders by-election. One has to ask oneself why this move is being made. I assume that it is not unconnected to the Flinders by- election. I assume also that the push for the World Heritage Bill to be thumped through this House is not unconnected with the Flinders by-election. I would rather support the Democrats in their desire to bring forward the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill and, if they so choose, to defer debate on the World Heritage Bill until the Senate has time more properly to consider the very dramatic implications of the provisions of that Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The four Bills now before the Senate, the Australian Capital Territory Tax (Vehicle Registration) Amendment Bill 1982, the Australian Capital Territory Tax (Insurance Business) Amendment Bill 1982, the Australian Capital Territory Stamp Duty Amendment Bill 1982, the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Amendment Bill 1982 and the Pay-roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Amendment Bill 1982, are supported by the Federal Opposition. They represent administrative changes which will provide some small assistance to business in the Australian Capital Territory. The Bills provide for exemptions from tax and stamp duty on certain transactions. In regard to payroll tax, provision is made for an increase in the exemption level, bringing the Australian Capital Territory into line with New South Wales. It is hoped that the lifting of the level at which payroll tax applies will remove a disincentive for small businesses to increase their work force. Provision is also made in these Bills to bring exemptions from vehicle registration tax into line with New South Wales. Of course, it is instructive to note that almost all of the changes contained in the Bills before us are to bring the Australian Capital Territory into line with the progressive policies of the New South Wales Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While these Bills will provide some minor assistance to business in the Australian Capital Territory, it must be said that they are absolutely insignificant when compared with the devastating effects that the policies of the Fraser Government have had on business in the Australian Capital Territory over the last seven years. If we look at what has happened to the local economy of the Australian Capital Territory over the last seven years, we see a very clear example of the failure of all of this Government's economic strategies because, as honourable senators will be aware-I hope they are aware-the Fraser Government's economic policies are implemented directly in the Australian Capital Territory. There is no State government to form a buffer between the Fraser Government and the economy of the Australian Capital Territory. So I think it is very fair to look at what has happened in the Australian Capital Territory and to judge the economic strategies and policies of the Fraser Government by what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government's policies in the Australian Capital Territory have been to cut public expenditure, to cancel public works, to withdraw from public enterprise and severely to restrict the growth of the Public Service. And what has all this done? It has caused a very serious recession in Canberra which is, of course, the seat of the Government's administration. Not only have the policies succeeded in promoting growing frustration and demoralisation in the Public Service-I should point to the documentation of that frustration in a series of articles in last week's Australian Financial Review-but also they have had a devastating effect on private enterprise in the Australian Capital Territory. Of course, this is ironic coming from a government which professes to support the private sector. If we look at the 1981-82 annual report of the National Capital Development Commission we get an overview of the sorry state of the economy of the Australian Capital Territory. That report states:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the effects of the low level of economic activity of the past five years has been that Canberra's dependence on the public sector has increased rather than decreased and in particular the running down of the building and construction industry has consequently reduced the city's economic base. Unemployment has become entrenched, particularly amongst 15-19 year olds; there is a surprisingly high and increasing level of part-time employment becoming evident . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, for 'part time employment' we should read 'casual employment'. In the building and construction industry, of course, we have seen the very worst effects of the Fraser Government's economic strategies. The Master Builders Association of the Australian Capital Territory has estimated that total construction expenditure in the Australian Capital Territory has plummeted from a peak of $550m in 1975 to a current annual figure of around $185m. The last annual report of the Department of the Capital Territory contained the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Activity in private enterprise building declined during the year. The total value of building permits granted by the Department dropped from $150.3m in 1980 -81 to $137.4m in 1981-82. The reduction of activity was most evident in the housing sector where the number of new houses commenced decreased from 2466 in 1980-81 to 1845 during 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1975, by comparison, 5,068 new dwellings were completed in Canberra, that is, 3,620 private and 1,448 government buildings. So it is very clear that one of the most serious effects of the Fraser Government's economic strategy has been to bring almost to a halt the whole home building industry in the Australian Capital Territory. Of course that has had very serious deleterious social effects on people seeking to become home owners in the national capital. The number of standard residential leases sold during 1980-81 was also down. The number of leases sold in 1980-81 was 2,296. This figure was reduced last year to 946. The number of units permissible on the leases sold in 1980-81 was 845 and last year it went down to 418. The Department of the Capital Territory in its annual report makes the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA> Rising interest rates and uncertainty concerning the future growth of Canberra led to a marked decline in demand for all types of residential land during the latter part of the year. Increasing numbers of lessees have been experiencing liquidity problems which has resulted in a considerable number of requests for the Department to either accept surrender of leases or to approve transfers to a third party prior to development being commenced. </PARA>
<PARA>The stagnation of Canberra documented in the Department of the Capital Territory 's last annual report and the National Capital Development Commission's last annual report stands as a very clear condemnation of the economic policies of the Fraser Government. If we look at the business sector the picture is no better. Only five industrial site leases were granted in 1981-82 in Canberra's three industrial estates at Fyshwick, Hume and Mitchell. No new sites were allocated for tourist oriented projects, yet we constantly hear from the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, that tourism is going to save the local economy. Obviously people who are prepared to invest in the tourist industry do not agree with the Minister, which is not surprising. Page nine of the last annual report of the Department confirms that the National Semiconductor Corp. silicone wafer fabrication plant, about which we heard so much and so many extravagant promises from the Minister for the Capital Territory, will not go ahead. I point out that this was another demonstration of the incompetence of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly citizens of the Australian Capital Territory will remember-I am sure many honourable senators will remember-the exaggerated claims that Mr Hodgman made about this proposal. He was prepared to allocate $19m for a feasibility project for this multinational firm which was supposed to be interested in setting up business in the Australian Capital Territory at a time when local small businesses were going bankrupt at a rate never previously experienced in this Territory. Of course, with his customary lack of preparation, research and investigation he was selling the electorate a pup. There will be no such project in the Australian Capital Territory. Anyone who looked seriously at the prospects for such a project knew that from the start, yet local people were misled into believing they would have a sudden salvation of unemployment and economic stagnation by this project which was never to get off the ground and which we now see confirmed in the report from the Department, will not go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister professed similar enthusiasm about another project. His enthusiasm was almost as great as it was about the National Semiconductor project. That was the proposal by United American and Australasian Film Productions Pty Ltd to invest $35m in a film studio development. I have the gravest of doubts as to whether this project will ever come to fruition either. The reason why I have such grave doubts-the whole film industry in Australia must have such doubt-is to be found in other debates we have had in this place. It is to do with the kind of operation UAA is involved in in Australia, which involves syphoning money from investment in Australian films to investment in overseas films. This kind of activity has aroused a great deal of hostility within our local industry and it has certainly caused enormous problems for the Australian film industry. Hardly any major projects have investment monies to go ahead. It also seems that again the necessary preparation for setting up a studio of this kind, that is negotiation with the Australian film industry, local business in the Australian Capital Territory and the relevant unions, has not been carried out thoroughly. We feel that Mr Hodgman's undertakings to the electorate that we are now going to be saved by 'Studio City' will be just as hollow as his undertakings about National Semiconductor. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, conservationists should perhaps take heart from Mr Hodgman's enthusiastic support for the Gordon below Franklin dam project. If his enthusiasm is to be the kiss of death for that project, the way it has been for other projects, then the Franklin dam may be saved. I suppose that means that Mr Hodgman will have to resign from the Ministry. He says that he will resign if the dam is saved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He never will, but perhaps his electorate will take care of that matter. Tables in last year's annual report of the Department of the Capital Territory document the rapid decline in government spending, which has been the hallmark of the Fraser Government's administration in Canberra. The Department's tables give figures in constant 1981-82 prices. Expenditure by the Department in 1975-the last year of the Whitlam Government-was $157m. In 1982 it was down to $ 105m. Expenditure by the NCDC shows an even more dramatic and drastic decline. In 1975 it was $322m. In 1982 it was down to a mere $81m. Total government expenditure in the Australian Capital Territory in 1975 was $708m. In 1981 it was down to $567m. Looking at tables like that all I can say is that it is no wonder the local Australian Capital Territory economy is in the parlous state it is in. I can only repeat that it is ironical in the extreme that a government that professes to believe in growth in the private sector had adopted spending policies which have caused such a serious recession within the private sector in the Australian Capital Territory. Very clearly, as I have said many times in this place, in the Australian Capital Territory the public and private sectors are interdependent. A government cannot make a savage onslaught on public expenditure and expect the private sector to survive. The private sector depends on the expenditure of public moneys. That expenditure has been reduced and so the private sector is in severe recession. The Canberra Association for Regional Development, in a submission to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) earlier this year, listed the disastrous consequences of this dramatic cut in public expenditure in the Australian Capital Territory. It pointed to the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A movement of unemployed from the Australian Capital Territory, thus 'exporting unemployment',</PARA>
<PARA> An excess of 'outward' over 'inward' migration of members of the workforce and population generally,</PARA>
<PARA>So we are almost in a no-growth situation. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> An outflow of private investment funds and a reduction of an inflow from other centres,</PARA>
<PARA> A definite trend towards stagnation and possibly a downturn of population levels, unless a recovery can be stimulated,</PARA>
<PARA> A project fall in the creation of employment opportunities in both the public and private sectors and predictions of future unemployment as school leavers are due to enter the workforce,</PARA>
<PARA> A reduction in the ratio of the private sector in the workforce to 35 per cent and possibly 30 per cent,</PARA>
<PARA> A reduction in the private sector mix in the A.C.T. economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course the unemployment situation is appalling. The NCDC 1981-82 annual report gives a summary of unemployment over recent years. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . unemployment for those aged 15-19 was considerably higher than for any other age group. The Census results indicate an unemployment rate of 15.1 per cent for this age group compared with a total unemployment rate in the A.C.T. of 5.1 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> the rate for males aged 15-19 was higher than the Australian average-16 per cent compared to 14.4 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> the rate for females aged 15-19 years was lower than the Australian average-14. 1 per cent compared to 18.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1978, the A.C.T. male unemployment rate has been above the Australian average and has consistently been higher than the rates for Sydney and Melbourne . Since 1979, the A.C.T. female unemployment rate has exceeded all capital cities except Adelaide and since 1976 (except in 1978), the overall rate of unemployment in the A.C.T. has been greater than that for Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that at June 1982, 7100 persons in the A.C.T. were unemployed. This represents 6.4 per cent of the labor force. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the Government starts patting itself on the back and saying that the 7.1 per cent level of unemployment most recently registered in the ACT is below the national average of 8.2 per cent for October 1982 I remind the Senate of the point made so clearly in the submission of CARD-that the unemployed are moving out of the ACT to find work. The only reason-every local Federal member in the ACT can confirm this-that Canberra's unemployment is below that appallingly high national average is because we are exporting our unemployed to swell the ranks of the jobless in Sydney and Melbourne. A particularly worrying aspect of this is that many of those who are forced to leave are young people. In August 1982- the last date for which we have figures available-the unemployment rate for 15- year-olds to 19-year-olds in the ACT was 33.1 per cent compared to a national average of 18.3 per cent. Over one-third of the ACT's young people are out of a job and Canberra's unemployment rate for this age group is almost twice the national average. That is how the Fraser Government's economic strategies affect the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, many young employed in Canberra are working only in part time jobs. Of total juniors employed in the ACT in 1981, 34 per cent had part time jobs. During this Government's terms of office there has been a drop in the number of people employed in the private sector in the ACT. In the period 1976-81 there was a decline of 250 in the number of people employed in the private sector compared with an increase of 15,000 people in the years 1971 to 1976. The annual report of the Department of the Capital Territory for 1981-82 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the absolute decline of employment within the private sector is accentuated by the very large increase in part-time employment. Some 7,000 part time jobs were created during 1976-81, all within the private sector, indicating a major substitution of part time for full time employment. </PARA>
<PARA>While the Labor Party is not opposed to part time work and indeed recognises that for some sections of the community, for example, parents with young children, part time work may be suitable, we are extremely concerned at the substitution of part time for full time jobs. As I said, the part time jobs are casual, a few hours a week, to suit the employer's convenience. They do not carry the normal benefits of full time employment. They do not carry recreation leave, sickness leave or long service leave entitlement or other such services. People are going from secure full time employment into casual jobs which give them a very small and erratic income from week to week and no permanent benefits . That casualisation of many jobs in the ACT is just another indication of the sorry state of the local economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I now make some comments about the Government's proposed wages freeze in respect of the ACT. Although the Opposition has had enormous difficulty this week in getting any precise information from the Government about what it is proposing with the wages freeze it appears that the Government's wages freeze will be imposed on the Public Service and there will be some attempt to extend this to the private sector. Of course, this will result in a further sharp contraction of the economy and this will be felt most severely in Canberra. Almost 60 per cent of Canberra's work force is employed in the Public Service so the Government can directly freeze the majority of salaries in the ACT. The effect on local business will be a further downward spiral. Local business has suffered enormously from a lack of consumer spending. If wages are to be frozen for 60 per cent of wage earners in this Territory then I doubt that many small businesses will be able to survive. If the Government goes ahead with this drastic action it is vital that any money saved should be put into programs to create work here in the ACT to offset the contraction that a wage freeze would create. Of course, we do not believe that freeze will go ahead because it is such an ill thought out proposal. It embraces so many economic problems that it will create more of a disaster than that it is attempting to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Fraser Government the number of citizens of the ACT forced into poverty has skyrocketed. In 1976, 6,888 people, or just over 3 per cent of the ACT population, depended for their income on pensions or benefits. Today almost 8.6 per cent, or 19,562 of my constituents, are forced to rely on pensions or benefits as their sole source of income. The social strain this has caused within families in my electorate is, of course, immense. In the face of this Mr Hodgman, the Minister for the Capital Territory, has decided to starve the Canberra Women's Refuge of funds to a point where it may not be able to continue to offer the very essential services it offers to women and children in this community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to point out that this Government, the Fraser Government, unlike former Federal governments of either political complexion, takes no pride in the national capital. Instead it sees Canberra bashing and Public Service bashing as politically advantageous to it outside this electorate. I see the results of that each day in my electorate office. Senator Reid must see the same . We have a Minister for the Capital Territory who seems to regard Canberra and his ministry as an excellent forum for self-promotion but who consistently allows the Fraser Government to make decisions which seriously disadvantage the citizens of Canberra. However, when the Fraser Government proposes supporting an action which may have some deleterious effect on the economy of Tasmania, for example, the Franklin Dam, the Minister is up in arms and threatening to resign. I believe that a better reason for the Minister for the Capital Territory to resign is the state of the local ACT economy. However, I return to the particular purpose of the debate today, the minor tax Bills, and repeat that the Opposition supports the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills before the Senate today are in a sense minor Bills but they are of great importance to some members of this community. For example, the Australian Capital Territory Tax ( Vehicle Registration) Amendment Bill relates to the ownership of vehicles after the decease of an owner. Such vehicles frequently pass between husband and wife. I do not think any of us would deny that the family car really is a family vehicle no matter whose name it may be registered in. It is appropriate that the vehicle should pass among family members without any duty being payable. As a result of legislation brought in, duty has been payable since 1 October 1981. Under this Bill that money will be refunded. Of course, a number of widows in this community paid the duty during that time. I hope that upon the passing of these Bills the refunds, when requested, will be made expeditiously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Several of the other Bills relate to some aspect of stamp duty and income tax. The Bill that is significant, of course, is the Pay-roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Amendment Bill which raises the payroll exemption to $120,000. That is also to take retrospective effect as from 1 September 1981. Perhaps the significant effect of that Bill is that in future adjustments to payroll tax will be made by regulation and not in the same way as has been done in the past. This will enable the adjustments to be made more promptly, I think, and bring the ACT into line with New South Wales. Revenue to the Commonwealth from this source is not very high indeed. However, the Commonwealth has always felt that while payroll tax exists in the States it also should exist in the ACT. I cannot see how anyone can justify the existence of payroll tax anywhere, especially at a time when jobs are at a premium. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem to me that if the Premiers of the States are serious about attempting to do anything about employment they should seriously consider giving up the collection of payroll tax and substantially altering the situation in regard to a number of companies whereby they would be in a position to offer jobs to more people. That is something they should think of. If they did, of course, I would expect and hope that the Commonwealth would follow suit but I do not suggest that this is a matter that would be benefited at all from the Commonwealth giving a lead. It is a matter for the States to take the initiative on. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the payroll tax refunds which are to be made in the Australian Capital Territory, I urge also that on the passing of this legislation every effort be made to see that the money adjustments can be made, I hope, by Christmas to make more money available in this community generally. It is not correct to blame the present situation on Canberra, as has just been done by the last speaker. The enormous growth in the Australian Capital Territory during three significant years of the 1970s, which none of us here have forgotten, just could not be allowed to continue. No one who I know in this Territory would suggest that it should have been allowed to continue. The cutbacks which, of course, follow have had an impact and nobody could deny that. The fact is that at the same time as the Commonwealth is the Government in the Australian Capital Territory it is also the Commonwealth Government and has to take notice of the high demand for income tax deductions which have been made throughout this country. Of course, the impact has been felt in this Territory with its balance between the public and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a number of reasons why the Government is totally responsible for growth in recent times. I suggest that that is a gloss of the story and that there are some significant reasons why there has been growth earlier this year and there is potential growth now. It has been clear from Master Builders Association statements recently that the growth potential in Canberra has been affected. That very clearly has been caused by union activity in Canberra during this year in particular. There was a report in this morning's newspaper that some industrial bans have been lifted on the Australian Defence Force Academy site. Varying bans were on and off at the new Parliament House site contrary to the agreement that had been reached. There have been bans in relation to the construction of the Gowrie Primary School. I gather from this morning's newspaper that some of them have been lifted but the fact is that the Gowrie Primary School now is not likely to be ready for occupation at the beginning of the 1983 school year. Of course, that does not take into account the jobs that have not been available on that site as a result of the bans. Bans have been placed on the construction of the Belconnen Grammar School. It is not yet at a stage where construction jobs would be available but while the bans continue people cannot plan the work and make jobs available. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me back to the Australian Police Academy site at Weston, on which bans have operated since 6 August this year. At least 40 jobs are not available to this community on that site as a result of the continuing Builders Labourers Federation bans for the most base reasons which I have spoken about previously in this place. The BLF took action in relation to an accident. It occupied an insurance company building and when the police asked union members to leave it is true that they left. But as a result they placed bans on the police academy construction and demanded that the police give immunity to intervention in relation to any union activity in the future. In other words, if a person trespasses he is likely to be arrested and dealt with but if a union member trespasses he shall be free to do so. I do not think that any of us would want to live in a community in which they were the basic rules. The result of those activities was, as I have said, 40 jobs not being available to this community. I think that it is well to bear in mind that it may be only 40 jobs lost on the site but the impact upon the private sector is much more serious in that it is a great deterrent to people to invest money in the Australian Capital Territory when they know that the unions are behaving in this way. Carpet firms in Fyshwick also have been suffering from union activities recently and their businesses have been most seriously affected. In the interests of seeing that these Bills are dealt with and finally disposed of this afternoon, I will not deal with that story today. I return now to the payroll tax implications. It costs $336.90 a week for a carpenter's wages in the Australian Capital Territory . That amount is increased by 60 per cent because of the statutory expenses which are associated with it. This brings the cost up to $533 which includes, of course, workers compensation, holiday pay, sick pay and annual leave. That figure does not include anything like the cost of equipment or profits but it does include the cost of payroll tax. I think it is time that we seriously started looking at the cost of employing somebody and realising the actual implications of the cost of employment. It is not just a matter of the $336 to employ a carpenter. When thinking about increasing one's work force one is really looking at $533 a week. I again come back to the point that I made earlier. Perhaps it is for the State governments to give the lead in payroll tax and abolish it altogether thus giving some incentive and encouragement in the area of employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an issue that I want to raise in relation to the Australian Capital Territory Stamp Duty Amendment Bill 1982. The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) will no doubt be aware that owing to quite significant differences between the stamp duty legislation as it applies in the Australian Capital Territory and in the States, the Australian Capital Territory is a tax haven for persons wishing to avoid stamp duty with State authorities. It is estimated in recent months that they have been losing more than $100m annually in stamp duty revenue through transactions being conducted in the Australian Capital Territory. I take it that the Minister will be able to confirm that the Commonwealth Government has been fully aware of this form of tax avoidance for a number of years. So, indeed, it ought to be aware of it because in many ways it is the easiest and cheapest form of tax avoidance in town and has been for a long time. I hope that the Minister will also recall that some concern in this respect was uttered by the State Treasurers at their meeting on 27 September 1982 with the Treasurer, Mr Howard. As I understand it, the Government proposed, as a result of that meeting, to pay some very careful attention to the status of stamp duty in the Australian Capital Territory and to do something fairly urgently about redressing the loophole situation that prevails. In the light of all that, I ask: Why is it that the only effect of the present Australian Capital Territory Stamp Duty Amendment Bill seems to be, if anything, to widen the exemptions from duty under the Australian Capital Territory legislation rather than doing anything to close the gap which does exist and which has been so significant between Australian Capital Territory law and that which applies in other States?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that Senator Evans is aware of the concern of the Commonwealth Government and the States and aware of the establishment, as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on 27 September, of a working party to look at some matters related to the question that has just been raised. On the broader question of the abuses that can occur through avoidance and evasion, the Ministers agreed that all governments have an obligation to bring to each other's attention information about examples of abuse of the respective revenue laws operating in Australia. But it was agreed by all governments, I think, that we need particularly to take into account the fact that a degree of uniformity of duties among the States would be desirable but that governments need to retain independence and flexibility to achieve their own policy objectives. Whilst Senator Evans has drawn attention to the Commonwealth Government's stamp duties in the Australian Capital Territory, account also needs to be taken of the application by the States of their own stamp duties and whatever other charges relate to the registration of companies and things of that sort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, that working party arose from the statement of the Treasurer on 27 September. I understand that it has just reported to the Treasurer. I think it was asked to report by 1 December and I am told that the report was given to the Treasurer today. I expect that after the Treasurer's consideration of that report there will be some comment from him. As I have said, when we are looking at disparity between the Commonwealth and the States we need to take into account the independence of the States. If they are suffering disadvantage because of Australian Capital Territory rates they may have the flexibility in some instances to do something on their own account. I think if we await the report that has been presented by the working party and the response to it by the Commonwealth and the States we might be able further to discuss the question raised by Senator Evans. </PARA>

I have no desire to draw any more attention than is necessary to the privileged position that the Australian Capital Territory has held for so long as the recipient of Commonwealth Government and Treasury largesse, but I suggest to both Senator Reid and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) that this is one area in which the Commonwealth, through its Territory, is very much out of step with the States.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday 30 November, in my capacity as Deputy Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, I presented a report of the Committee's inquiry into the Commonwealth's role in rural research and extension services. It is usual practice for the chairmen of respective Senate committees to table such reports together with a statement. Because of the absence of our Chairman, Senator Thomas, on parliamentary business it is my duty today to deliver the statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Agriculture, perhaps more than any other sector of the economy, requires the continuing support of effective research to maintain and improve its competitive position on world markets. One needs only consider the constantly changing pattern of diseases affecting crops, pasture and livestock, the development of plant and animal breeding techniques and the changing nature of farm management to understand the need for effective research. The role of government, both State and Federal, in supporting agricultural research is crucial. Unlike manufacturing industry, where innovations can generally be protected by patents or trade marks, the results of agricultural research often cannot be so protected, thus the researcher can expect little direct return on his or her investment. It is widely accepted that in these circumstances only public funding can ensure an adequate level of research. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the importance of the Commonwealth's role the Committee concluded that it 'lacked any clear policy on agricultural research'. This conclusion was supported by the decline in real terms of Commonwealth funding, the confusion of policy towards the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the recent abolition of the Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension. The lack of clear policy is particularly disturbing in view of the large number of inquiries into both rural and science policy in the last decade. The Committee believes that a vacuum exists in providing policy advice on research within the Department of Primary Industry. It was partly and briefly filled by the short-lived Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension which was abolished in 1981. In view of this the Committee recommends that a bureau of rural research be established to monitor rural research, to evaluate its worth and to provide informed policy advice to the relevant Minister. To supplement the work of this bureau the Committee also proposes that an agricultural research grant be established to consolidate existing fragmented Commonwealth research funds, thus enabling financial resources to be directed more quickly to areas of priority identified by the bureau. Of particular concern to the Committee are the research needs of new industries, of industries outside the rural industry research funds and of multidisciplinary research not adequately catered for within the existing system. The Committee also believes that the decline of the real level of funding for rural research must be stopped . Research institutions cannot continue to function effectively without some security of financial support. To let research run down even, or particularly, during a period of financial stringency is short-sighted and exhibits a lack of understanding both of the need for and the returns from successful research. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to turn briefly to the three main components of the Commonwealth's role in rural research-the CSIRO, the rural industry research funds and the tertiary education sector. The quality of the CSIRO's research work is widely recognised. However the organisation's ability to respond to the demands placed upon it is being reduced by financial constraints, staff ceilings and contradictory Government demands. The Committee therefore recommends that the CSIRO be no longer subject to staff ceilings and that the Government ensure that where it directs the CSIRO to undertake new areas of research the organisation's budget is increased accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The rural industry research funds are joint industry-government moneys funded in part by levies collected from producers. They have proved in the past to be an effective method of involving rural producers in research funding and should be expanded. To ensure that industry's contribution is maintained in real terms the Committee recommends that the various commodity levies be adjusted at least every three years. The Commonwealth should seek to expand the RIRF system, particularly for newly emerging agricultural products. </PARA>
<PARA> The tertiary sector is something of a poor relation in agricultural science. It is generally accepted that its potential is underutilised, despite the importance of both the teaching and research functions, particularly of the universities. The Committee believes that agricultural education and research should be stimulated by a number of measures. They are: The provision of increased research funds through the proposed Agricultural Research Grant; a further increase in post-graduate research awards; and increased co-operation between universities and colleges on the one hand and State and Federal research institutions on the other. In addition the universities should be directly represented on the Standing Committee on Agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout its inquiry the Committee did not consider it part of its role to examine the merit of particular research projects. However in one area, that of soil conservation, the Committee believes that the national importance of the subject demands specific comment. The report of the joint Commonwealth-State working group on soil conservation reported in 1978 that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . over half the area in agricultural or pastoral use requires treatment for soil degradation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth has failed to act on the findings of that inquiry. In view of the extent of the problem and its fundamental importance to Australian agriculture, the Committee proposes that a major soil conservation program be established by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Committee members, I express sincere thanks to our support staff. Firstly, I do so to our energetic and very capable secretary, Mr Derek Abbott. Derek has been with the Committee for some time now and his experience has been invaluable in the many inquiries undertaken by the Committee. Secondly, I express thanks to Jennifer Norberry, who was our research assistant during this inquiry. Jennifer was with the Committee for quite some time but she has now taken a position away from the Senate. The Committee extends its best wishes to Jennifer for success and happiness in her new vocation. I commend the report to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Standing Committee on National Resources has presented its report entitled 'The Commonwealth's Role in Rural Research and Extension Services'. This report very clearly reflects the frustrations felt by rural industry at the lack of Commonwealth commitment to research. In real terms the money for research fell from $98m in 1976-77 to only $73m in 1980. This, together with a cutback in staff, has had a disastrous effect, especially in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Not only has the Commonwealth neglected agricultural research but also it lacks a comprehensive and definite policy. For example, we saw the establishment, and within three years the abolition, of the Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension. Further evidence of neglect is seen in the transfer to the States of the Commonwealth Extension Services Grant. Whilst the Committee believes that the quality of the work of the CSIRO is not to be disputed, its allocation of priorities is open to question. We believe that there is some neglect by the CSIRO in Tasmania and Western Australia. In other words, coming from Tasmania I am concerned that that State is being forgotten in regard to research effort applied to many of the problems that confront that State. As the Tasmanian State Government pointed out in its submission, there are no CSIRO staff in Tasmania working full time on agricultural production research. I think this is to be deplored, especially in view of the importance of horticulture to that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is an immediate need for the CSIRO to reassess its priorities, maybe under Government direction or within the CSIRO. Horticulture, for instance, is very much a neglected area. The past emphasis has been on traditional cereal crops, wool, dairy products, et cetera, but for too long horticulture has been neglected. Unless the CSIRO is prepared to take up this matter I believe there should be a commitment of Commonwealth funds to universities which could direct very good effort into this area. The importance of, for example, Tasmania's horticultural production means that our research needs are different from those of the rest of Australia. We do not always benefit from research carried out elsewhere because of soil and climatic differences and other factors. The Committee believes that there is a need, therefore, for the CSIRO to decentralise its research facilities, particularly to those regional areas which are of some influence and importance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognises the importance of research into cost reductions in off -farm activities for rural produce. Research in this area can be just as important on a cost benefit basis as research into on-farm activities. The wool industry has long recognised this fact. The approach of the wool industry could be well adopted by a number of other smaller industries. The Committee believes that there is a need for major public sector research effort in agriculture. The structure of rural industry makes it unlikely that all rural industry could conduct its own research. On the other hand there are a number of instances in which industry provides a very significant contribution. In particular I refer to the sugar industry. It is unique amongst Australian agricultural industries because of the very high level of research activity funded predominantly by industry sources. The sugar industry has demonstrated its willingness to contribute funds for industry research, and while it continues to get value for money it will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that rural industries should be prepared to shoulder a greater proportion of the cost of their research where the degree of organisation and concentration permits it. Therefore, we also believe that the Commonwealth should provide matching funds on a two to one basis for new rural industry research funds for two years after they attain a statutory reserve fund status. As the Deputy Chairman Senator McLaren mentioned earlier, our Committee drew attention to the need for a national soil conservation council to be established by the Commonwealth Government in consultation with the States and that the Council initiate a national soil conservation program. </PARA>
<PARA> Anybody who has been in Canberra during the last three weeks would have noticed a dust haze on some very windy days because of dust blown in from, perhaps, the Wagga Wagga area or from central Australia. One of the real tragedies of Australia is wind erosion of our soils. It is a tragedy that not more is being done by way of soil conservation measures in the wheat belt areas because a lot of that soil is annually being lost forever. Far more attention should be paid by State departments of agriculture, by farmers and by the Commonwealth. We talk about our lost heritage and the loss of the wilderness in the South West of Tasmania, but what are we doing to keep Australian soils in place for future generations? It is a tragedy that this important matter has been neglected. Our committee has drawn attention to the problem, which we must take up as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also an under-investment by the Commonwealth in university research. Australia has nine universities which have agricultural science faculties and four which have veterinary science faculties. In addition, there are 10 colleges of advanced education which have schools related to agricultural science. The Committee acknowledges a problem presented by the low output of post-graduates. There are not enough financial incentives for graduates to stay on at the post- graduate level. We draw attention to this matter at page 31 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA> The ramifications of an undersupply of good quality postgraduate students are not limited to affecting research carried out today in Australian universities and colleges. If this trend is allowed to continue, it is likely that there will be an insufficient number of trained research scientists available to staff Australian research institutes in 10 or 20 years's time. Throughout its inquiry the Committee was told that most overseas agricultural research is inapplicable to Australian conditions. In these circumstances it seems particularly important that Australia ensure that it is able to conduct its own rural research in the future by training adequate numbers of postgraduate students today. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is reviewing the report of its Standing Committee on National Resources on the Commonwealth's Role in Rural Research and Extension Services. I must say that the Committee came to a very sorry conclusion, which should be of the utmost concern to every farmer and farming organisation in this country. Its key conclusion in relation to the Commonwealth's role was that the Commonwealth lacks any clearly stated policy on its role in agricultural research. The Committee recommended as a priority that the Commonwealth develop such a policy so that, having stated explicitly the reasons for fostering rural research, priorities can be established for the disbursement of funds, either directly into certain research organisations, or in conjunction with the application of rural industry research funds, or by way of some special fund perhaps in relation to new industries or multi-disciplinary problems such as soil conservation presents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is indeed a very strong argument for considerable Commonwealth financing of rural research. One finds that the industry provides Australia with virtual self-sufficiency in food. It contributes significantly to national income and accounts for about 40 per cent, by value, of our export trade. It is obviously an industry which requires constant care. In order to ensure that our competitive position, which is so important, is maintained effective research into the management of soil and water resources, protection against disease, the development of high yielding and disease resistant species of plants and animals must be pursued. That cannot result from aggregating the efforts of many hundreds of thousands of individual farmers on small holdings. It just will not work that way. What are required are contributions from the Federal Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, of course, a very good investment. All of the studies undertaken into rural research in comparable countries, as well as in Australia itself, indicate that the rates of return on investment in agricultural research are among the very best obtainable. That has certainly been the case in Australia. I have in mind the cattle tick measures that have been instituted, the control of pasture insects-locusts, sirex wasp and so on. One could go on to mention other examples . The myxomatosis campaign is perhaps the symbol of what can be one for Australia agriculture, given a good research effort. So there is a considerable argument for substantial Commonwealth funding for this purpose. Given that the argument does exist, the Committee was very alarmed indeed to find that, despite the continuing need for rural research the Commonwealth's support therefor, in real terms, is declining, and not just marginally. In 1976-77 the Commonwealth's allocation for this purpose was $98m. By 1980 it had declined to $73m. In addition, when one considers the restraint on staff levels in Commonwealth institutions such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation one realises that rural research has declined markedly as a priority of this Government, which purports among other things to be a friend of the farming sector. The Committee was alarmed to note this decline in real expenditures on the part of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the fact that rural research is such an excellent investment, it would be fair to say the Committee was also surprised to find that the contribution of the rural sector itself had been declining. Rural industry research fund moneys are an important source of finance for Government departments, universities and other research institutions. In fact, the catalyst that such moneys provide in those institutions means that research is carried on which far exceeds the apparent effect of the money applied by those research funds. We found that there was no mechanism that would allow levies to be reviewed at intervals, which we suggest should be no longer than three years. Let us consider the position with regard to some of our major rural industries. The meat research cattle levy was last adjusted in 1971. The wool levy was last adjusted in 1974- 75. The meat research sheep levy was adjusted recently, in 1979, but from a level set in 1966. There is no mechanism which allows for the regular, frequent, amendment of levies paid by these industries towards research. </PARA>
<PARA> We also found evidence that the Commonwealth itself was somewhat slow in implementing the recommendations of industry committees for levy increases. We decided that it was very important that industry be encouraged-as indeed its spokesmen said that they were prepared to do- to make frequent adjustments to levies to ensure that research projects were carried out through a proper and real level of funding. We found in particular that new industries were not adequately catered for and recommended a way in which the Commonwealth could encourage such industries by providing two-for-one matching funds. In this way it could help new industries, particularly horticultural industries, to become established. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that the great Australian commodities of wool, wheat, meat, barley and so on were well catered for but that this was not the case in respect of new industries, multidisciplinary research programs, regional research programs and off-farm research-which is extremely important and can be just as important in reducing industry costs as on-farm research. In these fields the research undertaken was not at all sufficient. This was symbolised most dramatically in relation to soil conservation. There is no doubt that the degradation of our soil is a matter of great concern to the Committee and should be of great concern to the whole Australian community. Only by proper soil conservation policies and practices can we sustain agriculture in the way in which it has been of such service to the Australian community over the years since European settlement began. We were shocked to find that although the Commonwealth Government in 1980 proposed a much-vaunted, national soil conservation program and announced a special $3m grant in order to get it off the ground, it had completely abolished it as a result of the recommendations of the razor gang, purporting instead to make the money available to the States by way of general grants. We know that that kind of approach does not work. So much so that an article in the Australian on Friday 29 October by Geoff Sorby bears the title 'Soil conservation policy is still blowing in the wind'. The fact remains that the national Government does not have a soil conservation policy. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> For every tonne of grain produced 13 tonnes of topsoil are lost. On the famous Darling Downs in Queensland, soil losses have reached 50 tonnes a hectare in some places. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria alone there is about 100,000 hectares of land affected by salinity.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to these problems, the Committee recommended strongly that a national soil conservation council be established by the Commonwealth Government in consultation with the States and that the council initiate a national soil conservation program to be adequately funded by the Commonwealth. As far as adequate funds are concerned, we saw the water resources program receiving $200m over five years as providing some indication of the dimension of what needed to be done. The Committee said the following in very strong terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that soil degradation on this scale is a national problem of enormous significance and is dismayed that the Commonwealth has withdrawn from active support of a proposed National Soil Conservation Programme . In view of the extent of the problem and the threat it poses to the productivity of the agricultural sector the lack of a properly funded and co- ordinated soil conservation programme is indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, you would be well aware that those are amongst the strongest terms one can come across in a Senate committee report, representing as it does a bi-partisan assembly of senators who try to be even handed and moderate in their recommendations. The Committee concluded that the lack of a national soil conservation policy on the part of this Government was indefensible. It recommended immediate alteration of that stance. I can tell the Senate-honourable senators would want to know-that the Labor Party, on coming to office, will indeed institute a national soil conservation program by restoring Commonwealth involvement by the provision of $4m to the States in the first year for approved programs, rising to $20m after four years. That would be our contribution to ensuring that the very sound recommendations of this Committee report were indeed implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I wish to speak briefly to the report. The principal security choice in foreign policy today is to be either aligned or non -aligned with a major world power. Thirty years ago Australia chose alliance with the most powerful nation in the world. The ANZUS alliance arose out of a close relationship during the war and a common perception thereafter of mutual dangers. It has become one link in what might be described as the web of total Western alliances, but over the last 30 years the world scene has changed substantially. Furthermore, Australia's position in that world scene has changed . Whereas we might well then have been described as an extension of Europe, we are now economically primarily linked with Asia, with nations which mostly have chosen to be non-aligned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not surprising, therefore, that in such changed circumstances there are in Australia members of the community who criticise the continuing existence of the ANZUS alliance. They tend to be divided into two groups. The first group criticises the form of the treaty, and argue that its mutual defence obligation is not as binding a statement as that in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation pact. Some argue that it is too limited geographically. Others argue that there is no specific obligation in the pact to defend. They tend to argue that the treaty should be renegotiated in order that it might be an effective defence pact in the circumstances of today's world. </PARA>
<PARA> The second group argues that the political costs of the treaty to Australia are too great. They argue that joint Australian-United States facilities make Australia a nuclear target, that by the treaty there is a loss of sovereignty, due in part to the presence of such facilities. They say that the treaty distorts our national defence posture as a result of adopting policies better suited to the global defence attitude of the United States than to our own defence needs, and that it places upon Australia diplomatic constraints which may conflict with our own foreign policy priorities within our region. Some in this group desire the abrogation of the treaty; that is, that Australia become non-aligned. Others argue to retain alignment and the treaty, but not to allow, for example, United States nuclear warships to visit Australia, B52s to fly over Australia and joint defence facilities. In other words, they wish to retain the treaty but not these activities which they argue are not obligations of the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, it was an opportune time for a parliamentary committee to examine the alliance and to comment upon its role and suitability for Australia in the world of the 1980s. I deal firstly with the criticisms of form. To the extent that the treaty contains ambiguities and is imprecise, the criticisms are valid. But if such ambiguities or imprecisions were removed, would Australia be better off? That is the principal question to be asked. In my opinion, it would not. The reason is that to read a treaty in the same way as a contract for, say, the sale of a car is an error. A mutual defence treaty is really only as good as the relationship between the parties. It is no good saying: 'If you don't come to my aid I'll sue you for damages or for specific performance'. If the relationship is such that a legal interpretation of obligations is necessary before a party will act, a treaty is of little value, be it precise or imprecise. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANZUS alliance was born out of an affinity, shared values, compatible institutions and objectives. Such mutual characteristics and ideals lie at the heart of what is referred to as 'the special relationship between Australia and the United States'. ANZUS arose out of that special relationship; the special relationship did not arise out of ANZUS. That is the real strength of the alliance. That is why its flexibility and imprecision can, in fact, be a strength. Thus, the responsibilities and obligations of each party under the treaty have been able to adapt to changing world situations. Clearly, the United States now expects Australia to take primary responsibility for its security in relation to regional threats. Australia accepts that obligation. As I assess the situation, Australia does not automatically expect to receive United States assistance in all contingencies, irrespective of whether the treaty says so. She would expect to receive assistance if a threat arose from a major power or alliance with which she was not able to deal unaided. I am satisfied that that is the obligation accepted by the United States, not because of the letter of the treaty but because of the special relationship that exists between us. Therefore, the arguments on deficiencies of the language I dismiss. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to the political objections. I look first at the question of whether Australia should or should not be part of an alliance. Do we better protect our cultural, political and economic interests by being in defence alliance with other nations whose values we share, and thus run the risk of being drawn into the international problems which we might otherwise avoid, or by going it alone? Australia has a record of being prepared to go to the aid of nations whose freedom has been threatened. In late 1941, when Australian territory was threatened with invasion, nations with similar ideals in relation to this report , particularly the United States, were prepared to come to our assistance. I support the alliance, not so much because of immediate national security but because of the responsibility Australia has to support and assist other free nations. To make that commitment will, I believe, in turn give Australia its best long term security. There is no doubt that many non-aligned nations expect Western support in the event of crises, but they are not prepared to make the same sort of commitment themselves. They want the benefits but not the costs. I do not believe true benefits come without costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The second series of arguments relates to whether the costs accepted by Australia under the ANZUS treaty are too great. I must confess that to me ANZUS is heavily weighted in Australia's favour. That arises out of the basic asymmetry of the relationship-a major power on the one hand and a regional power on the other. Out of that asymmetry I recognise that, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) put it, the United States will always be more visible to us than we are to the United States. Out of that appears to have arisen many of the concerns, frustrations and even fears expressed by critics of ANZUS. </PARA>
<PARA> Time will allow me to look only briefly at whether Australia's foreign policy, for example, is unduly restrained by the alliance. However, one need only look at differences in policy in Africa and Indo-China, differences in emphasis on North-South issues, considerable differences in economic issues, consider the Australian Government's comments on extraterritorial breach of United States laws, look at differences in the Law of the Sea negotiations and differences even in disarmament policies to appreciate that within the constraints of friendship and major common interests there is room in which Australia can and should act separately when our interests diverge. </PARA>
<PARA> As we concluded in an earlier report entitled 'Threats to Australian Security', the joint bases are potential nuclear targets. They represent a considerable cost, but they are a significant contribution by Australia to the defence of the alliance. Although they may not be an obligatory part of the ANZUS pact they are , as the former Minister for Defence, Mr Killen, said, 'a contribution by an independent ally to the United States deterrent upon which Australia's protection against fundamental threat from a global power ultimately depends'. </PARA>
<PARA> On my assessment the bases are not an unreasonable cost. That they may not be specifically within the obligations of the treaty is to me irrelevant. The question of whether they are within the spirit of the alliance is so important. All relationships need to be worked on to remain strong. We should perhaps give more attention to what we might contribute to the strength of the relationship than allow any national inferiority complex to allow us to presume that what we put in will always outweigh what we get out. In concluding I thank the staff of the Committee for their enthusiasm and competence in relation to the preparation of this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a party to the dissenting report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. As it was explained last week by Senator Sibraa, there is no need to go into the reasons for the dissenting report. As a member of that Committee I felt that we could have got a lot more out of the ANZUS agreement than we have. When the ANZUS treaty was signed 32 years ago the political and economic climate was very different and the treaty requires some renogotiation. I believe Australia is in a position to expect a bit more commitment from our ally than that which we have at the moment. I see the ANZUS treaty as a rather one-sided treaty. Let me explain. The treaty has been described as a type of insurance policy whereby we keep on paying the premiums and the return is something about which we can only guess and hope for the best if the policy is ever revoked. Unlike the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation agreement, there is no guarantee whatsoever in the ANZUS treaty that the United States of America or New Zealand would come to our aid should we be in a conflict or under attack. No matter what the circumstances are, there is no guarantee that they will come to our assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This treaty is only a basis on which to build a network of defence and so far we have certainly been more than willing to allow a powerful ally to build up its network of forward defence on Australian soil. How much say we have in the operation of these bases and therefore how much say we have in determining our own foreign policy is anyone's guess. Indeed, we have begged our allies to do even more by offering them a home port at Cockburn Sound and allowing them to stage their B52 bombers at Darwin. But still this gives us no guarantee. It gives us no guarantee whatsoever. We committed our youth to fight under the star spangled banner in Asia in the name of ANZUS. That was just another premium and still did not earn us a guarantee. In fact, all these premiums could be paid in vain. It may make us feel brave when we are dealing with other countries because we may think that those countries feel that we have this powerful ally behind us which will help us out if we get into any trouble. But what happened when Indonesia laid claim to West Irian? Originally the United States of America supported Australia, Holland and West Irian, making strong objection to Indonesia's claim. But the United States saw it as being in its own interests for Indonesia to take over West Iran, as it would curb the creeping horde of communism or something like that. It had nothing to do with the creeping horde of capitalism. That forced us into doing a complete about face so that we could be on side with our ANZUS partners. </PARA>
<PARA> This illustrates just how much independence in foreign policy we can have under this treaty. Independence can be a very high price to pay. With the United States bases in Australia I have no doubt that we are vulnerable. A number of authorities have agreed that we are vulnerable. Yet, still those bases give us no guarantee. Much as I see the United States as a great democracy and a marvellous partner, I would prefer to see the partnership based on an equal footing. I do not wish to see Australia in a position where it is an expendable pawn. For example, back in the 1960s France decided to explode its own nuclear bomb. I am not saying that we should copy the logic of the French at that time but they turned to their ally, America, and said: 'We know you do not want us to develop a bomb. We realise you said you are a partner and would help us out. You have in the past. You sacrificed your soldiers in 1914 and again in the last war to free Europe. France is very grateful.' We are all very grateful to America for what it did. However, France then said to America: 'We realise what you have done but because you are our ally we do not expect you to sacrifice a city in return for a French city.' I am not saying that we should follow the French attitude and develop a bomb of our own but they claimed that a nation cannot be certain of security unless it has the collective will to retain mastery over its destiny; that is, unless it has the ability to evaluate the situation on its own and make independent decisions on action to be taken. France refused to be dependent on anyone else-an ideal which inspired Joan of Arc, the fighters of the French Revolution and those at Valence, Verdun and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Without going into the romantic side of it, what I am driving at is this: I believe that Australia is in a position to get a far better deal, to get some type of guarantee. As Senator Hill said, the situation has changed. Sure it has changed. We should recognise that. We should be prepared to go to our partner, not cap in hand, but to say: 'We are looking for some type of guarantee at least equal to that given to NATO. If we are to lose our independence-we have lost our independence when it comes to negotiating foreign policy-we should have some right to renegotiate this deal and get a better deal for Australia, or at least a deal that will protect our independence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words about the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the ANZUS alliance. In my opinion it has been a valuable exercise to look into the ANZUS treaty. Unfortunately, a lot of people in Australia today are totally unaware of the history of the ANZUS treaty. I believe that it is to the benefit of Australia and the United States of America to look periodically at some of these treaties. I have always been of the opinion that, irrespective of what is in a treaty, it is almost valueless unless people in both the countries that make up the treaty endeavour to understand and to appreciate one another's attitude. I think that is important. When this treaty was signed 32 years ago feelings between Australians and Americans were very close simply because many people from both countries fought side by side to defend their countries. As I have said, there has been a great deal of appreciation of this by people in the business and political fields simply because of that conflict. But as time has gone by, this feeling has waned. A lot of these people have retired or have passed on. I believe that it is in Australia's interests to revive this knowledge to make others aware of this feeling and to inform them of how Australians and Americans live. We must have a better understanding. Any treaty is almost valueless unless some positive aspect is put into it. It has to come down to people. There has to be a total desire for friendship and a total understanding that each country would protect the other in a time of crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the ANZUS treaty can be renegotiated. We on the Labor side dissented in two areas. One area of dissent, of course, is the North West Cape. I and my party do not believe that we are in total command of that situation. Things could happen about which we would be totally unaware. For instance, there could be a declaration of war or an attack signal could be made and we would be unaware of it. I believe that, to some extent, the ANZUS treaty can be renegotiated with benefits to both sides. It has always worried me that there are only 22 countries left in the world that can be classified as democratic. I think it is up to the citizens of different generations to look periodically at the treaties of their countries. I think the Committee did a worthwhile job. Certainly we have raised the issue and I would hope that the community looks at what we have done. To open up the question of any treaty I think is healthy and desirable. I congratulate the Committee and its staff. They did a magnificient job and were very helpful. This Committee has to look at other references in regard to Australian-American relations. I believe that in the future further reports will come down which will be beneficial to Australian-American relations . I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of all the assignments that I have had serving on Senate committees this assignment was the most difficult. It involved a subject with a highly scientific background. I do not think any of us questions the sincerity of the Vietnam veterans and the various testimonies that were placed before us. On the other hand, on all Senate committees one can never let one's heart dictate to one's head. I suppose there are a number of lessons in this issue. If it had been a declared war or the troops in question had been under the United Nations flag there would have been a different atmosphere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leaving aside the problems of our own Vietnam veterans, let us look at the history in the United States. When the hostages from the United States Embassy in Iran were released they had a ticker-tape parade in New York. The Vietnam veterans felt that by comparison their role, on behalf of the United States war strategy, was not given a high rating. I suppose this attitude could apply in Australia, but there was another aspect to it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. That was borne out by American ex-servicemen who were not pinks, far from it. I say respectfully that whatever the division about that war, there is no question that, on reflection, the thing that worried so many veterans is that if they had been at El Alamein or Kokoda or in World War I they could have looked back to campaigns that were successful. Unfortunately-perhaps the media have to bear some of the odium-it was felt that it was rather a futile campaign. That is one general observation. This does not mean that we are unaware of some of the problems that were encountered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is probably unfortunate that when we had witnesses from Dow Chemicals ( Australia) Ltd before us, and for that matter other witnesses, they were talking about things that reached their zenith in the late 1960s. Yet there we were in the 1980s trying to get clear-cut responses. In the recommendations we brought down we added a saving clause. The Government has until March to come up with responses. I know that while we were inquiring the Government had two national surveys under way. No doubt there has been other work in the United States. In light of the Vietnam veterans' submissions on the use of chemicals by Americans- I and other honourable senators do not condone it-I would have expected the Vietnamese Government to go to the United Nations with massive statistics to show that the new generation, the offspring of Vietnamese mothers, had wholesale deformities. Conversely, the World Health Organisation might come up with such statistics. On that point alone I made a sharp distinction between the arguments about the deformities of the unfortunate offspring of some Vietnam veterans and the personal psychological problems of the veterans. I asked the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to provide statistics on the fairly sizable Vietnamese families in Australia and the medical checks on that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the start that one could not let one's heart dictate to one's head. Evidence of that sort, if it had been manifest, would have been overwhelming, on the submissions by the veterans. On the other hand, there is no question about the psychological difficulties that they encountered. It may be argued that the frustrations in the Australian work force, or for that matter in the whole world today, are different from the nomadic tendencies that many Australian ex- servicemen had after World War II. We were in a full employment situation up until the late 1950s. It was only about 1961 that we had a temporary recession. The point I am making is that these Vietnam ex-servicemen encountered the evils of a capitalistic system and opportunities were denied to them earlier than they were denied to soldiers of other campaigns. I am trying to paint the raw picture as I see it. I repeat that there is no question about it. Belatedly, the officialdom of the Returned Services League is much more aware of the situation now. The real dilemma was that when witnesses came before the RSL their ages ranged from the low twenties to the low thirties, and that is an age group which does not correspond with the age group of the hierarchy of the RSL. I do not say that in any sarcastic fashion. But I believe that the gap is being bridged and much of the past misunderstanding has been overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that evidence from some witnesses almost borders on science fiction. But I have never been one to believe in that situation. I have drawn a sharp distinction in relation to what I believe are the unproven assertions about the effect of pesticides and herbicides on the wives and families of these men who married a number of years after they had served in Vietnam. I think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) who is in the chamber and who is listening to me intently will agree that some of the surveys which have been commenced have not yet reached finality. I think he will read our report and see that by March next year we would like to see some positive responses. </PARA>
<PARA> I say respectfully that I felt that the Vietnam veterans were a bunch of people who were sincere and dedicated. We had to be objective. We had top technical advisers. These veterans were faced with problems involving tight employment and a society in which the chosen profession of many people has gone by the board. That situation has had an impact on these veterans. The effect of the tightening economic situation has had an effect on the families of veterans as well as other families. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on this point. It was a difficult assignment. I think the Committee, which comprised people of different ideologies and philosophies, reached a consensus, confident, or perhaps the word should be hopeful, that the Government will have bridged this gap by March. I do not close my eyes to the fact-I do not think any of us do-that while we groped a little in trying to understand the United States formulas relating to agent orange and the answers we received, it may well be that other scienific facts will surface. But, on balance, I felt that the Committee was on trial. It had a very difficult assignment. I think the fact that we brought down a rather cautious report will be understood for the reasons I have given. We have tried to look at the matter from our heads rather than our hearts. That is no reflection on the evidence that was given to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time I have available to me I should like to mention a couple of matters in relation to the first report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment on 'Pesticides and the Health of Australian Vietnam Veterans'. The first point that I want to emphasise relates to the aspects of birth abnormalities, which is mentioned on page 203 of the Committee's report. Paragraph (4) on that page states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee concludes that it is highly improbable that the birth abnormalities reported among the children of Vietnam veterans are the result of the verteran's exposure to pesticides while serving in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA>I would go even further than that. I would say it is extremely improbable. We even had problems with some of the doctors who appeared before us not understanding the nature of what causes most birth defects. A quite high percentage of birth defects exists in the general community, so that there is quite likely to be the same percentage throughout the Vietnam veterans. It is natural enough for people, if they have a child born with some deformity, to blame something if they possibly can. But it is unwise for them, really, to blame the things that happened in Vietnam. They were not the cause. I do not have time to go fully into the matter now. The doctors who want to look into this matter can find the teratogenic nature of most birth abnormalities. I would like to put the minds of the wives of Vietnam veterans very much at rest because there is practically no chance-a very very slight chance-of any of the abnormalities being due to anything that happened in Vietnam. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the honourable senator says it was. I say it was not. That is where he and I often have to differ. I now want to differ with someone else. I want to comment on the statements that have been released by the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, in relation to this report. Firstly, I would like to refer to the statement released by Mr Phil Thompson, President of the Association, on 25 November 1982, prior to the tabling of the report. He made reference to the Department of Defence report on the 21,000 files held at the Australian War Memorial, which has not at this stage been made available to the Committee, and implied that because of this the report will be incomplete. I can assure the Senate that when this document is made available to the Committee it will be examined closely and duly taken into consideration when the Committee reports back to the Senate next session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other important matter raised in this statement that relates to the Committee, concerns the public hearing on 22 September 1982 in which officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs appeared before the Committee. Mr Thompson suggested that the Department, 'appears to enjoy a special relationship with the Committee Chairman, Senator Jessop', and that it, 'was granted a special extra hearing after the Committee announced the completion of its public hearings'. It should be noted that the Department appeared at the request of the Committee and was not granted a special extra hearing as suggested by Mr Thompson. </PARA>
<PARA> At public hearings held in May, Mr Manning from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, outlined the location of the Ranch Hand spraying operations in relation to the position of Australian troops in the Dalat, Bien Hoa-Long Binh and Rung Sat areas. The Committee decided that similar information for Phuoc Tuy Province , where the Australian task force was based, would be particularly useful. Accordingly, the Committee asked the Department of Veterans' Affairs to provide this information at a public hearing on 22 September 1982. It was not the Committee's intention to reopen the hearings, but merely to expand on information given at a previous hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee Secretary forwarded a transcript of this evidence to the VVAA and asked for its comments in writing on the material presented to it by the Department. The VVAA provided the Committee with written comments. In his statement, Mr Thompson said: 'When we sought equal time for a further public hearing we were flatly refused'. The Committee made this decision when Senator Jessop and Senator Mulvihill-the Chairman and Deputy Chairman-were overseas and I was acting as Chairman. All other members of the Committee unanimously agreed that the VVAA had been given ample opportunity to present evidence and that written comments that we sent them on the hearing would suffice. May I add that hearings for the inquiry were held at Sydney twice, Melbourne and Canberra, twice. The VVAA presented evidence at Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra and its advisers presented evidence on its behalf at Sydney and Melbourne. At all times it was the Committee's aim to ensure that the VVAA was given ample opportunity to present its case. I have another couple of paragraphs which I think it is important for me to get through at this stage. I seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The paragraphs read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The second statement from the VVAA that I wish to comment on was again released on 25 November 1982, but this time after the report was tabled. In this statement Mr Thompson continually referred to the fact that the Committee held ten days of hearings and that this was a 'ridiculously short time in which to hear and assess complex and sometimes obscure scientific evidence'. </PARA>
<PARA> I could not agree more and we only considered the evidence on those ten days. However, Mr Thompson fails to realise that this time period represents the tip of the iceburg. There were many months of deliberation over some 2,000 pages of transcript and over more than 150 published reports, some of considerable length . The Committee also held lengthy discussions with its advisors Dr Donald MacPhee and Dr Wayne Hall who provided excellent advice on the various subjects canvassed by the Inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> If Mr Thompson cared to reflect on this more realistic illustration of the breadth of the Inquiry, and if he cared to read the report carefully, then perhaps he would not accuse the Committee so quickly of reaching conclusions that do not 'display such good sense'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had nearly finished speaking on the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill on Thursday night. I was speaking on the way in which some people wish to transfer legitimate aspects of Australian sovereignty to supranational bodies. I was saying how opposed to this move I was . If we take that to its extreme, we ought to close this Parliament down and rely on the United Nations to make all our decisions. For example, in the case of the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), who is in the chamber, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation could look after his portfolio and the World Health Organisation could look after health matters. I am quite opposed to the unnecessary transfer of matters which are properly the province of the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I move on to a technical consideration of the Bill, which was covered quite adequately when Senator Baume spoke to it. Quite apart from the philosophic objections I have, there are some very real practical difficulties with this Bill. In fact, it is so poorly drafted as to be quite unworkable, whatever its intent and whatever the intent of those responsible for its introduction. It simply cannot pass into law in its present form, even after it has been messed around with by the Australian Labor Party in the form of some amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with Senator Chipp's Queen's Counsel in a minute. The need for this legislation is quite doubtful. It is covered quite adequately by existing legislation on the books. The Australian Heritage Commission Act provides the powers that this Bill seeks to duplicate. In fact, the Bill would not extend those powers in any way at all. However, the drafting defects of this Bill are pre-eminent. The Bill provides that anyone can bring proceedings before a Federal court. Under our current policy it has to be shown that someone has a special interest which justifies their bringing action against the wrongdoers before a court. As Senator Harradine so accurately observed, there would be nothing to stop someone in California, Moscow or Paris bringing an action against a State government before the Federal court under the terms of this Bill . There is no definition at all of the scope of the unlawful actions which are referred to. There is the absence of any list of specific offences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 6 of the Bill proceeds to trespass unduly on the rights and liberties of citizens. I do not wish to take the time of the Senate to go through these technical defects. Quite simply, they make the Bill unworkable, quite apart from any objections we might have to its intention. I am glad that Senator Chipp raised the point about a Q.C. drafting the Bill. My advice is that the Bill was drafted by the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Conservation Foundation has lobbied members of the Parliament to have the Bill passed. I do not suppose it is treasonable for people outside Parliament to write legislation , but I think the point should be noted by the Senate that the Bill does not originate with the Australian Democrats, although quite clearly it has their full support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the second reading of the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill and to indicate that I propose to vote for the Bill at all its stages and for the amendments which the Australian Labor Party proposes. I believe that a number of my colleagues will be doing likewise. I have read with some interest the debate in Hansard, having missed much of it when it came on last week. I have also read the fulminations by the States righters who have gone off on a particular tram of their own. But I believe that the Bill constitutes a genuine effort in providing one of the options that is available to the Federal Government to intervene to stop the destruction on the Franklin and to ensure that an item of great world heritage value to this community will be protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recognise that some objection has been raised to the Bill. Some matters raised by the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) have some merit. But I think his argument is something like the curate's egg; it is half good and half bad. I propose to deal with one or two of the matters that he raised. I do not want to spend a lot of my time explaining my views about matters which have been covered by other honourable senators. I will refer to two speeches, in particular, for which I have a great deal of support. In the first place Senator Hill came to a different conclusion from mine. He concluded that the Bill ought not be supported because it has some defects. But he outlined in the speech which he made last week a number of various alternatives which are available to the Government to protect this heritage item. I think that the argument is usefully put and I generally agree that those various methods are available although, as I will point out, some of them are not altogether satisfactory. For example, I think that the Minister too pointed out that it is possible to make a declaration under section 69 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act but that declaration has to be made by a Minister and it may be disallowed by this chamber. It may well be that if action is taken-as I expect it will be taken by the Federal Government-to stop this destruction it will be desirable to have, from this Parliament, some expression of its views and not to rely merely on the action taken by a Minister in making a declaration. So I think some of the available alternatives do not adequately cover the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second speech on which I also rely was, I thought, a very succinct account by Senator Evans of the constitutional position and the foreign affairs power. It was carefully considered and did not go overboard by saying that the legislation is without doubts. It seemed to provide an adequate constitutional basis, apart from others, for this Bill. I adopt in general what Senator Evans has said and I do not intend to repeat the arguments which he put forward. </PARA>

I do not think that is so. Rather than refer to all the comments which have been made I will refer to a letter which, I think, many honourable senators received today from the Australian Conservation Foundation. Mr Murray Wilcox, Queen's Counsel, its President, is a man of great knowledge of constitution areas. I think that he had quite a deal to do with the drafting of this Bill. He has substantially replied to the major arguments which the Minister has made in criticism of the Bill.

<PARA>Australian Conservation Foundation</PARA>
<PARA>The Senator the Hon. Peter Baume,Minister for Education,Parliament House, Canberra, A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Baume,</PARA>
<PARA>Re: World Heritage Properties Protection Bill</PARA>
<PARA> I followed with interest the debate in the Senate last Thursday relating to the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill. You are no doubt aware that the Australian Conservation Foundation has, for some time, been pressing the Government to take action to protect the south west Tasmanian wilderness from the damage which is being, and will increasingly be, sustained from the Gordon below Franklin Hydro-Electric Scheme. Over a considerable period the Government denied its constitutional authority to take such action but I note the concession in your own speech last Thursday that the Commonwealth does have the necessary legal power. This conclusion, of course, is consistent with the view expressed by the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania in its report tabled last Tuesday (Chapter 10). </PARA>
<PARA> The views expressed in your speech last Thursday were, presumably, the current views of the Government in relation to the issue. With respect, that assumption makes particularly disappointing the negative tone of your contribution to the debate. I understand that the Senate is to resume the debate next Thursday and therefore I write to offer some comments on some of the points you made in justification of the Government's current approach. In view of the shortness of time I have taken the liberty immediately of releasing this letter, so that your colleagues in the Senate may give it their consideration. I deal with matters seriatim by reference to the Senate Daily Hansard of Thursday 25 November, 1982:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. P. 2864: ''The inference of this Bill is that there is neither adequate legislation at Commonwealth or State level nor willingness on the part of governments to fulfil the obligations arising under the Convention''. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to South West Tasmania, such an inference would be well founded. There is, at this moment, no Commonwealth legislation to protect, or to enable the courts to protect, south west Tasmania from the activities of the Hydro Electric Commission. Were there such legislation, you may be assured, legal action would have been taken to obtain the necessary orders to restrain construction activities. In your speech you went on to speak of the ''available legislation'' including the Australian Heritage Commission Act establishing the Register of the National Estate. That Act does, of course, establish the Register of the National Estate. However, the only provision inhibiting adverse activities is s. 30. That section only constrains the actions of Commonwealth instrumentalities. It has no application to a case such as this where the damage is being done by a State instrumentality. Your references to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and the legislative framework for the protection of Kakadu National Park are of limited application even in relation to those areas. They are, of course, not relevant to south west Tasmania. Your comment ''the States have their legislation covering national parks and the protection of the natural and cultural heritage'' is true but irrelevant to the construction sites. You will recall that the Tasmanian Parliament enacted legislation which authorised the hydro electric scheme to proceed and, in so doing, revoked the Wild Rivers National Park declared by the previous Tasmanian government. So much for existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as ''willingness on the part of governments'' is concerned the fact is that the Commonwealth, despite intensive urging by many people, has so far taken no action to inhibit destructive activities being actively promoted by the State government. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. P.2865 ''The Bill does not provide any power in relation to the Convention greater than could be available through existing Commonwealth legislation e.g. s . 69 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act.''</PARA>
<PARA> I agree. The difficulty is that the Government has not yet seen fit to make the regulations envisaged by s. 69. Only the Executive Government can take that action; in contrast to the current Bill which is something able to be initiated by the Parliament. If the Government were to make appropriate regulations under s. 69, the problem would be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. P. 2865 ''The mere existence of legal power is not itself a good reason for Commonwealth action on any issue unless that action is necessary.''</PARA>
<PARA> I agree with that proposition. However, can anyone doubt that such action is necessary in the present circumstances? The Premier of Tasmania has made it clear that he will not voluntarily abandon the hydro electric scheme. One can agree with the proposition that the acceptance of a protection responsibility by the States ''is implicit in their recommendation to the Commonwealth of properties for nomination under the Convention'' but note with dismay the total failure of the Tasmanian government to accept that responsibility in this particular case. In such a circumstance is the Commonwealth government, a signatory to the Convention and the nominator of the property to the World Heritage List, to stand by and see the area destroyed?</PARA>
<PARA> 4. P. 2865: ''The Bill provides that any person at all may bring proceedings to the Federal Court of Australia for an order declaring that an action is a breach of this Bill and seek an order to remedy or restrain a breach of the legislation ''. </PARA>
<PARA> You go on to speak of the possibility of frivolous or vexatious applications to the Court and the possibility of pressure for similar provisions to be inserted in other Commonwealth, State or Territory legislation. May I point out that the precedent already exists in both Commonwealth and State legislation. It has always been possible, subject to some specific exceptions, for any person to launch a criminal prosecution. This Bill envisages only a civil action for a declaration or injunction. Section 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 enables any person to take civil proceedings for an injunction to restrain a person from breaching that Act. Section 153 of the Heritage Act 1977 (NSW) and s.123 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) each permit 'any person' to bring civil proceedings for an injunction. To date, there has not been a single case, arising under any of these three Acts, in which it has even been suggested that the proceedings were frivolous or vexatious. It is customary, in discussion about an 'open door' standing rule, to conjure up visions of interfering foreigners and the debate last Thursday was no exception. I note that Senator Harradine envisaged somebody from California, Moscow or Timbuktu whilst Senator Martyr thought that the applicant might be an Eskimo. I can give an assurance that if appropriate legislation is passed there will be an applicant for an injunction, being one of the major conservation bodies in Australia or being one of the business organizations who are currently earning income for the Tasmanian community by conducting tours in the wilderness area. We will not wait for a Moscovian or an Eskimo to come along. </PARA>
<PARA> I might, perhaps, mention that the reference of the matter of standing to the Law Reform Commission was given by Mr Ellicott QC (not Senator Durack) as long ago as 1 February 1977. As you say, it will be some months yet before the report is even received by the Government. Is it suggested that there should be no effective legislation enabling people to take proceedings for an injunction in the meantime?</PARA>
<PARA> 5. P.2865: The words 'adversely to affect' are not defined in the Bill and are capable of a very broad interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with this comment but I point out that it is not unusual for legislation to be passed in broad terms leaving to a court the application in particular circumstances. For example, s.112 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act, 1979 (NSW) requires certain action to be taken in relation to projects which are 'likely to significantly affect' the environment. The courts have found no difficulty in working out the application of those words in particular cases. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, the suggested amendment by the Australian Labor Party would specifically sanction any action which is in accordance with a Plan of Management indorsed under Commonwealth law. Such amendment would have the effect of encouraging the preparation of a Plan of Management, acknowledged as being satisfactory by the Commonwealth pursuant to its undertaking to protect the area . Once this is done there can be no question of any breach of the section. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. P.2866 'The amendment refers only to Commonwealth legislation as making certain things lawful.''</PARA>
<PARA> This is, of course, correct for the fairly obvious reason that it is the Commonwealth which has undertaken to protect the area pursuant to the international Convention. No doubt State governments would prepare plans of management which would be considered by the Australian National Parks Service and, upon approval, be indorsed under Commonwealth law. In the meantime, it is, with respect, somewhat extreme to speak about a maintenance access track within the Cradle Mountain/Lake St Clair National Park as being unlawful. How could it be argued that such a track adversely affected the protection of the area?</PARA>
<PARA> 7. P.2866: The enactment of the Bill would make it extremely unlikely that any State or Territory would ever make a further recommendation or properties for nomination to the World Heritage List. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect, I would agree that this is a fair point. However, there are two comments which should be made. First, there is not much point in having any property nominated for the World Heritage List if it is then to be damaged in the manner proposed for south west Tasmania. It would be more honest not to put it on the list in the first place. Secondly, the practice under which the Commonwealth obtains the agreement of the relevant State or Territory before making a nomination is exactly that: a practice. There is no legal requirement of agreement. If the Commonwealth took the view that a particular property ought to be nominated to the World Heritage List then it is able to do so notwithstanding any failure by the relevant State or Territory to agree. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite possible that the current Bill can be improved. I do not think its proponents have ever suggested otherwise. However, it is quite unfair to describe the Bill as 'a piece of poor legislation full of errors and producing ( unintended) effects'. The enactment of this Bill would enable orders to be made by the Court to restrain any activity which would adversely affect a property identified by the Commonwealth as being suitable for World Heritage Listing. That effect is no more and no less than the Commonwealth government has undertaken to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> I do hope that members of the Government will be prepared to review their position on the Bill and give it their active support. May I add that A.C.F. has always taken the view that there will be a consequential need for the Commonwealth to provide special assistance to Tasmania in relation to employment opportunities, and, perhaps, energy alternatives. Some suggestions were included in our submission to the Select Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>MURRAY WILCOX Q.C. President Australian Conservation Foundation</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two or three points were made in the Minister's argument that I think ought to be specifically referred to. The Minister suggested that legislation already exists in Australia which has the capacity to protect places which are nominated for the World Heritage List. I doubt whether the legislation is adequate as it stands at present. I think that some legislation by the Government would be desirable. I believe that this Bill should go forward from the Senate to the House of Representatives. It and the Government can consider it. If they prefer another form of legislation they can put it forward but they should have the option available to them. I think this is a worthy option deserving support. In addition, the Minister raised some curious arguments on the question of access to courts and the rights of any person under this Bill. A lot of nonsense was talked the other day about Eskimos and non-Australians and various people who are likely to come here and take action. The fact is that, as Murray Wilcox points out in his letter, there is already a substantial number of provisions in our legislation which enable any person to take action. There are great defects in this country's legislation which mean that an organisation such as the Australian Conservation Foundation is denied by the High Court the right to enforce heritage legislation and things which seem obviously right within its compass. There have been difficulties for many years over access to the courts by individuals. I am quite sure that when the report on the question of access comes down from the Law Reform Commission-this is very clear from the discussion papers that the Commission has already put out-it will contain a very sweeping recommendation for a change in access so that people will have a much wider opportunity of going to court and upholding legislation than is the case at present.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, forget about people overseas. If the honourable senator wants to write into the legislation that those people must be citizens and so forth, that is all right. There is a point there. The important thing is that Australian citizens ought to have a right to do this. I give the honourable senator a point in that the legislation could be tightened up. I see no reason why Eskimos should not be excluded. I regard that point of such fundamental crashing unimportance that I can certainly concede it on the way. So far as ordinary citizens are concerned I have always said that I want to see a change in the law. I am waiting on the final report of the Law Reform Commission. If that is not quickly implemented I will certainly be prepared to introduce a private member's Bill. I have referred to one of the defects in the law as it stands in Australia. This Bill does not suffer from that defect. The evidence from overseas where standing has been widened and where people have been given the right of access to courts shows that it is utter nonsense to think that the courts will be flooded by people who rush into them prepared to take thousands of dollars out of their pockets and spend them on these things. Indeed, there has been no such flood where there has been a widening of access. I say that the Minister's argument on that ground was altogether inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must also criticise another thing that the Minister said. He relied, and others relied even more crudely, upon the fact that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, of which I am Chairman, made a criticism of this Bill. We stated that there was very little identification of the scope of the unlawful actions. We drew attention to the fact-we relied upon our terms of reference-that the legislation might unduly trespass on personal rights and liberties. But the Minister knows well, and other honourable senators ought to know well, that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee does not form fixed views when it looks at these matters. It floats ideas; it highlights points; it raises questions that ought to be considered. I think it was very poor of the Minister to try to make use of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee not by way of any amendment but by suggesting that because we float an item it means we have concluded that it makes a sweeping interference with human liberties. We have not so concluded and to believe what the Minister said was to misunderstand the purposes of the Committee of which I am Chairman. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate can repair things if it wants to, if it sees that there is a defect, as can the other House. There are plenty of opportunities once the matter has been raised and drawn to our attention. I think the major defects have been covered by the Australian Labor Party in its amendments. I see some defect in that if a State has a plan of management for parks and so forth there is no way at the moment that that could be protected from action. I think this Bill could be amended, where there is a State plan of action and the Commonwealth under its responsibility approves of that plan of action, whether it is to cover fire in a national park or various other matters, to cover such plans that are approved by the Commonwealth. But one could not write into such a Bill that the responsibility to make the decision be left to the State. Any plan of action therefore would not be challengeable by law. It is a relatively minor point; it could easily be picked up in the House of Representatives if it is thought desirable and if the Commonwealth decides that this is the cause of action to take. The nonsense in regard to States rights which was brought forward here at tedious length the other day was beyond comprehension. How people can think that an area of world importance for which the Commonwealth and the State have accepted responsibility and are putting on the World Heritage List, can be talked about as though it is within the decision-making province of some State Premier is beyond my understanding.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to Standing Order 196A I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill 1982 be referred to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report, and that the Committee particularly report on-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) inadequacies and ambiguities identified in the Seventeenth Report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the desirability or otherwise of a limitation being placed on the standing and class of persons who may bring proceedings;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the nature of the offence and likely penalty arising from a breach of the order of the Court; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) whether it would be appropriate for the Commonwealth to invoke the foreign affairs power of section 51 (xxix) of the Constitution to legislate in the manner proposed by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I submit that this matter is one of the most important to come before the Federal Parliament and it deserves the closest scrutiny. I mentioned in the second reading debate that I considered that this Bill is certainly a heritage Bill as it proposes to trample on the heritage of our civil rights and liberties . The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its seventeenth report identified a number of inadequacies and ambiguities in this legislation. To my mind, and I believe to the minds of all honourable senators, a fair conclusion can be reached that the Bill, even if amended by the amendments proposed by the Opposition, will not satisfy all of the inadequacies and ambiguities identified in the seventeenth report of the Committee. I, like Senator Missen, have had the opportunity of examining the debate which occurred last Thursday. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that many of those who supported the Bill did so with stated reservations. I draw the attention of the Senate to the comments made by Senator Tate in his second reading speech on page 2861 of Hansard. Senator Tate, who supported the Bill, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe it ought to be said initially that the Bill probably has a very tenuous constitutional base such as would enable it to succeed a challenge in the High Court of Australia. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Evans" NAMEID="VD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Evans</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. He did not go uncontradicted. Senator Evans at least, stated-and I quote from page 2876-that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the external affairs power, quite apart from the other possible heads of power, . . . probably is good enough to support this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I further believe that it is strongly arguable in the context of South West Tasmania that the mere nomination of South West Tasmania in this international treaty forum is enough to evidence the status of that particular area as being a proper subject for Commonwealth legislation under the external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans said that. May I contrast that statement about the nomination with another statement of Senator Tate's? They cannot even make up their own minds. In contradiction Senator Tate had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> At the very most, this Bill, if it is relying on the external affairs power, would require a definite action by a multilateral body to build up evidence such as the High Court would require. So it is my belief that at the very least, it is only when listing occurs that any Commonwealth external affairs power might be argued to arise. </PARA>
<PARA>As we all know, the Bill does not talk about the nomination; it talks about the submission. So there we have two supporters--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Evans" NAMEID="VD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And two members of the Committee would want it to be referred. It would be trial by ordeal.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, exactly. That is why I want honourable senators to make up their minds. We have two supporters of the Bill, both of whom differ on very fundamental issues relating to this legislation. Senator Button did at least indicate his views on the matter very briefly. On page 2869 of Hansard Senator Button is reported to have said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very disappointed with Senator Peter Baume's contribution to the debate. What he was really saying was: 'Look, there are a number of technical objections to this Bill', as if there are not technical objections to all Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Peter Baume said:</PARA>
<PARA> They are quite substantial, though. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button then said:</PARA>
<PARA> I follow that. If the will and concern were there to do something about the issues raised by the Australian Democrats in the Bill the Government-as any responsible group of senators in this House is entitled to do-would have moved amendments to improve the legislation further. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not the Government's legislation and it is not my legislation. That raises the very important question as to whether the external affairs head of power is an appropriate power to rely on for legislation of this character. It is quite clear from what the Australian Democrats have said that they place overwhelming reliance on the external affairs power. Just what is this power? Section 51 of the Constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:-</PARA>
<PARA> (xxix.) External affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst relying on the external affairs power, the Australian Democrats appear to have adopted an exaggerated interpretation of the Koowarta decision. In that I agree with what Senator Tate said in his speech at the second reading stage, so much so that the Democrats appear ready to sell out the States. The Koowarta case was given a gallop around the course last week, but a good summary of what was decided in that case is contained in the Australian Law Journal of August 1982 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where matters have, by virtue of general multilateral conventions or treaties, to which Australia is a party, or by reason of customary international law, become a proper and genuine subject for co-operative international action, in which such international action the Commonwealth of Australia has a clearly discernible interest, legislation by the Commonwealth Parliament legitimately dealing with such matters or giving precise effect to the Commonwealth's obligations under the relevant multilateral conventions or treaties, or under the relevant rules of customary international law, will be held valid as being supported by the external affairs power notwithstanding that the legislation concerned may impinge otherwise upon the constitutional powers of the Australian States, and accordingly State governments and the citizens of the States will be bound to comply with the provisions of such Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Koowarta case was all about. Honourable senators should note the words: 'notwithstanding that the legislation concerned may impinge otherwise upon the constitutional powers of the Australian States'. If there is a more important matter to come before this States House than this, I do not know what it is. To attempt to steamroll this Bill through without proper consideration is a reflection on this House as a States House of Parliament. Both Senator Tate and Senator Evans have been sceptical of this apparent reliance on the Koowarta decision. At page 2862 of Senate Hansard, Senator Tate is recorded as stating:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the possibility of this legislation being based on the external affairs power is based on a very biased reading of the Koowarta decision . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They are not my words; they are the words of Senator Tate, who has had a good deal of experience in the teaching field. Furthermore, Senator Tate also raised an important point about when any such power arises. I adverted to that point previously. He indicated that, in his view, no power arises simply by nominating the property to the World Heritage Committee for listing; power arises, only by its being listed. As has been indicated, this Bill states quite clearly that it is operative on the submission of the property to the World Heritage Committee. In fact what Senator Tate is saying to the Australian Democrats and their supporters is: 'It's all right, pass the Bill; but you will get nowhere. You will get nowhere because the obligation, the power, the trigger is not provided by the simple nomination of the property'. At page 2875 of Senate Hansard, Senator Evans is recorded as stating:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is clear that there is a great deal of wishful thinking evident in a lot of circles around this country since the Koowarta case about the scope of the external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans then suggested:</PARA>
<PARA> What seems to be the test after the Koowarta case is that the subject matter in question be such as to have the capacity to affect Australia's international reputation or Australia's international relations. </PARA>
<PARA>In so doing he was, of course, adverting to the second point made in the Australian Law Journal in a summary of the Koowarta case. In reference to the High Court's decision, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Any subject matter may constitute an external affair, provided that the manner in which it is treated involves in some way a relationship with other countries or with persons or things outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact remains that Senator Evans stated clearly that there is abroad within Australia a great deal of wishful thinking on the results of the Koowarta case. I support the view that if the Koowarta decision will hold for this piece of legislation-let us not make any bones about it, the Australian Democrats have nailed their flag to that mast-a whole new Pandora's box will be opened up. If the Democrats get away with Senate endorsement of this open-ended piece of legislation, what will we see next? The Australian Law Journal summary of the essence of the Koowarta case referred to general multilateral conventions or treaties. It may surprise honourable senators to know that, in the course of our history, Australia has been a signatory to or has been covered by no fewer than 500 multilateral treaties. I have a complete listing of these treaties. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that the Australian Democrats are clearer on their constitutional base than they are on their Standing Orders. This so-called World Heritage Properties Protection Bill seizes on just one of those international conventions which Australia happened to ratify on 22 August 1974. It uses it as a steamroller not just in relation to the rights of Tasmania in respect of South West Tasmania-the area is not really South West Tasmania; it goes up to about 40 kilometres from Devonport-but also with an open-ended application to other areas which might be nominated to the World Heritage Committee in Paris. It is not specifically a Bill in relation to South West Tasmania. It has a broad, open- ended application which is something to which honourable senators from all States should have regard. As I mentioned during the second reading debate, this Bill does not necessarily have to apply only to an area; it can apply to a building, a group of buildings or paintings. Provided they are nominated the trigger is supplied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania should have examined this aspect in more detail. According to page 211 of its report it appears to have accepted the argument of Mr Murray Wilcox, Q.C., who presented evidence as President of the Australian Conservation Foundation. Senator Missen mentioned that Mr Wilcox had a great deal to do with the preparation and drafting of this legislation. I have no wish to disparage his legal standing-indeed, I have no ability to do so. But we are warranted in drawing attention to his prominent association with an interested and committed organisation, namely, the Australian Conservation Foundation. The Chairman of the Senate Select Committee, Senator Archer, on page 2852 of the Committee's transcript of evidence, pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> They had not one independent legal witness nor canvassed or discussed any of the range of alternative views on constitutional or contentious matters. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator made that interjection then too. He said: 'What is an independent legal witness? Is there such a body in this world? ' My answer to the honourable senator is simply this: Any Q.C. or lawyer who is not also president of the Australian Conservation Foundation would be an independent legal witness on this occasion. Unlike Senator Tate Mr Wilcox offers what appears to be a very open-ended interpretation of the obligations now upon the Commonwealth. If honourable senators turn to his opinion, which appears at page 3735 of the Committee transcript, they will find something which, as far as I can determine, was not alluded to in the Committee's report, nor in Senator Mason's second reading speech. Mr Wilcox said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These obligations--</PARA>
<PARA>That is those under the Convention-</PARA>
<PARA>extend to the protection of areas of the natural heritage. It is likely that this power extends to areas of identified natural heritage not upon the World Heritage List. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators should note the words of Mr Wilcox, namely 'areas of identified natural heritage not upon the World Heritage List.' Does this mean that the side argument, so-called, about nominating and listing is totally irrelevant, that in fact something only has to appear on a list of the National Estate or something similar for the Commonwealth to have carte blanche in overriding the rights of the States? Is that what Mr Wilcox is saying? If it is we may as well pack up as a Senate, as a States House. The States may as well pack up and save the money of the electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am specifically proposing to do, Senator, in the very short time that is available is to come to the ambiguities which were identified in the seventeenth report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which was presented to the Parliament on 11 November 1982, and which, in some respects, have not been taken up by the amendments proposed by the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had a document prepared-I believe it has been distributed-which indicates one of the matters which are of concern to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Before I turn to these matters I will take up the point made by Senator Missen. If the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is not to scrutinise Bills--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Missen" NAMEID="YL7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator Missen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what it does. That is its whole job.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Good. If it is not to do that, what is it to do? It reports to us. What did the Scrutiny of Bills Committee say? It referred to clause 6, Protection of properties, and stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The clause provides very little identification of the scope of unlawful actions with which the Bill would deal. The Committee is concerned that in the absence of any list of specific offences, persons may not be able to arrange with any certainty those of their affairs that relate to the use of nominated or listed properties. </PARA>
<PARA>The ALP partially identified this in its amendment. It excludes as unlawful any act:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . which is expressly or impliedly authorised by any Commonwealth zoning plan or plan of management. </PARA>
<PARA>We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke. For example, the amendment talks about the South West plan. The plan is not here. We do not know what plan there is. We do not know who may enter the area or what vehicles may enter the area. We do not know whether it will deal with the taking or damaging of flora or fauna, the carrying of firearms, fishing implements and substances likely to cause pollution, construction of roads, building, mining and all the rest of it. We do not know that. We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke. It is all there before honourable senators in the document I have distributed, but significantly the ALP amendment and therefore the Bill do nothing to assuage the ambiguities noted by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in respect of clause 7 of the Bill. In respect of that clause, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee says:</PARA>
<PARA> Court action might be taken against a person who had no intention of damaging a property, whose actions however might be regarded as 'likely adversely to affect the protection, conservation, preservation or rehabilitation of a property'. If the doing of an act can include the failure to do an act, the declining by an owner to take, for example, steps to preserve or restore a property, area or building may fall within the proscribed conduct. In the absence of any clear guidelines in the Bill as to the precise scope of the proscribed actions referred to in clause 6, the Committee draws this clause to the attention of the Senate under principle (1) (a) (i) in that it might be regarded as trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it will. The facts of the matter are that if we let this legislation go through, even with the ALP amendment, that has not corrected the position. The ambiguities remain. I have listed them. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspects that I am asking the Committee to consider relate to the desirability or otherwise of limitations being placed on the standing and class of persons who may bring proceedings. Senator Missen and I have a meeting of minds here. Senator Missen says that we could exclude everybody from outside Australia. That is something at least that we have to start with. Surely the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs could deal with that. I want to have the Senate Standing Committee examine also the nature of the offence and the likely penalty arising from a breach of the order of the court. Clause 6 states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . or proposing to take. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is not thought control, I do not know what is. The Bill talks about proposing to take an action; that smacks of thought control. Finally, in the couple of minutes that I have left, let me point out and reinforce what I said in my speech in the second reading debate, that no penalty is spelt out. The offence becomes a breach of an order. I refer to page 3781 of the transcript of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania hearing where Mr Wilcox said, in answer to Senator Coates's question about offences:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think there is any need, or case, for criminal sanctions. Civil sanctions, by way of what lawyers call an injunction, that is, an order to restrain, are a very effective weapon . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They are very effective indeed. One can be gaoled until one makes up one's mind to accept the decision of the court. </PARA>
<PARA> All I am saying to honourable senators now is that it is recognised all round that this Bill is deficient, that an attempt is being made to steamroll it through the Senate. It opens up a Pandora's box. It is my concern-I believe it should be the concern of every senator in this States' House-that the constitutional foundation for such proposals ought to receive the most rigorous consideration. I am suggesting, therefore, that the Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for that purpose. </PARA>

Long before Senator Evans came into this chamber we heard from the Opposition that this place ought to be abolished. It was part of the Australian Labor Party's platform. If I remember correctly it was Senator Evans who said: 'We ought to cut that out of our platform because it is not too popular with the electors. So let us just keep it in the background. Let us not have it as part of our platform, or not the written part anyway. Let us just keep that in the background. We have found through experience that this is not too popular with the people electing us'. So Senator Evans is certainly not for a States' House. Senator Tate seems to be the person on that side of the chamber who is closest to being a States' member, but he does not have the gumption to cross the floor. He does not have the courage of his convictions and he only talks about it.</PARA></TALK.START>

They caucus and they forget that this place is a States' House. They have absolutely no intention of including States rights in any action in the Senate and they have started off making that completely clear. I am absolutely appalled and horrified that this debate should go on in this place and that it should centralise around the Commonwealth interfering in a State's right to do what it wants with its own property.

All right, I will relate it and I will relate it right now by saying that I second Senator Harradine's motion. Perhaps that will bring me in line, Senator Evans, with the motion before the Chair. If I were Senator Chipp perhaps I would say that this whole debate has been obscene because that would strike some chord with the Australian Democrats. Senator Evans has said that a lot of rubbish has been said about a States' House in this debate. May I refresh the Senate on the representation we have in this Parliament. In the House of Representatives, 76 members are divided between New South Wales and Victoria, the two States with the largest numbers. South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland have 46 members between them. So at any time, without this place being a States' House, New South Wales and Victoria could easily say: 'Right, we want a quarter of Tasmania and we will do with it as we like. We will nominate it'. We have Victorians standing in this place saying: 'We have as much interest in the South West. It is as much ours as Tasmania's'. We have Victorian senators here who are trying to interfere in a quarter of our State. How ridiculous can they be! I ask honourable senators to look at those numbers for members in the House of Representatives and they will see why we on this side so jealously guard our States' rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have all listened in silence to the Democrats. I did not interject while they were speaking. But they do not like it much and so they are taking up my time. As I was saying the Labor Party had a few qualms of conscience and it decided to amend things. Senator Chipp said: 'Yes, you have amended it and it is ever so much better'. The Labor Party did not amend the people's rights angle of the legislation. That is not of much significance to them even though all the lawyers referred to it! The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . that it might be regarded as trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>Some honourable senators say that this may be trespassing on the personal rights and liberties of people of Australia. But the Chairman of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee said: 'That is really not important. I am going to vote for it anyway. The legislation may not be perfect but it will do because we cannot be seen to vote against it'. Senator Tate and Senator Evans said: 'It is not perfect but we will amend it'. But do they amend the rights of the Australian citizens? No, they do not bother to do that. Has Senator Missen put up an amendment to fix it? No, he has not done that; he cannot be seen to vote against it. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have the situation in which the Labor Party decides to amend the legislation by putting in a management clause. We will manage it. That management clause has really improved the rights of the Australian people. The second amendment is that the Commonwealth be given powers to enforce the Bill. That is really fixing up the rights of Australian citizens, is it not? We will add those two amendments and say: 'Okay, it was not perfect but we will add some amendments'. Senator Tate, in his speech, was hypocritical enough to start off by saying: 'It is not perfect; it is not too good; it might infringe on our Constitution and it might not even get through the High Court of Australia but we will move substantive amendments'. These are not substantive amendments. They are trivial amendments that have nothing to do with the rights of Australian citizens. I am absolutely disgusted with this chamber attempting to discuss this matter. The legislation is so poorly drafted that I cannot imagine which one of the Democrats attempted to draft it. Surely they could have got some competent help if they wanted to put through something like this. As I have just said after all those beautiful Labor Party amendments the legislation is still trampling on all Australians' rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks will take no more than a minute or so. I do not intend to join this filibuster. I have always understood that when an honourable senator intended making a proposal to refer a matter or a Bill to a standing committee the practice was to consult the chairman, and perhaps also the members of that committee to ascertain the committee's program and availability and whether the proposed terms of reference appeared to be such that the committee could handle the matter in the way suggested. No approach along those lines has been made to me or my committee which has, of course, a full program. I see the proposal as merely a method of achieving delay. The Committee would not be able to proceed with it immediately. The resulting situation would be highly undesirable. The Senate is capable of handling the matter entirely by itself. The way in which it has been handled by Senator Harradine provides an indication of the lack of genuineness behind the move. I certainly oppose referral of the matter to my committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats oppose the proposed reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. We have heard from Senator Harradine a farrago of nonsense and half truths, all of which he will find have been answered in the second reading debate. No real fresh evidence has been brought forward which would indicate that the Bill would be improved or that there is any reason whatsoever for it to be referred to a committee. Indeed, the Bill has passed the second reading stage by a majority of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to make a point that I think needs to be made at this stage. We are witnessing here-I make this point to anybody who may be listening who is interested in the preservation of the south west wilderness area-a dishonest and disgraceful attempt for the second week running to prevent this Bill passing through the Senate and to allow the destruction of that area to continue. Be it on the heads of those people who are organising that. This Bill, normally a simple private member's Bill, would have passed the Senate last week when two and a half hours were given to this debate. It was filibustered through shamelessly by honourable senators in this place who are dedicated to the destruction of the natural assets of this country. One might well ask whose pockets they are in. I think we all know whose pockets they are in. They are in the pockets of people who want to exploit, destroy and generally to use and abuse the natural assets of this country. </PARA>

We are not, after all, seeking with this Bill to stop that damming. We are seeking to have the Bill pass through one House of the Parliament. It will go to another House and be debated and discussed there. I ask honourable senators: Why do they use these cowardly tactics? Senator Walters asks, 'Do we know what the Senate is about?' She says that we are newies here, that we do not know what the Senate is about. Is she, as a Government Senator, teaching us the lesson that the way to obstruct a Bill is not to vote against it honestly and use the processes of democracy, but to filibuster and destroy it when we know the majority has voted for it to pass? If that is the kind of lesson that Senator Walters wants us to learn from the Government, I suggest she ought to think twice before she tries to advise us on the way this place ought to be run.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would have thought that Senator Missen, who has left me on my own, would jump at the chance to protect us all from a foolish Bill. It became quite clear in the debate last week that the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill was deficient. The Minister for Education, Senator Peter Baume, was the one who pointed out all of the deficiencies in this Bill. Today Senator Harradine has given us accurately chapter and verse of where the Bill is deficient. I would have thought that Senator Missen, as the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs-what a mouthful that is-would jump at the opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Never mind about being asked. I thought that he would have jumped at the opportunity of putting us all right. I find it absolutely incredible that today Senator Missen stood up and, in a mealy-mouthed refusal to consider the Bill, said that he had not been asked. Does he have to be asked? The Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs has been set up to do a particular job. Senator Missen is indicating that he refuses to accept that responsibility. If the Committee is asked to do a job by the Senate surely it will do it, whether it has the time or not. I might say that since the Australian Democrats have had a strong view and a strong capacity to change the will of this chamber they have had a penchant for sending Bills to all sorts of committees for examination. They have done this time and time again. Special committees have had to be created for some of the things the Democrats have wanted to do. All of a sudden when there is a Bill which is obviously full of deficiencies they do not want it to go before a committee whose job it would be to point out the deficiencies and rectify those deficiencies. I find this very inconsistent. It is inconsistent of Senator Missen to refuse to accept the job and inconsistent of the Democrats not to try to improve the Bill which they want so much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a couple of other matters which I think are particularly germane. In supporting Senator Harradine I have to say that it is wonderful to see this chamber performing in the way in which it ought to perform. This is what the Senate is supposed to be about. There is no doubt that within the last week when honourable senators in this chamber had very strong views to put in protection of what they consider are the interests of their State they were doing their job . It is too bad that we have had to disagree but it is the first time in many years that this Senate has really devoted itself to the interests of the States. All the Senate is trying to do-Senator Harradine is to be commended for this, and Senator Walters for supporting him-is protect this Commonwealth; that is, the relationship between this Commonwealth and its sovereign States. What could be a more appropriate duty for the Senate than to do that?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ7">Senator MARTYR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all very well for people such as Senator Mason to come here from New South Wales and Senator Missen from Victoria-he has just come back into the chamber; I welcome him-and to have very strong views about what ought to happen in somebody else's State. Those honourable senators who, in my view, represent a brotherhood of misery-they both have Labor governments; they could not attend to their own affairs that well-want to interfere in the affairs of a State which is running itself quite well. There is a very clear distinction between what the Commonwealth ought to be doing and what Senator Mason wants the Commonwealth to do. In my view, that clear distinction has to be preserved. I know that all this has been said before, but this is a States House and it is our fundamental responsibility to see that the rights of the States are protected. The Bill has been clearly shown to be defective in several major ways . Senator Harradine has shown us in what particular ways it is defective. As I said before, I would have thought Senator Missen would have jumped at the chance to oppose this Bill. Senator Missen is supposedly devoted to civil liberties and the affairs of individuals and citizens. He seeks always to protect those citizens but I note that his contribution in the last couple of days amount to this: Anybody who disagrees with Senator Missen is a devotee of Tammany Hall, is talking nonsense, is wasting time or is filibustering and is not genuine. I say through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Missen that he represents a libertarian tyranny which is absolutely despicable and which really has no place at all in this open-minded Senate.

I insist in making the point that anybody who disagrees with Senator Missen is categorised in the terms I have already outlined. I find this quite deplorable. I am prepared for the free come and go of the Senate; whatever people say to each other is completely reasonable. But I believe that the use of terms like these demeans the whole Senate.

I do not mind going on doing that; I do not mind taking this abuse. If this is what I have to do as my contribution to the protection of the States against the tryannical interference of people like Senator Missen then I consider that my duty and I consider that I should have no conscience at all in taking the salary which is due to me, because there is much to put up with. I hope that the people listening to this debate who understand the great issues at stake will know that we are protecting those things most important to them. Senator Harradine has made a great contribution towards protecting his State from outside tryannical interference from people who do not have the best interests of Tasmania at heart. Who in this chamber would know best about what is good for Tasmania? The Tasmanians themselves. There is no doubt at all about this. The whole purpose of Senator Harradine's amendment, which I strongly support, is to protect the Tasmanians themselves-to protect them properly-from the outrage that would be perpetrated on them by this stupid, incomprehensible Bill put up by Senator Mason.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not propose to use pejoratives and I do not propose to insult anyone but I do wish to take the opportunity not only to speak in specific terms in relation to Senator Harradine's motion but also to explain a little further why I voted as I did at the second reading stage and how that affects my attitude towards Senator Harradine's motion. I believe that the Senate has been becoming particularly emotional in debate without having regard to the facts and the history of this matter. I believe it is important to outline the history to try to clarify for a lot of people some of the confusion which clearly exists. Let me go back. There was a great debate in relation to the flooding or otherwise of Lake Pedder in Tasmania which led to certain resolutions and attitudes being adopted at State and Federal parliamentary level . Following that, the Liberal Party produced a joint Federal and State policy statement in relation to this issue. I was the responsible shadow Minister who announced that policy. That policy has never been withdrawn. In fact, it has been reaffirmed. I would like, for the information of some of my colleagues and others, to refer to some parts of that statement-a firm policy commitment issued in 1975. That policy statement referred to the fact that there had been discussions between Federal Liberals and State Liberals in relation to the question of the South West National Park and that there was agreement. It stated :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . it is important that early action be taken to preserve this area. </PARA>
<PARA>The area referred to was a significantly enlarged South West National Park which was to be developed and maintained. The statement went on to point out that there was a need for co-ordination in relation to the park. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Commonwealth Government provide a special grant to assist the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service to develop a management plan for the existing South West National Park as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>I pause to say that, in pursuance of that policy commitment, that was done. The Commonwealth Government-this Liberal and National parties coalition Government, under the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-provided the funds pursuant to that policy commitment which was made in 1975 and which has been reaffirmed on a number of occasions since then. The policy statement went on to state that there was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a firm commitment by the Liberal and Country Parties to provide Commonwealth financial assistance to support enlargement of the boundaries. The enlargement of the boundaries will require sacrifice on the part of the Tasmanian State Government and the Tasmanian people in the national interest. In effect the Australian people will be asking them to forgo revenue that might otherwise flow from unchecked development of the area in order to preserve for the nation an area considered of immense national significance. </PARA>
<PARA>A policy commitment was made to provide direct aid in preparing a management plan and a measure of compensation for development opportunities forgone in respect of electricity generation, mining and forests. I have just quoted from parts of that policy statement. But that policy statement, made in 1975, has never been revoked. In fact it was made with the full support of the State Liberal Party at that time-the parliamentary party. I find myself in an invidious position where I am supporting declared Liberal Party policy, which was a joint policy at the time of the Commonwealth and the State Liberal parties , which has never changed. But a unilateral about turn, without discussion, took place on the part of the State party which wants to take different action. I just make the point because it is part of the explanation of the difficult position and the sadness of the position in which I find myself. I find it particularly so when I hear the argument put about this being an invasion of States' rights. In the first place there was a joint policy in relation to this. In the second place Tasmania, through its lawfully elected Government, took certain steps which meant that, by necessary consequence, it had forgone rights which it might otherwise have had. It requested the Commonwealth Government to apply for World Heritage listing of the South West National Park. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a decision of the Government of the State at the time. The consequence of doing that-there was no attempt as I understand it to reverse that position immediately-was that the Commonwealth Government, acting in pursuance of a request by Tasmania, through the lawful Government of Tasmania, commenced upon a set of actions which have necessary consequences. I think this is the point that needs to be borne in mind. As my colleagues in this chamber and elsewhere would know-I do not think there are any who have fought much harder for States' rights in relation to the referendum and various other things -I support the concept of this House being a States' House. But in this particular instance Tasmania requested the nomination for World Heritage listing . The Commonwealth, acting in pursuance of that, applied for World Heritage listing. Once those steps have been taken I do not believe that it is legitimate to turn round and say, 'We have changed our minds', nor is it legitimate to turn round and say, 'This is trampling upon the rights of Tasmanians'. The lawful government of Tasmania took a step which it could take. It was not overruled by the Parliament at the time. I do not think that the fact that some people have changed their minds since entitles people to say that this action which has been taken by the Commonwealth Government in pursuance of its stated and reaffirmed policy and at the request of the State is now an act of trampling upon States rights. I totally support the Liberal-National Party policy. I totally support what the Federal Government has done. In particular, I totally support the statements made by the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, on the importance of the preservation of the South West of Tasmania. Having said that, I find myself sitting in a different position from that of a lot of my colleagues in relation to this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me address myself to the Bill. Although I would have liked to have had the opportunity to talk at length about the other issues relating to the South West of Tasmania, I do not propose to delay matters unduly tonight. No doubt there will be other opportunities to discuss the issue in more detail. I do wish to explain my basic attitude and why I supported this piece of legislation, defective or subject to adverse comment though it may be. I share some of the doubts about the real value of the Bill and whether it does, in direct terms, add very much to what would be the consequences of the listing which may or may not take place somewhere between the thirteenth and seventeenth of this month in Paris. However, it may assist. If it does assist it is not unreasonable. It is totally consistent with the obligations Australia has assumed in being a party to a convention. In relation to this particular area, it is consistent with obligations which Australia has assumed as a result of a request by the Tasmanian Governemnt pursuant to a policy, which was at that time a bipartisan policy, of the preservation of the South West of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that the people of Tasmania have expressed a clear view on this matter. I do not want to spend a long time debating that, but let me remind honourable senators that the referendum which was held in December last year did not give people an option to vote against the dam. It simply asked: 'Which of two dams in South West Tasmania do you prefer?' For a long time I have consistently held a view on South West Tasmania. But in the State election I voted Liberal and I am proud to say that I helped as best I could to get a Liberal government elected in that State. That does not say that I gave it a mandate to go ahead with that policy. This is the one matter which at the time was not disputed by the major parties, the parties that could form a government; it was not an election issue for the two major parties. Both parties were saying that, if elected, they would go ahead. So I do not see how anybody can say that whoever won the election received a mandate to go ahead with this scheme, changing the position which had been adopted by the State of Tasmania in relation to a World Heritage listing. Again, I do not want to go into great detail on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I do think that it is unfortunate that the Bill did not receive a little more consideration. It has received adverse comment from the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. It has received adverse comment from a number of people. It would seem to me that it could be improved. The Australian Labor Party has indicated that it will move some amendments with a view to improving the Bill. But I would have thought that a short, sharp inquiry by a committee of this chamber would be consistent with the committee nature of the chamber and would be consistent with improving legislation which first, has been carried by the House at the second reading stage and, secondly, has been criticised to some degree by almost every honourable senator on each side of the chamber. I do not see it as in any way impossible for there to be a quick inquiry into a matter such as this. It is not as though the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs would need to seek submissions or to give the matter in-depth consideration. Rather, this being Thursday night, the Committee could be asked in the time available between now and, say, next Wednesday to have a look at the matter and to make some comment on it. It would not delay the passage of the Bill in any significant way because the House of Representatives could not deal with the Bill before next Wednesday anyway. In other words, there would be no delay. If the Committee found that it just could not do that, then it could report accordingly. But it seems to me that that is one positive step that could be taken to try to improve this piece of legislation. I would support a motion which required either a full report from the Committee or a report that it was unable to deal with the legislation so that it could be dealt with on Tuesday afternoon when the Senate resumes and before the House of Representatives sits on Wednesday. There would be no effective delay in any way. </PARA>

I emphasise the point that this is consistent with the declared policy of the Liberal Party, it is consistent with the action of the State Government of Tasmania when it requested World Heritage listing and it is consistent with the policy and actions of the present Commonwealth Government which sought the listing and has an obligation to go on with it. Having decided that we believe that this is a matter of major importance we cannot turn around and say: 'No, we have thought about it again and we think we should change our minds'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without having engaged in the exchange of unpleasantries which has rather categorised this debate-I think extremely unfortunately-I have endeavoured to explain why I believe that the Bill is not inconsistent with anything that has happened, if we look at it in relation to the proper history of the development of this matter over the past ten years or more and the policy positions and lawful actions taken by various governments. I invite Senator Harradine to consider amending his motion. If he amends it in the way I have suggested I will be prepared to support it. </PARA>

For good or ill, the Senate decided that when it voted on the second reading. Senator Harradine has proposed that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs should look at a narrow range of problems which have been raised and have not been answered in the discussion of this Bill. They are narrow, legal problems. He is not suggesting that the Committee look at the broad thrust of the Bill, just at legal issues. I think it is entirely proper that the Senate Committee should look at these matters. As I think most honourable senators know, I am in favour of all Bills being referred to one or other of our standing committees. But where serious deficiencies or possible deficiencies in the Bill are pointed out I think it is ridiculous for the Senate not to have them properly studied by a competent committee.

What we want is a model for the Government to look at as one of its possible courses of action.' It is available now for that purpose. It does not have to pass the Senate for it to be available as a model for the Government if the Government wants to look at this as a possible course of action. It is quite seriously defective so there is no way in which the Government can take it up in the House of Representatives and have it passed there. It would have to amend it and bring it back to this chamber. Therefore all that is claimed by its proponents, that what they are offering the Government is a model, is available now. What we should do, as a responsible chamber, is to see that the model we are proposing to the Government, as a chamber, is not full of inconsistencies and deficiencies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish Senator Lewis would stop using the word 'motion'; he is starting to give me one. In debate both last week and this week we have been somewhat tortuously discussing an issue which, as I say, everybody in Australia understands and it is important and urgent. It involves what happens in the South West of Tasmania. Senator Harradine's motion will not be supported by us because it is in essence a way of avoiding the issue. It is a contrivance. If this Bill goes to the House of Representatives next week, the week after or whenever to be dealt with, if the will is there on the issue the defects in the Bill will be cured. If the will is not there on the issue then there will be continued prevarication about it. Honourable senators know that that is what this is all about. It is prevaricating about grasping the nettle on the issue. That is what this filibuster is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine's motion asks the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs first of all to make a judgment on the decisions of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Secondly, the last paragraph of the motion asks us to make a very clear cut value judgment as to whether it would be appropriate for the Commonwealth to invoke the foreign affairs power. That is a matter which can be judged if the Commonwealth has the will concerning the protection of the South West of Tasmania. That is a matter about which the Government can make a judgment, if it has the will to do anything about it. It is not a matter appropriate for the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> In a sense the other terms of reference fall into a similar category. I understand Senator Harradine's motivation in moving this motion. I do not say that in any hostile sense. He is a Tasmanian battling, as he sees it, for what he calls the protection of the Tasmanian heritage which is the right to be the most mendicant State in Australia and receive by far a larger proportion of taxpayers' money than any other State in the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the risk of being accused of entering into a filibuster, I want to make a small contribution to the matter before the Chair at the moment. The matter relates to the sending of the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill to a Senate committee. Before I do that, I will explain my actions during the course of this debate on the Bill and on the vote that has just taken place. I was in my office when the debate started. I had my intercom turned down and did not realise the debate was taking place because I had constituents with me. When the bells rang for the division I was met at the door by one of the Whips and asked whether I would not come into the chamber because he wanted an honourable senator to have a pair. I did that not realising that the vote was taking place on the Bill at that time. That is the reason I did not vote. I would have supported this Bill, despite all the expert advice I have had. I have talked to a lot of people about the Bill and it does have some defects. Therefore, I am quite conscious of my stand on it and support Senator Harradine's motion that it go to a committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there are defects in the Bill that committee will find them and something can be done about them. I think that is a sensible course of action because I do not want to be party to passing a defective Bill. I would have voted for it if there was no other way. I would have supported the Bill and let it go through. Now there is a way of overcoming the defects in the Bill by having it sent to a committee. As my colleague Senator Rae has already said, that will not take a long time. The Bill is not large and does not have a lot of clauses. If the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs can take a few hours to consider it, I am sure it will be able to report back to the Senate in a very short time. As my colleague Senator Rae has pointed out, the House of Representatives will be sitting next week and the Bill can go before it. As to whether the House of Representatives will have time to deal with the Bill in the week it is sitting, that is up to it. In the meantime, I believe the Bill is right and proper. I say all that without taking away my support for the principle of what Senator Mason and the Australian Democrats are trying to do on this matter. I support the concept of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I throw out completely this nonsense that has been going on about overriding States and everything else. When it comes to something that is important to this nation, and its people, and the world as a whole, I believe that the Commonwealth Parliament has a responsibility to do something about it. I would support any such moves, as I would moves relating to the Great Barrier Reef, the Kakadu National Park and a whole range of other things which are important in this nation and which must be protected. Some honourable senators have talked about overriding the States. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had no compunction whatsoever in the case of Fraser Island in Queensland when he refused to allow an export license because Fraser Island was being destroyed by sand mining. I did not hear a peep out of anyone here when the Prime Minister did that against States rights. The Prime Minister overrode the views of my State-Queensland. He said: 'You can mine it if you want to but you will not get an export licence'. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned the same principle applies in South West Tasmania. This national Parliament has a responsibility in matters so important not only to Australia and Australians but also to the world as a whole. It is one of those unique places which needs to be protected. Having said that, I will certainly support the motion as moved by Senator Harradine. I hope that it will be carried so that this Bill can be referred to that responsible Committee. I refer to some of the remarks that have come from the cross benches about referring this matter to a committee. Senator Chipp has had no compunction whatsoever in referring a Government Bill to a committee to look at. </PARA>

If it is good enough for the Australian Democrats, who fortunately or unfortunately have the balance of power in this place, to do that to Government initiatives it is good enough for us to do it when we feel it is important for a Bill to be referred to a committee for thorough investigation. I will certainly support Senator Harradine's motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief so that it cannot be suggested that I am filibustering. I take the view that much of this debate is on the question of State rights. I think that any attempt to use external powers to achieve the objective is insidious, surreptitious and undermining. Our founding fathers never intended the Constitution to be so used. I must say that I found it regrettable that Senator Missen echoed all of the obnoxious and objectionable features of what appears now to me to be a failing system of federation. There seems to be no longer in this Parliament a recognition of the capacity, ability, sensitivity, understanding, wisdom or local knowledge of members who represent their States in the State parliaments. They are, of course, the nerve ends of the community. They are the litmus test of how people feel in the various States and they better than anybody know how their States feel. Presumably if they are half-wise, half-pragmatic, half- practical and half-political they will reflect those views within the framework of the philosophy which they represent. If they do not they will very quickly ignominiously be removed from office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that it is impertinent to say the least that all wisdom resides in Canberra. I do not believe it does. I think it is wrong to suggest that all capable, competent members of parliament happen to have been elected to the Senate or the House of Representatives. I do not know what makes so many people think that there is a divine right of wisdom, a unique right of wisdom, in this parliament. I used to believe that the Liberal Party believed in the devolution of power-making decision-making closer to the people-not ever-gathering and growing power towards the centre, the vortex, as we now see so often. It ought to be remembered that the great debate on the Constitution in the first place was over the separation of powers. The Commonwealth was formed only because of the agreement of the States after much debate and argument as to what the division of powers would be. </PARA>

Definitive, precise, articulate powers were laid down in the Constitution for the benefit of the States and ultimate residual powers rested with the Commonwealth. There have been insidious attempts over the years to undermine those powers. The tragedy is that members of the Australian Labor Party do not believe in State rights. The aspirant to the leadership of the ALP, Mr Hawke, has said:</PARA></TALK.START>

Under a great deal of duress and a great deal of pressure we went to a referendum. Notwithstanding the fact that the growth in population went from 24,000 to 110,000 as a result of all this wisdom and knowledge coming from the eastern States in pursuit of the gold that was lying in the ground in Western Australia, we ultimately had a referendum. The referendum was carried. It was carried only as a result of the votes of Australians in the eastern States and not by Western Australians. It was carried by people who had no identification with Western Australia, had never been to the capital city, did not have a relative there, did not have any affinity with the place, and had no knowledge of the place whatsoever.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Peter Rae was one of the architects of that document, and I am glad he reminded us about it. I still believe that the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill is inadequate. I certainly would be anxious for the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs to look quickly at this to examine the points that have been raised by Senator Harradine, in particular the last point as to whether it would be appropriate for the Commonwealth to invoke the external affairs power in section 51 (xxix) of the Constitution to legislate in the manner proposed by the Bill. Those matters deserve re-examination and report from what I regard to be a very responsible committee of this chamber. If we are to proceed with this matter I think the Senate has a responsibility to ensure that the inadequacies and ambiguities that Senator Harradine referred to in his motion are identified and that a report should come from that Committee as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The World Heritage Properties Protection Bill proposed by my Australian Democrat colleague Senator Mason is designed for one purpose; that is, to stop the vandalism that is taking place in one of the most beautiful places of the world. That point seems to have been lost in the course of this debate. This area has been nominated by this country for listing on the World Heritage list and is now being destroyed as we debate this useless motion in the Senate tonight. Incredible damage is being done right now. The damage that is being done to this area since the Bill passed through the Tasmanian Parliament is unbelievable. Anyone listening to this debate, I am sure, would not be moved by any sense of urgency from the Liberal Party senators who have spoken on this matter this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. I apologise to Senator Missen; he made an extremely courageous speech. One of the incredible things is that this Bill has already passed the second reading stage. This move by Senator Harradine is an extraordinarily clever but diabolical device to delay the passage of this Bill. He has been ably assisted by those members of the Liberal Party who have filibustered. In 10 minutes' time this Bill, which has not yet progressed beyond the second reading stage, will have occupied five hours of the Senate's time. That is almost as much time as it took the Senate to pass the Estimates in total .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last week, when we were debating whether the Senate would sit again this week and the Democrats informed Senator Harradine that we would vote in favour of that happening, he leaned across in the presence of three witnesses and said to my Whip, Senator Macklin: 'If you Democrats support sitting next week I will oppose everything you do next week'. That is the basis on which this man, Senator Harradine, has moved this contrivance, to use Senator Button's word, to ensure that the Bill is not passed. Why is it urgent? It is urgent because the House of Representatives is to sit next Wednesday. If the Senate passes the Bill tonight we will be able to put pressure on the House of Representatives to address itself to this question on 8 December. The World Heritage Committee meets on 13 December. As I have stated previously in this chamber, I am very concerned that, as a result of either a deliberate or accidental contrivance, the Department of Home Affairs and Environment has not sent the requisite information to the delegates to that meeting. Senator Peter Baume said yesterday , in answer to a question by Senator Bonner, that the information still had not left Australia; that the permanent head had left but the information had not. I am desperately concerned lest the World Heritage Committee, at its meeting on 13 to 17 December, defer the matter to February. Having seen this area, having seen photographs that my colleague, Dr Norman Sanders, has taken from an aircraft, I say that if we defer the matter to February it will be too late. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention very briefly once again the States rights issue. Are those who propose that argument seriously suggesting that the Queensland Government, for instance, should have an unchallenged right to drill the Great Barrier Reef for oil if it should wish to do so? Is that what is being suggested? If the troglodytes on the other side of the chamber are suggesting that the Commonwealth has no power or business to intrude upon the rights of a State, one must logically come to the conclusion that any State has the right to determine its own destiny to the ultimate conclusion. If so, one would have to acknowledge that the Queensland Parliament had the power-not that it would be stupid enough to exercise it but I am speaking theoretically-to approve the drilling of the Great Barrier Reef for oil. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disgusted at the way in which this measure has been talked out. If its opponents wanted to delay the Bill until after the Flinders by-election, or for some other dubious reason, why did they not let it proceed in Committee. The second reading of the Bill was passed but they did not accept the umpire's decision. Instead, they took advantage of this contrivance, this spurious device , of Senator Harradine which virtually, for the last hour, has precluded debate on the Franklin River in this chamber. A strict application of the Standing Orders would require that the only debate that could be undertaken would be on the four prongs of Senator Harradine's motion. I was tempted, in an endeavour to obtain some satisfaction, to go along with Senator Peter Rae's suggestion that the matter be referred to the Committee on Constittional and Legal Affairs with the proviso that it report back on Tuesday. I have discussed that with the Chairman and members of the Committee and they say it would be a charade to require it to report back by Tuesday. Therefore, I will not go along with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to try to bring this debate back to the motion which is before the Senate; that is, that the World Heritage Properties Protection Bill 1982 be referred to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report. Four matters in particular were detailed in Senator Harradine's remarks. The reason that I have been drawn into this debate, quite frankly, has been the intolerance of the so-called civil libertarians taking part in the debate. The people who in this chamber protest strongly that they represent the civil libertarians in this Senate took point after point of order against Senator Walters because they had to suffer listening to a point with which they did not agree. I was ashamed to hear such people. I will not name them because this debate is still being broadcast. But those people who claim in this Senate all the time to represent the civil libertarians and say that others do not, taking point of order after point of order against Senator Walters simply because she was taking a point of view contrary to their own, drew me into this debate and led me to consider the matters which Senator Harradine has asked the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs to report on. Let us consider this Bill and what Senator Harradine is asking the Committee to look at. Clause 6 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is unlawful for a person to do any act or take any action that is likely adversely to affect the protection . . . of a property. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mason says, 'There is nothing wrong with the Bill'. What detail is there in it? How does a landowner in that area or a person who is passing through the area know how to organise his affairs, his life or whatever he is going to do on the basis of that sort of clause? What is in it in relation to onus of proof or protection? If a person wants to pick up a stick is he guilty? Is he guilty if he digs some sort of a hole somewhere or other? Surely these are matters which ought to be set out in such a Bill. The people of Tasmania or visitors to Tasmania who go into that area are entitled to know what they are allowed to do. But no, the Bill is vague. Strangely enough, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has reported on this matter. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> This clause provides very little identification of the scope of unlawful actions with which the Bill would deal. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree. I find it incredible that the so-called civil libertarians of the Senate and people such as Senator Missen, the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, do not agree that this Bill ought to go to that committee in order to be rectified. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 May I raised the matter of the eavesdropping of telephone conversations on the Aurukun-Weipa radio telephone circuit. In reply-I quote from Hansard-the Minister for Education, Senator Peter Baume, said that he would:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . ask Telecom to look at the matter, to get a report and to try to make a response to Senator Colston on the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>On 24 November-not yesterday but the previous Wednesday-having received no reply , I asked during the adjournment debate whether I could have some information in the near future. Today, on 2 December, the Minister kindly advised me that a reply was forwarded towards the end of June to the then Secretary of Estimates Committee B. I would like to mention this evening that until today I had not received a copy of that reply. Today the then Secretary of Estimates Committee B contacted me and acknowledged that he had received a copy of the reply but the copy had been misfiled. It seems a little peculiar to me. If matters are raised in the Senate and an honourable senator is told that she or he will receive a reply perhaps that reply should go direct to the honourable senator concerned. If the reply had come direct to me I would have received it last June. I would suggest that the practice be adopted whereby a reply goes direct to a senator so that this type of thing does not occur in future. I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard a section of the letter that went to the then Secretary of Estimates Committee B which outlined a response to my original question. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>In response to Senator Colston's question concerning the privacy of telephone conversations between Weipa and the Aboriginal community of Aurukun, the following information has been provided by Telecom Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> The Aurukun-Weipa single channel radio telephone system was installed in 1980 with a substantial contribution ($67K) towards provision being made by Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The system provides a service to the Aurukun Aboriginal settlement. The subscriber is the Aurukun Shire Council accessed via Weipa on (070) 73 3600. </PARA>
<PARA> The radio telephone system is a standard frequency modulated one working in the 160 MHz band. It does not incorporate equipment to 'scramble' speech; therefore suitably sited multi-band FM receivers and certain types of TV receivers can be tuned by unauthorised persons to eavesdrop on the conversations of people using the Aurukun-Weipa telephone circuit. Such eavesdropping is of course prohibited by Clause 86 (1) of the Telecommunications Act 1975, and is subject to a penalty of impirsonment for two years. However, it is in practice difficult to detect or prevent. </PARA>
<PARA> If the existing Weipa-Aurukun circuit is to be fitted with a device to make casual eavesdropping more difficult, its signal to noise performance will be worsened to a considerable extent, and it will become unusable for extended periods of time. To provide a circuit which would give both a reasonable degree of secrecy and a completely satisfactory signal to noise performance would require the expenditure by Telecom of a further $100,000; and would involve the provision of a repeater installation at a location approximately half way between Weipa and Aurukun which is at present not readily accessible. Funds for such upgrading work are currently not available. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In 1978 the Public Service Board decided that at locally owned airports the justification for payment of the Officer-in-charge allowance should be reviewed on vacancy. Weipa came into this category and the review showed that the duties of the position of Flight Service Officer, Grade 4 did not meet the eligibility criteria. The eligibility criteria are that the officer is representing the Department; is controlling staff and stores; has administrative functions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Officers-in-charge of non-government airports who meet the eligibility criteria receive an appropriate allowance. The allowance is paid at Mildura, Albury and Gove.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The allowance was paid to the previous occupant of the position of Flight Service Officer, Grade 4 at Weipa. However, the allowance was ceased when this officer vacated the position, because the duties of the position, did not meet the eligibility criteria as stated in my answer to Question (1).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) All of the duties listed were performed on occasions by the supervisor- Flight Service Unit. Some duties such as mail clearances were performed daily, whereas in the last 8 months only 3 charts have been sold. There is no authorised stores holding at Weipa and the Department has no knowledge of savings of thousands of dollars a year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 October 1982 (Hansard, page 1794) Senator Watson asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Aviation, a question without notice concerning the delay in the introduction of Boeing wide-body jets by Ansett.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Ansett has informed my Department that the delay in the introduction of Ansett 's wide-body aircraft was primarily caused by Boeing which was having difficulty meeting delivery schedules for the first thirty aircraft. I understand that Boeing suggested a six-week deferment to Ansett but, in view of the serious downturn in airline traffic, the airline then negotiated the longer delay to mid-1983.</PARA>
<PARA> Ansett has also stated that Boeing is constructing all of the early aircraft in a three-man configuration and subsequently converting to a two-man configuration as required. All of Ansett's and TAA's Boeing B727s and TAA's Airbus A300 are flown in a three-man cockpit configuration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 October 1982, (Hansard, page 1933) Senator Thomas asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, without notice, a question about discussions the Minister had with representatives of the Exmouth and Carnarvon shire councils on 23 October 1982. The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 23 October the Minister for Defence had discussions, in Exmouth, with the Honourable Phil Lockyer, M.L.C., representatives of the Exmouth and Carnarvon shire councils and district landholders. He explained that although the need for an amphibious training area in Western Australia is being investigated, its general location has yet to be determined. The Exmouth district is only one of the possible locations for the training area.</PARA>
<PARA> An environmental impact study would be prepared before final decisions are taken in relation to the exact location of the training area. Should Exmouth Gulf be preferred on technical grounds, ample opportunity would be provided for comment on the proposal by the West Australian Government, local shires and the public. The meeting was also informed that there is, at present, no provision for the establishment of an Amphibious Training Area in Western Australia in the Five Year Defence Programme.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is aware that the Shire of Derby would be happy for an area near that town to be used for amphibious exercises in conjunction with the proposed Royal Australian Air Force Base at Derby.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 November 1982 (Hansard, page 2105) Senator Button asked me a question without notice concerning the Government Information Unit and in particular a Mr Arnis Verbickis employed by the unit. On 1 December 1982 Senator Sibraa also sought an answer to Senator Button's question. In my reply to Senator Button I undertook to direct his question to the Minister for Administrative Services, who has portfolio responsibility for the Government Information Unit. Mr Newman has now provided me with the following information in response to Senator Button's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Arnis Verbicks, the Federal Information Director, Victoria, was attached to the office of Sir Phillip Lynch. Since Sir Phillip Lynch's retirement, Mr Verbickis has continued to perform his duties as Federal Information Director. These duties are outlined in the Charter of the Government Information Unit which was laid down in 1981. Those duties are, broadly, to assist Ministers in communicating with the public on matters affecting Victoria and to report to Ministers on public reaction to Government policies, programs, activities and objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button sought my assurance that 'Mr Verbickis has not been and will not be involved on behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia in the by-election campaign for Sir Phillip's former seat of Flinders'. Mr Verbickis has advised that he has not been involved in the by-election campaign beyond providing the usual media services for Ministers visiting Victoria and that the last time he was in the Flinders electorate was in late 1981 when he handled media inquiries when Sir Phillip's knighthood was announced.</PARA>
