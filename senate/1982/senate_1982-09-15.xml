<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef is unique and is included on the World Heritage List.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection , storage, and research has been publicly funded.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving ' property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Recognise that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programs,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed in to the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Reject any proposal to legislate for any system such as the drafted Plant Variety Rights Act, which gives exclusive ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 670 citizens of New South Wales:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 provided that a precisely defined area, which included the coastal low water line, called The Great Barrier Reef Region should be proclaimed a marine park in which mining and oil drilling specifically would be prohibited and that management plans would be prepared for each zone, allowing for normal uses consistent with the preservation of the natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA> Only a small percentage of the area has so far been proclaimed and in the Cairns section a 5 km wide region for most of the coastline has been excluded. This seems to provide an opportunity for oil drilling and beach mining (causing silting) to take place. We fear that the granting of mining or drilling leases or other harmful developments, here or in the rest of The Great Barrier Reef Region may prevent the object of the Act from being achieved. We believe that most citizens share our fears.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Government to take action so that a referendum will be held with the next federal elections on the question that the entire Great Barrier Reef region be immediately declared a marine park as defined in and provided by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 and amended in 1978 which included the coastal low water line.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 649 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: the petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we believe that a recent archaeological discovery has been a cave along the Franklin River containing artiefacts and other indications of human habitation during the last ice age. It has not been studied yet and there could be similar sites not yet located. The remains are equivalent in age to the remains in the famous caves in France and similar world wide scientific interest can be expected to develop. It is inconceivable that these sites of world wide importance should be lost forever by being flooded.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition there are very few wilderness areas left now and the retention of what remains is necessary to provide biologists with continously available scientific reference data for more skilful use of our cultivated areas and as a storage for species, including river borne species, that may become of practical use in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> Also it is important to keep some areas in their completely natural state to maintain some balance in nature and in this case because of its inspiring beauty and grandeur.</PARA>
<PARA> We understand that the cost of constructing a dam will fall mainly on taxpayers of the mainland states and that it has been shown by an independent study that other methods of power generation are much cheaper for this particular case.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Government to take action so that a referendum will be held with the next federal elections to ascertain the opinion of electors on whether the area generally known as the South West Tasmanian wilderness should be kept as far as possible in its natural state, no dams should be constructed and that the Federal Government should use all constitutional means towards this end and towards the preservation of similar wilderness areas in other parts of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for National Development and Energy been drawn to today's Press reports that 2,700 workers at various Broken Hill Proprietary Co.

Has the Minister's attention also been drawn to the fact that import duty on steel imports is generally only 5 per cent, the maximum being only 10 per cent, and that in many cases imports from countries such as Taiwan and South Korea arrive in this country duty free? Is the Minister aware that Australian companies exporting steel products from Australia to Taiwan have to pay a duty of up to 15 per cent on the c.i.f. price, a 4 per cent labour tax and a commodity tax which ranges from 2 per cent to 100 per cent, making a total of between 22 per cent and 139 per cent when these various taxes are compounded? Is the Minister aware that Taiwanese and South Korean importers have to be licensed and that imports are controlled in those countries when they conflict with local production? In view of the attitudes of these two countries to their domestic steel industries, will the Government reconsider its foolish and short-sighted view of the strategic importance of our steel industry?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is aware of the retrenchment of a significant number of workers employed at the BHP steel works. Indeed, a series of discussions has been held between BHP and the Government over the months. BHP has made it very clear that the world recession has had an effect upon it and, in particular, upon the demands in Australia for steel. Therefore it has been in a difficult trading position. Equally, the very great rise in wages, which averaged something like 17 1/2 per cent last year, has, of course, imposed costs upon the steel industry which priced that industry out of many markets. The Government set up a Temporary Assistance Authority inquiry at the request of BHP and the report was considered. The Government has referred the whole question to the Industries Assistance Commission and there will be a thorough review of BHP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is admitted that in the world at the moment there is an enormous excess capacity for steel making. In fact, in the free world there is something like 130 million tonnes excess capacity for steel of which Japan itself would have a very considerable amount. It is true that countries, including particularly South Korea, are keenly competing in the world at prices with which Australian steel works cannot cope at the moment. All of these things are being taken into consideration. The Government has pegged imports of steel to the 1981-82 situation. The Government has also taken a very significant step with regard to aid to BHP for reconstruction for the future. Under the recent Budget companies are able to collect together and produce their accounts as a consolidated account. That means that profits and losses can be consolidated. This could mean that the profits from BHP's oil venture, which could be very substantial for the future particularly with Fortescue coming on stream, could provide a significant source of capital for redevelopment and restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government up to date has been very closely in touch with BHP, has been very acutely aware of the need in Australia to maintain an efficient steel works and has taken steps already which are significant in themselves. But overall the problems of BHP are the problems of Australian manufacturing industry at the moment. Wages in Australia have been forced upwards-the rise last year was 17 1/ 2 per cent-to a point so far ahead of the general trend throughout the world that Australian manufacturing and general exports are steadily pricing themselves out of world markets. The way back for Australia is to do what every other country in the free world is doing at this moment. The way back, as in Europe and other countries, is for Australia to understand that there must be a restraint on wages and costs in Australia if we are to have a cost structure which allows us to expand employment and to compete elsewhere. The whole question of the steel works in Australia will be kept under review. As to the specific details that were asked of me regarding Taiwan and South Korea, I am unable to be specific and I will refer those maters to the Minister for Trade and Resources and seek further information.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have not been any formal complaints laid in this area. All requests for anti-dumping action need to be lodged with the Department of Industry and Commerce which administers our anti-dumping legislation. The latest advice I have-which would be no more than a day old-is that no complaints on apples have been lodged with the Department, although the procedures for initiating anti-dumping action were recently outlined in a letter from the Department of Primary Industry to the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation in response to allegations that a range of processed apple products were being dumped in Australia by New Zealand exporters. In other words, there have been allegations and as a result information with respect to the appropriate procedures has been forwarded by the Department of Primary Industry to the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation, but I do not think any formal action has been taken as a result of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the exception of a dumping and countervailing duty complaint against imports of New Zealand square-dressed structural softwood, I am not aware of any agricultural industries having lodged anti-dumping complaints. In the course of public consultations on the proposals for closer economic relations with New Zealand a number of industries, in particular horticulture and sectors of the dairy industry, have expressed concern at the prospect of New Zealand produce being dumped in Australia. The closer economic relations proposals are designed to ensure that anti-dumping and countervailing duty action, where it is justified, is effective. For horticultural products, because of the seasonal nature of production and the need for prompt action to prevent injury, a special liaison arrangement will be established between government and industry to enable the speedy determination of whether a legitimate complaint exists. The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently announced measures to speed up the investigation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty complaints with a view to ensuring that effective remedies are available to Australian industries.</PARA>

Nevertheless, the essential points made by Senator Crichton-Browne in his question are true. The sea lanes of the Indian Ocean, especially from the north-west, through the South-East Asian area, are among the busiest in the world and vital to Australia's interests. It is also true that in recent years the Soviet naval presence in the Indian Ocean has increased significantly. Some 20 or 30 ships of that country's navy are normally deployed in that ocean quite close to the Western Australian coast at any one time. It is true that from time to time there are also visits to Australian ports by United States naval vessels. It is important to the ANZUS alliance that that kind of cameraderie between two allies should continue. I note no dissenting remark; perhaps even the Opposition agrees. However, it might be interesting to note that, in fact, the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party, according to a resolution that is being put to its conference, apparently is opposed to it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, said on the television program Sunday and later in his electorate radio talk that, although no Liberal liked retrospectivity, it was even more important to demonstrate the Liberal Party's commitment to a fair tax system and that it is the Government's intention to collect the tax that has been evaded. He stated also that the Liberal Party was founded to govern fairly, in the interests of all Australians, and he did not want to lead or be part of any party which failed to stand by that principle. Keeping in mind that the great majority of Australians are honest taxpayers and have had to pay on an average between $30 and $35 a family per week, or approximately $3,000, extra because a group has evaded paying all or most of its taxes and that an honest government could not and would not want to keep those evaded taxes when collected but would want to pay them back to the honest taxpayers, I ask: When and how is the Government planning to do that following collection of the taxes?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the Prime Minister's television and radio talks, I understand that he said that a number of taxpayers in Australia-the pay-as-you -earn taxpayers-had borne an unfair burden of tax over the past 10 years because some people had evaded taxes by using schemes such as the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. When one is considering principles, especially the principle of equity, one has to consider that there is a very real principle of equity in regard to the PAYE people who have been unduly carrying the burden of taxation as against those who have been dodging it. That is the principle that has been weighed up. In the recoupment provisions that will come before the Senate the Government will pursue the liabilities for company tax that were liable at the time when the vendor shareholders sold their shares and the companies were subsequently stripped. That is perfectly clear and it was in that context and in the knowledge that there is a need to be fair to all Australians that the Prime Minister pointed out that his political party, which the people of Australia have accepted over the years as being the government of their choice, governs in the interests of all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Within the very Budget before the Parliament at the moment is a significant amount of money to be recovered from such schemes. That money will help to provide tax cuts, increases in family allowances, increases in student assistance, increases in spouse allowances and the interest rebates on housing. All those things, taken together, will mean for an average family with children something between $17 and $20 a week in the course of this year. That is a very significant distribution towards the lower and lower middle income families of Australia. Senator Elstob has referred to some figures. He alleges that the tax evaders have robbed taxpayers of $35 a week. There is absolutely no basis at all for such a figure. The evidence before us is that it is considerably lower. It is the intention of the Commonwealth Government to pursue these tax evasion schemes and to outlaw them, to collect the revenue and to apply that revenue to all those items of welfare in the Budget-education, defence et cetera-for all Australians to share in. We intend to do that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no information on whether particular safeguards are used in that regard. I have experience, as I suspect many honourable senators have, of direct personal representations being made in circumstances in which people are seeking to get admission of people from overseas and are putting forward in support of that the fact that they are able to obtain employment for them in Australia. Often in the course of that letters are produced from potential employers saying that they are prepared to employ the person who is seeking immigration. I suppose that it is one of the oddities of our situation that, at a time when there is very great concern about unemployment, one still gets people trying to come to Australia because they see it as a land of considerable opportunity-which, of course, it is-and one finds that there are employers prepared to say that they are unable to obtain suitable employees on the local market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention that in response to the question because it suggests a state of affairs rather different from the one implied, I think, in the question asked by Senator Watson, which is that there may be some effectively fictitious advertising which is really being used to provide a facility for the entry of immigrants rather than offering jobs to local people. If that were occurring, it would be a matter of concern to the Government and, I am sure, to the Minister, Mr Macphee. I shall ensure that it is referred to the Minister.</PARA>

Is it not a fact that Mr John McLeay was, in March 1980, a Minister of this Government and, secondly, that the same person is currently luxuriating in Los Angeles as the Australian Consul-General and has been there since December 1980? In view of the aforementioned, I ask the Leader of the Government: Was the Prime Minister advised by his then Minister of his dealings with the family companies, and did the Prime Minister know this when he appointed Mr McLeay as Australian Consul-General? In view of the allegations of the official liquidator , and on the basis that Mr McLeay represents Australia and not the Fraser Government, I ask that Mr McLeay be recalled from Los Angeles.</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, I would also think that if any honourable senator were aware that there was an action before a court, he would know that it is not for this Senate, in any sense, to sit in judgment on what the final resolution of those court proceedings would be. I should have thought that that would be elementary. As to the question about whether a Mr John McLeay was a member of this Parliament and a Minister, the answer is yes. As to the next question, rather melodramatically asked, I remind the Senate that Mr McLeay is indeed the Consul-General in Los Angeles at present, and no doubt he is doing a first class job for Australia in that capacity. I am not equipped to comment upon any of the company transactions of Mr McLeay, but I have an awareness that Mr McLeay made a statement quite some time ago in which he indicated that he was not connected with particular companies at the time of transactions. Not having any knowledge of the details before the courts I suggest to all honourable senators that the ordinary proceedings of the law should take place and that this Senate should observe them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My advice on this matter is that the Diesel Fuel Taxes Legislation Amendment Bill which was introduced on Budget night provides for a rebate of excise paid on diesel fuel in mining operations otherwise than for the purpose of propelling a vehicle on a public road. In the Bill the definition of mining operations includes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) exploration, prospecting or mining for minerals; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the dressing or beneficiation (at the mining site or elsewhere) of minerals , or ores bearing minerals, as an integral part of operations for their recovery .</PARA>
<PARA> and includes-</PARA>
<PARA> (c) other operations connected with exploration, prospecting or mining for minerals that are carried out in, or at a place adjacent to, the area in which the exploration, prospecting or mining occurs;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) where minerals, or ores bearing minerals, are dressed or beneficiated, at a place other than the mining site, as an integral part of operations for their recovery-the transporting of the minerals or ores from the mining site to the place where they are dressed or beneficiated:</PARA>
<PARA>Whether the rebate applies in a particular mining operation depends on the circumstances of the case. However, rebate is not payable on diesel fuel used in smelting or refining activities which are not an integral part of the mining operation. Off-road transport of minerals to a place where beneficiation of minerals would occur would be eligible for rebate. In other words, there are specific areas where the rebate is applicable; outside those areas it is not. I will, however, check the point raised by the honourable senator, but I do not think that any further change is likely.</PARA>

The fact is that everybody who is in primary industry in Australia understands that many farmers, in fact most farmers, belong to co-operatives; that shareholdings in co- operatives are nominal shareholdings; that they are in fact the membership establishments of those people in the co-operatives; and they are not, in the sense, shareholdings for pecuniary interests such as the ordinary shareholdings in private or public companies.

If so, what arrangements is he prepared to make to enable these people to take advantage of the scheme?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will remember that as part of the Government' s housing package announced earlier this year and before I assumed responsibilities in this area, we indicated that among the changes which we were making to assist the promotion of home ownership in Australia we would be discontinuing the old Homes Savings Grant Scheme, paying off the backlog of claims under that scheme and introducing a new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme. That latter scheme had an easier savings requirement. It provided some additional benefit and it was, I think, income tested and had a number of changes which were thought to be beneficial. One of the principal changes was that we were seeking to ensure that the subsidy available from the taxpayer would be made available at a time when it would assist home purchasers to bridge the deposit gap.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Inevitably when one changes from one scheme to another it is necessary to have a cut off date for one scheme and a commencement date for the other. In the case of the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme and the Homes Savings Grant Scheme there was in fact an overlap period. An announcement was made and I think 2 June was given ultimately as the cut off date for assistance under the old Homes Savings Grant Scheme. Because there was a cut off date and because there was the problem of letting people know about the scheme and the fact that if they did not apply they would lose their rights, the Government undertook a quite extensive advertising campaign. There was advertising in all the major Press and on radio. A very large number of letters was sent out by the then Minister for Housing and Construction, Mr McVeigh, to those bodies which dealt with home buyers. So, a great effort was made to ensure that those who might benefit from the scheme should learn about the fact that the scheme was coming to an end and was being replaced by the new scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> Inevitably, some people have not caught up with the fact that the scheme was changed. One might say that it is the counsel of despair for Ministers to say that is inevitable, but, when one looks at the utilisation rate of the Homes Savings Grant Scheme, it becomes clear that at all times during the life of that scheme it has never caught 100 per cent of home buyers. Again I am speaking from memory, but my recollection is that the participation rate among home buyers was something like 60 per cent to 70 per cent. There has always been a significant number of home buyers who might have qualified but have not come forward. In any event, a special effort was made. Notwithstanding that special effort, some people have missed out, through either inadvertence or lack of knowledge. I do not propose to put before the Government any proposal that there should be a further period of having the two schemes operating. It is unfortunate, but the Government did what it could at the time to ensure that the scheme was widely understood. I do not believe anything can be done to pick up those cases which are the subject of the question by Senator Robertson.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As indicated in the honourable senator's question, the matter of beef exports to the United States is important given current Australian seasonal conditions and the general state of the industry. I can advise the Senate that action has been taken in the area raised by Senator MacGibbon. Because of the high level of shipments by major supplying countries, it was thought likely that imports of beef into the United States in 1982 would be limited under the United States meat import law. Australia, New Zealand and Canada were, therefore, approached by the United States to restrain the level of their exports for the remainder of this year. The figure proposed for Australia is 676.9 million lb, which corresponds with the minimum access level to which Australia is entitled under the meat import law. However, this may be increased if there are shortfalls in supplies from other countries. An understanding of the United States along these lines is in the process of being finalised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Forecasts indicate that our shipments for entry into the United States are likely to reach the proposed restraint level in about mid-October. The Minister has directed the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation to implement the necessary arrangements to ensure that the proposed restraint level for Australia is not exceeded. The access assurances which we received from the United States are of particular value to the industry, which is currently going through one of the severest droughts on record. I am sure that exporters will recognise that these and the related measures being implemented by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation will remove much of the uncertainty in respect of the United States market which has been facing them over recent weeks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory to legislation due to come into force in the Australian Capital Territory on 1 October which will require all electrically boosted solar hot water installations to be connected to an off-peak electrical supply, whether the householder wants that or not. This requirement applies only to solar systems and not to conventional hot water systems and will confront the householder with a large amount of additional cost. To my knowledge this is the only legislation of its kind in the world. I can understand the desire of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority to reduce peak loadings, but if householders are discouraged by this legislation from installing solar hot water systems, surely electricity consumption will increase. Will the Minister suggest to the Government that it removes or amends this piece of bureaucratic nonsense?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address a question to Senator Carrick in his capacity as Leader of the Government in the Senate. Has Senator Carrick seen published reports that Mr John Valder, the Sydney stockbroker, has raised at least $1m to pay off the immediate debts of the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Party of Australia? To allay fears that people such as professional tax dodgers are making large donations to the Liberal Party in an endeavour to ward off prosecution, will Senator Carrick arrange to table in the Senate a full list of the names of those individuals who donated more than $500 to Mr Valder's campaign on behalf of the New South Wales Liberal Party?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a newspaper report that Mr Valder, who is a very highly respected Australian and a leader in his own profession of stockbroking in Australia, has in a voluntary way accomplished a very great deal in reducing the severe indebtedness of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party. Mr Valder and his finance committee have very strict rules of propriety regarding the raising of funds. There is a full understanding that no money shall be given to that Party with any strings attached to it or with any contamination on it. That is rigidly observed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the second part of the question, an old fashioned situation prevails in this country and that is that the support of a political party by an individual is a matter for privacy. That is why we have a secret ballot. There is no reason at all why a person should be forced to disclose that he has given money to a political party. Is the Australian Labor Party willing to show the source of its funds from the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union? Why is it that for the last 10 years the Labor Party has known of the corruption, the murder and the violence of members of the Painters and Dockers Union and has continued its affiliation with it? The fact of the matter is that the Labor Party receives donations privately from a wide range of people. The Liberal Party is not suggesting that they be disclosed because there is a very old-fashioned view indeed regarding this; that is that the privacy of the individual as to his support for a political party is absolutely inherent in the Australian political system. We intend to uphold that principle.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. In part of the reply of the Leader of the Government in the Senate he claimed that the Australian Labor Party had received donations from the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. I want to ask him what proof he has of that and I want to remind him that in a radio interview just a few days ago one of the leading officials of the Painters and Dockers Union claimed that 98 per cent of its members voted for the Liberal Party. When he was asked why, his rejoinder was: 'We crooks have to stick together'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only proof of a sense of humour of the officials of the Painters and Dockers Union is in that remark. The fact is that if 98 per cent of members of the Painters and Dockers Union were members of the Liberal Party, can the honourable senator explain why they would have voted to affiliate with the Australian Labor Party? Now the very demonstrable nonsense of Senator McLaren's question is apparent. They affiliated with the Labor Party because they were supporters and members of the Labor Party. Since they want an answer to this, let me describe what Mr Costigan said of that union. He stated that it is not an authenic trade union; it is an organisation of criminals designed to recruit criminals for criminal purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to remember that the straw companies and the bottom-of-the- harbour schemes ended up with the painters and dockers, who are affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. Mr President, you could not want a clearer answer to what I thought was an utterly stupid question. The fact is that the painters and dockers by their vote have accepted that they support the Labor Party. Over the decades the Labor Party, knowing the violence and the corruption of the Painters and Dockers Union, has supported it. They are in mutually good company .</PARA>

It is not simply a matter regarding which a particular honourable senator should take offence; it is an offence against this chamber and I must say that. Of course, the Opposition wishes to provoke the honourable senator concerned into taking a point of order because it is looked upon as a partisan duel. It is not that at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the point of order. We have been down this road before. In fact I was once removed from this chamber for 24 hours over this very matter. It seems to me that what Senator Sir John Carrick says is, in theory, very reasonable- that if someone on this side or that impugns the honour or reputation of another honourable senator some action should be taken. The difficulty is that Senator Sir John Carrick wants it both ways. He wants to be given the right, in answering questions, to impugn members of the Opposition , specifically members of the Australian Labor Party as he did in answer to a question today, when he suggested that we were involved intimately with the painters and dockers, that we accepted money with the painters and dockers, and were involved in the murder and mayhem that goes on in their union. That impugns honourable senators on this side of the chamber. I have said before, and I say again now, that if he does that I will retaliate, as will other honourable senators on this side. If Senator Sir John Carrick is offended or hurt by that, the best way to avoid this happening is for him to avoid making the remarks that he made during his answers to questions today. If he proposes to be provocative, abusive and personally offensive towards members of the Opposition he must cop what he gets back without getting up and bleating about it to you, Sir. I suggest, Mr President, that you consider the situation in which collective blackguarding of the Opposition by the Government Leader is okay but personal blackguarding by an individual on this side is not.

<PARA>The issue of the Franklin River has been Australia's greatest conservation issue since the battle to save Lake Pedder. It is no coincidence that these two battles have been over area of Tasmania, areas of a State which contains some of the world's most outstanding beauty. I was fortunate enough to experience this beauty in a rafting trip down the Franklin in February 1981. It is one of the most unforgettable experiences I have had. The essence of the debate that the Australian Democrats raise today is that the Federal Government has the authority to prevent the environmental destruction of the Franklin River. No political points will be made by me or by members of my party today. I hope that this motion will give all members of the Senate an opportunity to participate on a non-party basis to do two things: Firstly, to save one of the world's most beautiful places from destruction; and, secondly, to compensate the Tasmanian Government for any losses it might sustain because of such a federal decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that although I am a member of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania I am also the leader of a party and therefore have always reserved the right to move such a matter as a matter of urgency, ensuring of course that no evidence given in confidence to me or to other members of the Committee is disclosed. I made it perfectly clear to the Chairman of the Committee at the beginning that I had to wear two hats-one as a member of the Committee and one as the leader of a party. He graciously accepted that position . </PARA>
<PARA> The controversy over the Franklin River is very much a national issue. I put this analogy to the Senate: Letting Tasmanians alone-that is, about half the voting population of Tasmania-decide on the Franklin River is about the same as allowing the population of Alice Springs and Darwin to vote by referendum to have Ayers Rock crushed by bulldozers to make gravel for a road in the middle of the Northern Territory. It is the same as allowing the populations of Townsville , Cairns and Mackay decide that the Great Barrier Reef ought to be mined for oil . The proposition is absolutely absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a Tasmanian issue; it is a national and even international issue. The fact that the people of Australia have recognised that can be seen by a meeting in Melbourne on a recent sunny Sunday afternoon. Over 2,500 people gave up their Sunday afternoon to protest about the damming of the Franklin. The significance of that, Mr Acting Deputy President, ought to come to you, as a Queenslander, in a flash. You would know, and God knows, that Melbourne has very few sunny Sunday afternoons. Notwithstanding that, 2,500 people turned out. Last Thursday night in Canberra something like 500 people turned out for a similar meeting which the Australian Labor Party spokesman, Mr Stewart West, and myself addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is in a very difficult position on this issue. I do not want to make political capital of that. With the Tasmanian Liberal Government opposing any federal intervention and the fate of five House of Representatives seats possibly in the balance, the pressures on him must be enormous. It is at least pleasing to note that the Young Liberals fully support moves to save the Franklin. Difficult though it might be, this is an opportunity for the Prime Minister to adopt a statesman- like policy. It could also be a political plus for him if he were to pay compensation to Tasmania in the form of direct grants for alternatives or for subsidies. It is also an opportunity to act on a very clear obligation that has existed since the very first days of the Fraser Government in December 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of urgency that the Federal Government act now. The bulldozers of the Hydro-Electric Commission are already widening an old bush track, gouging an access road into the wilderness. I wish Hansard could incorporate photographs . Any member of the Senate can inspect the photograph I have of Lake Pedder, where a road gouged into the mountain has absolutely desecrated the beauty of the site. Roads are now being gouged into the mountains surrounding the Franklin River. I am informed by my Democrat colleague in the Legislative Assembly in Tasmania, Dr Norman Sanders, that the rate of destruction around this access road has already been substantial. During the recent setting up of a large camp a fire was started which burnt out of control. The threat of fire makes this subject a matter of extreme urgency. One must remember that, as far as we know, there has been no fire in that area for 3,000 years. The human species gets in there and a fire starts within three months. Fire could obliterate this wilderness. The longer the Federal Government waits the more wilderness will be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has unequivocally recognised the great wilderness value of South West Tasmania. In July 1980 it put South West Tasmania on the register of the National Estate and in November 1981-I commend the Prime Minister for this-it forwarded the nomination of South West Tasmania to the World Heritage Committee. This is the significance of why this debate is urgent. The World Heritage Committee is due to meet in one or two months time to consider the Australian nomination. It is time to act to ensure that this recognition is not merely window dressing. </PARA>
<PARA> What can happen to this motion of mine? It is a significant opportunity for the Senate to send something down to the House of Representatives. It would be unthinkable for any honourable senator to be a party to the gagging of this debate. I tell every person listening in to this debate that Standing Orders facilitate a vote on this question. If any senator, particularly a Government senator, suggests that the business of the Senate be called upon, let every listener to this debate know that that is a gag. If any Labor senator votes for that motion, that Labor senator is also voting for a gag of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> We go further. I quote from Mr Stewart West, the Labor Party spokesman, who has done a marvellous job around Australia addressing meetings on this question. He said in a Press release of 6 September:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government must acknowledge its responsibility under the World Heritage Convention and protect the Franklin and Gordon Rivers. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The recent Federal Conference of the ALP decided to oppose the Franklin Dam and to extend financial assistance to Tasmania. The Federal Opposition is working on the details of any such assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>I am informed-I hope that I do not do him a discredit-that my friend, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Button, moved that resolution at the Federal Conference with a most eloquent and moving speech. Therefore, one would hope that the Labor Party would support the Australian Democrats today, because not only can we have the Senate resolving such a question but, if the Senate passes the motion-I would hope that a Tasmanian, Senator Harradine, would also see his way clear to supporting it-I would move, pursuant to Standing Order 336, that the resolution passed today by the Senate be communicated to the House of Representatives by message. That would mean that we could force every member of the House of Representatives to stand up and be counted on this question. </PARA>
<PARA> If this debate is gagged today, that opportunity is lost. I give warning: If this debate is gagged, if Senator Hamer, who is the last on the list to speak for the Government, does that or someone else on the Government benches jumps up after him and moves that the business of the day be called upon, we shall oppose that motion, we shall divide the House, and we shall then move the suspension of Standing Orders and that a vote be held on this question, and divide the House again. </PARA>

<PARA> The Federal Government has a number of sources of authority that would enable it to save the Franklin and Gordon Rivers and the surrounding environment. Over the last two or three weeks, a number of legal opinions has been furnished that clearly demonstrate that the Federal Government has not only the power but also a strong obligation to act. Even the Attorney-General's Department has prepared an opinion that clearly shows this. Despite the fact that the Attorney-General's office classifies the opinion as an 'internal document' some details were recently disclosed in the Age newspaper. The President of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Mr Murray Wilcox, Q.C., has written an opinion and, along with the Tasmanian Wilderness Society lawyers, he has confirmed the Attorney-Generals, view. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis for the Federal Government's obligation is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation's Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural heritage. This convention has the full force under international law of a treaty between nations. Australia has ratified that convention. Under article 4 of the convention we have recognised that protecting the heritage of our territory is the nation's duty-and is not to be left to a State government. The whole purpose of this convention is to give the primary responsibility of protecting cultural and natural heritage to sovereign States which are signatories to that convention. Australia is the signatory to that convention, not the State of Tasmania, and it is the Federal Government that has that responsibility. Article 4 of the UNESCO convention says :</PARA>
<PARA> The State will do all it can to this end, to the utmost of its own resources.</PARA>
<PARA>The responsibility is clear and all embracing. The Federal Government should do all it can to protect and conserve our natural heritage to the utmost of its own resources. I should have thought that the language is very plain and very clear.</PARA>
<PARA> Article 5 of the convention specifies the steps that each State party shall endeavour to undertake to protect and conserve its heritage. The course of action that the Federal Government needs to take is thus clearly set out. There is a number of sources of authority in the Constitution that the Federal Government can invoke to live up to its international obligations. If there is a relevant source of authority in section 51 of the Constitution that can be applied to the wilderness of South West Tasmania, the Federal Government has the constitutional authority to legislate, and that legislation overrides any inconsistent legislation of a State-as dictated by section 109 of the Constitution. It was that section, section 109, that the Prime Minister recently invoked, quick as a flash, to override John Cain's legislation on nuclear warships entering the port of Melbourne, an action with which the Democrats immediately concurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The best example of constitutional authority relates to the Federal Government' s external affairs power. However, the Federal Government may not need to go to the lengths of introducing new legislation. As Mr Wilcox, Q.C., says in his opinion:</PARA>
<PARA> As the UNESCO convention is now in force it would appear that regulations could be made to implement the convention and thus protect South West Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>The avenues to implement the responsibilities undeniably exist. Nothing excuses the fact that nothing has been done to save the Franklin by the Fraser Government. It there is any legal doubt, let the High Court determine the validity of such regulations or such legislation. This is the course that the Federal Government followed and won with the Racial Discrimination Act. Again I pay great tribute to Mr Fraser and to the Liberal Government for forcing that situation to the High Court. Let them do the same on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be stressed that there is no suggestion in this controversy that Tasmanians should suffer in any way. Adequate financial compensation must be offered to assist Tasmania to develop one of the alternatives, be that alternative other hydro-electric schemes in the non-wilderness areas, thermal schemes, connection to a grid, or the many other options that can be opened. Personally, I would prefer to see the maximum amount of available funds to Tasmania devoted to the development and promotion of its magnificent tourist attractions. As far as my affection for Tasmania goes, I doubt whether, even if it goes to extraordinary lengths to provide cheap electricity to attract industry, its future lies in competing as an industrial base with the mainland because of that inevitable stretch of water that exists between it and the mainland; rather, it lies in its magnificent potential as a tourist area. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet here we have a petty little government intent on destroying one of the most beautiful areas not just in Tasmania and not just in Australia but in the world. As the letters from 24 of the world's most eminent archeologists have recently shown, the Franklin is not only a national asset but also an international asset . We shall be submerging, I believe, an area two or three times that of Sydney Harbour, or even more. That is the magnitude of what will be devastated in this proposed act of vandalism. And to provide what? It is to provide 170 megawatts or 180 megawatts of power-mere chicken feed! Yet that area is going to be destroyed. But this is also an international asset. As such, the responsibility for saving the Franklin and providing reasonable compensation to Tasmania must fall on Australia as a whole. Compensation is a small price to pay-it is only money-for preserving this magnificent area in accordance with Australia's international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by recognising Mr Fraser's problems and the Liberal Party's problems . The Labor Party has overcome its original problems. I could have understood those as well. There is a Federal resolution on this question along the very lines of this motion. I commend the Government to act. But before I do that, I commend the Senate to act because this is a unique opportunity where a vote on a question of national and international significance can be accepted by this Senate on a non-party basis. It can come to a vote. I should have thought that this Senate chamber would be rendered a farce if any person here today engineered a situation in which this debate was gagged and no vote was taken. The time allowed for this debate is two hours. Let this issue be debated. In those two hours let speak any honourable senator who wishes to speak, but at the end of the two hours provided for by Standing Orders let us have a vote. If that vote is taken and it is a positive vote, I will immediately move that the vote of the Senate be communicated to the House of Repesentatives. That would lift the status of the Senate chamber to a new height. It would force the members of constituencies in the House of Represenatives-this is a national issue, so it should force not just the five members from Tasmania, but all the members of the House, particularly Government members-to be exposed to the groundswell of opinion on the mainland of people who desperately want this beautiful part of the world conserved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the motion of urgency being debated today Senator Chipp raised two series of questions. It is necessary to address each of those questions. One goes to the substance of his motion and to the matters which he raised, the other to procedural matters. Senator Chipp raised the procedural matters for the consideration of the Senate. He pointed out that he is a member of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania which is considering this matter. He might have added that the motion to establish that Committee was moved by Senator Macklin on his behalf in September last year. The urgency motion which has been moved by Senator Chipp clearly sets out to cover some of the very same matters which this Senate referred to the Select Committee on South West Tasmania and which it asked that Committee to consider. The terms of reference of the Committee might be of interest to honourable senators . I ask honourable senators to look at the present motion of urgency as I read part (b) of the terms of reference:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Federal responsibilities in assisting Tasmania to preserve its wilderness areas of national and international importance, including appropriate financial assistance consistent with the State's development needs and options for the State's energy requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Select Committee has before it the same kinds of considerations as those which we are being asked to address today. The purpose of the Senate Select Committee, as for all other select committees, is to consider all the available information, to digest that information, to collate it, to organise it , to reach conclusions on it and to report to the Senate what it believes to be in the best interests of all Australians. Today the Senate is being asked, without the benefit of those inputs and that consideration, to give an opinion on the very matters which are presently before Senator Chipp's Committee. Senator Chipp sought the establishment of that Committee. The Senate in its wisdom saw fit last September to ask the Select Committee to put under considered judgment the matter of South West Tasmania. It is not as though the Committee has not had time to do some work. </PARA>
<PARA> There are appropriate and well established procedures in this chamber for the conduct of both matters of public importance and matters of urgency. We believe- Senator Chipp has confirmed our belief is correct-that it is Senator Chipp's deliberate wish that the matter should come to a vote today; that is to say, that the Senate should express its opinion on a matter before it is in receipt of the report from the Committee which it established to advise it on that matter. My response from this side of the chamber-I hope I speak also for other honourable senators-is that I see no merit in proceeding to a vote today. I see no merit for the Senate or for the committee system of the Senate. I see no merit particularly because of Senator Chipp's role in establishing the Committee , his membership of that Committee and his desire now to get a vote to pre-empt the work of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that Senator Chipp appeared on the PM program on 17 May this year. In answer to a question from Huw Evans concerning the whole issue of South West Tasmania, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> But it would be a very brave or silly Government that proceeded to give what could be up to $4 billion to a State where 3 per cent of Australia's population reside against the wishes of a Select Committee--</PARA>
<PARA>I want honourable senators to note in particular these words-</PARA>
<PARA>or while a Select Committee is still sitting. </PARA>
<PARA>Those were Senator Chipp's words in May this year. They were right then and they are right now. It is not appropriate that this Senate should seek to proceed to vote on a matter which would pre-empt the work of some of its senators who have already spent a year working on this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the substance of the matters which have been raised. Government senators who will speak to this urgency motion will cover different parts of the issue. I open the debate from the Government side of the chamber by reminding the Senate that under the Australian Constitution land management, land use and the decisions about them in any State are largely matters for that State. I ask Senator Chipp whether he really meant to refer to the Government of Tasmania as a petty little government? Is that his opinion of a government of a State? Perhaps he has that opinion because it is a State with only a small population. I ask Tasmanians to take on board this appreciation of the Government of their State by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisions on South West Tasmania are primarily the responsibility of the Tasmanian Government. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth has in many instances taken an interest in major environmental issues. I think Senator Chipp drew attention to some of these. The Liberal Party of Australia and the National Country Party have had a longstanding interest in environmental matters. The parties which I represent have had a longstanding interest in South West Tasmania. The 1975 policy statement of our parties recognised the national importance of South West Tasmania. In that statement we said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will assist the Tasmanian Government-</PARA>
<PARA>I note here that we work with the Tasmanian Government-</PARA>
<PARA>in establishing a National Park of world significance in South-West Tasmania to include a substantial wilderness area. </PARA>
<PARA>That commitment has been reaffirmed many times since then. In a major address to the World Wilderness Congress in Cairns in 1980, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have recently advised the Tasmanian Government of the Commonwealth's willingness to provide further practical assistance should the Tasmanian Government decide to proceed with the establishment of a national park. </PARA>
<PARA>Between 1977 and 1980 the Commonwealth provided approximately $350,000 for the conduct of detailed resource surveys of the area. This was necessary to identify those attributes of the area which require reservation and management as a park. The report of that survey was tabled in the Commonwealth Parliament on 20 October 1981. South West Tasmania was entered on the register of the National Estate by the Federal Government, by Malcolm Fraser's Government, in April 1980. The register is of those places which have aesthetic, historical, social or scientific significance. We have been active in this matter. We continue to be active. In 1978 the then South West National Park was listed by this Government as a national biosphere reserve under the man and biosphere program of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. Further international recognition came in November 1981 when the Commonwealth, at the request of the Tasmanian Government-that petty little government, as my colleague referred to it--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was said by Senator Chipp. As I was saying, the Commonwealth Government nominated significant areas of the South West for the World Heritage List. That nomination included the South West National Park, the Davey River extension, the Franklin-Lower Gordon Wild Rivers National Park and the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park. The nomination has been evaluated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. That group has recommended the inclusion of the area in the World Heritage List. The nomination for inclusion will be considered at the meeting of the World Heritage Committee, probably in November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I summarise the actions that we have carried out. The Commonwealth has had a long-standing concern about the wilderness of South West Tasmania. This concern is real. It is continuing and it has been demonstrated in practical action up to date. There has been a commitment to assist Tasmania in establishing a national park of world significance in the South West and that commitment stands. The South West has been entered in the register of the National Estate. It has been recognised by UNESCO. Substantial areas have been classified as State reserves by the Tasmanian Government and it has been nominated for the World Heritage List. The whole of the South West has been declared a conservation area under Tasmanian legislation. It is not as if the State is out to abandon the whole area and to desecrate it tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of a plan of management is required for this massive area. I must say something that may not be appreciated by most people who do not live in Tasmania. The area we are talking about-this is a significant area of Tasmania- is not just a small national park in a large State; it is an area which is almost one-quarter of the total land area of Tasmania. Tasmanians, not unnaturally, want a major role in the management of this large part of their own State. As I have stated, the Commonwealth stands ready to assist Tasmania with this task. The question then arises whether we should move to use Commonwealth legislative powers. If we look at the words of the matter of urgency proposed by Senator Chipp we find that is in three parts. First, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Federal Government to fulfil its legislative responsibilities-</PARA>
<PARA>That is fair enough. Governments must fulfil their legislative responsibilities. Senator Chipp then sets out how this should be done. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by legislating immediately to guarantee that the environment . . . is not destroyed by any development in the wilderness regions--</PARA>
<PARA>The third element deals with compensation matters. I come back to where I began: Those questions are properly before the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania. If it is a matter of great urgency then I suggest to the members of that Senate Select Committee, including Senator Chipp, that it is within their capacity and it has been within their capacity all along to acquaint the Senate of such urgency, to give the Senate a committee view, to acquaint the Senate with what is recommended and to let the Senate work on the Committee report. There has been no such report. There has been no such action. I have enough faith in the people who make up that Committee to know that if there were a consensus, a shared view, about the urgency we would have heard from the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp said that the Government should legislate immediately. He is advocating in this matter of urgency specifically that we pre-empt by action all the work of that Select Committee, as if it were nought. The motion specifically calls for Commonwealth legislation, not for anything else. It is prescriptive even to the fact that the Government should intervene by passing a law, by making an Act of Parliament to achieve our goals. First of all it may not be necessary for the Commonwealth to exercise its legislative responsibilities by passing further legislation. It may be that within the existing legislation we can respond in every appropriate way. There was nothing in Senator Chipp's presentation to justify in any way why he thought it necessary to prescribe that we should introduce and pass further legislation. Perhaps that is just one of those small details which was not picked up in the drafting of the matter of urgency. Senator Chipp says specifically that we should pass legislation but we have not heard why that is necessary. If we proceeded to pass legislation then it would have implications not only for Tasmania-they are significant implications for Tasmania-and Tasmanians but also for all States and for the citizens of all States. Any Commonwealth law that is passed will have application across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Is Senator Chipp proposing that the Senate, in advance of the report which it is awaiting, should move to dictate terms to every State in Australia as to how it should proceed to conduct the management of its own land and how it should proceed to discharge the duties which are its under the Constitution? I remind Senator Chipp again that he chose to refer to the Government of Tasmania as a petty little government. It remains the Government's view-the Government does not share that description of course-that those closest to the land generally should be those who make the decisions. The proposition that we should, as a matter of choice, proceed to have control from Canberra is not a proposition which finds general acceptance among many Australians, particularly those in the outlying States among whom, of course, I would include Tasmanians. Many people in the outlying States have a distrust of Canberra which sometimes, I confess, is a little xenophobic. They want the control of their land held close to home. </PARA>
<PARA> Our preferred approach is to consult with the State to develop co-operative mechanisms to achieve the goals which we want. I have already set out what those goals are from our policies and commitments to action over a considerable period . Not only do we believe that consultation is the way to go but also consultations are underway. Talks have been planned between the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Ministers to assess the situation. I advise the Senate that talks were set down for next Monday, 20 September. I must also advise the Senate that those talks set down for Monday, 20 September, have had to be deferred. The reason they have had to be deferred is that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) is not able to take part in them because of his illness. The Minister for Communications (Mr Brown) who is standing in for the Attorney-General requires time to confer and to be briefed on this matter before those talks can occur. They will be carried out at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems quite inappropriate for the Commonwealth to be seeking to take heavy- handed unilateral action in advance of those talks, in advance of consultation and in advance of a whole range of activities which are presently underway. Surely consultation is preferable and surely consultation is the way to go. Further, there remains some doubt about the extent of Commonwealth legislative power. That extent is unclear. Senator Chipp alluded to that in the PM program of 17 May when, in response to a question, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament itself would virtually have no power as I understand it. </PARA>
<PARA>I may be corrected on the context, but I think I am quoting the honourable senator correctly. He was suggesting in that PM program that there was some limitation on what the Commonwealth could seek to do by legislative power. </PARA>

My overriding concern comes back to what might be called parliamentary propriety. I put it to the Senate that it is unthinkable that the honourable senator who himself was instrumental in the setting up of a committee to examine one matter should now come to the Senate and prescribe what the committee's conclusions should be ahead of a report by the committee. He has attempted to pre-empt the kinds of actions which are appropriate and which might flow from that report, and to attempt to have the Senate and the Government take a view on what should be done ahead of the kind of information which the Senate wants from the Committee and for which we are waiting. It is our concern that in South West Tasmania this Government preserves and extends the protection of the wilderness and that we proceed with the listing on the World Heritage List. But we do not intend to do it by haste or in the way that is being suggested. While we acknowledge the importance which Senator Chipp places on this matter, we cannot agree to his urgency motion. We do not believe it is appropriate that it be moved at this time. We certainly do not believe that it is appropriate that the Senate should move to a vote on it today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter which Senator Chipp has raised here today is of enormous importance and, I must add, of enormous sensitivity. No one who lives in Tasmania, such as the Tasmanian senators in this place, are in doubt about that. The proposed hydro-electric scheme in the Franklin region in Tasmania is a matter which has divided the Tasmanian society, it has divided Tasmania's political parties and, in fact, it divides our parties nationally. The proposal which has been introduced into the Senate today as a matter of urgency is very serious. We treat it as a very serious matter and we accept that Senator Chipp and his colleagues have very strong views on it, although I might point out that during the last elections in Tasmania indeed there was a Democrat candidate who proclaimed himself in favour of the flooding of the Franklin. So it even divides the Democrats, although Senator Chipp and his colleagues would have us believe it divides the Democrats less than other parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing I want to talk about is the manner in which this matter has been brought forward to the Senate today. I do so not personally criticising Senator Chipp. Yesterday afternoon I was certainly notified that we would have a matter of public importance on the Franklin River and the proposed power schemes before the Senate for debate today. We in the Australian Labor Party accept that this was a reasonable thing to debate, that it was a reasonable thing for the Senate to discuss as a matter of public importance. It was at 10 o'clock this morning, although I suppose I could have found out earlier if someone had caught me up, that I became aware that this was in fact an urgency motion expressing a specific proposal; asking the Federal Government to fulfil legislative responsibilities in relation to the Franklin and Gordon river schemes, to prevent the Tasmanian Government proceeding and to provide compensation concerning any development opportunities which may be made available there. </PARA>
<PARA> The time for urgency debates in this place is, as Senator Chipp said, two hours . We have a speakers list which, if the usual speaking times prevail, will involve speeches by two members of the Australian Democrats, one member of the Australian Labor Party and three or four Government members. I suggest to Senator Chipp that that is not a full debate and that a motion which comes up on a very serious proposal only today which results in this sort of debate will not provide adequate coverage for those who want to speak on this subject. In fact, I believe I am the only Tasmanian senator who is on the speakers list at the moment. I am sure that every Tasmanian senator wants to speak. This just cannot be done in two hours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It cannot be done in two hours, I suggest. It certainly cannot be done in light of the honourable senator's speech. He pointed out clearly that he believes there should be firm legislative action taken now. But, with due respect, it was, I think, a bit light on for details of how that action should be taken. I will take up now a point raised by Senator Baume. On 23 September, 1981 the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania was established to examine the whole problem of what should be done in relation to the Franklin and Gordon rivers systems in Tasmania. I point out that it was a motion moved by Senator Macklin on behalf of Senator Chipp. In fact the terms of reference were amended by a motion moved by me. The Committee has yet to report, although I understand that it will be able to report soon. I refer the Senate to what Senator Mason, the then acting leader of the Australian Democrats, said about that committee on 23 September 1981. I quote from page 925 of the Hansard of that date. Senator Mason said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We hope that it--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>will be a vehicle for tapping into and marshalling the many points of view which should come forward in an investigation of this matter. It is designed to be of assistance in practical ways to the people of Tasmania and the Government of Tasmania not only to allow reasonable points of view to be expressed but also to help in financial terms. I refer again to the second of the terms of reference we propose in our motion. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . federal responsibility in assisting Tasmania to preserve its wilderness areas of national and international importance, including appropriate financial assistance;</PARA>
<PARA>He went on later to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The question of how this assistance might be provided to Tasmania ought to be one of the major preoccupations of the select committee. If it can establish that principle that there should be some assistance and then seek out practical ways in which the Tasmanian people and the Tasmanian Government can be supported , it will be very worth while. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Coates, at the time when that motion was being discussed, expressed some caution and some worries about the establishment of such a committee. He said at the time that it may be viewed with some suspicion by the Tasmanian electorate, as being the means whereby the decision-making process was taken out of their hands. He expressed some concern that it may have resulted in a delayed decision on this matter. But the motion to set up the Committee was a motion of the Australian Democrats, specifically a motion by Senator Chipp. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a Senate committee. It is in the process of conducting an extensive hearing, getting evidence from a wide variety of sources about the very problems which have arisen in consideration of this problem. I understand it is to report before long. If it is not to do so, I suggest that the Senate should take some action to hurry up that report, if that is needed. I suggest that the members of the Committee, including Senator Chipp, should do so. But the simple fact of the matter is that this matter is before a Senate select committee. I point out to the Senate that what this urgency motion does, at very short notice, is to ask the Senate this afternoon, within two hours of debate-I suggest a limited debate on such an important matter-to pre-empt the results of the hearings of this Committee. I suggest to the Senate that that is just not on and that is not a proper way for us to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator has been considering it for seven years, I suggest he should not have set up that Committee. If he had made up his mind at the time, I suggest he should question whether he should be on the Committee. If he has been considering the matter for seven years, I suggest that he should give the rest of us more than a few hours notice that he intends to bring up a very serious proposal such as this, a proposal which should have a very serious impact on the Government and on the people. No one on this side of the House is suggesting that we gag this debate. I believe that a debate on this important issue should go on as long as people want to speak on it. But the practicalities are that if we want to do that then we should present it as a notice of motion and have the debate at the proper time, not debate it as an urgency motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said at the start of my speech, this is a difficult issue. It is an extremely difficult issue for anyone who comes from Tasmania. The parties themselves are divided on the issue. In recent weeks we have had the Young Liberals again coming out very firmly against any proposal to establish any dam in the south-west of Tasmania. As Senator Chipp said, the national conference decision of the Federal Australian Labor Party was that it would prefer no dams in south-west Tasmania but that proper assistance be given to Tasmania if that occurred. None of the proposals, including the proposals of the Australian Democrats, has any real detail as yet. Nothing that Senator Chipp has said today has any real detail as to what form that assistance would be and what sorts of alternatives we can present to the people who will be employed and, therefore, concerned in the development of this dam. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand Senator Chipp wanting some clarification of the issue by debate in the Senate in view of the confusing remarks we have had in recent times from the Government and government representatives. Mr Malcolm Fraser as far back as 1975 when he became the Leader of the Liberal Party said that he supported the policy proposals on Tasmania of the previous Leader, then Mr Snedden. He made it quite clear and quite specific at the time in a telegram to Senator Peter Rae that he supported the commitment to the Tasmanian policies announced by Mr Snedden. These included the protection of South West Tasmania and the preservation of the South West wilderness area. He went on to say that any subsidy required to make the cost of generating alternative electricity in Tasmania should be made available to the Tasmanian Government, that it should be part of Liberal Party policy and would remain part of Liberal Party policy. In recent times we have had no such certainty from the Liberal Party. We have had no such certainty largely because of the varying decisions and statements of senior people in the Liberal Party. The Canberra Times of 23 August this year stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman has said the Federal Liberal Party supports the controversial intention of the Tasmanian Government to dam the Franklin River for hydro-electricity. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hodgman, has stated in a letter he would be ''less than honest'' if he ''did not refer to the fact that the Liberal Party does support the Lower Gordon power scheme''. </PARA>
<PARA>One can certainly say, from the remarks made by Senator Peter Rae and Senator Missen in this place, that Mr Hodgman is not referring to every member of the Federal Liberal Party in the Federal Parliament. From the statements of the Minister for Education, Senator Peter Baume, I believe we are not quite clear even now about just where the Federal Liberal Party stands. We are certainly not clear from the many and varied responses of the Prime Minister in recent times. It was reported in the West Australian of 15 April this year that when speaking on an Australian Broadcasting Commission phone-in program in Western Australia the Prime Minister said that the decision on whether or not to build a hydro- electric dam in South West Tasmania was a matter for the Tasmanian Government and the Tasmanian Liberal Party. Perhaps he felt that that was the best thing to say in Western Australia. Perhaps he thought that he would not be reported or that it would not be noted in the eastern States. A little earlier than that we found out that according to Mr Gray, who is now the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Malcolm Fraser had promised him that the Federal Government would provide the finance for the construction of the dam. Yet a few weeks later on a talk back program in Victoria Mr Malcolm Fraser expressed some doubts as to whether the Federal Liberal Government would support the State Liberal Government in financing this dam. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that there is great confusion about the Federal Government's attitude and about what powers are available for a Federal government to intervene in this area, there needs to be further debate; but more than that there needs to be presented to this place the report of the Committee of which Senator Chipp is a member, the Committee which is asked and charged by this Senate to consider all the proposals and more that are in Senator Chipp's urgency motion. For us to come in here after a couple of hour's notice, to make up our minds after a truncated debate and to vote for a motion such as this which gives a firm direction to the Government I suggest is unreasonable. I hope that we continue the debate. I hope we continue to debate for much longer this serious issue and this serious economic problem for Tasmania. But I hope that we do it in a sensible way and not through the vehicle of a hurried urgency motion in the chamber on a Wednesday afternoon for what I suspect to be largely political purposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This discussion today is about protecting a wilderness area. It is worth remembering how a wilderness area is defined. A wilderness area is one which is uninhabited, not cultivated or mined and free from permanent man-made works. Recognition that wilderness areas are something special and worthy of protection is gaining acceptance not only in Australia but around the world. It is urgent that wilderness areas should be protected because , with current trends, in a few years time there will be little wilderness area left of ecological, scientific or cultural importance. The South West Tasmania area is one of only three substantial temperate wilderness areas remaining in the world. For the information of honourable senators the other two are fjordland in the South Island of New Zealand and southern Chile. The trouble is that the South West Tasmania wilderness area is rapidly shrinking. Some say that it has been reduced by half in the last 20 years by the intrusion of other activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt at all that South West Tasmania is an area of unsurpassed beauty and that it needs to be protected. The Federal Government has taken an important step in this respect by offering to place it on the World Heritage List. I am sure that when the committee considers it in November it will be placed on that list because it is one of the few areas of its quality left in the world. One difficulty is that Australia has limited experience in managing major wilderness areas. South West Tasmania used to be protected by its difficulty of access and remoteness. That protection is no longer sufficient. Tighter controls are now urgent. A plan for its management is definitely needed. A typical management plan for a wilderness area would divide it up into a core area in which activities were strictly controlled and to which access was deliberately limited; a wilderness zone, which acts as a buffer for the core area, would be reserved for hiking with access only by walking tracks; and a third zone-a tourist and other activities zone-adjacent to the core and wilderness zone boundaries would provide for intensive recreation and additional buffer areas. With regard to the South West Tasmania wilderness area, a broad management plan on those lines was suggested by the report of the South West Tasmania Resources Survey. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no dispute that the proposed developments of the Hydro-Electric Commission obviously affect the wilderness area of South West Tasmania. Recognising that this wilderness area represents a quarter of the land mass of Tasmania, we must look at this decision or desire by the Tasmanian Government and the Hydro-Electric Commission to generate power in this area. Can it be justified? We must address ourselves to three questions: Firstly, what are the non-power advantages of developing this area in the way suggested? Obviously it would damage part of the wilderness area, but there are compensating advantages that must be weighed in the balance such as tourism and the availability of access to a wider community. Those factors must be offset against any possible damage to the wilderness area. The second question to which we must address our minds is this: How much damage would actually be done to the wilderness area. Can it survive as a viable and useful wilderness area if these hydro-electric developments go on there? This is a matter we must look at and I hope that the Committee, as has been mentioned already, will do so. However, I must say that my own opinion is that I do not think the two can possibly be combined. The third question to which we must address our minds is: Does Tasmania really need additional electric power generating capacity?</PARA>
<PARA> These are all very complex issues and, as Senator Grimes said, they are very emotional questions in Tasmania. Because of the complexity and the emotional difficulties, on the motion of the Australian Democrats last September, just a year ago, we set up a Senate select committee to study these very matters. I understand that the Committee is due to report next month. The terms of reference of the Committee are worth thinking about. The Committee was charged to investigate:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The natural values of South West Tasmania to Australia and the world; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Federal responsibility in assisting Tasmania to preserve its wilderness areas of national and international importance, including appropriate financial assistance consistent with the State's development needs and options for the State's energy requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Peter Baume pointed out on behalf of the Government, this Committee has been sitting for a year. It has been within its power to report at any time with an interim report if necessary. Senator Chipp is a member of the Committee and I hope that, in view of his expressed urgency of this matter, he will press for the Committee to report promptly. I hope it will. I have been told that it will report next month. But the matters that are-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope it will be reporting next month. I now turn to the question of the power needs of Tasmania which are one of the key issues involved . The Hydro-Electric Commission's projections for the power needs of Tasmania have been disputed. Whether there really is a need for more power by 1990 has been questioned. Of course, one cannot without a great deal more information, which I hope the Select Committee is getting, possibly answer that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw attention to something that has happened in my own State of Victoria. Some years ago, people motivated by some of the same considerations questioned the power projection needs of Victoria and managed, among other things, to have the capacity of the power plant at Newport reduced from 1,000 megawatts to 500 megawatts. They were totally wrong and we would very much like those additional 500 megawatts right now. I am suspicious-not very suspicious but slightly suspicious-of people who denigrate the projections of power needs for the community. Anyway, the Senate Select Committee is investigating this very matter and it will, with deference to Senator Chipp, report soon, I hope. I have just been passed a Press release-and Senator Chipp as a member of the Committee might be interested-which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is working towards tabling its first report on demand and supply options in the Senate in September. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is this month and I hope the Committee will be able to meet that objective. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. If it is accepted-and we cannot really judge until we have the report-that Tasmania does need the additional power and the development of the wilderness area to provide that power is unacceptable, what alternatives are there for Tasmania? We have to remember that we are talking about only 180 megawatts which means a very small power plant indeed. I think the size of the power plant rules out what to me is the most attractive option to Tasmanians- that is, the use of a nuclear power plant which is certainly the safest, the cheapest and the least polluting way to generate the power. Unfortunately, nuclear power plants are not economic below about 500 megawatts. I think the 180 megawatts required by the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission or the Tasmanian Government would not make that proposal such an economic option.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another alternative is coal. Tasmania has extensive and largely untapped coal reserves but the mining of them is likely to be very expensive. Also I understand that they have a high ash and sulphur content. If these coal fields prove suitable, they might be sufficient not only for Tasmania's industrial needs and the conversion of Bell Bay oil-fired power station but also for another 200 megawatt coal-fired thermal station. But this is an option so far quite unproven. The Tasmanians have another problem. If they get into coal-fired generating stations, I think inevitably they will start to have industrial problems. One of the great attractions to the Hydro-Electric Commission is that it has to deal with only one trade union and the industry has been dispute-free. I think it would be very reluctant to take up an option that might involve it in substantial industrial disputes. Of course, I think all honourable senators know that power generated from oil or coal pollutes the atmosphere with large quantities of carbon dioxide which, of course, a hydro-electric scheme does not do. </PARA>
<PARA> Another option Tasmania must consider is the use of natural gas from Bass Strait. Victoria uses a 500 megawatt gas fired power station in Melbourne at the moment and that could be an option that might be attractive to Tasmania. Finally , there is the option of being connected to a national grid. This might be attractive but it will be a high cost option and it certainly would be using unproved technology. For all these reasons-and I touch only briefly on them-it is surely sensible for this Senate to wait for the report from the Committee which it has set up for this purpose, before it tries to come to any resolution on any of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp in the motion we are considering calls for immediate action and for the Federal Government to exercise its legislative responsibilities. He justifies this in part by saying that it is a national issue. It may be a national issue but that does not necessarily give us the power to do anything about it because we are bound by our Constitution and the protection of the environment and the generation of power are State responsibilities. In Tasmania in particular, judging by the result of the last election, both the Government and the Opposition were in favour of power generation by a hydro scheme. It may be-and Senator Chipp quoted one legal opinion on this matter; others have other views-that it is possible we could use our external affairs power to impose a solution on Tasmania. It could possibly be done, as Senator Chipp suggested, under the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation Convention for the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage. I think that would be thin grounds. I think we will have stronger grounds if and when this matter gets put on the World Heritage List. That should be done this November. At the moment I think we have to say that our powers are doubtful but that they will be much stronger after November. </PARA>

The alternative which has been urged on me by a number of people concerned about this problem is the use of our financial power. I think I should make quite clear that we have no power over the use of loan funds . The Loan Council, the decisions of which are binding on the Federal Government , has freed electricity authorities from any form of restriction on the raising of loans. That is an area in which we do not have control. I suppose we could use our section 96 power and direct that tax reimbursement funds be used in particular ways. But this would be a very serious precedent. I think that before we even consider such a draconian solution, we should wait for the report of the Senate Select Committee that we set up to study this matter on our behalf.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with great enthusiasm to support my leader, Senator Chipp, and the proposition of this motion, which seeks some action to protect the wilderness area of South West Tasmania before it is too late. I stress and emphasise the words 'before it is too late'. The point is that while the matter is being discussed-I agree that it is being reasonably discussed and debated-the Hydro-Electric Commission in Tasmania is not sitting in a state of suspended animation but is taking the opportunity to start the work of despoiling that wilderness area. That despoiling is being carried out and it cannot be cancelled or repaired by any later decisions that might be taken. This summer will see that work well under way. The Liberal Government in Tasmania has revoked the scenic park status, and therefore any protection provided by that status, for enough land around the Franklin and Gordon rivers to build access roads to begin construction. The Hydro-Electric Commission in Tasmania told the Tasmanian Parliament that it would build a small access road with minimal disruption to the environment. When it was told that it could do so , it went ahead and built a very large road, as we have photographs to indicate. It put up a campsite and burned off a large patch of bush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is only the beginning. This is what has happened already. A great deal of damage has been done to the South West Tasmania wilderness area and more is being done with every day that passes. I know very well that the whole question of the absolute preservation of the wilderness area of South West Tasmania for the world and for posterity is one of great concern to very large numbers of Australians; every day more and more become concerned about it. Very large meetings are being held in every capital city of Australia. Most of them are bigger than political meetings of any kind that have been held for some time. Every time those meetings are held larger numbers of people attend. It is a matter of concern to a very large number of Australians, particularly that special class of Australians, the Tasmanians themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt whatsoever that a substantial minority, if not the majority, of Tasmanian people now do not want a dam there. They want the wilderness area of South West Tasmania preserved. I would have thought that by now any government in Tasmania would have had the wit and sense to understand that that is the feeling of those people. At the very least, because of that feeling of so many Tasmanians, there is a very good case for the work to be delayed and deferred. Can it be delayed or deferred? I understand that there is public evidence to the Select Committee on South West Tasmania, so I am not speaking out of turn, from the Department of National Development and Energy that there is no reason in the world for that dam even to be considered before at least 1985. There is no urgency about this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was public evidence to the Committee. Senator Baume can read it for himself. It might do him some good to see it and then he will understand. The Australian Democrats are acting today in a spirit of emergency, almost a spirit of desperation, because of our fear that any decisions taken by the Commonwealth Government will be too tardy, too late. So often that happens with government, for the very best of reasons, but it does not put Humpty Dumpty back together again, does it? Our fear is that by the time all the words have been said, all the decisions have been made and all the deliberations finished, it will be too late to avert what we see as a disaster for Tasmania, a disaster for Australia and a disaster for the world. As all honourable senators know, that is not just my opinion; it is the opinion of very many Australians, of very large public interest groups throughout the length and breadth of this land, and of the State of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I listened very carefully to Senator Baume, Senator Grimes and Senator Hamer, who pointed to what they see as pre-empting the Senate Committee of which Senator Chipp is a member and which, of course, was set up at the instigation of the Australian Democrats. In this motion we seek-this point has to be made clear ; I have tried to make it already-to buy time to inject into the Commonwealth Government a feeling of urgency about the activities in this area, a feeling which the majority of Australian people already feel. The Australian people want action on this matter and, with the greatest respect to the Senate and to the Committee, I suggest that the fact that a large number of Australians want action on it shows that it might be something of importance and something that this chamber should take some account of. Yet those three speakers tended to make the point that somehow the activities of the Senate are more important than what the public might think. I may have misjudged them and perhaps a later speaker can address himself to that. With the greatest of seriousness, I put the point that we have a responsibility to the people who elected us here which transcends our responsibility to certain other things. It is 12 months since the Senate Select Committee was formed. I do not want to criticise this Committee. I have no intention of doing so and I have no basis for justification for doing so . But it must be said publicly that it is seven years since this matter was first considered and no decision has been reached. </PARA>
<PARA> To go back to the Committee, it was hoped that it would report last March. It has been said in debate recently that it may report in September. It may do so. Committees have said that they will report at a certain time and for the best of reasons have found that they were not able to. That may be the case here. Some fresh evidence may come up or another witness or some other matter may have to be taken account of. I do not see how anybody can say at this stage that that Committee can guarantee to report in September, but perhaps it will. I repeat that I have no criticism of that Committee-far from it-but we have a problem not only with this Committee but with a number of committees of this overworked House, the Senate. It is overworked because of the great surge of committee work it has taken on in recent years. One could almost describe it as a kind of log jam. No one will solve that problem easily. No blame can be laid in this place- far from it. I know that honourable senators have given a great deal of their time outside the normal requirements to work on committees and those committees are doing useful work. However, with respect to the committees and procedures of the Senate, great issues do not stand still in a state of suspended animation while we deliberate. For that reason the Australian Democrats see a necessity and urgency for this matter to be raised now. It is not raised in any small pious hope way and not as a debate that has no conclusion. It is raised as a debate which expresses a conscious opinion of this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree with Senator Grimes that this in any way inhibits further discussion of the matter. Of course it does not. It does not inhibit a further debate on the matter. It may even encourage it because a bit of urgency is put into it. In no way do we seek to inhibit that kind of debate. At this stage all we are saying is that the work has started and is going on; the damage is being done. For heaven's sake let us do something about it now. I cannot believe that that is an unreasonable point of view. If anybody perverts it to be an unreasonable point of view I will cast their views and mine to the judgment of the Australian people and see who they think is right on the matter of whether this place should consider the fate of South West Tasmania. It is one of the noteworthy parts of the world which is sought to be preserved not only by Australians but also by brilliant academics from all parts of the world who have spent their money taking out full page advertisements in Australian newspapers saying: 'For heaven's sake, whatever you do, do not destroy this'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a matter of urgency, a matter of morality and a matter of reasonable major public demand for action by this Parliament. It is something which any of us here would scorn at our peril. I greatly urge that we should not take that course of action. Because of that I suggest that we should go ahead with the course of action that Senator Chipp has proposed. It is a reasonable point of view. It does not pre-empt the Committee's work and it does not pre-empt any further discussion of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak briefly on two aspects of the Gordon-below-Franklin dam. I refer, firstly, to the economics of hydro-electric power in Tasmania and, secondly, to the alternatives which exist to the use of hydro-electric power in that State. The capital cost of the proposed scheme is estimated by the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission to be $458m-almost half a billion dollars-to generate 180 megawatts of power. That in itself is an appallingly high figure. We are all aware of the effects of inflation, interest rates and unexpected escalations in prices on the eventual cost of things. It is almost certain that this one will cost a great deal more than that half a billion dollars bill. Indeed, if cost overruns are comparable to those already incurred in the Pieman scheme, which is a similar hydro-electric scheme in Tasmania, the project will increase to some three-quarters of a billion dollars, without taking into consideration high interest rates and inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Where would this massive sum come from? Most of it would come from the pockets of all Australian taxpayers. In 1981-82 the Federal Government allocated $469m to the State electricity authorities. This amounted to an average of $31 per head of population for the mainland States but, I emphasise, $81 per head of population for Tasmania. If this dam is to be financed by the people of Australia, as it will if it goes ahead, I for one, object most strongly to my taxes being used to destroy an irreplaceable Australian asset, and I know that many hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of Australians share that view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also clear from those figures that the adequate and reasonable compensation referred to in the Australian Democrats motion could easily be found from the funds that the Federal Government would no longer have to provide to the Tasmanian Government for the dam if indeed it were not built. But if the dam is built, what justification is there for this huge capital expenditure? The electricity is not sold for profit. Indeed, the 13 bulk users of electricity in Tasmania, who between them use about two-thirds of the State's electricity, are very heavily subsidised, for no apparent reason. They pay about one cent per kilowatt hour whereas residential users pay about 3c and commercial users about 5c. However, this does not make up the whole subsidy. The rest is obtained, of course, through the Premiers Conference and the Loan Council. Even now, I find myself, as do millions of other Australians, subsidising multinational companies to allow them to produce aluminium in Tasmania while employing only 7 per cent of the Tasmanian work force. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the alternatives? There are several possibilities, if indeed more power is needed in Tasmania, and I doubt that that will be the long term situation. The most obvious answer is a coal-fired thermal station which could be built for about half the cost of the hydro-electric scheme. Coal for it could be obtained from within Tasmania and also from the mainland. Continuous employment in a thermal station is much higher than that in a hydro-electric station and the production cost of electricity would be almost certainly lower. So, on that basis, there is certainly no economic justification for what is proposed. Wind power, which is already being used in the megawatt range in many parts of the world, could provide another alternative to the dam scheme. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation itself has estimated that 90 electricity-generating windmills, each of two megawatt capacity, such as are now being built all over the world, could be built in the pasture lands of north west Tasmania and would provide the same amount of electricity as the proposed dam. There would be no pollution or use of renewable resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor that must be taken into account is a possible decrease in demand in Tasmania for electricity. The aluminium market is now dwindling. It is not growing at anywhere near the rate projected by the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission when it proposed the dam. That is something for which it must answer. Beside this, consideration must be given to new processes such as that being developed by Mitsui in Japan, which will be ready to go in ten years' time, when the dam is proposed to be completed. That would mean that there would be virtually no requirement at all for aluminium. Unlike the Bayer process, it is a smelting process and does not use much electric power at all. The final point that I want to make is that more electricity per head of population is used in Tasmania than is used anywhere else in the world with the single exception of Norway. That is not due to the fact that the people of Tasmania are wasteful or profligate in the use of electricity but because of the battening on that State of a large number of multinational organisations which, frankly, are exploiting it increasingly with every day that passes. Surely this suggests that the problem in Tasmania is not lack of electricity but inefficient management of the energy resources which exist there. Tasmania's most pressing need is certainly not a massive, expensive, hydro-electric scheme which is designed to destroy vast tracts of our most beautiful and irreplaceable heritage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in the debate on this urgency motion because, in common with every other Australian, I happen to be interested in the environment, which is an important subject for debate. However, it is a matter of disappointment to me that Senator Chipp has proposed this motion at a time when the Senate has not had the benefit of a report from the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania that the Australian Democrats were successful in establishing to deal with this problem. I remember that when we were discussing the question of forming the select committee, Senator Mason said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just because the Australian Democrats have moved for the establishment of a Senate select committee, such a committee would by no means be the property of the Australian Democrats. We hope that it will be a vehicle for tapping into and marshalling the many points of view which should come forward in an investigation of this matter. It is designed to be of assistance in practical ways to the people of Tasmania and the Government of Tasmania not only to allow reasonable points of view to be expressed but also to help in financial terms. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that statement. I believe that was a very sensible statement. It is a matter of regret that the Australian Democrats have chosen to deal with the matter prematurely, when the Senate has not before it recommendations that would have been tabled following the examination of a great deal of evidence on the subject. That makes me wonder whether Senator Chipp really understands the committee system of the Senate. Perhaps he spent too much time in the House of Representatives and does not understand how the Senate works. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Australian Democrats perhaps do not appreciate the volume of committee work that is undertaken by the Senate, although I must say that Senator Mason did say that the Senate was overworked because of the great upsurge of committee work that had been undertaken in recent years. Despite that , the Australian Democrats seem to come forward with monotonous regularity with proposals to establish select committees to deal with this, that and the other subject. I believe that that has happened in regard to some seven select committees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They may be necessary, but we have a committee structure that can deal with them quite effectively without overstraining the human resources of the Senate. One aspect that worries me is that we are tending to disregard the work load that is placed upon the shoulders of honourable senators and, equally importantly of course, the secretariats that serve those committees. I repeat, it is a matter of regret that we are now dealing with a subject without having the benefit of substantial facts that could be put before us by the select committee to which I have referred. I understand that a progress report is imminent, that indeed within the next few weeks the chairman of that committee will be presenting such a report to this chamber. I feel that I could debate the question much more intelligently if I had the benefit of the deliberations of that committee before me. Senator Chipp has also referred to the fact that he is a member of that Select Committee. I wonder what would happen if every other member of that Committee chose to take action with respect to this subject independently of the Committee. That could weaken quite effectively the impact of the report that we are looking forward to examining. One of the golden rules of the Senate's committee system is that public statements concerning the operation of a committee during an inquiry are left in the hands of the Chairman. The fact that Senator Chipp has launched this matter before the Senate today could detract considerably from the value of the Committee's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has stated-I think Senator Peter Baume made it quite clear-that land use and the preservation of natural wilderness areas is largely a matter that falls within State jurisdiction. The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment has recognised the importance of land use policy and is currently pursuing that course in order to provide guidelines to the States concerning the direction that should be taken in the preservation of natural forests and areas such as we are discussing under this urgency motion. Extreme sensitivity was displayed when I wrote to the Premiers of the various States to suggest that the Committee would like to have submissions from the State departments concerned with land use. I had to write to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory on two occasions. Although he was opposed to the idea of the Committee moving into what would appear to be entirely a State jurisdiction, in my second approach I explained to him that it might be of some use to the Northern Territory in regard to encouraging the Commonwealth Government to provide additional finance for certain projects that deal with appropriate land use management programs. I am glad to say that Mr Everingham responded to that and he is now giving considerable support in this matter, particularly on the constitutional side, which I think will be a quite important part of the Committee's report when it is eventually presented to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I had a little bother with the Premier of Queensland. Despite my cajoling and suggestions that the States House is not an entirely biased institution and that it has regard to the welfare of the States, he chose to resist the proposition as far as Queensland was concerned. All the other States have come forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we would not quarrel with that. The Committee will look at Queensland in any case because we think there are areas in Queensland that should come under attention, perhaps with the object of providing the Queensland Government with further encouragement in some way or another. I hope that what the Committee says will be of help to the Queensland Government. Certainly the other States have been co-operative in every way and some very interesting submissions have come from their departments. The State Government of Tasmania is co-operating as well. I have no doubt that the Committee will be anxious to receive the report of the Select Committee on South West Tasmania on the Franklin and Gordon rivers. That will be of great assistance to our Committee. I have no doubt that when the report is presented in its full context it will form part of the material under consideration in regard to the overall reference of land use planning that my Committee is dealing with at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate what the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) said earlier in the debate; that is, it should be re-emphasised that the Liberal and National Country Parties have had a long-standing interest in South West Tasmania. The policy statement of 1975 recognised its national importance. The Federal Government has given an assurance that it will assist the Tasmanian Government in establishing a national park of world significance in that part of Tasmania. Such a park would include a substantial wilderness area. The Minister also said that negotiations and consultations have been continuing for a long time. He mentioned that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in Cairns in 1980 said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have recently advised the Tasmanian Government of the Commonwealth's willingness to provide further practical assistance should the Tasmanian Government decide to proceed with the establishment of a national park. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister also indicated that consultations are continuing, to the extent that it was planned to have further discussions on Monday on this particular subject. That has had to be postponed because the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N. A. Brown) has to be briefed thoroughly on the important question that will be discussed in the very near future. I do not think the Minister was able to say when that meeting will take place but I imagine it will take place within the next few days, or perhaps within a couple of weeks. </PARA>

I believe that the whole question of the preservation of our environment is important. I would like to see any project of this character carried out with great care, with great regard for the public interest and the need for everything to be done to preserve as much as possible of the environment that we hold dear to us.

That is because, for instance, members of the Committee have information which is perhaps not publicly available. Therefore, one must be careful to keep in one's mind what is publicly known and what has to be kept under one's hat because it is still privileged information. Perhaps a member of the Committee is able to assess the progress of the Committee's thinking, and one must be careful not to give that away. One particularly needs to avoid pre-empting the Committee's conclusions or , on the other hand, repudiating them in advance, knowing what those conclusions might be. In particular, members of the Committee need to show an open mind about the issue and the evidence which has come and which is yet to come and, in addition, they need to be seen to have an open mind about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp is relying on my inability under the Standing Orders to talk about the Committee and about my role on it and his role on it. But let it be seen that the publicly announced position of the Committee is that its first task was to look at demand and supply in the electricity system in Tasmania. The Committee did not say that it must save the Franklin come what may , much as some of us might wish that that happened. The Committee said that it must do its task in an ordered fashion. But it is very difficult to debate this matter as a member of the Committee with both the Standing Orders and the moral obligations that are placed upon one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think, however, that one can refer specifically to the opinion of the Attorney-General's Department, which has been mentioned by Senator Chipp. Senator Chipp mentioned that many legal opinions have been floating around. Apparently, from newspaper reports, the Government has been supplied with an opinion from the Attorney-General's Department. That was leaked to the Age and published about a week or 10 days ago. The Committee ought to have the benefit of that legal advice. But it is a bit much to ask the Senate to vote on a legal opinion which it has not seen. At least one ought to give a few days for that opinion to appear. I would be the first to agree that, in the absence of the Government supplying it formally, we should call it to the barricade as if that was the opinion and let us see whether it can be substantiated. But we must give that a chance to happen. Those of us on the Committee, myself included, have our views and personal prejudices.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Senate has been ambushed by the Australian Democrats with a matter which has been brought forward only with notice from this morning; no notice of motion was given yesterday or last week. It is an ambush which has taken by surprise the Select Committee of this Senate that is inquiring into the matter of South West Tasmania. It has taken the Commonwealth Government by surprise. It is now being thrust upon us with all kinds of threats and innuendo from the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Chipp). Senators in this chamber, after a brief and hasty debate of only two hours, are to make a decision and take a vote as to whether or not we should pre-empt the people of Tasmania and the Government of Tasmania-a worthy State government in this nation but one which the Democrats have described as a petty little government-in the decisions that they are making about energy supplies in that State and the best management of the resources in the wilderness area in South West Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the issue did not begin with this ambush earlier today and will not end with this brief debate in the Senate. It began some seven years ago when the energy priorities of Tasmania showed that there would be a shortfall in the supply of electricity and as the steps were taken to research the best options for supplying the shortfall. Over the last 12 months that issue developed into a major matter of debate in Tasmania, especially in the Parliament. It is now a matter of history that the Tasmanian Parliament was virtually unworkable because of the deadlock between the Houses and because of the differences of opinion between the parties. To resolve that deadlock, or in an attempt to resolve it, in December last year a referendum was put before the people of Tasmania. The referendum offered a choice between a big dam, a small dam and even if not explicitly, no dams at all. At least, that is how the people of Tasmania perceived that referendum because some wrote that third option on their ballot papers. They did not accept just the two options that the Australian Labor Party Government of Tasmania had determined would be put before the people of Tasmania . </PARA>
<PARA> It is now common knowledge that the referendum had three blocks of support. A fourth block can also be discerned-that of persons who were genuine informal voters. What was the result? It can be interpreted in various ways, but a number of journalists and other commentators have written about the result of the referendum held in December last year as being a 55 per cent vote for the large dam proposal, a 32 per cent vote for the no dams proposal and a 10 per cent vote for the small dam proposal. In addition, 3 per cent genuinely voted informal. Putting those figures together, a majority of Tasmanians, almost two-thirds, wanted a dam built in this region. </PARA>

Clearly, the majority of Tasmanians supported the building of a dam in the Tasmanian wilderness area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That was followed by further impasses in the Tasmanian Parliament. Indeed, this issue principally brought about the fall of the Tasmanian Government. The Labor Party Government was tossed out because it lost the confidence of the Tasmanian Parliament. In the election that ensued in May this year, the Liberal Party of Australia was returned to office overwhelmingly, with 48 per cent of the vote and with a clear, explicit proposal in this crucial issue that was before the people. That proposal was to build a large dam in the Franklin River area. Only 38 per cent voted for the Labor Party, which had advocated the small dam proposal. What was the vote for the Australian Democrats in the State elections in Tasmania? What support was there from the people of Tasmania for the Democrats who at that stage already had waxed loudly along the lines of their motion here today?

<PARA> The ambush of the Senate by the Democrats is an attempt to pre-empt the tabling of that report in a genuine way, so that it can be acted upon by the Senate.

They want to neglect one of the instruments of this chamber.

<PARA>Senator Chipp has not explained the contradiction between his ambush here today and the statement that he made so clearly in May this year. Does the Senate expect the Democrats to adopt a principle one month and then to reject it another month? Where is the consistency in the Democrats' position? What are we to believe is the Democrats' policy? As is now well known, they have adopted various positions only to say: 'Despite the views that were expressed then, this is another time and another place and we now categorically reverse our views'. I do not believe that, with that kind of precedent in the Democrats' approach, their ambush today should in any way be successful. We should see the conclusion of the Senate Committee inquiry when its report is brought to this chamber. Also , we should not neglect the commitments of the Commonwealth Government which already have been outlined by Senator Peter Baume and Senator Hamer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The commitments of the Federal Government have been outlined also by Senator Jessop. They outlined the Prime Minister's commitment on behalf of the Federal Government and on behalf of the Liberal Party to recognition of wilderness areas in Australia. Indeed, the Prime Minister has gone on to make sure that the Government has listed on the World Heritage List the Great Barrier Reef, the Kakadu National Park and the Willandra Lakes region and has nominated, at the request of the Tasmanian Government, part of South West Tasmania for inclusion in the World Heritage List. The Commonwealth Government has clearly committed itself to assisting the Tasmanian Government to establish a national park of world significance in the south-west and has backed it up by providing $ 350,000 towards the Tasmanian resources survey. This area has been listed by the Commonwealth in the National Estate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These commitments of the Commonwealth have been referred to in answers to questions in the other place by the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Mr McVeigh, and by Senator Peter Baume in answers to questions in this chamber. Those commitments of the Commonwealth Government are clear. On that basis the Commonwealth Government has been negotiating with the Tasmanian Government about the outcome of the demands involved in this issue. As Senator Peter Baume has already indicated, these matters were to have been discussed directly by the responsible Ministers of the Commonwealth and Tasmania next Monday but because of unfortunate circumstances-the illness of the Attorney-General-the discussions have been put off for some days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under Standing Order 448, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Chipp moving a motion that a vote be taken forthwith on the urgency motion. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not detain the Senate long. I agree with every honourable senator who has spoken in this debate-I admired the speech of Senator Coates-that ideally it would have been better had the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania reported before a vote on this issue was taken. I am conscious, in speaking to Standing Order 448, that I cannot speak to the substantive motion. I have to talk about why it is urgent that a vote be taken on this matter. I will address my remarks to that because Senator Peter Baume, as usual, is watching me like a hawk. I will satisfy even Senator Peter Baume on the question of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that the Senate has had only two hours in which to contemplate this matter. The Federal Government ratified an international convention about this matter in 1975, seven years ago. This matter is urgent. That is why I am invoking Standing Order 448. The Federal Liberal Party has had its policy on this matter since 1975. At its conference several months ago the Federal Labor Party decided by an overwhelming majority on this very question of Federal intervention. It is an urgent matter because the wilderness area is being degraded right at this moment. A fire lit by the Hydro-Electric Commission got out of control. The particular area in relation to which I want legislation introduced is being degraded and desecrated by the Hydro-Electric Commission now . I remind the Senate, in terms of the urgency for implementing Standing Order 448, that the Hydro-Electric Commission and the Tasmanian Parliament are not waiting for the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania to report. They are in there now plundering and destroying. </PARA>
<PARA> I assume that if we wait until the Senate Select Committee reports-I brought up this matter of urgency today only after great consideration-we will have to wait until October. That is why the matter is urgent. I am not divulging any secrets by saying that it is unthinkable that the Committee could report in September. Let us assume that it can report in October and let us take into account the slowness with which the wheels of government necessarily turn in this place, irrespective of whether the government is a Labor or Liberal government. The report could not possibly have any impact on a government decision until the Parliament resumes in February or March next year. By February or March next year the Hydro-Electric Commission would have been given its head for five or six months. The question of saving the Franklin River would be totally academic by then. </PARA>

This is a matter of extreme urgency. I submit, with great respect, that even if the Committee could conceivably report in October, the report would have to be debated and then considered by the Government. There is no way in the world that a response could be given before the Parliament resumed in February or March of next year. That would give the Hydro-Electric Commission a clear go at destroying this wilderness area for something like eight months. One thing it is good at is destroying wilderness areas. It does it with a rapidity that makes one hold one's breath.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Senate has not complained about that. It put aside two hours for a debate and the debate has occurred. Honourable senators canvassed the issues during the time allowed. The views expressed in relation to this matter during those two hours are available to the Government. The views of the Senate as expressed today will be available to the Executive Government which has the matter before it now. What is being sought now is a second bite at the apple. The issue before the Senate is not a vote on whether one wishes to agree with Senator Chipp's matter of urgency; it is a procedural matter as to whether we should suspend Standing Orders. Honourable senators should understand that there was ample opportunity during the debate, using established procedures of the Senate without moving to the suspension of Standing Orders, to force a vote on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would not assume that Senator Mason is so ignorant of the Standing Orders of this place as not to know what can be done. He did not seek to have a vote taken during the debate. It could have been done. Even if a vote were taken, even if Standing Orders were set aside, even if we were to proceed to address the motion which has been moved by the Australian Democrats and which has very little support, and even if we were to carry it, the motion would still only have the character of a pious resolution. It is an expression of view. I say to Senator Chipp with the best will in the world that it is the content of the debate and what was said during his speech which is important. What was said in the debate in this chamber will be placed before government. Nothing will be gained now by proceeding to a vote which could have been taken an hour ago but which was not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest to you, Mr President, that one reason-the main reason- I oppose the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders is that I am afraid I am in a position in which I must suspect the motives of the Australian Democrats and in particular Senator Chipp. Until yesterday afternoon, the intention of the Democrats was to move a motion of public importance in this place on technology. Late yesterday afternoon they announced to us that they would move a motion of public importance on the Franklin River. This morning they suddenly turned up with what was an urgency motion. There is nothing that the Hydro-Electric Commission of Tasmania is doing in South West Tasmania that it was not doing a month ago. There is nothing that Senator Chipp has suddenly discovered last night. There is nothing that a member of that Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania investigating this matter should not have known about much more than a month ago. Yet suddenly last night, or maybe it was only this morning, Senator Chipp gets a burst of inspiration that he would put on a good turn here this afternoon and produce this matter as an urgency motion. This is a very serious matter. It is a serious economic, environmental and socially divisive matter in Tasmania. It certainly should not be dealt with, at a few hours notice , with a debate of only two hours.</PARA></TALK.START>

For a year Senator Chipp has sat on the Committee of Inquiry into this matter. The Committee could report soon. If Senator Chipp believes that the Committee is not doing its job properly, he should get up in this place and say so. He should take action on the Committee to get its report through so that we can have a proper debate on the results of that Committee's deliberations and on the results of that Committee's long consideration of the matters that are of concern.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to oppose the motion. I need to do so because an interjection of mine was taken up by Senator Chipp. As I understand it, Senator Chipp attempted to establish the urgency of proceeding with the putting of this motion on the ground generally, in relation to the debate that has occurred, that the Senate cannot afford to wait until it gets the report of its Select Committee on South West Tasmania because by March of next year, in Senator Chipp's terms, irreparable damage will be done to South West Tasmania by the activities of hydro-electric teams in that area. In response to that argument in support of the motion by Senator Chipp that irreparable devastation would occur in South West Tasmania in the next seven to eight months, I interjected that that was utter rubbish. For that, Senator Chipp said I would be condemned by posterity. He got my interjection into Hansard in order to ensure that that would be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations presented late last year a major report on the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Asian subsidiaries. As stated in that report the Committee is following closely progress made in correcting the particular problems as set out in some detail in the report. As a result of the Committee's continuing involvement in the affairs of the Australian Dairy Corporation we have been presented with a submission, by P. T. Kebun Bunga, an Indonesian company, with regard to a proposed sale of the Dairy Corporation's 50 per cent shareholding in a company called P. T. Indomilk, a joint venture operating in Indonesia. I wish to point out that the Committee has not sought public submissions with regard to this matter although we recognise its public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Briefly, the background is that the Australian Dairy Corporation signed a heads of agreement in September 1981, to sell its 50 per cent shareholding in P. T. Indomilk to P. T. Kebun Bunga. That agreement has not proceeded to finalisation. In an attempt to force the Dairy Corporation to comply with the terms of the heads of agreement P. T. Kebun Bunga has now commenced legal action in both Indonesia and Australia. As a result it is the Committee's intention to defer any further consideration of the issues raised in this matter until such time as legal proceedings have been completed. We consider that we cannot conduct public hearings in relation to this matter whilst it is sub judice. Although the Committee is concerned about the situation which could result in a loss of $5 1/ 2m and more to Australian interests we can, in the circumstances, do no more than keep a close watch on events to ensure that Australia's interest in this overseas joint venture is protected. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make the statement. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this amendment Bill is to allow expenses incurred by candidates in local government elections to be tax deductible. The amendment will also cover the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island. The existing provisions of the income tax law with respect to deductions for election expenses are restricted to expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in being elected for membership, or in contesting an election for membership, of the Federal Parliament, or a parliament of a State, or of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. There is currently no provision to allow expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in being elected, or in seeking to be elected to local government, to be tax deductible. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation, undoubtedly, comes from a time when local government was treated as a convenient way of getting the dictates of State governments carried out in local areas. However, local government has acquired considerable status over the years by virtue of the fact that it is the level of government closest to the people. As part of this development, it has been necessary for central governments at both the Federal and State levels to acknowledge the role of local government as a crucial part of the governance of this country. The Australian Democrats see this Bill as a further step in that recognition and a step which is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> Candidates for local government incur considerable personal expense in seeking election. The Australian Democrats believe that the ability to represent Australian citizens should be decided upon the merits of the candidate and not on the candidate's wealth. It was for this reason that tax deductibility for Federal and State parliamentarians was introduced. It is for this reason that we believe that it ought to be extended to the third tier of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government when rejecting this reform in the past has argued that it is not practicable to amend the tax laws in the context of current budgetary circumstances. The Democrats reject such an approach. Obviously, in the Government's view, the time will never be right for such a taxation concession, but why is it acceptable for Federal and State parliamentary candidates to be able to receive this benefit under the current budgetary circumstances and not local government candidates?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats argue that local government representatives perform a most valuable service in the community. This service is given not in return for a salary despite the fact it incurs a considerable personal expense in terms of time and money. It seems to us that in terms of equity and fairness that those standing for local government, which does not attract a salary, have a greater claim to a tax deduction than those standing for Federal or State parliaments which attract a most reasonable living. </PARA>
<PARA> Our argument is simply that those who are prepared to make considerable sacrifices in fulfilling their civic duty at the local government level are entitled, as a matter of equity, to have their election expenses tax deductible. To avoid doing so will be merely to perpetuate a view of local government as second class and to denigrate the extremely important role that local government representatives play in the life of this country. At present there are no limits -in local, State or Federal elections-as to the amount that can be claimed as a tax deduction. The Australian Democrats wish to signal that we intend to introduce amendments soon that will provide limits for all elections. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect to local government elections, local government associations, in their discussions on this topic, have suggested that a ceiling of $1,000 for tax deductibility should apply. At this stage, that seems a reasonable figure. The Australian Democrats urge all senators to join us in passing this amendment so that there can be no mistake about where this House stands in fostering citizens to undertake the heavy duties of serving in local governments throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to exempt all forms of Australian produced computer software from sales tax for a period of five years from 1 July 1983. The reasons for introducing this Bill are firstly to resolve a problem which has arisen in determining sales tax on computer software and secondly to encourage the development of the Australian software industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The computer software industry in Australia is at a crossroads. It is rapidly expanding, yet it is almost of a 'cottage industry' nature in structure. There are literally hundreds of small producers of computer software in this country. The industry shows promise of becoming a significant export earner in an industry which has a grossly unfavourable balance of trade. I am informed that for each dollar of high technology equipment and software exported, we import $ 14. That clearly is ridiculous. Turkey and Brazil can do five times better than that. We are a high-tech colony. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has other features which commend it. Software development is both 'intellect' and labor intensive. Australia enjoys a comparative advantage in a field which is rapidly being overhauled by countries such as Singapore and Japan . Nonetheless, Australian software enjoys a high international reputation. The software industry is thus one that the Australian Democrats believe ought to be encouraged to the greatest possible extent without imposing tariff barriers or inhibiting the free flow of ideas which are essential to the industry's development. The imposition of such barriers would be a hindrance to its rapid development. </PARA>
<PARA> Has the industry been fostered? Unfortunately it has not. For at least 14 years it has had to fight for recognition as an industry. The Government seems to regard it as a service industry whose products are not generally sales taxable; but nor is the industry worthy of research grants and other forms of stimulation and assistance. It seems that the Government cannot recognise the value of an industry whose primary output is ideas rather than things in a tangible sense. </PARA>
<PARA> The catalyst for the introduction of this Bill was my discovery earlier this year that some firms were being asked for up to three years back sales tax after the Australian Taxation Office apparently re-interpreted the sales tax schedules . Unfortunately this re-interpretation was not made general and so we had the ridiculous situation of software companies in some States paying sales tax and others not paying sales tax. That manifestly is unfair. It seems that the Taxation office is having great difficulty adjusting to technological change. Interestingly, I have recently been informed that at least one company, namely De Forrest software, has won an appeal against the tax office for the repayment of retrospectively applied sales tax. In passing, I might say the tax office was unable to supply me with an estimate of the revenue which would be forgone if this Bill were enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I would like to draw the attention of honourable senators, particularly those on the Government side, to the importance of computer software. I believe programs for computer software should be viewed as mechanisms for information transfer, and thus analagous to books. Like books, they should be free of tax. Thus although a sunset clause has been inserted in this Bill, I hope the situation will be favourably reviewed when that time expires. I commend the Bill . </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On the 19th July the Prime Minister outlined the Government's decisions on industry and related policies which followed its consideration of IAC reports on industry assistance, protection and export incentives. </PARA>
<PARA> In a subsequent statement on 19 July, the Minister for Trade and Resources elaborated the decisions taken on export incentives. This Bill gives effect to those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that the Export Market Development Grants Act should be substantially amended so that it can more effectively stimulate the market development activities of Australian exporters and that the Export Expansion Grants scheme should be allowed to lapse on 30 June 1983. This decision should be seen in the context of the total package of industry assistance announced by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to terminate the EEG scheme and to increase benefits under the EMDG scheme reflects its view that the EMDG scheme provides a more cost effective means of stimulating the growth of exports. The majority of EMDG claimants are firms producing technologically advanced products which by their nature must rely heavily on innovative marketing and promotion to ensure success against international competition. The Government was also cognizant of international attitudes towards performance based export incentives and sees its decisions as being consistent with Australia's objective of achieving a multilateral reduction in subsidies to international trade. </PARA>
<PARA> I should now like to draw the attention of the House towards the specific measures aimed at further increasing the effectiveness of the Export Market Development Grants Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The EMDG scheme, which was introduced in 1974, provides financial incentives in the form of taxable grants based on eligible expenditure incurred in such activities as overseas market research and development, advertising, the cost of participating in overseas exhibitions, fares incurred in overseas travel and the cost of bringing agents or buyers to Australia where the promotion of export sales is the objective. The Act was subsequently amended in 1978 when a single grant rate of 70 per cent of eligible expenditure was introduced and benefits were extended to the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Taking into account the present difficult international trading climate, the Government is anxious to ensure that exporters are able to make use of the increased benefits as soon as possible. These benefits will therefore apply from the grant year commencing 1 July 1982 for a further six years. Exporters have therefore been provided with a stable base to plan long term marketing strategies. </PARA>
<PARA> The main changes now proposed for the legislation are as follows. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum annual grant available to a claimant will be raised to $200,000, compared with the present level of $100,000, with an additional $25,000 for expenditure incurred in Government sponsored promotions. This latter provision will be deleted in line with the recommendation of the industries Assistance Commission. The Government has accepted the view of the Commission that deletion of the provision will improve the effectiveness of the scheme by allowing firms to determine for themselves the form of export promotion which would give the greatest returns in terms of export sales. The doubling of the basic $100,000 ceiling will restore the benefit to a real level commensurate with that existing at the commencement of the scheme in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the period of operation of the Export Market Development Grants scheme there have been changes in the relative importance of the different elements which make up the costs of market development. Expenditures on accommodation and sustenance are now significant charges which previously have been fully borne by the exporter. It has been decided that the Government will now make a contribution to these costs. This contribution will take the form of the payment of an amount of $50 for each full day of the visit up to a maximum of 10 days. This is a set figure and will not be subject to an application of the 70 per cent grant rate. The amount has been set at a level consistent with the 'shared cost' principle inherent in the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> All claims for the payment of an amount under this provision will be subject to detailed scrutiny by the Export Development Grants Board in accordance with procedures developed by the Board in its examination of eligibility of overseas fares. Claimants will be obliged to substantiate to the Board's satisfaction that each visit was undertaken primarily and principally for the purpose of export market development. </PARA>
<PARA>Increased Benefits for the Tourism Industry</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In its report the IAC drew attention to certain anomalies in relation to the treatment accorded to the tourist industry under the legislation. The Government has accepted the proposition that wherever possible benefits provided for tourism should be consistent with those offered to other industries and has therefore decided to extend certain benefits accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Regional tourist bodies will no longer be subject to incurring eligible expenditure only in relation to Government sponsored promotions. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of tenders and quotations for the supply of special tourist tenders will now be eligible. A similar provision already exists in respect of the export of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides that where discounts are offered to overseas tourist industry representatives as an inducement to buy Australian tourist services, one half of the amount of the discount may be admitted as eligible expenditure. This is also consistent with the treatment of free samples provided to overseas clients by manufacturers under the existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing requirement that tourist industry claimants must spend at least $5 ,000 other than on fares to have a grant entitlement will be retained. Recognised tourist promotions as approved by the departments of Trade and Resources and Industry and Commerce will continue to be exempt from this provision even though the provision for Government sponsored promotions will be deleted. </PARA>
<PARA>The Construction Industry</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A new provision has been introduced which takes into account the special problems encountered by the construction industry when contracting for overseas business. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian firms competing for overseas construction tenders are often obliged under the terms of the contracts to include certain inputs from local sources. At present the legislation generally results in claims being allowed only in the same proportion as the Australian inputs bear to the total contract value. The legislation has been liberalised to allow all tender/quotation costs to be admissible when Australian input is not less than 20 per cent of contract value and for a proportion of costs, according to a sliding scale value, to be eligible when Australian input falls below 20 per cent. Eligible expenditure will therefore reflect more satisfactorily the costs incurred in tendering for these contracts. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity has also been taken to introduce certain amendments which will clarify the legislation and simplify the administration. </PARA>
<PARA> These include a redefinition of the eligibility requirements where two or more persons who are relatives travel outside Australia at the same time. In order to simplify administration and clarify the position a discretion previously exercised by the Export Development Grants Board will be removed. Because of this it is proposed that these amendments will not come into operation until the grant year commencing 1 July 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Other changes include an extension of the concept of approved bodies to cover those associations promoting the export of services, industrial property rights and know-how and an extended power of delegation to all members of the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that the increased EMDG benefits made available to exporters will be of the order of $36m in the first grant year of operation. Their effects will be felt in the Budget from 1983-84 onwards. </PARA>
<PARA> The new EMDG scheme should provide a new impetus to develop export markets. Coupled with the other assistance measures being made available for industry, the means now exist to stimulate further expansion in Australia's international trade with resulting benefits for the economy as a whole. I commend the Bill to the honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 to provide for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The implementation of the State tax sharing relativities adopted at the June 1982 Premiers' Conference for the purpose of calculating States' tax sharing grants for the years 1982-83, 1983-84 and 1984-85;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The phasing-in of those relativities over the three years ending 1984-85 at the rate of 33 1/3 per cent each year; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) A Commonwealth guarantee that the total tax sharing grants payable to each State will not increase by less than two per cent in real terms in 1982-83 and by one per cent in real terms in both 1983-84 and 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA> The new tax sharing arrangements are the culmination of a process begun in 1978 when the question of the distribution of the States' tax sharing grants was referred to the Commonwealth Grants Commission for inquiry and report. The Commission was required to assess whether any change was desirable in the per capita relativities between States' grants on the basis of the principle that each state should have the fiscal capacity to provide standard levels of service without imposing taxes and charges significantly different from those imposed by other States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's report on State Tax Sharing Entitlements 1981 was considered at the 20 June 1981 Premiers' Conference. It was decided that there would be no change in the relativities contained in the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 at that time in respect of the year 1981-82 and that the Commission should be asked to produce a further report on its assessment of state relativities in the light of submissions to be put to it by States and by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in recognition of the likelihood that, following the further review, relativities could be adjusted in favour of the three more populous States, the Commonwealth agreed to provide additional grants of a total of $60 million to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland in 1981-82, as a part of the total contribution by the Commonwealth towards assisting States to adjust to the new relativities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission presented its second report on 31 May 1982. In it, the Commission confirmed the view expressed in its 1981 report that a change was desirable in the existing State relativities. </PARA>
<PARA> The June 1982 Premiers' Conference adopted a proposal put by the Commonwealth regarding the distribution of tax sharing grants to apply 1982-83, 1983-84 and 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill gives effect to these new tax sharing arrangements. The Commonwealth Grants Commission's 1982 assessed relativities have been modified so that the benefits of South Australia's and Tasmania's hospital cost sharing grants, which continue for the next three years, do not adversely affect their tax sharing grants. This modification is consistent with clause 7.1 of South Australia's and Tasmania's continuing hospital cost sharing agreements with the Commonwealth which states that any above-average per capita hospital cost sharing grants paid to those States are not to be offset by the Commonwealth against general revenue payments. Clearly, the Commonwealth has honoured these agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The relativities so modified are to be phased-in over the three years ending 1984-85 at the rate of 33 1/3 per cent each year. The phasing-in provisions take account of the financial difficulties that would have been created for the three less populous states if the assessed relativities had been implemented in full in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Bill provides for a guarantee that each state's tax sharing grant will increase by at least 2 per cent in real terms in 1982-83, and 1 per cent in real terms in each of 1983-84 and 1984-85. An amount will be set aside from the tax sharing pool to be used, in the first instance, to fund this guarantee, with any portion not required for this purpose being distributed among the six states. The amount to be set aside, totalling about $149 million in 1982-83, represents the escalated value of the $60 million provided by the Commonwealth to the three more populous states in 1981-82, to which I referred earlier, plus the escalated value of the net budgetary gains accruing to South Australia and Tasmania from the Commonwealth payments to those states in return for the transfer of their railways to the Commonwealth in 1975-76. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission had assessed that, under the fiscal equalisation principle, South Australia and Tasmania should not continue to have a higher share of Tax sharing grants on account of these additional grants. </PARA>
<PARA> To give effect to the decisions taken at the June 1982 Premiers' Conference, the Bill provides that the total tax sharing grant in respect of each of the three remaining years of the tax sharing arrangements will be divided into two pools:</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, a basic tax sharing pool, equal to 20.323 per cent of total Commonwealth tax collections in the previous year; and</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, a supplementary tax sharing pool, equal to 0.397 per cent of such collections. </PARA>
<PARA> The distribution of the basic tax sharing pool among the states in each year will be calculated on the basis of the populations of each state at 31 December in the relevant year weighted by the new phased-in per capita relativities adopted at the June 1982 Premiers' Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The distribution of the supplementary tax sharing pool among the states in, in the first instance, designed to fund the guaranteed minimum tax shares, with any portion not required for that purpose being further distributed among the six states on a specified basis. A state that receives a payment as a result of the guarantee is not entitled to receive a total tax sharing grant greater than the guaranteed amount. </PARA>
<PARA> The total amount of Tax Sharing Grants payable to the six States in 1982-83 is $7,772.5 million, an increase of 16.2 per cent over the previous year. Mr President, with the concurrence of honourable senators. I incorporate in Hansard a table which contains the latest estimates of the Tax Sharing Grants payable to each State in 1982-83. This distribution is subject to revision in accordance with revised estimates of the States' populations and the respective capital city consumer price indices. </PARA>

<PARA> One of the provisions of the Bill is that the previous guarantee, that the State's Grants in any year will not be less in money terms than in the previous year, is replaced by a significantly more generous guarantee that each State's Tax Sharing Grant will increase by 2 per cent in real terms in 1982-83, and 1 per cent in real terms in each of 1983-84 and 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the generosity of the guarantee, and the phasing-in arrangements for the new relativities, the Commonwealth required, and the States accepted, that no special grants will be paid by the Commonwealth during the phasing-in period of three years. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Commonwealth Government has acted responsibly and equitably in respect of the appropriate relativities to apply during the next three years. Clearly, changes to the distribution of the Tax Sharing Grants between the States have to be made consistent with the principle of fiscal equalisation. Equally, the provisions of the Bill will ensure that the changes take place at a pace compatible with the fiscal capacities of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> No State will suffer a decline in the real value of its Annual Tax Sharing Grants. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of decisions taken at both the Premiers' Conference and Loan Council meeting in June 1982 the States will have available, in 1982-83, a substantially increased volume of funds from Commonwealth assistance and borrowing programs (excluding electricity authorities) approved by Loan Council. It is currently estimated that the States will receive an increase in such funds of over 13 per cent-a significant real terms increase. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill which is purely a machinery measure seeks to correct an error concerning references to the Secretary to the Department of Aviation arising from one of the orders made under the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 consequent upon changes in the machinery of government made on 7 May, 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The circumstances I will now outline were brought to the Minister's attention during the last sitting week of August and have given rise to the need for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-section 19B (3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that where reference is made in a provision of an Act to an office that is an office of Permanent Head of a Department and the office has been abolished, the Governor- General may, by order, direct that the provision shall have effect as if there were substituted for that reference a reference to such an office as is specified in the order made by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport and the Office of Secretary to the Department of Transport were abolished on 7 May 1982. On that date an order was made pursuant to sub-section 19B (3). It provided that, where any provision of an Act, or an instrument (including rules, regulations, and by-laws) made, granted or issued under an Act, being a provision administered by the Minister for Aviation, contained a reference to the Office of Secretary to the Department of Transport, it shall have effect as if there were substituted a reference to the office of Secretary to the Department of Aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 9 of the Air Navigation Act 1974 was excepted from this order because it contained provisions of a transitional and validating character in relation to past actions. However, this exception should not have been applied to sub- section 9 (3), which deals with future actions. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-section 9 (3) provides inter alia that after the commencement of the section in the application of regulations or other instruments in force before 1 March 1975, any references to the Director-General of Civil Aviation or to the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Director-General of Civil Aviation shall be read as including a reference to the Secretary to the Department of Transport. Following the machinery of government changes made on 7 May 1982 a reference in that sub-section should have been altered so as to include a reference to the Secretary to the Department of Aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> While an order made by the Governor-General under sub-section 19B (3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 on 26 August, 1982 altered those references as required, this latter order only applied prospectively. Validating legislation is required in relation to the exercise of the powers and functions by the Secretary to the Department of Aviation from 7 May, 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also validates any act or thing done by any other person or body in reliance on, as a consequence of, or in relation to, the purported exercise of the abovementioned powers or the purported performance of the abovementioned functions by the Secretary to the Department of Aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also provides for certain references now appearing in regulations or other instrument in force or subsisting under or for the purposes of the Air Navigation Act 1920 before 1 March, 1975 to include a reference to the Secretary to the Department of Aviation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not oppose the Special Prosecutors Bill but we are very far from enthusiastically endorsing it. Our reluctance is not, of course, based on any unwillingness to see the successful prosecution of tax cheats and frauds-in that respect, our position could hardly have been made clearer in the excitements of recent weeks-but rather we believe that the Bill before us is a load of cosmetic legislative codswallop shovelled together in haste, not because of any need for a new statutory office, not because any such statutory office was recommended by Mr Costigan, but because the Government had the pathetic thought that to do so might divert public attention from its record of negligence and incompetence insofar as the prosecution of tax cheats is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We take the view that the Bill before us is both unnecessary and inadequate. It is unnecessary for the specific purpose for which it is introduced, namely, the appointment-presumably from the private profession-of a prosecutor to spearhead a task force initiating and instituting both civil and criminal proceedings against tax cheats because the Government could have established such a position and appointed such a special prosecutor to proceed against bottom-of-the-harbour criminals and tax avoiders, or indeed others in the whole taxation area, simply by a wave of the Executive wand. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perfectly within the scope of the Commonwealth's Executive power under the Constitution to make such an appointment. It might of course be said that a mere stroke of the Executive wand cannot ensure any independence of the Executive so far as such a position is concerned in the same way that legislation can ensure that independence. As a technical matter, that is perfectly true. But, as I will point out later in the course of this debate, that independence has certainly not been secured by anything in the text of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is unnecessary, why has the Government introduced it? The first and most obvious reason is simply for purposes of window dressing-to throw up a smokescreen, to lay out some diversionary tactics-to try to turn public and media attention away from the awful mess it has made of the business of exposing and proceeding against tax avoidance and evasion. More specifically though, perhaps, we have the legislation before us as a product of the Government's being obliged to make some concessions to the reality of its failure to perform effectively in the policy, administration and law enforcement machinery areas, and to be seen to be doing something about that manifest failure. The indictments made by Mr Costigan in his report against the quality of the Government's administration of the law in this area stand unanswered despite the pathetic attempts from various remnants of the back bench and the bureaucracy in recent days to throw the credibility of that report into doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> The most obvious thing about the Government's attitude remains the sheer obliviousness of its senior public officials as was most encapsulated by the remarks of Mr Neaves in the hearing of Estimates Committee A on Monday that he simply did not see the 1973 Perth case as a test case. Indeed, he failed to appreciate the possible meaning of the concept of a test case in the context of criminal proceedings. He perceived it simply as a routine matter and, as we all know, within the Attorney-General's Department routine matters are the kinds of things for which year long delays and multiple years of delay are the norm rather than the exception. </PARA>
<PARA> So there has been a failure of administration and nothing that this legislation contains can possibly serve to disguise that. Indeed, the second reading speech which introduced this legislation was thoroughly self-incriminating in this particular respect. The Government is bending over backwards to reassure us-to reassure an understandably sceptical public-that it really does now mean business. Thus in the first paragraph of the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) we have the assurance that the cases to be handled by the special prosecutor will be:</PARA>
<PARA>of such special character that the community should not be left in the slightest doubt that prosecutions will be handled with the highest professional competence with complete independence from any extraneous consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>Further down is the following additional statment:</PARA>
<PARA>therefore, a clear indication of the Government's intention to proceed with the utmost vigour in these cases regardless of all considerations other than the proper enforcement of the law and the protection of the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, by those statements the Government is condemned out of its mouth. The very use of the words 'highest professional competence' in the first paragraph I quoted, and the phrase 'with the utmost vigour' in the latter paragraph, is the clearest possible admission that neither of those qualities has dignified the shameful performance of this Government in relation to tax avoidance and evasion over the past seven years. The record has been one rather of massive incompetence and culpable lack of vigour. The Special Prosecutors Bill is simply a straw for this drowning Government to clutch, but we know and the Australian public knows that it is much too late. Two senior Ministers are going down beneath the surface and this Government is going with them. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the necessity of the Bill. What about its adequacy to perform the task that it sets for itself? I believe, and the Opposition believes, that the Bill is inadequate as a response to the more fundamental and important questions of how Commonwealth prosecutions in serious matters are in fact to be conducted in the future. It simply does not address itself to the question of whether an effective semi-independent Commonwealth prosecuting agency can be established, not just on an ad hoc basis but on an effective permanent basis, out of the wreckage of the Crown-Solicitor's Division of the Attorney-General's Department, which division has demonstrated its manifest incapacity to perform in that kind of role. </PARA>
<PARA> The vulgar haste which has accompanied the preparation and introduction of this legislation has really rendered quite impossible on behalf of the Government any consideration of the issues associated with the establishment in the longer term of such a semi-independent prosecuting agency. There is no indication that the Government, in the context of drafting the legislation, has turned its mind to this question. Indeed, in the course of the Estimates committee hearings last Monday there was again admission that the Government had not done so, in other than a desultory way, at any stage earlier. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As always, my comrade Senator Mulvihill has made a pleasant, cheerful and helpful intervention in the debate and I hope that it will be treated by the Senate in that spirit. I wish later to say a little more about the kind of machinery model that might be appropriate for the longer term but for the moment I wish to spend a few minutes on the substance of this Bill and some of the claims that are made concerning it. First, there is the question of the functions to be performed by the special prosecutor, which are identified in clause 6 of the Bill. Those functions, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, are to institute prosecutions under Commonwealth or Territory law, to carry on prosecutions under Commonwealth or Territory law, to take on or supervise actions for civil remedies on behalf of the Commonwealth and its authorities, and to perform, so far as the States are concerned, any functions that might be conferred on the special prosecutor by State legislation in relation to, again, the carrying on of institutional prosecutions for offences against State law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the functions so far as the Commonwealth is concerned are only in respect of those matters in the first instance which the Attorney-General specifies as appropriate for the special prosecutor to take over. It is obvious that at the moment the Commonwealth has not thought beyond the immediate context of taxation prosecution. The primary function of the clause seems to me to exist as a kind of vehicle for such further and better thoughts in this area as the Commonwealth may later have. However, manifestly the primary functions that the special prosecutor will be performing-as much has been stated by the Government- will be in the area of taxation evasion and avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> There is something of an incongruity-a matter to which the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills has drawn attention, and about which no doubt my colleague Senator Tate may wish to say something-in sub-clauses (2) and (3) of clause 6, to the extent that it is there stated that no objection can be taken to a particular proceeding on the ground that it does not relate to a matter which has been specified by the Attorney-General. Thus, even though the functions of the special prosecutor at the Commonwealth level are in the first instance to be only those which are defined or specified by the Attorney-General , if he chooses to branch out beyond those circumscribed functions apparently, by virtue of the operation of this clause, no legal redress can be resorted to against him. Therefore, as I say, there is an incongruity in those provisions. It may be something to which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner ) will give his attention in reply, explaining precisely just what is the justification for taking away with a second hand what is, in this instance, given by the first hand. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a rather more important question that arises from the text of the Bill is just how much it does to secure the independence of the special prosecutors who may be appointed under it. Of course, much attention has been given, in the course of promoting this legislation, to that notion of independence. I have cited already one or two passages from the second reading speech which are redolent with that theme. Again, the very opening words of the second reading speech make the point thus:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to enable appointments to be made of Special Prosecutors with clear authority and independence to institute in exceptional cases and carry on necessary prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, a lot of attention has been given to the question of independence. That theme was repeated by Mr N. A. Brown, who has acted for the last few weeks as surrogate Attorney-General in the other place--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both terms may do. At page 1289 of Hansard Mr Brown is reported as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . above all, the means is a resort to an independent person. It is important that that point should be made. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it has been made during the barrage of propaganda that has been associated with the Government's presentation of this legislation. But really, the assertion that independence is vested in these special prosecutors is laughable. The special prosecutor is so hedged about with controls and constraints that he is barely more than an arm of the Attorney-General's Department. I make it clear that I do not necessarily believe that to be wrong in principle, rather that humbug is to be avoided at all costs, and to say that a completely independent statutory set of conditions is created by the legislation is humbug of a very high order indeed, especially when one looks at the text of the Bill. As we have seen, clause 6 makes clear that the functions exercised by the special prosecutor are to be those defined by the Attorney- General, albeit, as I indicated a moment ago, the force of that particular constraint is somewhat mitigated by the following sub-clauses, which make it impossible for that limitation to be enforced. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, if we look at clause 7, we find that it provides:</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General may . . . give directions or furnish guidelines to a Special prosecutor with respect to the performance of his functions. </PARA>
<PARA>Not, it is true, in relation to any particular case, but again there is the clear notion that, with respect to a class of matters and the way in which he deals with it, the special prosecutor can be thoroughly hedged around by the approach demanded of him by the Attorney-General of the day. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make clear that I am not saying specifically that it is inappropriate for a special prosecutor or, for that matter, any other authority created by statute to be subject to Government guidelines and directions. I will make very clear later that I believe a preferable model is provided by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the United Kingdom, who indeed operates, save in exceptional cases, under directions from the United Kingdom Attorney-General. I simply make the point that the question of total independence from the Executive, for better or worse, has been one of the most vaunted claims made on behalf of the Bill. I make the point that when one looks at the relevant provisions of the Bill one finds it very difficult to sustain an argument that there is indeed independence. I made clear before, and will again, that I do not necessarily think that there should be absolute independence. I just do not think that there should be humbug in respect of claiming independence when, in fact, it does not exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under clause 11 (1) the Attorney-General determines the remuneration and allowances of the special prosecutor.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Tate says, no one knows whether it is to be permanent. It may be perfectly appropriate for fees or remuneration to be set by the Attorney-General. Indeed, in the context of this legislation and from the assumptions on which it is drawn, it would be very difficult to frame that provision otherwise. I am only saying that this legislation is totally unnecessary because it merely wraps up in a legislative costume what is, in effect, a set of executive discretions of a thoroughly familiar and, for the most part, unexceptionable kind. My point is: Why in the hell are we wasting parliamentary time in debating a piece of thoroughly unnecessary legislation? Answer: Because it represents a cosmetic enterprise designed as a diversionary tactic by a government that is in a hole and wants to be seen to be doing something, however unnecessary in practice that might be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the nub of the criticism. I do not want any of the remarks I make about particular clauses to be taken in any other context than that. They are simply parts of the case I am making, that we are not here talking about an independent statutory authority free of any influence either of a transitory or of a potentially permanent kind. That is exactly the same answer as the answer to the previous question. Similarly, the same point can be made in relation to clause 17 (1). The Attorney-General must approve those whom the special prosecutor employs. Under clause 17 (2), the Attorney-General must approve the engagement by the special prosecutor of consultants. Clause 18 makes provision for other services to be made available to the special prosecutor from the Australian Federal Police, the Public Service Board and so on. Again, that is if the Government chooses in the exercise of its executive discretion to make those services available. In practice, of course, the effectiveness with which this outfit, this authority, will operate, will be entirely dependent on what resources the Government chooses, under these various provisions, to make available to it at any time. The special prosecutor is then in all these different ways simply a creature of the executive government. He is established by statute but he may as well not be; he may as well be simply counsel briefed by the Commonwealth in the way that counsel, consultants and people who assist counsel, so often are in the conduct of ordinary prosecutions. The thing, as I said, is just a load of cosmetic codswallop to the extent that it purports to be anything more than the dressing up in legislative form of a straightforward, familiar set of Executive appointment discretions. I repeat-it seems to be necessary to repeat it-that we do not make any great argument for the necessary independence of the special prosecutor. We do think it is appropriate, in the interests of ministerial responsibility, if that concept has not been totally denuded of content in recent times, and in the interests of political accountability, that there be a degree of control of whoever is running Commonwealth prosecutions and that that control be to a significant extent retained at the ministerial level by the Atorney-General. We do not dissent from that. We simply make the point yet again that claims of the kind that have been made about the independence of the office are quite spurious in the context of this particular legislation because there is no such independence. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish on a more constructive note, as I hope I foreshadowed I would, by making some suggestions as to what may be the way out of the mess that the Commonwealth has got itself into with its conduct of prosecutions and because of the manifest failure of the Crown Solicitor's Division to be a credible outfit in this respect. It is important that a more professional, aggressive, lively and effective approach be adopted to Commonwealth prosecutions generally, not just in the taxation area but across the whole spectrum. With the morale in the Crown Solicitor's Division of the Attorney-General's Department in its present debilitated condition I believe that it may now be almost impossible to create such an effective agency within that environment. There is, after all, a fundamental difference between the two basic functions that the Crown Solicitor' s Division performs. On the one hand it operates, and always has operated, with a mixed degree of success, as a solicitor to the Commonwealth and to the departments and agencies of the Commonwealth. It is a 'firm of solicitors' engaged in drawing up agreements and contracts, giving advice on relatively routine matters, including some of some complexity, giving representation to those Commonwealth agencies and departments when they are proceeded against in civil actions by outsiders for injury or anything else-the familiar run of solicitors' functions. That is an identifiable role and one which, as I say, the Crown Solicitor's Division has performed with mixed success over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of its role is a very distinct one. It is the conduct of prosecutions in matters of significance. It has not traditionally conducted prosecutions in every case in which the Commonwealth has sought the recovery of debts or wanted to take action of other kinds-there are many areas in which departments and agencies conduct their own prosecutions-but it has been traditional certainly for matters of any significance for the Crown Solicitor's Division to play that role. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, when I was interrupted in such an untimely fashion by the dinner bell, I was in the middle of saying that I believed there was a case for separating the two basic functions of the Crown Solicitor's Division-that of a general solicitor for the Commonwealth and its agencies, and that of a prosecuting body-and creating a separate agency with prosecution functions, an agency which may well develop as a result of separate establishment a whole new esprit de corps and professionalism, which is conspicuously lacking in the present Crown Solicitor's Division. It appears to the Opposition that the model for such an agency, a prosecuting authority independent or semi-independent of government, may well lie in the very long- established United Kingdom Directorate of Public Prosecutions, which has provided the foundation for the new approach to prosecutions and the machinery of prosecutions now being considered by the Cain Government in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the United Kingdom the Director of Public Prosecutions acts under the superintendence of the British Attorney-General and is responsible to him. It is a semi-independent agency in the sense that there are some crimes for which the DPP has sole discretion to prosecute, whereas there are others concerning which he acts on instructions of the Attorney-General. In the Australian context, it might be thought that the most appropriate system-my inclination is to believe this-is one in which the DPP has the primary discretion in all matters but is capable of being overruled by the public direction of the Attorney-General in circumstances where the Attorney-General is prepared to put that direction on record and take the political risks of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> The DPP in Britain is not the prosecuting agency for all crimes; rather, it is for the more serious crimes in the country, with the police prosecutors being the prosecuting agencies for less serious crimes-apart from those initiated by private individuals. A succinct description of what the DPP is about appears in the official British Government publication 'Criminal Justice in Britain' from which I read the following short extracts:</PARA>
<PARA> The Director is under a duty to prosecute crimes such as treason and murder. The police have to report to him a further list of offences, including serious offences against the person, sedition, criminal offences by police officers and offences relating to obscene or indecent publications. The Director does not prosecute all such cases referred to him by the police but may do so in any one that appears to be important or where he thinks intervention is necessary, otherwise the proceedings are conducted by solicitors employed by the police. The Director also considers whether proceedings should be taken in cases reported to him by Government Departments. In addition, he advises the police and others concerned with the administration of the criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a reference to the review of the functions of the DPP and the various prosecuting agencies around the country run by the police forces now being conducted in the aftermath of the Phillips Royal Commission on Criminal Investigation. The account goes on as follows to describe those who actually do the work:</PARA>
<PARA> The professional officers of the Director's Department are barristers or solicitors. Although the former have a right of audience in the higher courts, they do not in practice appear except in magistrates' courts where they and their solicitor colleagues conduct summary and commital proceedings. When cases go to trial counsel in private practice are instructed to appear on the Director 's behalf. At the Central Criminal Court in London these are drawn from a panel of 'Treasury Counsel' appointed by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> I imagine that those Treasury counsel, in the Australian context, would be very similar to the sort of persons who are anticipated as being special prosecutors, in effect, under this legislation. It is that melding of a semi-independent permanent agency with the tapping of specialist resources for specialist cases that I believe might provide an appropriate model for Australia, not in absolute terms but one which would at least give us food for thought. The Opposition believes that that justifies more attention than, on the evidence of recent public statements from the Attorney-General's Department, it has so far received . We believe that what is needed to efficiently conduct prosecutions of tax cheats and other major Commonwealth criminal defendants is not just an ad hoc system of special prosecutors of the kind provided for in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not oppose the Bill, because it does not do any particular harm; but nor does it do any particular good. As we see it, it does not do anything by way of meeting the longer-term need for an effective semi-independent Commonwealth prosecuting agency. It is just an obviously political solution to what is very obviously the Government's present political problem-the Government's need to drastically refurbish the image that it now so deservedly enjoys, as a government soft on tax cheats, soft on tax evaders, soft on business and professional tax avoiders, but hard as nails on the ordinary pay-as-you-earn income earners who, because of this Government's neglect and incompetence, and in some instances even its corruption, have been subsidising tax cheats to the tune of about $30 a week over the last seven years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans has, both before the dinner break and for the past seven minutes, given us one of the more pathetic attempts to belittle a major measure taken by a government expressing its concern and its preparedness to act in relation to a national problem. I shall come to some of the details of that shortly, but I think that the best way to sum up Senator Evans's contribution is to say that it is what I referred to the other day; a further example of the extent to which the Australian Labor Party's representatives in this chamber have prepared and introduced a new scheme in relation to tax avoidance. It is the bottom-of-the-barrel scheme, a scheme in which they are trying to dredge up any way in which they can try to make the bottom-of-the-harbour tax avoidance schemes run for them as a political issue. So far they are demonstrably failing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is a positive, forward-moving piece of legislative and administrative action by an Attorney-General who, until yesterday when unfortunately and unavoidably he commenced his sick leave, has been extremely active in taking action to prevent what has become a national pastime. Let us look at the matter with objectivity instead of with party political particularity. From the speech that Senator Evans made, what he and the Opposition mean is that they agree with the legislation but they are not prepared to say so. They agree that it is a development but are not prepared to say so. They agree, but are too small-minded to acknowledge that the present Government has made a forward step. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed to find that Senator Evans has not had the decency and courtesy even to remain to hear some of the remarks which I propose to make shortly about other aspects of what is apparently the shadow Attorney-General's major attack. A major attack? We have listened for 30 minutes to what is a pathetic bottom-of-the-barrel scheme attempt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very shadowy exercise on the part of the shadow Attorney-General. I pass on to some of the other points which can be made. The first point is that people should realise and be prepared to acknowledge that since 1977 the present Government has introduced more than 30 measures, successfully guided through the Parliament, to overcome some of the legislative shortcomings and the ingenuity of tax avoiders and tax evaders. I refer to a few introduced during this period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> General anti-avoidance provisions were introduced in 1981. Trading stock schemes were legislated against in 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1981. Legislation in relation to the misuse of gifts was introdced in 1978 and 1982. Legislation in relation to trusts being misused was introduced in 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982. The avoidance of tax in relation to dividends was legislated against in 1978. Legislation was introduced against trafficking in current year loss companies in 1978. Legislation against sales tax avoidance was introduced in 1978. Pre-payment schemes were legislated against in 1979. Legislation was introduced against schemes to postpone tax liability in 1978 and 1979. Expenditure recoupment schemes were legislated against in 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982. Legislation against carry forward of losses generated under tax avoidance schemes was introduced in 1979 and 1981 and more is about to be introduced in 1982. Legislation was introduced in relation to depreciation problems in 1979. Straw companies and trusts were legislated against in 1980. Legislation was introduced to cope with certain problems with deceased estates in 1977. Legislation to remove problems which arose in relation to the definition of ' public company' and in the effective collection of taxes were legislated against in 1977. Legislation introduced in 1980 in relation to royalties received by non -residents. In 1981 legislation was introduced with regard to payments to employees. The diverting of income through tax exempt bodies was legislated against in 1981. Transfer pricing was legislated against in 1982. Short term property transactions and the avoidance of tax was dealt with in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight we have before this chamber a further measure by this Government- conscious of the industry which has been created, conscious of the problems of the individual pay-as-you-earn taxpayer, and conscious of the problem that some people were avoiding tax while others were having to pay it-designed to overcome these problems. For Opposition members to come here tonight and attempt to belittle what is being done effectively and conscientiously by this Government is, I think, unworthy of them. Let me refer to what has happened. The Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act was passed in 1980. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since that time not even Senator Grimes would find it possible to allege that a tax avoidance industry is flourishing in Australia. As I said in this chamber on one of the other occasions when we had been rather monotonously going through what has been happening in relation to this matter, the tax avoidance industry is so dead that one of the chief promoters of one of the major schemes bounced a few cheques the other day. I do not think anything can be any more dead than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators of who it was who established the inquiries that produced the results that have been the subject matter of debate in this and the other chamber. The present Federal Government established the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The McCabe-Lafranchi and Costigan inquiries were established by Liberal governments. They established them, supported them and gave them every assistance that can be given by a government determined to take steps to overcome a major problem. Those inquiries have revealed information which could not have been revealed unless either a parliamentary committee, with the flexibility, opportunity and powers it has, or a royal commission had been established for the purpose. Those inquiries have revealed matters of serious concern to Australia. But what have we had as a result of the publication of these Liberal-National Country Party inspired inquiries? We have had small, mean objection and an attempt to take advantage of and to blame the very people whose concern has led to the establishment of the inquiries and the subsequent revelations. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what is a matter of concern to the people of Australia: Why is it that the Australian Labor Party is endeavouring to make small-time party political mileage out of the honest attempt of a government to get to the bottom of what is happening in this country and the defects of the legislation and the advantages which are being obtained by some of the people who, I believe, could be described only as the crooks of this country-the tax avoiders, the people who are not prepared to play their part in looking after the interests of our country? I can only say that I believe that for this Government to be criticised by the Opposition for having achieved the greatest breakthrough in ascertaining the nature of tax avoidance in this country and for having achieved the greatest breakthrough in taking the legislative steps necessary to overcome tax avoidance is only small, petty party politics. I cannot understand why Opposition members are not prepared, with a greater degree of concern for the best interests of this country, to give credit where credit is due. With the knowledge that neither this Government nor any other government is perfect, I say that if ever there has been an example of a government prepared to take every necessary step and to cop the political flak that can come from small minded opposition, this Government has provided it on this matter of tax avoidance. I compliment both Mr Howard, the Treasurer, and Senator Durack, the Attorney-General, for having withstood all that and pursued a course of action notwithstanding the fact that many people may have been put off by the way in which it has been twisted against them. </PARA>
<PARA> I pass now to the detail of the Bill we are debating. The Bill proposes to create positions of special prosecutors. It is entitled the Special Prosecutors Bill 1982. One of its most important parts deals with independence. The appointment for at least the duration of a prosecution of a prosecutor who knows that he will, without fear or favour, be able to pursue as he sees it objectively and professionally the responsibility which he has been given is, I think, an extremely important provision. There have been troubles with this type of appointment in some countries. I do not believe that there is an Australian example of this, but one could point to the position of Special Prosecutor Cox in the Watergate affair in the United States. He, having got hot, having got to the heart of what was going to hurt the government of the day, had his commission withdrawn. That is the sort of situation that this Bill is designed to prevent. </PARA>
<PARA> I felt that Senator Evans tried very hard to belittle an important piece of proposed legislation without making any real point as to why it was not an advance on the present situation. Members of the Labor Party have made this whole issue of the persecution of tax offences a highly political one. They have created the necessity for this very piece of legislation to ensure that we are in a situation in which a person or a group of people appointed to prosecute individuals in society can feel free to do so without the fear of being subjected to political interference. That is the fear I have following certain actions which took place during the term of the last Labor Government from 1972 to 1975. I need refer to no more than the dawn raids on the offices of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to provide an example. The speech of Senator Evans tonight is a further example of the importance of the sort of independence and protection which the prosecution, on behalf of the public of Australia, will be able to obtain as a result of the legislation which we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA> It seemed that the main argument of Senator Evans was that the special prosecutor is not really independent and that the Bill does not really represent a departure from existing arrangements. He suggested, therefore, that it is unnecessary. This was the attempt to which I referred earlier to belittle an important piece of anti-tax avoidance legislation. However, the contrary appears when one examines the position of a special prosecutor as opposed to the position of a barrister briefed to prosecute. The brief to prosecute can be withdrawn at any time. While it is virtually unthinkable in this country-I hope it will continue to be unthinkable-that there would be a situation where that action was taken, the fear, the prospect, the possibility and particularly the smear of innuendo and twisting campagin of the past few weeks mean that there is a need to give an assurance, a protection, to any person who engages in the important public role on behalf of the people of prosecuting to the end, successful or otherwise, people who are alleged to have been engaged in major activities of what I would describe as an un-Australian kind-people who have avoided their fair share of tax, people who have their responsibilities as citizens of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it may be unthinkable that that could happen, I believe that the events of the past few weeks have made it appear that it is a real prospect that prosecutors will be treated as have the very objective and efficient officers of the Attorney-General's Department such as Mr Neaves, the Secretary of that Department, and Mr O'Donovan, the Crown Solicitor, who on Monday were examined at great length but with little success. On Monday they had their opportunity, through the operation of the Senate Estimates committees system, to tell their side of the story for the first time. I believe that that was one of the most telling parts of the whole debate that has taken place. That was the only opportunity those officers had to tell their side of the story. The shadow Attorney-General who is an extremely competent cross-examiner attempted throughout the day to examine them and find defect but he failed to do so. That examination was the greatest justification of the Attorney-General and the Attorney-General's Department. There are certainly problems and action has been taken in relation to particular problems. When there are a few thousand officers in a department I cannot imagine that one would not find possibly one or two officers who are less than perfect. Even within the Labor Party, that could happen. As perfect as members of the Labor Party are, there may be one or two who are less than perfect. </PARA>
<PARA> The position that is proposed by this legislation is that a special prosecutor will be able to have the certainty of appointment, protection and independence to pursue through to the end the task of prosecution without the risk of the withdrawal of a brief as could happen and as did happen in the case that I mentioned earlier of special prosecutor Cox in the United States in the Watergate affair. The objective of the legislation is to provide a complete assurance to the community that in exceptional cases where a special prosecutor is appointed he has security of appointment and can pursue his duty without the slightest risk that there will be political interference with his capacity to do just that. I believe that that alone is sufficient justification for the piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to pass to a couple of other points that arise in relation to this matter. I refer to the question of independence and accountability. This is a vexed question and a question which needs more consideration and far more debate than has been given to it by this Parliament, academia, the media or the general public of Australia. The question of accountability is interrelated with the question of independence. The greater the independence that is given, the greater the degree and the requirement for specific types of accountability. I am appalled at times to hear some of the comments made by people in some areas of some industries. I refer particularly to some of the people interested in marketing authorities in Australia who put forward the view that the Parliament should legislate to give them an advantage but should not require the slightest degree of accountability out of the advantage given. That to me is an untenable situation. If one uses legislative power to give people a task and independence- -</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And sometimes a monopoly, the very essential ingredient that follows is that there must be both accountability and timeliness in the accountability. That is one thing that I think is an important feature of this legislation. Here we are creating a position whereby we give to the special prosecutor an independence. The quid pro quo for that independence is that he must be accountable to the Parliament. Therefore, I warmly support clause 20 of the Bill which requires that form of accountability. I refer briefly to clause 7 which relates to the giving of directions by a Minister. I think again it is important to see this in its proper perspective. Senator Evans gave one perspective; I should like to give another. Clause 7 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General may, by notice in writing, give directions or furnish guidelines to a Special Prosecutor with respect to the performance of the functions of that Special Prosecutor but the Attorney-General is not entitled to give directions or furnish guidelines in relation to a particular case. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans referred to that. Let me refer to sub-clause (2) which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Attorney-General gives any directions or furnishes any guidelines to a Special Prosecutor under sub-section (1),--</PARA>
<PARA>I have just read that sub-section-</PARA>
<PARA>the Attorney-General shall cause a copy of the directions or guidelines to be published in the Gazette. </PARA>
<PARA>If ever there were a basis for the complaints made by Senator Evans about the lack of independence of a special prosecutor, it could be destroyed by the very proper requirement which I totally support that directions be published as soon as possible. One of the matters that has concerned me for a long time is the capacity of a government to interfere with supposedly independent authorities. One thing that I believe is extremely important is that there should be, on any occasion when there is political intervention with the operation of an independent authority of one sort or another, a disclosure of that political intervention for all members of the public to know and judge. That is what this Bill provides in Clause 7 (2). </PARA>
<PARA> Remuneration is another matter about which Senator Evans made complaint. I agree that there is a matter for concern in relation to remuneration. I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) to pay particular attention to the point I am going to make. I do not like and I do not support the general idea that the salaries, allowances and entitlements of people appointed to positions such as this should be subject to Executive whim. I believe that this sort of position on a permanent basis ought to be subject either to the Remuneration Tribunal or to specific legislation which then has to survive the scrutiny of the Parliament. The position with regard to this proposal, is however, acceptable I think provided what I understand to be the situation proves to be the situation, that is, that special prosecutors will be appointed from time to time for the purpose of pursuing one or a number of prosecutions. If it turns out that an appointment or position is permanent, I ask the Government to give an undertaking to review the provisions of this Act to ensure that the appointee comes within the purview of the Remuneration Tribunal as a permanent appointee. If it is a matter of the equivalent of briefing counsel for particular cases or a series of cases, I think the only practical way to go about it is to do it by negotiation. Therefore, the provision in the Bill is reasonable. But if it becomes a permanent position, I cannot see any reason why it should not be--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Tate" NAMEID="NJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not necessarily. It is limited to a maximum of five years I understand, and I am subject to correction, that it is likely that the special prosecutor will be appointed for the purpose of pursuing particular pieces of prosecution and it may be that another appropriate expert will be appointed for another series of prosecutions. In that case, I think flexibility is required in relation to the question of remuneration. But if it becomes a permanent position, I cannot see why it should not be subject to the normal permanent position provision of the Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I warmly support the introduction of this legislation as part of an ongoing attack, a vigorous attack, by this Government to overcome something which is a disgrace to our country, a disgrace which has developed with the introduction of the idea that it was fair game to rip off other citizens. I warmly support this legislation as an important part in achieving the restoration of credibility in the honest citizens of this country and the repudiation of the dishonest practices which have crept in and led to 30 separate measures of tax reform to which I have referred and which have been necessary since 1977. This legislation is a further example of the determination of this Government to stamp out tax avoidance in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in favour of it because it overcomes the failure of this Government to prosecute successfully those who defrauded the revenue of hundreds of millions of dollars. It is novel legislation, it is new, for the national legal environment. A special prosecutor is required because this Government has failed to prosecute successfully those who have defrauded the revenue of hundreds of millions of dollars, those who over the years in a quite subversive fashion have undermined the whole equity and fairness of our tax system, particularly by their use of so-called bottom-of-the-harbour schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation is in fact the most candid confession yet by this Government of its failure to pursue tax avoidance as vigorously and as robustly as it should have in the years preceding tonight. After all, today is Wednesday, 15 September 1982. It is seven or eight years since the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes were first detected by the Australian Taxation Office. It is seven years since that Office sought the assistance of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth, Western Australia, to launch a prosecution in relation to one of these schemes. In other words, it is seven years since the Government first became aware that it ought to prosecute these bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. It failed to do so. The enormity of the loss to revenue can only be wondered at or guessed at. Tonight, 15 September 1982, we are debating the presentation of this Bill. Far from being the last in a noble saga of hard hitting exercises by this Government to curtail tax avoidance, it is an abject confession of failure. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I am delighted that it has come into the Parliament in this form. Whilst it is true, as my learned colleague Senator Evans has pointed out, that much of what is in the Bill could have been achieved by Executive fiat, I think it is appropriate, as we are adopting this novel office in Australia's public life, for it to come before this Parliament. I think it is important that the Parliament deal with the matter. I must say that I was surprised-I will deal with this later-at Senator Peter Rae's acceptance of what I see as some deficiencies in the possibility of Parliament scrutinising and carrying out a surveillance function without an interference function in regard to the operations of the office of special prosecutor. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that more specific point in a moment. This Bill is telling the people of Australia that there can be no confidence at all in the capacity of Mr Howard's Taxation Office or Senator Durack's Attorney-General's Department to pursue these matters. We need a completely new office, a break with the past which has failed us so manifestly. The vigour that is required is not contained within the present structures of government established by the Fraser Administration and the Ministers-Howard and Durack-who have been responsible conjointly for it. I must bring into the picture the Public Service Board, which has also neglected its proper responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Estimates Committee A, which met on Monday, did uncover the fact-Senator Peter Rae would not expect me to agree in toto with his interpretation of the events of last Monday but I think he would acknowledge this point-that a joint management review committee report was available to the Government in June 1980 concerning the operations of the Crown Solicitor's Office, a report which advocated strongly that tax expertise be built up in the Central Office of the Crown Solicitor's Office in order to deal with the defrauding of revenue that had been established and was going on in Australia. Despite that, it was only three weeks ago that the Public Service Board indicated its preparedness to accept a submission from the Attorney-General's Department for the appointment of a First Assistant Crown Solicitor to carry out litigation in this field, and only three weeks ago that the submission for the establishment of a special revenue section within the Crown Solicitor's Office was accepted by the Public Service Board. </PARA>
<PARA> Two years after the joint management review committee said that that tax expertise needed to be built up, and only in the atmosphere of the political climate that has built up around Australia in the last three or four weeks, the Public Service Board has come to the party in that regard. That comes out of the evidence of Estimates Committee A. That, I think, demonstrates the weakness, the dilatory nature, the almost culpable negligence of the present structures of government in dealing with these tax avoidance prosecutions. Therefore, I am not surprised-indeed, I am pleased-to see the emergence of the proposal for this office of special prosecutor. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not entirely clear whether his brief will be restricted to following up those who entered into bottom-of-the-harbour schemes before the passage of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980. It is another surprising fact that no prosecutions have as yet been launched under that Act. Once again it emerged in evidence that the Crown Solicitor himself had felt constrained to telephone the Australian Taxation Office over the last few weeks and ask whether any prosecutions were forthcoming under the Act. He got two different answers. One was that five prosecutions were pending, perhaps nine were in some stage of preparation. The next time he telephoned the answer was that nine prosecutions were more or less ready to go and there were five waiting in the background. There has been complete confusion in relation to prosecutions under the Act. I hope the special prosecutor has a role in relation to them and not merely those schemes which were entered into prior to the passage of the Act. </PARA>

My purpose was to point to the confusion as evidenced in a conversation between the Crown Solicitor and the Australian Taxation Office. That is perhaps an indication why it is that no successful prosecutions have been launched to this point. I believe that the Ministers responsible have to take their share of political responsibility for the fact that their departments are in that state. We do need this new office of a special prosecutor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose one of the features which it is necessary to find in such a Bill is that independence of the Executive which so commended itself to Senator Peter Rae and to the Opposition. It is important that this office not be subject to political interference. But I wonder whether, in removing scope for ministerial control over the office of special prosecutor, there has not also been a failure to sufficiently empower the Parliament to scrutinise the activities of the special prosecutor. I am referring to clause 6 of the Bill which provides that the Minister, who is the Attorney-General, by instrument in writing published in the Gazette, from time to time specifies those matters or classes of matters in relation to which the special prosecutor may institute prosecutions or undertake civil remedies on behalf of the Commonwealth. In other words, it is intended to establish the special prosecutor's initial jurisdiction by means-I am sure that Senator Peter Rae will be extremely interested in this point-of an instrument in writing published in the Gazette. Clause 7, as was properly pointed out in debate, concerns directions and guidelines to special prosecutors which, once again, are to be published in the Gazette-I am not sure whether by instrument in writing; as I understand it they are simply to be published. </PARA>

I am greatly indebted to Senator Peter Rae for acknowledging the point I am making that some further thought ought to be given, since tonight we are being given the responsibility for the creation of this office rather than by way of Executive fiat, and we need to take responsibility for its proper operation. Further, there is the surprising and difficult point that the special prosecutor is not constrained, fettered or hindered by the limitation of matters or classes of matters which the Attorney-General may set out by instrument in writing in the Gazette. He can go beyond them without ministerial hindrance and legal challenge because clause 6 (3) states that his going beyond that jurisdiction set out in the Gazette:</PARA></TALK.START>

Whilst it is true, as Senator Peter Rae has said and as I think Senator Evans has also pointed out, that there is a requirement in the special prosecutor that he provide the Attorney-General with an annual report which is then laid before each House of the Parliament by the Attorney-General within 15 sitting days of the report being furnished to him, it seems to me that the opportunity for debate to which the tabling of the annual report gives rise may well be too late. It would seem to me that if the special prosecutor felt that he needed to go beyond the grounds of jurisdiction or the matters or classes of matters which were assigned to him, then he ought immediately by way of special report to the Parliament- indeed the Ombudsman may make a special report to the Parliament from time to time; he is not required merely to make an annual report to the Parliament- indicate that he is travelling beyond those classes of matters which were assigned to him. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand why the clause is there. No doubt it is precisely to prevent the sort of political interference that Senator Peter Rae and those on this side of the chamber fear which would so define the classes of matters or purport to define them in a way which constrained, fettered, hindered or narrowed the ability of the special prosecutor to carry out his task. He must be able to go beyond those despite the fact that the Minister may not be prepared to alter those matters or classes of matters by a new instrument in writing in the Gazette. That is the whole point. In those instances where the special prosecutor has to go beyond those grounds, it must be because he has been unable to get the Minister to agree to extend those grounds by instrument in writing in the Gazette. Surely in that instance the Parliament ought to be informed that the special prosecutor and the Minister have been unable to agree on an extension of grounds or the matters or the classes of matters to which he can have regard and the matter ought to be brought into this chamber for debate. I hope that Senator Peter Rae, as a protector and great champion of the parliamentary institution, will see that although I might not have come up with any perfect solution there is some need, given the responsibility which is upon us tonight, to assert the ultimate sovereignty of the Parliament over its creation. I hope that some notice will be taken of that point in the Minister's reply. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the Opposition fully supports the concept of this Bill. It regards it as absolutely necessary despite some of the deficiencies in parliamentary surveillance which I have noted. The Opposition does recognise the total inadequacy of the existing machinery of government and even perhaps its unwillingness to deliver the goods. In this case the goods are those hundreds of millions of dollars which have been defrauded or denied to the Treasury of this country for many years by those who have sought to subvert our system to their own ends or those, by the perverting of the best legal and accounting brains in the country, have served their own greed than to provide those sinews of government which are so essential. Speaking of sinews of government, it seems to me that although we have had assurances-this is an important point-that the special prosecutors will be provided with such expert staff as is necessary for them to undertake their task, I would say that the Parliament would want to have a look at the staff resources made available to special prosecutors quite early in the piece and not merely at the time the special prosecutor makes his annual report. We have had instances before in this Parliament when the Government has not provided the sinews of law to the Taxation Office for it to carry out its function. Only a very short time ago during debate in this chamber I had occasion to point out that very fact. From memory, an estimates committee had determined that whereas the Government was engaging in great rhetoric about the fight against tax avoidance, it was proposing to deny to the Taxation Office, because of its obsession with staff ceilings, well over 100 people in the tax recovery area. It was proved by that Estimates committee chaired by Senator Austin Lewis, which reported I think in October 1981, that whilst the Government might save some $15,000, $18,000 or $20,000 per employee in the Tax Office by not employing that person's services, it was thereby denying itself $250,000 in revenue which each of those persons could recover. In other words, it was a question of tens of millions of dollars of revenue not being recovered by this Government because of its failure to provide the sinews of war. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that it is essential that this special prosecutor be sent into battle with sufficient staff, whether they be experts in the area of law or accounting, to enable him successfuly to bring prosecution to fruition. I think one of the problems-this came out during the deliberations of Estimates Committee A, as I think Senator Peter Rae will acknowledge-in the time between 1975 and 1978 was a fear in the Crown Solicitor's Office that if an unsuccessful prosecution were brought perhaps more damage would be done to efforts to recover revenue than if it were just not brought at all. It is essential that the special prosecutor have the staff available to him to bring successful prosecutions early in his operations because if he is to fail in some of those early cases and if that failure can be traced to a lack of expert backup, I think we will be in an extremely sorry state. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition supports this Bill. It is a completely novel step in the Government's attempt to recover revenue which has been denied to the Treasury over many years. I say it is a step by the Government. However, I think the fact that we as a parliament are now debating the matter really means that the office is being established by the Parliament rather than by Executive fiat. I think that that contrast needs to be emphasised. I think we as a chamber take some responsibility for the creation of this office but that brings with it the attendant need to ensure that it functions effectively. From time to time-not merely at the time an annual report is presented-we should take the opportunity to gauge the effectiveness of its performance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the purpose of those people who do not have a Senate Notice Paper in front of them I think it might be as well to remind those taking an interest in this debate that the Senate is debating a Bill for an Act to provide for a special prosecutor. I came into the chamber this evening with some interest to listen to the debate. I have read the Bill. I think it is a good Bill. I was interested to hear what points the Opposition would raise. I have to say that so far as the Opposition's contribution is concerned this is as pathetic a debate as I have heard in the Senate. Opposition speakers, and particularly Senator Tate, who spoke last in the debate, have belittled the Government's efforts, have refused to give credit where credit is due and in fact have added nothing to the substance of the debate. The Opposition will not admit that the Government has made progress in preventing tax evasion. The Opposition will not admit that this legislation is part of the Government's determination to stop tax evasion. The Opposition cannot give credit where it is due.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that we would have a better chance of mounting a determined attack on tax evasion and of setting the clear moral standards that are necessary in our society, with parliament playing its role in that, if the Opposition could avoid the nitpicking-certainly it should make criticism where it considers criticism to be due-and give some enthusiastic support to those areas where the Government has moved, and moved decisively. </PARA>
<PARA> Without canvassing all the debates that have taken place on the subject of tax legislation in the past, a few words at least ought to be said on the Government 's behalf on that matter. Senator Tate said that this Bill is not the last in a series of laws on tax evasion. He said the legislation is quite novel. The inference of what he is saying, the import he attempted to give to the debate, was that this was not part of a process of Government attempts to end tax evasion. What I understood him to be saying was that the Government had not in fact moved seriously in the past on the subject of tax evasion and that this quite novel Bill-'quite novel' being his words-was something new and a dress up of a situation the Government should have been addressing itself to anyway. The Government has long since been addressing itself to the subject of tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I said in a debate in the Senate a few weeks ago, and I will say it again, that much can be quoted from the comments that have appeared in print by prominent members of the community. There is much that every one of us, including members of the Opposition, could quote. Members of the Opposition should come out and say freely and frankly that John Howard as the Treasurer in the Commonwealth Parliament has done more than any other Treasurer in this country's history to stop tax evasion. That is a comment I have had from people on both sides of the fence who work as specialists in the tax area. I cannot believe that only Government senators and members are getting this comment. I cannot believe that that comment is not being made to members of the Opposition. It has been made so frequently and firmly to me in recent years that I cannot believe that this is being said only to Government members. I would like some Opposition members to admit that that comment has been made to them by people whose opinions they have to respect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Rae says is absolutely correct. When some comments published on this were quoted in the Senate just a few weeks ago Opposition debaters kept on saying: 'We do not want to hear that again'. They had read it and heard it and all they wanted to happen was for it to go away. They were not denying that the comments were true; they just did not want them piercing their eardrums. But credit must be given because if it is not Opposition comments on the Government's policy on tax evasion lack credibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to refer to what are, in part at least, the specific origins of this Bill, which is not the last in a series but the latest in a series of Bills from the Government to prevent tax evasion. This Bill is indeed quite novel, and I agree with Senator Tate on that issue. The origins of the Bill are also quite novel. At paragraph 3.135 of volume 1 of the fourth interim report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, commonly known as the Costigan report, the following words appear:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been identified a number of promoters involved in the fraudulent schemes and a vast number of companies. They present a challenge to the proper administration of justice, the application of law and the enforcement of fiscal policy. It is a challenge that cannot be allowed to pass unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not intend to allow it to pass unanswered and this Bill is the first step in part of its answer. In that section of the report there was a recommendation for a task force to be set up on the subject. The Attorney- General (Senator Durack) referred to the Government's deliberations on the report and said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it has been decided to appoint a special prosecutor to concentrate special effort on action with a view to prosecution of persons who were directly involved in the promotion and execution of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The special prosecutor will be assisted by a task force of lawyers, taxation officers and police. There will be liaison with the Royal Commission. Additional staff and resources will be provided as needed. We will be seeking the fullest co-operation from State authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the prompt and specific response of the Attorney-General in this Parliament but a few days ago in fact. Now we have legislation which is an even more specific response to that section of the Costigan report. I think it can fairly be said that the Government has acted very quickly to meet this challenge that Costigan referred to, the challenge to the proper administration of justice , the application of law and the enforcement of fiscal policy. Senator Rae, a Government senator, in an earlier speech spoke very eloquently on how he and the Government feel about people who evade their due responsibilities to their country, who evade their responsibility to make a financial contribution to what is necessary to make government of this country the standard that it should be. Senator Rae very properly picked up the morality of that and the Government's attitude towards it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that government meet the challenge to the proper administration of justice, and the Government is meeting that challenge. It is important that government meet the special challenge of the application of the law, which is not an easy issue, but the Government is moving and will continue to move. It is also equally important, as pointed out by Senator Rae, that the Government meets the challenge for the enforcement of fiscal policy. It is very much in the Government interest to collect all the tax that is due to the country. </PARA>

I hope that that means that Senator Gietzelt agrees that it is in the Government's interest that also the tax that is due to the Government is collected. The Government has always seen it in those terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue on this Bill has been entirely political. In fact, the Opposition has been on the defensive on this Bill because it cannot continue to run the rhetoric that it has in the past few weeks. Here we have a specific; we have a very particular response, a special response-as Senator Tate said, a novel response-a novel response in the terms that it is something special to meet the problem. As the Attorney-General said in his second reading speech when introducing this Bill in the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is . . . a clear indication of the Government's intention to proceed with the utmost vigour in these cases regardless of all considerations other than the proper enforcement of the law and the protection of the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Those were the Attorney-General's words. That is the Government's intention. That is the issue to which the Opposition will not address itself in debate on Government policy on taxation collection. It has been the Government's clear and firm intention to prosecute those involved in fraudulent tax evasion. It has long since been the Government's legislative policy to attempt to stop tax evasion. There are many examples of that. Those are the examples the Opposition will not meet, will not address itself to and will not admit. I would not claim, as did Senator Rae, that the Government has been perfect. I do not think any government has ever been perfect. What is important is that the Government strives to do an honest job, to apply itself accordingly to the rule of law and to the goals that it sets itself. The Opposition cannot deny that that is what Mr Howard and Senator Durack as the Treasurer and Attorney-General of this country have striven to do while they have held those high offices. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Rae said, there is now a real prospect of success in what has been a major problem for this country. Along with many other citizens in the country, I am sure that in recent times we have been dismayed, even sickened, by the attitude of some people on the subject of the payment of tax; the attitude that if there is a way of getting away with it then it is okay. It is pretty clear that in a large number of what are referred to as bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and activities that people meant only to find a way to avoid the payment of tax. It is not clear that that was so in all cases. I would like to make that point in case there are some who feel that I unjustly malign them. It has been distressing and the Government has moved in a number of ways. It ought to be remembered that it was this Government which set up this Royal Commission that brought in this report. It ought to be remembered that when the report came in the Government acted. </PARA>
<PARA> I will commend the Opposition on one thing. It has made it clear that it intends to support the Bill. I would like to say that the more speedily this Bill passes the Parliament and is put into effect the better I am sure we will all feel it is. Here is the initiative for action. The passing into law of this Bill will give the Government the opportunity to move very directly towards solving this problem. Nobody could suggest that one Bill, one Act of Parliament, will meet all the problems that can arise, have arisen and will arise. Nobody would suggest that. We all know that it will always be a continuing battle. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the beginning of taxation many centuries ago, taxation collectors have probably been the basic figures of fun and derision in society, in literature, plays or whatever. They have always been unpopular with certain sections of the community, and sections of the community have always striven very vigorously to avoid the best efforts of the taxation collector. Government has ever had to be active in that area and will ever have to be active in that area. It cannot be suggested that this Government has been inactive in the past. We do not suggest that this piece of legislation will solve all the problems, just as we have not suggested that any individual piece of legislation in the past would have solved all the problems. But we do claim, and we have grounds to claim, that the Government has moved firmly in the past and is moving very much to the point now , and that has had and will have the desired effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I wish to thank all those speakers who offered their support for the Special Prosecutors Bill here tonight. Indeed, I believe it was a useful debate. It was particularly useful to hear the comments of Senator Rae and Senator Martin in putting very clearly into perspective the arguments in favour of the Government' s very timely action in regard to this latest report of the Costigan Royal Commission into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Clearly the Costigan report demonstrated the need for action of the kind demonstrated in this Bill to be instituted by the Government. There has been no delay in acting upon that and I believe that has the clear recognition of all members, not only of the Senate but also of the Parliament as a whole. Clearly the establishment of the office of special prosecutor is demonstrable evidence that the Government is moving to act upon the very clear evidence of tax evasion and avoidance on a grand scale as evidenced in that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe it is fair to say that not even the Australian Labor Party, not even the Opposition in this place or in the House of Representatives, had the insight to bring forward evidence about the kinds of tax evasion that were rife in the community in the last few years. For instance, I do not remember Senator Tate's bringing to our attention, say, four years ago evidence of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The clear evidence is now available by virtue of reports. For that reason we can see clearly now that there is a need to pursue the matter. I repeat that the establishment of this office demonstrates the Government's concern and activity in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Some quite useful suggestions were made in the course of the debate and perhaps I might address a few of them. Once we got past Senator Evans's first 25 minutes of belittling the behaviour and activity of the Government in establishing the office of special prosecutor we were able to glean one or two points of interest . Apart from his usual flamboyance and extravagant language, we learnt that his only concern about the decision of the Government to institute the office of special prosecutor was that he had some doubt as to the level of that officer's independence. The honourable senator was not prepared to come right out and say that the legislation would undermine the office or its effectiveness in chasing tax avoiders, or anybody else for that matter. He sought to make the point that the special prosecutor's abilities would be severely curtailed. As Senator Peter Rae so ably pointed out, the office is one that will develop its own direction. Clearly, as it moves through the tax avoidance area, as it meets the various requirements the need for which has been demonstrated by the reports that have come before it, there will be changing circumstances and perhaps a need for changes in the way in which guidelines are issued. Clearly, from time to time decisions regarding change will have to be made. We need to maintain for the special prosecutor a degree of independence to move as rapidly as possible in a particular direction. The way in which the Government has perceived its duty in this regard is well demonstrated in clauses 6 and 7. I do not believe that I need reiterate the arguments so clearly expressed by Senator Peter Rae in the regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate spoke of the accountability of the special prosecutor to the Parliament and drew attention to a way in which reports could be made to the Parliament in a time frame other than the 12 months time frame set down in clause 20. That is a matter to which the Government, in the light of Senator Tate's argument, could give consideration. I will certainly draw it to attention . </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the remuneration of the special prosecutor and the degree of independence that may or may not result from its being regulated, Senator Peter Rae made the point that an independent means of establishing such remuneration should be established. Again, that is a matter which the Government would need to consider. It certainly warrants sympathetic examination and I will draw it also to the attention of the Attorney and the Government in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> Several other points were made but I believe they fall into the major category previously outlined, that of attempts to demonstrate that the independence of the special prosecutor would not be as high as one might wish. That aspect was well and truly dealt with by Senator Peter Rae, who demonstrated that it was a false argument. I thank the Opposition and, I believe, the Australian Democrats for their support of the legislation and express the hope that it will enjoy a speedy passage. </PARA>

The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) stated, in the course of his otherwise generous remarks, that he could not recall during the last three or four years, Senator Tate bringing to this chamber any concern about schemes of tax avoidance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially, I wish to make the point that, as Senator Peter Rae pointed out, this is a Bill to provide for the appointment of a number of special prosecutors, not merely one at any one time. What I am concerned to ascertain from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) is whether such appointments will be for the duration of a task, or a given duration of time. Clearly, if it is to be for a certain time duration that period may have expired before the task has been completed. It is important to know whether special prosecutors are to be appointed in order to achieve, for instance, the successful prosecution of all outstanding cases having to do with bottom-of-the-harbour schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the point made by Senator Tate. Clearly, clause 10 refers to a temporal appointment, for a period not exceeding five years, but I direct Senator Tate's attention to clause 15, which gives the Governor-General power to terminate an appointment for misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity in circumstances where that might be necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that case I believe that the fears expressed by Senator Peter Rae and me are not allayed at all. If the appointment is temporal, as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) described it, rather than to engage in and complete a task in relation to a certain matter or class of matters, clearly, if a special prosecutor became as obnoxious to the Government as evidently did Archibald Cox in the United States vis-a-vis Nixon, it might well be that, if he were appointed for a short period of six months or a year, the Government would not renew his appointment and thus allow him to complete his task. If indeed the Minister has correctly interpreted clause 10, the matter is one of grave concern.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a particular problem which relates to the power of the special prosecutor. I refer to the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) wherein it was mentioned that the special prosecutor will have overall responsibility for the handling of the prosecutions for the alleged taxation frauds referred to as bottom-of-the- harbour schemes. In response to that I raise the problem of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is a problem raised quite recently by both the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General in defence of themselves, and also by Crown Law officers before Estimates Committee A on Monday of this week in defence of the current situation. Section 16 (2) of the Income Tax Assessment Act states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subject to this section, an officer shall not either directly or indirectly, except in the performance of any duty as an officer, and either while he is, or after he ceases to be an officer, make a record of, or divulge or communicate to any person any such information so acquired by him. </PARA>
<PARA>The operative words are 'except in the performance of any duty as an officer'. My point is that unless those terms are met it is possible that the Commissioner of Taxation could be barred from conveying information to the special prosecutor . There are two ways of interpreting 'any duty'. One is by looking at section 8 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which is a general administration section under which the Taxation Commissioner has a duty to administer the Act. But under those general duties there is a specific duty in section 233 of the Income Tax Assessment Act which enables prosecutions in the name of the Taxation Commissioner. It can be argued that this particular area of duty of an officer could be limited only to divulging information in cases where that information is briefed to Crown Law officers and only Crown Law officers. The other aspect of interpreting section 16 (2) could well come under section 245 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. In part, that section reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In any action, prosecution or other proceeding . . . by the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner-</PARA>
<PARA>That is in any court-</PARA>
<PARA>he may appear either personally or by a barrister or solicitor, or by some officer of the public service of the Commonwealth or a State. </PARA>
<PARA>In those instances the information may be divulged. The point I raise first is that there is a particular problem with section 245, and that is that it refers only to those cases that are prosecuted in the name of the Commissioner of Taxation or the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. As such any prosecutions started by the special prosecutor in his own name as is provided by the Special Prosecutors Bill, may not cover that exemption from section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem I raise, also in respect of section 16, is that under clause 6 (1) of the Special Prosecutors Bill the Attorney-General decides what matters may be prosecuted. From my interpretation of the Income Tax Assessment Act the Taxation Commissioner then has the responsibility of prosecuting and also deciding what is within his duty as an officer for the purpose of section 16 (2) . So it may very well be that the Attorney-General and the Taxation Commissioner may not coincide in their assessment of what matters may or may not be prosecuted. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the minor problems I can foresee from my reading of these provisions. The major problem-it arises when section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act is read as widely as Ministers have read it in recent weeks-is that section 16 was passed in much earlier days when prosecuting was done in-house by the Government by way of the Crown Law Office in a major matter and within the Australian Taxation Office when matters were not major. It may well be, given the interpretations that we get from the High Court, that section 16 will be read stringently and will not be read down and that a reading of section 16 will prohibit any divulging of information by the Taxation Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise these problems because I think that the Government, in its haste in preparing the legislation, has not obtained an opinion from the Crown Law Office as to the ambit of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. That is information which Estimates Committee A received on Monday of this week. In the absence of such advice it could well be that the problem the Government is claiming has existed in recent years will persist under the Special Prosecutors Act. The Government should give some consideration to looking at that with a view to amending either the Income Tax Assessment Act or this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> In relation to Senator Tate's remarks, perhaps I misunderstood his question in the first place in that I thought he may have missed the time that was written into clause 10 of the Special Prosecutors Bill. I was merely drawing his attention to that. It is, of course, the Government's intention to allow a task to be completed. It is a matter of judgment as to whether five years is an adequate time for a general task to be completed or otherwise, and five years has been chosen in this case. Certainly it would be a matter of great concern were it to be considered in any terms other than that it would be a task-related appointment in the situation outlined by Senator Tate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills on clause 6 of the Special Prosecutors Bill. I do so because a special edition of the reports of the Committee-the twelfth report- was put down in the Senate this afternoon in order to enable honourable senators to have the benefit of the Committee's reflections. The Committee is now an important committee in the working of the Parliament. Whilst to some extent the report reiterates points made by me in the second reading debate, I think those points bear repetition at the Committee stage. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) will agree that clause 6 is indeed an odd clause in that whilst the jurisdiction of the special prosecutor is purported to be established by the Attorney-General, by instrument in writing, publishing in the Gazette the matters or classes of matters with which the special prosecutor can deal, not only is it the case that those classes of matters cannot be reviewed by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances because the instrument in writing is not reviewable by that Committee, as would be the case if the prescription of matters were made by regulation, but also if the special prosecutor travels outside the jurisdiction he can be challenged neither by the Attorney-General nor in a court of law. This is the case under clause 6 ( 2).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose the question one needs ot put to the Minister is whether, in view of the cautionary note, the alerting of honourable senators, that appears in the report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, he might take to the Government that concern of the Committee in regard to clause 6 in that, as I say, a self- initiated extension of the jurisdiction of the special prosecutor cannot be challenged by a citizen who finds himself in contest with the prosecutor through the normal process whereby the courts constrain those who are acting against citizens very strictly to the grounds of their power. </PARA>

My advisers have not had the opportunity of reviewing the matter, but as I understand the argument put forward by Senator Tate, he was making the point that it is a question of the terms of reference of the prosecutor. Clearly it would appear that that was a matter between the Government and the prosecutor. Nevertheless, in the light of the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, it is something, along with the matters mentioned earlier by Senator Bolkus and others , which the Government should be taking on board and will review in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President-(Quorum formed). We are continuing the debate on plant variety rights. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for plant breeders, if they so desire-in other words, it is entirely voluntary-to apply for registration to an authority to obtain sole rights or ownership rights for a limited period over new varieties. In 1938 a group of breeders from Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands, founded the International Association of Plant Breeders for plant variety protection. By 1977 the Australian Agricultural Council had approved the setting up of plant variety rights. By 1982 we find that about 25 countries have introduced provisions for the granting of property rights in plant varieties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation is reasonably simple, but it grants rights only in relation to a new plant variety. That means that the variety must firstly be homogeneous having regard to the particular features of its sexual reproduction or vegetative propagation. It must be stable. It must have been originated by a person. It must be distinguishable by one or more morphological-in other words, features relating to its form-or physiological or other characteristics, from all other plant varieties whose existence was a matter of common knowledge when the variety was originated. In other words, it does not cover varieties that have been introduced from overseas even though they might as such be new to Australia. It does not cover items that were, as such, growing in the wild. But it provides a protection to breeders who develop a new variety. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is somewhat similar in the plant field to protection in the form of a patent type of right in the industrial sphere. For a given period, ownership bestows upon a particular person. He sells a seed and gets a certain royalty in payment for that. It is important to recognise that there is nothing in the Bill that would prevent farmers or gardeners retaining the seed of protected varieties for the sowing of crops. In other words, they can keep their own seed for growing purposes. They can sell it for human or animal consumption. Provision is made that the protected varieties will be freely available for research purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is particularly important to Australia because we are an agricultural nation. We derive significant exports from agricultural products. Coming from Tasmania, where horticulture is one of the few potential growth areas, I think that all Tasmanians and all Australians true to their country must be concerned about Australia having available to it the best varieties. As I mentioned last night, all too often we condemn some people in the manufacturing field for not keeping up to date with the latest techniques, the latest varieties. What this Bill is seeking to do is to make sure that the Australian farmer has available to him all the varieties that have been developed overseas. Unfortunately, we have found that new varieties have been refused release to Australia because of a lack of plant variety rights legislation. Some common items that have been excluded until now are: Grapes, cherries, grape seed, barley, perennial rye grass, peaches, nectarines, strawberries and pome fruit. There is quite a formidable list of items. Why should Australian agriculturalists and horticulturalists be deprived of the new varieties that have been developed overseas?</PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that there will be certain problems. Maybe it is in the home garden area that the advertising men should seek to extol a lot of the virtues as to colour, size, yield and so on. But maybe some of the problems, such as susceptibility to disease, are not balanced out. The commercial man will not buy a new variety without testing it himself. Although there is no provision for a testing authority, farmers are fairly conservative in their approach-they will not spend hundreds of thousands of dollars putting in a completely new crop without testing or having advance knowledge of the suitability of that crop for their soil types and so on because all those sorts of things are important. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem I raise rests more in the international sphere. Plant variety rights will indeed be good for Australia. It is true that some of the seed may cost a little more, but it is the net benefit that will be gained from the extra yields that is important. A cost-benefit analysis would indicate that farmers might buy the newly developed seeds if there were a net overall gain in doing so . But I sometimes wonder what might apply in the Third World. The developing world has a little share-unfortunately, it is too small a share-in the global seed industry. We have to recognise that when we create a benefit through introducing legislation certain people may tend to gain excessively from that benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of gene pools have developed in the Third World countries. They do not always have the resources necessary to buy those new seeds. So it is the old story: As the Western societies or the developed world move to improve their position, in the long term that can prove somewhat detrimental to the Third World. No greater challenge to man exists at present than the challenge to eliminate starvation from the world and to help the mass of rural people to escape from dire poverty. The basic challenge is to provide a breakthrough in this area of need. We must improve our yields. We must provide an incentive to plant breeders to plant better strains, to get better yields. We have to recognise the overall net benefit to be derived by mankind. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, there will be problems. When benefits are created I believe there is a possibility that some of the smaller seed organisations will be taken over by some of the larger corporations. We saw that happen in the United Kingdom when, within one week of legislation being passed, the Rank Hovis McDougall company bought out 84 small country seed suppliers or organisations. I believe that is somewhat inevitable. We have to recognise that sort of thing when we pass this sort of legislation. But the net benefit will indeed be good for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise another benefit that will be derived from this legislation. Why are we going to have patent legislation in respect of plant varieties? This legislation will encourage investment in plant research by private companies. Another benefit is that it will lead to a policing and raising of the quality of seeds developed by plant breeding because there will be added interest in that. I believe that a combination of those two benefits will lead to advances in agriculture. I foresee one problem; that is, that as the private companies develop their own plant breeding laboratories and apply moneys to research in this area, we must not overlook the significant contribution made by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to rural Australia in the propagation of needed varieties. I think it would be a tragedy if CSIRO research in this area were allowed to decline as an offset to the increased interest and activity of and the increased research funds spent by the private sector. The role of the CSIRO has indeed been very significant. I trust that with the passing of this legislation the contribution by the CSIRO will not diminish but, in fact, will improve. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has lain on the table for public discussion since 7 May 1981. I think it has been there for ample time. I do not believe that anything could be gained by sending this Bill to a committee stage. I think that the sooner Australian farmers can gain the benefits that will be derived from the new varieties the better it will be for the economy of Australia. Therefore, I wish the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment, moved by Senator Walsh on behalf of the Opposition, to the motion for the second reading of the Plant Variety Rights Bill. I would like to express my concern about certain effects that the introduction of plant breeding legislation in Australia will have and, in particular, its effect in relation to the Third World. We know that poverty and famine go hand in hand. There is no doubt that this legislation will deliberately and decisively prevent the underdeveloped countries from feeding themselves at the lowest possible cost. This has happened in other parts of the world. In 1977 in the Philippines the Esso company developed a network of 100 ' agroservice centres'-a small monopoly-where farmers could purchase seeds, pesticides and farm implements as well as fertilisers through the Esso dealer. That information is taken from the book entitled Farming for Profit in a Hungry World, published in the United States of America in 1977. In 1978 the Farmers Assistance Board in the Philippines stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In less than three years alone, the cost of certified high-yielding seeds here has gone up almost 100%</PARA>
<PARA>After a series of some 400 meetings on land issues, bishops of the Catholic Church, representing 43 dioceses of 12 mid-western States of the United States of America issued the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . stewardship of land and life itself are both symbolically and naturally joined in the life generating capacity of the seed. </PARA>
<PARA> We must preserve for ourselves and for future generations the genetic variety of plants necessary to protect humanity . . . We are also disturbed by the acquisition of seed companies and patents by multinational corporations, the control of seed seeds, because it implies also the control of food production, and indeed of life itself, should not be appropriated to itself by any company or nation. We therefore urge a careful review of pending seed patent legislation . </PARA>
<PARA>The Presidential Commission on World Hunger has also noted the ethical question raised by seed patent legislation. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . at the very least there should be a thorough and careful review of this proposed legislation and all related laws currently on the books. Establishing laws to patent forms of life raises serious ethical questions and may establish dangerous precedents. Appropriate federal agencies should be directed to do long range reviews of these laws in light of world food security, conservation, and diversity. Appropriate policies and legislative remedies would hopefully follow-</PARA>
<PARA>Life form patenting raises moral and ethical issues. I think we have to question whether we can or should put life forms which are owned and which are the common heritage of mankind into the hands of certain companies which are motivated by economic profit. The North-South report on world hunger says:</PARA>
<PARA> Only major efforts of investment, planning and research can make enough food available for the six billion people the world will probably hold by the year 2000. But not only must the food be there; people who need it must be able to buy it. </PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that once the seeds get into the hands of multinational companies the price of seed and food will be beyond the means of Third World countries. We have to ask: Should the Third World countries pay royalties for varieties, the germ plasma of which originated in their own countries? A number of Third World countries have asked the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to begin a study of the effects of the spread of PVR-type laws on agricultural development. It is known that much research and development of species is done for high yield without sufficient consideration of the food value. The protein content of wheat over the last 20 years has been greatly reduced. It is not quantity alone but the quality of the food and the protein value which will best feed a hungry world. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation at its special session in Rome in November 1981 passed a resolution calling for a special review to consider the problems raised in Third World countries by the plant variety rights legislation in various parts of the world. The resolution requests the Food and Agriculture Organisation to produce a document including legal provisions designed to ensure that global plant genetic resources will be conserved and used without restricted practices that limit their availability or exchange, whatever the sort practices. It is quite clear from the transcripts of the debates surrounding the resolution that it was promoted by concerns held by large numbers of countries that international exchange of plant genetic material , and therefore plant breeding, was being greatly hindered by the spread of PVR- type legislation. It is also clear that a majority of the nations represented at the Food and Agriculture Organisation see the answer lying in overcoming the monopoly provisions of the plant patenting system rather than a world-wide adoption of such schemes. The resolution was supported by all Third World nations. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to consider seriously whether famine in the Third World will result from the greed of multinational companies. It seems quite obvious that multinational companies will be taking over the seed companies of the world and resources of the world if PVR falls into their hands. Seed patenting obstructs effective plant breeding for pest and disease resistance since the requirement of distinctness, uniformity and stability do not encourage plant breeders to introduce exotic germ plasma into their programs, thus seed patenting further encourages the breeding of plants based on a limited genetic base. The Food and Agriculture Organisation is particularly concerned about this aspect of seed patenting. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it may be noted that the commercialisation and subsequent commercial competitiveness resulting from the system of plant breeding . . . has led to the intensive breeding of new varieties on a limited genetic base resulting on several occasions in widespread disease epidemics. </PARA>
<PARA>So far as research is concerned, Sir Otto Frankel, in Canberra in 1969 said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have met with constant difficulties because of a marked lack of financial support. The financial resources that we require are of an order that is infinitesimally small compared with sums that mankind devotes to far less constructive purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that mention has been made tonight of the very good work that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is doing in the development of species in Australia. I think we should perhaps ask why, if more money were not put into that area, we would not have an even greater seed resource in this country. Transnationals have a very insidious way of acting and carrying out their policies before the public is often aware of them. I turn now to the transnationals' control of food in Australia. In Multinationals Take Over Australia by Len Fox, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In some Australian industries, overseas investment may have been needed to supply the risk capital or the technology. But in the food industry this was hardly so. There had been some British investment, but by 1940, and even as late as 1950, our food industry had largely been built on Australian capital, with no reason why it should not become more so. </PARA>
<PARA>However, by 1963 the Sydney Morning Herald financial editor was writing:</PARA>
<PARA> It would take an expert dietitian now to show us how to keep body and soul together without helping to send dividends abroad, and especially to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>Since then the United States invasion has intensified, particularly in the fast food area. In 1975 the Australian Financial Review carried the headline ' Australia target of big United States fast food expansion plans'. By 4 March 1978 the National Times reported:</PARA>
<PARA> The multi-million-dollar fast food industry has wrought a quiet revolution in Australian eating habits that worries dietitians, supermarket proprietors and milk-bar owners . . . . the Australian consumer has become a convert to the fast food, eat-out society, spending $6.36 or 20 per cent of the average family's weekly grocery bill on take-away food and meals eaten out of the house-</PARA>
<PARA>Most local fast food groups, except the Perth-based Red Rooster Foods were pushed out by the United States big three, Kentucky Fried Chicken Pty Ltd, McDonald's Family Restaurants and Hartee's Family Restaurant. The latter, owned by the Kellogg organisation, closed down in 1975; but Kentucky Fried Chicken lifted its Australian profit in 1976 to just on $2m. Hartee's place was taken by Pizza Hut Australia Pty Ltd owned by Pepsico of the United States. This chain has its own hamburger university in the United States and in Australia it is expanding rapidly, with many new sites alongside cinema complexes. What this illustrates to us is that, when Australia was in charge of its own food, the profits were staying in Australia. We must question where the profits will be going if the seed industry gets into the hands of overseas companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Patenting will allow market control by a small number of companies and seed prices will then rise. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, since PVR legislation was introduced there in 1970, there has been 143.4 per cent increase in the cost of seeds. Overseas experience suggests that, on a crop basis, a few firms may ultimately control a high proportion of patents. Statistics from the United States Plant Protection Office show that, in December 1979, four companies controlled 79 per cent of beans, four companies controlled 44 per cent of cotton, six companies controlled 66 per cent of lettuce and two companies controlled 43 per cent of peas. There is also the unpleasant fact of the green revolution in Third World countries. Mr W. David Hopper provided a devastating analysis of the impact of the green revolution in Third World politics when, in 1977, he concluded a speech on the Politics of Food by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The politics of the control of wealth is always an unseemly affair . . . a particularly inelegant diplomacy. </PARA>
<PARA>This probably sums up very clearly the impact of multinationals controlling food in Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another aspect of the entry of multinationals into Third World countries and into food organisation. Dr L. W. Crowder of Ithaca, New York, has pointed out a major shortcoming of the revolution often overlooked by critics. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> Small landholders usually practise a system of multi-cropping. For example, a mixture of corn and beans where they are adapted. Unfortunately, plant breeders have not taken into consideration the plant characteristics that favour growing crops together. Thus, new varieties of corn and bean do not grow well in combination. Other experts have calculated that such companion-planting can increase both yield and profitability by more than 50 per cent. Beyond yield, companion-planting makes a major contribution to the protein production of subsistence farmers. Legume crops, cultivated in this way, are often kept by the family while the cereal crop is sold. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the multinational green revolution, this system has been abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been critisism by speakers on the Government benches that some organisations have approached this legislation in an emotional way. I would suggest that, if we are discussing part of our life support system, which the plant kingdom is, it is perfectly legitimate to be emotional. The sad fact is, I think, that in the system under which we live, economic values are put at a much greater level than human values. If we consider that both the animal kingdom and humans are dependent on the plant kingdom for their very survival and health, I think we should be looking at values other than economic values when we consider this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the Middle Ages, when plants were beginning to be developed, we find that they were not being developed for profit. Many monasteries developed herbs and plants out of their concern for the need of people for better food. This is often spoken of as the romance of plants. I think we should consider what that means. Throughout history the development of plants, whether they be herbs for medicine or vegetables for food, roses or fruit, much the greater part of development has been by people who have had a concern for developing the plant itself. In fact, the romance of plants has been the developing of plants for the sheer love of the plant. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the amendments to the Bill, I think we have to remember that if democracy is to work all information and facts must be available to people so that they can make an informed judgment. During the debate on this Bill much information has been put forward by the Opposition which has not been made available to people. I am considering the kit which the Government put out. That was very light on in relation to much of the material that has been used in the debate against this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that seeds must remain a public resource. I think we must consider all aspects of their value, not only the aspect of profit. I would suggest that, if this Bill goes to a standing committee for consideration, there be no haste to resolve the situation until the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has come down with a resolution, with guidelines for the control of seeds throughout the world, and the flow of food to mankind. I think we must therefore ask whether control of our most basic need, which is food, should pass out of our hands, the people's hands, into the hands of people and companies who are concerned only with economic gain. I commend the amendment moved by Senator Walsh. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this legislation, the Plant Variety Rights Bill, which introduces plant variety rights into this country. I do so with considerable enthusiasm, in spite of the comments of Senator Hearn, whose concern-and a very proper concern for poverty and famine around the world-has been expressed. But the very objectives of plant variety rights legislation are to increase yield capacity and to reduce the damage of insects and other matters in the production of food, in the production of the very crops that are the basis and the objective of this legislation. Indeed, Australia's stance in the area of community aid abroad has been a very significant one. Her contribution in providing food and all of those things that tend to obviate famine and poverty has been considerable. At one moment I seemed to gain the impression that Senator Hearn was concerned more with the problems, if indeed they are problems, of Kentucky Fried Chicken than of the matters that are relevant to plant variety legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It arouses in me a measure of surprise that this legislation should be opposed by the Opposition and, I presume, by the Australian Democrats, because it has been lying on the table of the Senate for consideration by the Senate for many months. The legislation represents a period of in-depth consultation and examination by producer organisations, seed merchants and a whole range of people who are directly involved in the development and breeding of plant varieties. That long and intensive examination has produced a circumstance in which there is virtually general and complete agreement that the proposition is worthwhile and can only be seen to make a real contribution to the productivity of Australian agriculture and plant breeding across a very wide range of involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to take just a moment to make a comment or two in relation to Australia' s agricultural and pastoral industries. Those industries are confronted with a harsh climate and harsh soil which, in many cases, lacks fertility and many of the qualities that aid productivity. Consequently, in the face of that sort of competition from climate and soil together, Australian agriculture has developed a measure of adaptability and a capacity of which Australians should be intensely proud. Australian agriculture, in the form of the Australian farmer, has the highest level of productivity on a per capita basis of any agricultural country around the world. Indeed, its adaptability has brought about a level of research, development and breeding in plant varieties and stock that is rated very highly. It has seen the development of a wide range of machinery and cultivation methods that are, in many cases, the envy of the world in which we live. It has seen the development of agricultural chemicals which, in terms of both their nature and the method of application, have made a significant contribution to the productivity of agriculture in this country and in many places around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Only a few weeks ago a well known Australian agricultural chemicals applier spent some time in China looking at the circumstances of chemical control in agriculture in that country and demonstrating the capacity for aerial application of chemicals in new agricultural areas in China. Australia has made very great contributions in relation to cultivation methods, research, the application and nature of chemicals, and plant and animal breeding. If plant variety rights are introduced in Australia at this time they will only open up new opportunities to an already great industry, an industry that rates highly around the world by whatever standards one may like to judge. It is worth remembering that even today, in spite of the advent of a gradually growing and significant manufacturing industry and the enormous potential Australia has in the minerals and resources field, the agriculture, livestock, meat and wool production industries still provide virtually 50 per cent of Australia's overseas earning capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Plant variety rights, which we have discussed on a number of occasions over a few days, are not something new. Plant variety rights have been introduced in 22 or more countries around the world, mostly developed countries. The United Kingdom introduced plant variety rights in 1964, so they have been in operation there for almost 20 years. If we are to avail ourselves of the benefits of plant variety rights we will need to go into this field quite soon. Plant breeding is a relatively slow process. We are looking at anything from between five years and 15 years for the process to take place. The sooner we become participants in something which has become common-place in the developed countries of the world the sooner we will improve the productivity of our great agricultural and pastoral industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly enough, in the United Kingdom where plant breeding through PVR has been in operation for some 18 or 19 years, both public and private enterprise play very significant parts. In some fields only private enterprise is involved. There are 100 full time plant breeders and 1,500 associated staff employed at public institutions in the United Kingdom. They cover an enormous range of plant breeding under the umbrella of plant variety rights. No fewer than six private companies are involved in cereal breeding alone. One of these vast consortiums in the private field has no fewer than 100 breeders in 66 countries around the world. Obviously Australia, not being a participant in plant variety rights, is not one of those 66 countries and consequently does not have the capacity to involve itself in the knowledge and the results of research in that very significant area. In some fields, such as ornamental grasses, only private breeders are involved in the United Kingdom. In other fields, such as the development of rye grasses, there are nine public breeders and nine private breeders. In the area of red clover there are four government breeders and seven private breeders. It is clear that there is a reasonable and responsible combination of private and government involvement in plant breeding in countries where PVR is in existence. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems strange that the Australian Democrats should oppose this sort of legislation. I have always imagined them to be greatly concerned with conservation. Indeed, most of us are, as we should be. We live in an age in which, because of the availability of plants and knowledge, our capacity to re- establish, maintain and stabilise the environment is greater than it has ever been in the history of mankind. We have the machinery, the engineering capacity and the knowledge to maintain and develop the environment to a greater degree than ever before in our history. The consequences of plant variety rights have been, at least to this point, the capacity to breed types of plants that have a great contribution to make and have made a great contribution in containing erosion, in sealing off old mining areas and in maintaining a stable environment . Consequently, I would have thought that genuine conservationists would support this sort of legislation and enterprise as do conservationists in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunately true that the rate of increase of plant productivity in Australia is significantly slower than that in many parts of the developed world . It is a fascinating and somewhat ironical circumstance that New Zealand fruit bred from an American based product is competing successfully with Australian fruit in Sydney today. We should be aware of that circumstance and take the necessary steps to obviate its continuance. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to one or two things which are quite exciting in respect of plant variety rights. I refer to the results of plant breeding and production in a number of places around the world. The yield of wheat in the United Kingdom has increased in the last 10 years by one tonne per hectare. This very largely has been the result of the growing of varieties that have been developed following participation by the United Kingdom in plant variety rights. Maize, which was not even grown in the United Kingdom 30 years ago, today is the most significant and productive forage crop. The perimeter of maize production in the United Kingdom moves north today at the rate of five to 10 miles annually. This crop is making a significant contribution in that country. In 1950 it took about 445 manhours to produce a hectare of beet sugar. Twenty-five years later, because of the introduction of a monogerm variety of beet it takes 80 manhours. This represents an increase in efficiency of something like 600 per cent. On the other hand, in Australia Beecher barley is still a recommended variety although it was introduced to this country from America 42 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's enormous range of soil and climatic conditions must make this country a natural place to benefit from world-wide breeding research. We must benefit from research carried out in those parts of the world which have climates and soils similar to our own. This research is carried out at no real cost to the taxpayer. For instance, the royalty on wheat is estimated to increase the total cost of production of wheat by about half of one per cent. Of course, we can benefit significantly in respect of royalties if we are able to produce and sell Australian varieties to many places around the world which are in great need of them. Indeed, in the Middle East and in many other arid and semi-arid parts of the world there is a real need for some of the plant varieties which are natural to this country. We should be there providing those varieties and, in a real sense, helping what are in many cases undeveloped countries, to control their environment and become productive. I believe that the plant breeding industry will be a boom industry in the remaining part of this century and certainly in the twenty-first century. It has been said that the plant breeding industry could in fact be to the twenty-first century what the engineering industry has been to the twentieth century. From a conservationist's point of view, for people who are concerned with the environment, plant breeding is a clean and non-pollutant industry. Its growth and development are directly relevant to the productivity of some of the most important industries in this country or any other country. These industries have a very great contribution to make to the problems of famine and poverty to which Senator Hearn referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The advent of plant variety rights must give this country an opportunity in industries in which we have a natural strength, a strong background and a capacity for making a shrewd judgment. As I have said, Australian have had to develop their own industries in a harsh climate and in many cases with poor soils. They have had to develop the machinery, the cultivation methods and the chemical applications that have made us significant leaders around the world on a productivity-per capita basis. Australians who have overcome those circumstances are extremely shrewd judges of what is likely to be a better and more productive plant variety. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in concluding my remarks that the introduction of plant variety rights to Australia will do a number of things. In the first place it will involve, as it has in every country in which it exists, a greater investment in the plant breeding industries and that investment will naturally contribute to a greater rate of progress. It is a fact that where plant variety rights have existed for the longest period, the greatest productivity of the plant variety is to be found. None of the 22 or 23 countries which have been involved in this legislation-even Hungary, a Communist country in Eastern Europe-have seen fit under any circumstances to step back from this type of plant breeding advance. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to stress the point again that the concept of plant variety rights covers a total range of plant breeding. It covers not only plants that are conducive to the pastoral industries but also it maintains and stabilises the world in which we live by overcoming the problems associated with moving soils, and water and wind erosion. Plant variety rights will help to overcome so many of the problems that are involved in the instability of the environment in which we live. It is clear, as I demonstrated earlier tonight, that plant variety rights, and the breeding that stems from it, will improve yields. it will not greatly increase the cost through royalties. It will enable Australian breeders to receive royalties from other parts of the world. It will enable Australia to contribute significantly to the development of other parts of the world. Indeed, it will see Australia move from a country which still holds to the hybrid wheat breeding program. It will see us capable of moving into the open-pollinated varieties which have advanced at such an increasing rate over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that the overall gains from the introduction of plant variety rights are very significant in a whole range of areas. If there is one proviso that might be worth considering it is that as time goes by the States, with appropriate membership should establish a form of merit testing organisation. But basically, this legislation can only increase Australia's productive capacity, its potential for its people and for contribution to other countries. I strongly recommend the legislation before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Plant Variety Rights Bill 1982. An amendment has been moved proposing that this Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. I am in a cleft stick on this matter because I have been informed that if the amendment is not carried, if the Bill is not sent to the Committee, it will be defeated at the second reading stage. I would have thought that that would not be beneficial from the point of view of supporters of the legislation. I know there are still a number of people in the Opposition who in fact recognise the principle that the people who put considerable effort and money into the development of plant varieties ought in some way to be compensated more than they are at present for that effort and for that money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of other valid principles behind this piece of legislation. Nevertheless there are some problems in the legislation, one of which-namely, merit testing-was adverted to by Senator Scott. I had hoped that the Bill would go into the Committee stage and that appropriate amendments could be moved to the Bill to overcome some of the problems that some of us foresee occurring after the legislation becomes law. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless I come back to the clear point that if this Bill is not sent to a committee it is lost. What then does the Government do on behalf of the large number of people throughout Australia who consider that the Bill has merit? The Government has an option, once the notification that the legislation has been rejected goes back to the House of Representatives, of taking action to return the Bill to the Senate. Furthermore, if the Government considers that the legislation is of vast importance to the people of Australia, it can proceed under section 57 of the Constitution; namely, after a lapse of three months it can reintroduce the Bill in the House of Representatives and send it on to us. The Government could not do this until the first sitting week of the session next year. That would probably be about 17, 18, 24 or 25 February, depending upon when the Parliament is called together. </PARA>
<PARA> I have consulted with Opposition members on the Standing Committee on National Resources and with the Australian Democrats Whip. I have been assured that they would not oppose a rapid meeting of the National Resources Committee so as to ensure that consideration of this matter is at an advanced stage by that date. We hope that a report could be made by February of next year. As I see it, the Government has nothing to lose at the present moment by the Bill going to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. Incidentally, that Committee has reported only recently on its past reference. It has been given another reference, I think, during this week, but I am told that that reference will be supplanted by this reference. In other words, this reference will take precedence over the reference that has already been given to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, on the one hand the proponents and even the opponents of the legislative have everything to gain by sending this piece of legislation to the National Resources Committee. On the other hand, the proponents of the Bill have everything to lose if it does not go to a committee. I remind the Senate of what will happen. If the Bill does not go to a committee it will be defeated and the Government will lose this piece of legislation. There is no way out of that problem other than, at this stage, to send the Bill to the committee . It is my view that the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources would be the appropriate committee to which the Bill should be referred. Under those circumstances I advocate reluctantly that the Bill be sent to the Standing Committee on National Resources. I will be supporting that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their participation in the debate tonight and on previous occasions on the Plant Variety Rights Bill. As my colleagues Senator Watson and Senator Scott have mentioned, it has been a long debate. It has been one of very considerable importance, and a number of points have been made. I think it is evident, though, that there are very clear philosophical differences in the approaches of those honourable senators who have spoken. Perhaps we ought to start by putting into perspective the arguments and straight away I address my remarks to the point of equity for breeders of new varieties of plants. Breeders or developers of new varieties are seeking similar rights to those which are available to inventors of new industrial processes or procucts under a patents Act. I believe that to be a reasonable proposition. The problem that arises is that existing legislation is simply not suitable for the protection of rights in respect of plants and new varieties of plants. The processes of developing and breeding new varieties are not capable of precise description and would be almost impossible to repeat. The end product, the new variety, is the object of protection, not the process of development in itself. The end product reproduces itself. The Plant Variety Rights Bill will enable breeders of new plant varieties to apply for the exclusive right to produce and sell the variety or to license others to produce it as well. The issues of consumer protection, public plant breeding, merit testing, et cetera, are important but, I believe, have been allowed to drift across the mainstream of the debate on this matter in the last few weeks. Indeed even tonight it has tended to cloud the main issue. Perhaps the fundamental question that the Senate and the Parliament need to address is: Should the Senate or the Parliament deny the right of breeders or developers of new plant varieties the protection that is already afforded industrial developers and inventors? Why should a breeder, after years of costly work to produce a new variety, be denied the right to apply for a patent? At present, the breeder loses control of the variety after its first commercial release on the market. Should we allow to develop a situation in which there is no control, despite the enormous commitment of time, energy and inventiveness expended by the breeder in producing a new product? I believe that is the fundamental question which, indeed, Senator Scott addressed very clearly during his contribution. It is the central issue of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Later I will come to one or two points that have been made by Senator Watson regarding public funding for plant breeding. It must be said that incentives will arise for the further development of new plant varieties as a result of this legislation, which provides encouragement and incentive for new private operators to develop products. If honourable senators generally believe, as I and other senators on this side certainly believe, that plant breeders should enjoy a fair and equitable return for their work and investment, the use of the present Patents Act must be regarded as totally unsuited to that purpose. The only alternative is that of introducing a plant variety rights scheme such as has been outlined in the Bill. If the Patents Act were suitable we certainly would not need to be here proposing new legislation in this form. Breeders would already have the protection that they are seeking. As I believe both Senator Watson and Senator Scott have mentioned, 25 other countries have found patents legislation unsuitable and have gone to the extent of enacting special legislation to extend equity to plant breeders. </PARA>
<PARA> Plant variety rights offers many advantages to the community. I mentioned earlier a most important one-the fact that if a fair return is made available to developers it must stimulate the efforts of private plant breeders. At present in Australia this is almost entirely a public effort. The State departments of agriculture are involved, as are the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the universities within the States and elsewhere. But, as Senator Watson has pointed out, it should not be the only area of activity. If we are keen to develop, as I believe Senator Hearn would like to happen, a greater availability of seeds on world markets to stimulate the growth of world food production, surely we must foster the development of better and more numerous varieties. The Bill makes a positive contribution in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, some costs to the community will be involved. It is intended that the scheme will recover costs and, in time, become self-supporting. There will be income from registration fees and, in the longer run, costs could become zero . The monetary benefit that will flow to the community from what is proposed by this legislation could be many millions of dollars. I believe that Senator Scott referred to that aspect. For instance, in New Zealand where plant variety rights were introduced in 1974, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research estimates that the national benefit of the new varieties released during the last five years can be put at $NZ10m a year. In Great Britain royalties from sales of new varieties bred by government breeders in 1978-79 brought in #3.3m on which the Government was paid a dividend of #650,000. That provides a return to the taxpayer on his public investment in plant breeding. That would not be available without a scheme such as that outlined in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to hear the Opposition parties agree with us on the irrelevance of many of the emotional and unsubstantiated arguments put forward against plant variety rights. Many of those have been mentioned tonight. I think both Senator Macklin and Senator Walsh, leading for the Opposition, have made the point that many of those arguments are irrelevant and that the major issues are those which need to be attacked in other ways and by serious consideration. Senator Scott during his remarks mentioned one of these issues-merit testing. That matter would of course require further examination. It is a very vexed question. I think Senator Scott would acknowledge that there are shortcomings to merit testing of particular plants in particular areas and that some products may be suitable in some areas and not in others, and matters of that kind. Nevertheless the point is acknowledged that there are perhaps a number of matters that would require examination as experience in the use of this legislation develops. The essential point is to get the legislation established so that we can have a useful system of plant variety rights in this country leading, I think, towards a greater quantity and variety and better quality of seeds being grown in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine raised the question of whether the matter should be referred to a further committee for examination. This is the point of the amendment moved by Senator Walsh. Clearly, a great deal of time has been given to the consideration of this matter. I think it was pointed out by Senator Watson that the Bill has been around the Parliament now since May 1981. That gives us more than 15 months in which to have considered the Bill. We all know as members of the Parliament the very considerable volume of representations made by various organisations of all shapes, colour and sizes on these matters. We know that members of parliament have applied their minds in great detail to those points. It is doubtful that there could be any further use in going over those further representations and perhaps further information in the form of a committee. The Government has the view that it is time to act, that the legislation has had considerable airing not only of course in the last 15 months but also over almost the last decade with the development of the legislation. There is the advantage of considerable experience overseas in relation to legislation of this kind. That experience has been drawn upon by our advisers. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the essential need we face right at the moment is to get on with the job. We realise that there is the question of how the Opposition will vote. We realise that Senator Macklin's colleagues are opposed to the Bill. We implore that Senate to pass the Bill at the second reading stage so that we can proceed with the legislation, get the scheme in force and ensure that we proceed to a system which will be of greater benefit not only to Australia but also indeed, in the longer run, to the world. Along those lines I draw my remarks to a close. I make the point simply that this legislation is important to all of us as Australians. I draw the attention of honourable senators to that fact. I hope the Bill will pass in the next few moments. </PARA>

The report concerns a very close colleague and very good friend of mine, Mr Col Miller, Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly for a Brisbane metropolitan electorate called Ithaca. Some time ago Mr Miller, because he was concerned about a particular place in Queensland, decided that he would take a survey amongst his constituents. Mind you, not all of his constituents responded , but 1,000-odd of his constitutents did respond. The survey shows that 87 per cent of the people who responded were against mining on a place called Fraser Island, 12 per cent were for it and 86 per cent wanted the island declared a national park.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I certainly shall, even if I have to cross the floor of the House to do it. And I think a lot of Liberals, and even some National Party people, will come across with me. </PARA>
<PARA>This evening I stand in total support of my colleague, Mr Col Miller. As I said earlier, he is a colleague and a very close friend of mine and I totally support what he is saying. Moreton Island is a beautiful sand island, still in its natural state, situated on the doorstep of Australia's third city. If one goes east by boat from Brisbane, it takes just two hours to reach this 19,000-hectare island. It is unique in that it is the last major sand island in the Moreton region in its pristine state. It has high forested sand dunes. In fact, Mount Tempest is the highest sand dune in the world. The perched lakes of Moreton Island are rare on any Australian scale. The island has unique vegetation and animals. The wildflower heathlands support prolific birdlife and the forests harbour many native animals, such as possums and sugar gliders. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreton Island is now the only wallum area free of both cane toads, which are fairly prevalent in Queensland, and introduced rats. The island contains a rich history of Aboriginal settlement still largely undisturbed. It is unique in South-east Queensland, and it is important to the Aboriginal population of my State and, I would think, Aborigines throughout Australia. Because Moreton Island is beautiful and so close to Brisbane, it is very valuable as a natural place for people to go for any kind of recreation. The island is a virtual wilderness and is of inestimable value because of that alone. The island is also important for education and scientific studies. Many of my colleagues from Queensland who have visited that place will agree with what I am saying. </PARA>
<PARA> After a careful assessment of all the points I have just stated, the Australian Heritage Commission decided to officially list Moreton Island on the register of the National Estate. This means that Moreton Island is one of Australia's very special natural areas. It is a very special part of our heritage as Australians. In the Australian Heritage Commission Act it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> No Federal Minister shall take any action that would adversely affect the heritage value of a listed area unless-</PARA>
<PARA>This is very important-</PARA>
<PARA>there is no feasible and prudent alternative. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of export licences, I believe that this Government is responsible for the future of Moreton Island and must act in the best interests of all Australians now and in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> An environmental study looking at the future of Moreton Island was carried out in 1975 under the direction of the Queensland Government. I stress that this was not an environmental impact study. It recommended two alternatives for Moreton Island-the first was no mining; the second was 6.41 per cent mining. But a public inquiry chaired by two Queensland public servants in 1976 recommended that 6.4 per cent of Moreton Island be mined. This was adopted by the Queensland Government in 1981 even though-I stress this point-there was a massive public outcry against any mining on Moreton Island. </PARA>
<PARA> To support all that, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation recommended, after receiving numerous public submissions and carrying out an inspection, that a full public inquiry should be carried out into the question of sand mining on Moreton Island. To date, this full public inquiry has never been carried out. The Queensland Government has not seen fit to do anything about the recommendation of a joint committee of this Federal Parliament. The recommendation has still not been listened to or carried out by the Queensland Government. The Queensland mining decision is now outdated and wrong. This Government needs to take urgent corrective action on behalf of all the Australian people. In the last few years new light has been shed on the importance of Moreton Island as a natural area. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to speak about the Aboriginal history on Moreton Island. It is important to the Aboriginal people and I believe, because of what I will be saying later in this debate, it is surely important to every Australian. Moreton Island has a rich archaeological heritage. Recent studies have shown that hundreds of sites have been found on this island. There sites range from dinner camps to extensive village sites. They include shell middens and tool making camps. Evidence so far shows that Moreton Island was occupied for at least 2,000 years by members of my race. All the different sites and the distribution of sites can tell us stories. For example, there were different summer and winter camps and different foods were eaten at different times of the year. The foods included vegetables, pandanus, berries, animals from the island and a great variety of seafoods. Something unique seems to have happened on Moreton Island. Apparently fish were often caught with the aid of porpoises which would on command herd the fish towards the shore where the waiting islanders would net and spear them. That is something that has never been followed on. Here we find evidence that this unique way of fishing was used by the Aboriginal people thousands of years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators might ask: Why is Moreton Island's Aboriginal history unique? Let me tell them. Firstly I should say that only a little over 20 per cent of the island has been properly surveyed. Yet what we know already points to the importance of the archaeological heritage of Moreton Island. Current research indicates that south-east Queensland may be an archaeologically unique region. Because Moreton Island has been relatively undisturbed by the hands of the so-called settlers to this country all of the sites in the tribal area of the Ngugi people still remain. Because of the integrity of the archaeological history of Moreton Island much can be learned and is still to be learned about the culture of members of my race. If this is not important to Australians then I wonder what is. This sort of knowledge exists nowhere else in south-east Queensland because of the land clearing, sand mining and other developments that have taken place. Moreton Island is the only undisturbed island left on the coast of Queensland. So it follows that only on Moreton Island can scientists examine a relatively complete record of past lifestyles and changes in these lifestyles. As far as we can ascertain at the moment those lifestyles may go back 5,000 to 6,000 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out that it is not just individual sites that are important. The relationship between sites and the relationship between sites and their surrounding environments enable us partly to reconstruct the culture of this group of members of my race. The value of this knowledge and the archaeological material is of direct relevance to the living descendants of Moreton Island's Aboriginal inhabitants and, I believe, to Aboriginal people generally as a reflection on our heritage. A wonderful educational opportunity is presented on the island for all people to view at first-hand part of Australia's fascinating past. Eager's Swamp within the proposed mining area is ideal for an educational centre. It is close to Brisbane, two hours away by boat. There is a landing strip on the island which means that people can reach it by aircraft in about 15 minutes from Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> The archaeological heritage is of value to science because we can study the nature of people's adaptation to the environment. The sites contain information on the geological, zoological and botanical history of the Moreton Island region . This data is relevant to mainland and island research, not just in south-east Queensland but, I believe, elsewhere in Australia. The points I have stated have become apparent only in recent years through the research efforts of the Moreton region archaeological project. One independent consultant, Dr Rod Rogers, considered that they constituted 'as strong a reason as any other for including the island on the register of the National Estate'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that much further detailed investigation is required to understand more about the archaeological heritage of Moreton Island. Sand mining is proposed on 1,200 hectares of Moreton Island. That area includes 16 kilometres of ocean beach which we know contains over 200 sites and the area has not yet been fully surveyed. It would be impossible to mine the area without losing sites and the important story they have to tell. It is not good enough to dig them up and store them in museums or write them up in books which will be stuck away in libraries. They are an important part of our living heritage and should remain undisturbed in this special case. </PARA>
<PARA> I have visited the island on a number of occasions. I have looked at some of the middens. It is not good enough for someone to say that we can take photographs of them, we can study them, we can write them up and put those writings in the archives. That is not good enough for future generations of Australians. If that were to happen future generations could read about those things and ask: 'Where can I see them?' It would be too late then; we would have allowed them to be destroyed, never again will they be there for future generations of Australians to look at or to study. If mining development goes ahead regardless, both the general public and the scientific community will lose forever irreplaceable cultural resources. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Queensland Government inquiry held in 1976 people were led to believe that small areas of bare sand dunes on the east coast of Moreton Island were degraded and that sand mining could fix them up. That was given as a major reason for allowing sand mining on Moreton Island. We have been fortunate in that detailed studies have been carried out by universities. Those studies now show that those dunes are natural and in fact are helping to build up the island and have helped to build up the island over thousands of years. One of the most valuable and increasingly rare resources in south-east Queensland is natural areas for people to visit, appreciate and enjoy. In the last six years, since the Queensland Government inquiry was conducted, the number of people visiting the island has increased not two-fold but 14-fold. All of those tens of thousands of new visitors, who love Moreton Island, to my knowledge have never had the chance to have a say in its future to preserve it, not just for their enjoyment, but for the enjoyment of tens of thousands of Australians and of future generations of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very strong feeling, particularly in south-east Queensland, that sand mining should not be allowed on Moreton Island. An independent public opinion poll conducted in June 1981 indicated that almost 70 per cent of people were opposed to mining. As I have already said, two weeks ago a Liberal Party member of the Queensland Government conducted a public opinion poll in his electorate. I gave the results of that poll earlier, but I will repeat them. The survey showed that 87 per cent of people were opposed to any mining on Moreton Island and wanted all the island to be a national park. Most of the people had never had a proper public opportunity to participate in decisions about the future of Moreton Island. </PARA>
<PARA> To point out that Moreton Island is a prime example of a remaining unspoilt coastal area on the doorstep of Australia's third city is not to take an anti- mining stand, it is merely to state a fact. Many pro-sand mining people have supported the cause for a natural Moreton Island, believing that some areas in this country ought to be kept in their natural state. Moreton Island is of value to all Australians and admirably fits the description of a special place-a place that we have the responsibility to keep. Reafforestation does not restore an area to its former state. I defy anyone to argue that point. We cannot replace soils that are tens of thousands of years old; we cannot duplicate forests; we cannot do the things that nature has evolved over thousands of years, and we cannot replace archaeological heritage. It is not very comfortable, believe me, to camp beside a sand mining dredge. In areas of lesser environmental importance , these disturbances may be acceptable, but for one of Australia's special places, part of our national estate, these disturbances certainly are not. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that jobs and money are important in the present economic climate. However, at present there is no sand mining on Moreton Island. Large sums of capital have not been invested and employment considerations can be offset by alternative, carefully managed recreational and educational uses. In fact, detailed studies by independent consultants to the Queensland Government show that no net national benefit may be gained by mining on Moreton Island. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise the fact that Moreton Island is listed on the Register of the National Estate and that under section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act no Federal Minister should take any action that would adversely affect the heritage value of Moreton Island unless there is no feasible or prudent alternative. I believe the Federal Government must decide the future of Moreton Island carefully and with wisdom. I belive there are many feasible and prudent alternatives to the sand mining of Moreton Island. I urge the Government and all my colleagues to reject any application for export licences for mineral sands taken from Moreton Island. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier in the day there was a debate concerning South West Tasmania. It was a good debate; I do not think there was much difference between the opinions expressed by the speakers who indicated their support for the protection of that area of Australia. Senator Chipp, who introduced that debate here today, said that South West Tasmania does not belong to Tasmania, to the Government of Tasmania, to Australia-if I quote him correctly-but to the world. It is unique and it is something that should be preserved. I echo his words in relation to Moreton Island. It does not belong to the Queensland Government; it does not belong to Queensland; it belongs to Australia and I believe it must be preserved for future generations of Australians. I urge the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to take the same action as he took with respect to Fraser Island and to reject any applications for export licences for minerals found on the island. In that way we will certainly be able to preserve another one of Australia's very important areas for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Senator Bonner brought to our attention a most important issue in relation to Moreton Island-that of sand mining. It has been debated in this place from time to time and is of great concern to all of us. I am informed that Mr McVeigh , the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, recently visited Moreton Island and fully appreciates the recreational, archaeological and other features of the island as outlined by Senator Bonner during his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that it was a colourful speech and it was very interesting in relation to a number of aspects of life especially affecting Aboriginal people. However, the Minister is also aware that the Queensland Government has adopted the recommendation of the Cook report for future land use. The recommendation was to the effect that sand mining be limited to 6.4 per cent of the island's total area. The Commonwealth position is that any decision in relation to the granting of export licences, which was a key point raised by Senator Bonner, would be a matter for later consideration because obviously it would need to take into account the factors which Senator Bonner brought to our attention. It would certainly also need to take into account the broader aspects which have already been considered by the Minister; he considered them during his visit. In addition to that, any consideration by the Government would, of course, need to take into account the State's views and, in particular, the Cook report. I assure Senator Bonner that I will take forward his very substantial and considerable concerns to the Minister and with all due weight represent his views to the Minister on his behalf. I thank Senator Bonner for his very valuable contribution in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) It has been necessary to integrate the transferred functions into the overall structure of my Department. Proposals to that end are currently under examination by the Public Service Board. Under these proposals the Trade Practices and Consumer Affairs Division will remain intact; some of the staff of that Division are lawyers. The Companies and Securities Branch of the Corporate Affairs Division is to remain largely intact and to be integrated into the Business Affairs Division where related legal functions were already being performed. Some staff of this Branch will continue to occupy clerical/ administrative positions while others, who are legally qualified, will have their positions translated to the legal/professional equivalents. A few project and accounting positions in the Companies and Securities Branch are to be integrated with similar work in the Management and Special Services Division. The Bankruptcy Branch of the Corporate Affairs Division, which is predominantly staffed by people with accounting qualifications, is to be transferred, except for one position, to the Management and Special Services Division. The Australian Capital Territory Corporate Affairs Office is to remain intact and to report directly to the Secretary of the Department.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Although joint venture fishing proposals involving Australian and Taiwanese commercial fishing interests are currently under consideration by the Commonwealth in association with the relevant State and Northern Territory Governments no joint fishing ventures have been approved to date. KKFC Pty Ltd ( previously known as Kailis Kaohsiung Fishing Company Pty Ltd) is the nominated Australian representative of the Kaohsiung Fishing Boat Commercial Guild of Taiwan in its bilateral fishing agreement with the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> The agreement provides for access by Taiwanese gillnetters and pair trawlers to waters off the north and north west coasts of Australia subject to a number of specific operational requirements designed to protect the fisheries from overexploitation and avoid conflict with Australian fishermen. In addition to statutory licence fees under the Fisheries Act a levy based on the estimated market value of the catch is also paid by the Taiwanese fishing interests. Since October 1979 when the first twelve month agreement was signed the following aggregate fees have been paid to the Commonwealth Government by the Kaohsiung Fishing Boat Commecial Guild:</PARA>
<PARA> 1979-80-$ 984,600</PARA>
<PARA> 1980-81-$1,375,915</PARA>
<PARA> 1981-82-$1,394,869</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Since October 1979 the following catches have been taken by licensed Taiwanese fishing vessels operating within the terms of the agreement:</PARA>
<PARA>tonnes</PARA>
<PARA>(total)</PARA>
<PARA>1979-80  22,124</PARA>
<PARA>1980-81  23,504</PARA>
<PARA>1981-82 (8 months to end June)  16,050</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Licences have been granted covering the following periods:</PARA>
<PARA> 1 November 1979 to 31 October 1980</PARA>
<PARA> 1 November 1980 to 31 October 1981</PARA>
<PARA> 1 November 1981 to 31 October 1982</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The licences have been renewed annually in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed between the Guild and the Australian Government and set out in the annual agreements. The Guild has nominated KKFC Pty Ltd as its Australian representative. The agreements were negotiated in order to establish controls over Taiwanese fishing activities which had been undertaken in the area for a number of years prior to commencement of the Australian fishing zone in November 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy is to give preference to Australians and Australians in partnership with foreign interests over bilateral agreements such as the agreement with the Guild. A number of joint feasibility fishing ventures were approved in 1978 for trawling on the north west shelf involving Japanese and Korean vessels. These projects were not successful and at present the only foreign trawlers and gillnetters operating in northern waters are Taiwanese vessels licensed under the agreement with the Guild.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is, however, prepared to consider on their merits new proposals involving Australian and/or foreign fishing interests operating in these waters. Indeed, as indicated, a number of new joint venture proposals involving Australians in association with foreign fishing interests are under active consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) The full nature and extent of the goods or services provided by KKFC and the fees paid for those services by the Guild are matters for commercial agreement between the parties concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am advised that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has received a proposal to upgrade the water supply at Normanton under the Commonwealth's Aboriginal Public Health Improvement Program which is a $50m, 5 year effort to provide clean water, sewerage and electricity services to Aboriginal communities . The proposal seeks a contribution, of 66 per cent by the Commonwealth towards the total cost of this project. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs is considering the provision of funds, in 1982-83, to meet the design cost of the project. This would enable a firm cost estimate to be developed and for further discussions to take place toward agreement on respective State and Commonwealth contributions to the project.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A proposal to provide water to the town of Karumba has not been received by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and I am therefore not in a position to comment specifically on that part of the question. However, the Aboriginal Public Health Improvement Program assists in providing services to Aboriginals and is not for the purposes of providing infrastructure for industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The current estimate for upgrading the Normanton water supply is $1.26m and is based on a feasibility study by a firm of locally engaged consulting engineers. No estimates have been submitted to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in respect of the Karumba project.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Karumba field station was originally established to enable scientists studying the banana prawn to work there for extended periods in the wet season, which is an important phase of the prawn's life cycle.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) After three or four years of field work, time was needed to analyse and interpret the results and scientists left Karumba in 1979. As a result of their findings, the banana prawn catch can now be predicted each season with some confidence on the basis of rainfall records.</PARA>
<PARA> Field work on northern prawns resumed in 1981, but the emphasis is now on the tiger prawn, which has become the principal component of the catch. Karumba is well away from the main tiger prawn area, and some of its buildings are being used to establish a new field station at Groote Eylandt, which is the centre of the tiger prawn industry. CSIRO is putting increased effort into prawn research, with support from the Fishing Industry Research Trust Account.</PARA>
<PARA> Struggles to survive in the northern prawn industry are largely due to economic factors including fuel and operating cost increases, not to a decline in total catch.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Not known, but not the Australian Customs Service. The indications are that such advice was given to the airline involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The airline company's. Carriers have no responsibility to convey goods beyond the airport to which the goods are consigned; the air waybill was for carriage of the goods only to Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) None known to this Department (see also answer to question 2).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am advised that Mr O'Neill refrained from calling the Sydney Customs Office as it was 1.15 am local time Sydney. Dr Stephenson could not advise as to the location of the goods in Sydney and it was considered impossible to identify the relevant area or locate the goods in Sydney at that time of night. It is also the importer's responsibility to arrange and pay for transhipment of goods, not the Department's. Therefore Mr O'Neill did not consider it appropriate to undertake what would obviously be extensive inquiries, in a matter of Dr Stephenson's responsibility, at governmental expense.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am further advised that Perth Officers who came into contact with Dr Stephenson at all times displayed courtesy and restraint even though subjected to loud and derogatory comment within the hearing of the public.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2498) Senator Siddons asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Support, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Support aware that replacement driving sprockets for the Leopard tanks have recently been ordered from Germany in spite of the fact that these components can be made competively and to a high standard at the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo? In view of the fact that the Falkland Islands conflict has demonstrated the importance of self- sufficiency in critical areas of defence equipment, will the Minister give an assurance that high wearing and critical replacement parts for our defence equipment will be manufactured in Australia wherever possible.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> While a development program has been undertaken at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory to produce Leopard tank sprockets, the current status of the program is such that the first four sprockets produced by the factory for acceptance testing purposes are not scheduled for delivery until October 1982. Manufacture of the remainder of the first order for 100 sprockets will follow successful acceptance testing. The order placed on Germany was necessary to meet Army's requirements until such time as the development program is fully established.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's defence policy remains one of self-reliance. The strategic importance of local production is weighed against any penalties in cost, delivery times, or product performance which may be incurred by manufacturing locally. A selective approach to local manufacture is therefore applied to reconcile the objective of greater self-reliance with these factors and the need to make the best possible use of the taxpayer's money.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The article in Endeavour 1982 referred to by Senator Missen does not reflect all of the research and survey work carried out into crown-of-thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef in the past decade. There are currently a number of reefs which carry at some point on their perimeter a large population of crown- of-thorns.

This figure is not significantly different from any of the objective survey results obtained since 1972.</PARA>

<PARA> In specific answer to the questions:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) No control measures are currently being implemented. Research and trials conducted by the Queensland Fisheries Service and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority indicate that no method currently exists which can achieve control of large starfish populations.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Information on the administration of Queensland laws is a matter for the Queensland Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The basic biology of the starfish is now well understood. Current research effort is now concentrated on monitoring the occurrence of crown-of-thorns starfish populations. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has a program in which it is obtaining the collaboration of reef users such as divers , charter boat operators and scientists in reporting the presence or absence of starfish. Other long-term studies both in Australia and overseas are investigating the question of whether man's activities affect crown-of-thorns populations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 August 1982, (Hansard, page 526) Senator Chipp asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the following supplementary question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. First, may I have the indulgence of the Senate to say that I am bitterly disappointed with the answer that the Department has furnished to the Minister. My supplementary question is based on a confirmation that this document does exist by an article in today's Sydney Morning Herald. In that article Mr Weinberger, the United States Defense Secretary, conceded the existence of this document; that the United States has a plan to do this. One is filled with horror. I ask the Minister to bring this updated information to the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his Department and to being an equally updated reply to the Senate. Mr Weinberger made an extraordinary response when asked whether it was really possible to control nuclear forces in the confusion of battle and to make the calculated decisions of protracted nuclear war; he shook his head and said: 'I don't have any idea'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> You referred to an article published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 26 August reporting claims regarding the preparation of a United States Government document dealing with United States nuclear doctrine and strategy. The Sydney Morning Herald report was based on American wire service reports which followed a letter written to a number of newspaper editors on 23 August 1982 by the United States Secretary of Defense, Mr Weinberger. For your information, I am attaching a copy of the text of Mr Weinberger's letter to editors.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer given by Senator Guilfoyle, on my behalf, made it clear that the Government is satisfied that the fundamental purpose of United States defence doctrine and strategy is to convince the Soviet Union that it would have no prospect of gaining its objectives through armed conflict with the United States and thus to deter it from initiating hostilities. This central feature of United States military strategy is not new. The Carter Administration re- affirmed in 1980 that the basic strategy of the United States is deterrence across the entire spectrum of conflict. It remains the objective of the United States to convince the USSR that it will be successfully opposed at any level of aggression it may choose.</PARA>
<PARA> The Reagan Administration's steps to reinforce United States deterrent capability must be viewed against the background of the massive Soviet build-up of arms, particularly of nuclear arms.</PARA>
<PARA> During the last 25 years the United States has continued to develop and maintain a strategic arsenal of a make-up and size specifically designed to deal with Soviet capabilities. The United States doctrine is designed to demonstrate to the USSR that any recourse by it to the use of nuclear weapons would result in unacceptable damage to the Soviet Union. The present strengthening of United States nuclear forces is intended to maintain the effectiveness of United States deterrence across the board. One particular requirement identified in recent years has been that of strengthening United States command, communications and control systems, and targeting doctrine, to demonstrate to the Soviet Union the futility of any concept of a limited, protracted or winnable nuclear war.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government does not accept any scenario of limited or protracted nuclear war. Australia fully supports the concept of deterrence and United States Government policy directed to that end. The letter of 23 August from the United States Secretary of Defense made clear that the United States does not endorse the concept of protracted nuclear war or nuclear war-fighting. The Australian Government is convinced that nuclear war would be a catastrophe of unpredictable proportions from which neither side would emerge the victor. The United States has indicated that the notion of a 'winnable' war has no place in its strategy.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government's policies in the field of arms control and disarmament are directed in particular, to support for an end to the nuclear arms race, strengthening of controls against the spread of nuclear weapons and the early negotiation of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.</PARA>
<PARA> The following is the copy of the text of Mr Weinberger's letter to editors:</PARA>
<PARA>THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSEWASHINGTON, THE DISTICT OF COLUMBIA</PARA>
<PARA>August 23, 1982</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir</PARA>
<PARA> I am increasingly concerned with news accounts that portray this Administration as planning to wage protracted nuclear war, or seeking to acquire a nuclear ''warfighting'' capability. This is completely inaccurate, and these stories misrepresent the Administration's policies to the American public and to our allies and adversaries abroad.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the first and foremost goal of this Administration to take every step to ensure that nuclear weapons are never used again, for we do not believe there could be any 'winners' in a nuclear war. Our entire strategy aims to deter war of all kinds, but most particularly to deter nuclear war. To accomplish this objective, our forces must be able to respond in a measured and prudent manner to the threat posed by the Soviet Union. That will require the improvements in our strategic forces that the President has proposed. But it does not mean that we endorse the concept of protracted nuclear war, or nuclear ''warfighting''. It is the Soviet Union that appears to be building forces for a 'protracted' conflict (the Doctrine of Zatyazhnaya Voyna).</PARA>
<PARA> The policy of deterrence is difficult for some to grasp because it is based on a paradox. But this is quite simple: to make the cost of nuclear war much higher than any possible 'benefit' to the country starting it. If the Soviets know in advance that a nuclear attack on the United States could and would bring swift nuclear retaliation, they would never attack in the first place. They would be ''deterred'' from ever beginning a nuclear war.</PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing new about our policy. Since the awful age of nuclear weapons began, the United States has sought to prevent nuclear war through a policy of deterrence. This policy has been approved, through the political processes of the democratic nations it protects, since at least 1950. More important, it works. It has worked in the face of major international tensions involving the great powers and it has worked in the face of war itself.</PARA>
<PARA> But for deterrence to continue to be successful in the future we must take steps to offset the Soviet military build-up. If we do not modernize our arsenal now, as the Soviets have been doing for more than 20 years, we will, within a few years, no longer have the ability to retaliate. The Soviet Union would then be in a position to threaten or actually to attack us with the knowledge that we would be incapable of responding. We have seen in Poland, in Afganistan, in Eastern Europe and elsewhere that the Soviet Union does not hesitate to take advantage of a weaker adversary. We cannot allow the Soviet Union to think it could begin a nuclear war with us and win.</PARA>
<PARA> This is not just idle speculation. The Soviet Union has engaged in a frenzied military build-up, in spite of their economic difficulties. They have continued to build greater numbers of nuclear weapons far beyond those necessary for deterrence. They now have over 5,000 nuclear warheads on ICBMs compared to about 2,000 only five years ago. They have modified the design of these weapons and their launchers so that many of their land based missiles are now more accurate, more survivable, and more powerful than our own. They have also developed a refiring capability that will allow them to reload their delivery systems several times. They have elaborate plans for civil defence and air defence against any retaliation we might attempt. And finally, their writings and military doctrine emphasize a nuclear war-fighting scenario. Whatever they claim their intentions to be, the fact remains that they are designing their weapons in such a way and in sufficient numbers to indicate to us that they think they could begin, and ''win'', a nuclear war.</PARA>
<PARA> In the face of all this, it is my responsibility and duty as Secretary of Defense to make every effort to modernize our nuclear forces in such a way that the United States retains the capability to deter the Soviet Union from ever beginning a nuclear war. We must take the steps necessary to match the Soviet Union's greatly improved nuclear capability.</PARA>
<PARA> That is exactly why we must have a capability for a survivable and enduring response-to demonstrate that our strategic forces could survive Soviet strikes over an extended period. Thus we believe we could deter any attack. Otherwise we would be tempting them to employ nuclear weapons or try to blackmail us. In short, we cannot afford to place ourselves in the position where the survivability of our deterrent would force the President to choose between using our strategic forces before they were destroyed or surrendering.</PARA>
<PARA> Those who object to a policy that would strengthen our deterrent, then, would force us into a more dangerous, hairtriggered posture. Forces that must be used in the very first instant of any enemy attack are not the tools of a prudent strategy.</PARA>
<PARA> A posture that encourages Soviet nuclear adventurism is not the basis of an effective deterrent. Our entire strategic program, including the development of a response capability that has been so maligned in the press recently, has been developed with the express intention of assuring that nuclear war will never be fought.</PARA>
<PARA> I know this doctrine of deterrence is a difficult paradox to understand. It is an uncomfortable way to keep the peace. We understand deterrence and accept the fact that we must do much more in order to continue to keep the peace. It is my fervent hope that all can understand and accept this so that we can avoid the sort of sensationalist treatment of every mention of the word 'nuclear' that only serves to distort our policy and to frighten people all over the world. Our policy is peace, and we deeply believe that the best and surest road to peace is to secure and maintain an effective and credible deterrent.</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of U.S. policy remains to prevent aggression through an effective policy of deterrence, the very goal which prompted the formation of the Northern Atlantic Alliance, an alliance which is as vital today as it was the day it was formed.</PARA>
<PARA>Respectfully,</PARA>
