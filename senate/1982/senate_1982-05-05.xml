<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Since the Australian Whale Protection Act 1980 provides for the banning of importation into Australia of all whale byproducts, and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. the Prime Minister has stated that he and his Government support the international banning of whaling,</PARA>
<PARA> 3. then consistent with (1) and (2), this Government should immediately legislate to ban the importation of all marine mammal byproducts, including the harp seal of Canada, and</PARA>
<PARA> 4. through the Australian delegate in the United Nations General Assembly, the Prime Minister should state his Government's support for an international ban on the slaughter of any marine mammal for commercial reasons.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Federal Government funding to the performing arts through the Australia Council has declined since 1974 by 39% in real money terms.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Unless this funding is substantially increased in forthcoming federal budgets, many companies will be forced to cease operations and the performing arts will eventually wither and die.</PARA>

<PARA> 4. The people of Queensland, particularly, value the performing arts and believe that without them, their lives would be significantly impoverished.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will substantially increase funding to the performing arts and will not allow the decline to continue at the alarming rate that has characterised the past seven years from 0 .12% of total Government outlays in 1974-75 to 0.07% in 1981-82.

<PARA> (1) That the Minatome uranium deposit at Ben Lomond, near Charters Towers, exists within hydrologically unstable ground in a region of intense seasonal rainfall and is generally regarded as uneconomical and unsafe.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) That safeguards taken against the uncontrolled dispersal into the environment of toxic elements and radioactive material have already been proved to be totally inadequate.</PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate carefully weigh the limited economic benefit to a 100% French-owned company against the health of a large number of Australian citizens and a significant section of our grazing industry and refuse to allow the granting of export licences for any uranium products from the Ben Lomond mine.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. The decision by the Australia Council to discontinue the General Grant of $ 20,000 (which is in the nature of recurrent funding) to La Boite Theatre, Brisbane, will jeopardise the continued viability of the theatre, and in particular, the Main House Theatre; Adult Theatre Workshops; Youth Theatre activities and the existence of the professional core of the theatre.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) The amount spent on decentralisation is a fraction of the amount being allocated to Casey University, the Defence Forces Academy that has been condemned by educational authorities across the nation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate further notes that this downgrading of decentralisation is occurring at a time when country industries are under threat or are closing, and when levels of unemployment and poverty in rural towns and cities are rising alarmingly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether Australian support for the British attempt to regain possession of the Falkland Islands was conditional on the observance of a declared 200-mile zone around the Falkland Islands area. I ask, in search of information I might say by way of explanation: Was the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano within that 200- mile limit at the time it was sunk? Secondly, was it in fact positioned between the 200-mile zone or the perimeter of that zone and the Argentine coast? Thirdly , has the Government any information on whether there is truth in the allegation , and indeed the boast, by some representatives of the British Government that the United Kingdom forces had been seeking to entice the General Belgrano into the 200-mile zone for several days but that the vessel had failed to succumb to those enticements at the time it was sunk?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is of the view that Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are citizens of the Territory and therefore are entitled to the same access to services as anyone else. The fact is that because of their remote location they have difficulty in obtaining television and radio receptions. Representations have been made as to ways in which they can receive these services more readily. Some of the communities are aware that the introduction of modern communications would pose threats within the communities to the maintenance of their traditional culture and way of life. But yes, representations have been made. There are proposals that might involve terrestrial transmission and proposals that might involve the use of satellites when these become available. I understand more work has to be done on them all but I think it is inappropriate to try to give any more details other than to say to Senator Kilgariff that proposals are being considered and the methods still have to be finally decided.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. With the escalating crisis in the Falkland Islands tragically causing hundreds of deaths of both Argentinians and Britons, does the Government recognise that the conflict has entered a new and dangerous phase which could result in very heavy loss of life and limb? Will the Government take urgent steps to bring the present hostilities to an end and intensify the diplomatic search for a solution which will first and foremost take into account the human rights of the Falkland Islanders?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government has made clear its attitude to the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands for a number of days now. It has condemned the Argentine action and has expressed support for the British Government. As I said earlier, I am not in possession of the detailed response required by the question raised by Senator Button, but I will seek it. However, I have said before in this place that Australia expressed its support for United Nations Security Council resolution 502 of 3 April which demanded an immediate withdrawal of Argentine forces and called on the governments of the United Kingdom and Argentina to seek a diplomatic solution. The views of the Australian Government has been made known most recently in the Foreign Minister 's letter to the Argentine Foreign Minister which was delivered last week and has since been released. The Government has been in close and constant communication with the British Government since the Argentine invasion. In response to requests from the British Government we recalled our Ambassador to Argentina, Mr Malcolm Dan, for urgent consultations and we imposed a ban on all imports from Argentina.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 25 April the British conducted an operation to recapture South Georgia and since then there has been military action in the region of the Falklands. The Foreign Minister regrets that military action has increased and that significant casualties are reported, particularly in association with the sinking of the General Belgrano and the loss of HMS Sheffield. However, as the Prime Minister said in a statement on 26 April, Britain's decision to use force was a natural consequence of Argentina's failure to comply with the provisions of United Nations Security Council resolution 502 by not withdrawing its forces . The latest developments have emphasised the need for even greater efforts to find a peaceful solution to this dispute. The British Foreign Secretary restated on 4 May in the House of Commons his Government's continued wish to seek a peaceful and negotiated settlement. The Australian Government hopes that a peaceful settlement can be achieved and welcomes reports that avenues continue to be open which could lead to negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the extent of the response I am able to make at this stage. I noted Senator McIntosh's concern for the human rights of the people in the Falklands. I think that from what I have said it will be seen that we are concerned about this very grave situation. We all hope that a peaceful and negotiated settlement to the dispute can be achieved. That is the wish of the Australian Government. I am sure that if at any time it is appropriate for further steps to be taken by the Australian Government this will be given attention. I will see that the Senate is kept informed.</PARA>

I am not in a position to state whether we are satisfied that every effort has been made to obtain a diplomatic solution to the problem. We simply are following closely what is occurring. It is our hope that a peaceful solution to the problem will be achieved as soon as possible and without further serious loss of life such as we have seen in more recent days.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate or the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs a question along the lines of that asked by Senator McIntosh concerning the Falkland Islands. Is it true that members of the junta governing the Argentine have established a remarkable record of being torturers, murderers and gaolers without trial-violators of civil liberties? Is it also true that, in an attempt to take pressure off them for the massive corruption in which they have been involved and the mess in which they have rendered the economy, they have engaged in a military operation in the Falkland Islands? Is it true that the Falkland Islands is a virtually useless piece of territory? However, is it also true that the incident can no longer be called a toy war because at least 600, or probably nearer 1,000, innocent young men have died and in a desperate situation such men as I have described tend to use desperate measures? In that context, I ask either Minister : Is there any evidence that Argentina has nuclear weapons or has the ability to make such a weapon in a short time? Secondly, I suggest with great respect that Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle's reply to Senator McIntosh that we support the British Government and that the Australian Government hopes that avenues can be opened is no longer good enough and that there must be other avenues, such as using the good offices that Australia enjoys with the honest broker in this deal , the United States, to make urgent intercessions to halt this killing in this tragic affair.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question, which is a long one, overlaps the responsibilities of Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and myself. It is a tragic fact that over recent years the Argentine nation has had unstable government. There have been strongly supported claims from time to time of it having governments with non-democratic ways and, indeed, governments commiting severe violations of human rights. Unfortunately that has been so. Indeed, there had been some hope that this present regime may have mitigated some of those habits of the past. I am unable to referee that situation at all. Equally, it is claimed by some commentators that, faced with a very heavy economic disability at the moment and with an economy declining badly, the regime has created an incident off-shore to divert the attention of the people from their homes. That is not a matter on which I can adjudicate. I can simply report that that has been suggested as a reason for this confrontation as it has been for other confrontations created over history. It is, of course, tragic that it should have escalated into a shooting war, that there should have been aggression and that no way had been found, other than by British intervention, to overcome the first situation of aggression.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it comes unkindly from an Opposition senator to try to suggest that any aggression did not come from the Argentine. The fact of history is that the invasion of the Falkland Islands was by the Argentine and that, therefore, was the first aggressive shot. It is pathetically true that there has been a serious loss of life and that there is a danger of an escalation of that. Australia is in constant contact with both the United States of America and with the United Kingdom and, through our Ambassador, with the United Nations seeking hourly ways in which some solution may be found. Aggression cannot be allowed to go unhindered. If it goes unhindered many nations around this world will be under threat. Senator Chipp asked whether the Argentine had a nuclear facility or capacity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer, refers to the changes to the income tax zone allowances. By way of preface I state that, under the terms of the Treasurer's statement of 15 November 1981, a taxpayer living in excess of 250 kilometres from a population centre of 2,500 would be entitled to a special rebate of $750. Unfortunately, the conditions of distance from population centres preclude most remote area residents from receiving any benefit from these changes as very few areas in Queensland are situated more than 250 kilometres from a town of 2,500 or more. I use as an example the small western township of Adavale which is not on a rail line, has poor road access and lacks most facilities that the majority of taxpayers take for granted. Yet because Adavale is less than 250 kilometres from the population centre of Charleville it does not qualify for a special rebate. Can the Minister advise whether any efforts are being made to establish a more equitable taxation system, both in terms of the size of population centres and the distance from them, so that remote area residents are justly able to claim a rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Government, in introducing the special basic rebate of $750 for people residing or spending the required period in a place in excess of 250 kilometres by the shortest practical surface route from the heart of the nearest population centre of 2,500 people or more, implemented one of the recommendations of the main report of the public inquiry into income zone allowances which reported last year. It will be remembered that during the period of deliberations-I think a period of some seven months-the inquiry received a large number of submissions, held public hearings and made visits to a large number of cities and zones throughout Australia. The committee of inquiry took the opportunity to hear at first hand from a wide cross-section of people the difficulties that people face in living and working in remote communities. The recommendations of the main report have largely been implemented by the Government. As a result, those living in particularly isolated areas and taxpayers maintaining dependants in isolated areas are to receive a significant increase in their zone allowances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Bjelke-Petersen raised the point that whenever boundaries of any sort are drawn there will always be individuals falling just outside those boundaries . In particular it can be seen that in Queensland, with the large number of decentralised towns in that State, there would be difficulties of this kind. However, the Treasurer advises that it is not practicable to try to shift the boundaries on any ad hoc basis. I have to say that the Government has no plans before it at the moment that would lead it to change the arrangements which have so recently been adopted as a result of the recommendations of the committee of inquiry. However, I will draw the question to the attention of the Treasurer to see whether he has any comments that he wishes to make. In particular, I will ask that he have a look at the position regarding the town that was mentioned by Senator Bjelke-Petersen. As I think will be understood, there will be people living just outside any boundaries that are drawn. It is very difficult to overcome that sort of situation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The particular article to which Senator Teague referred was brought to my attention. Indeed, it is a collection of a great number of various untruths and misstatements of fact. I understand that there was a reference to some 470 Vietnam veterans who had suicided in the period since 1972. I think the original evidence for that statement emanated from a newspaper banner headline in the Truth in January 1981 which appeared to have absolutely no foundation whatsoever and to have been a figment of the imagination of the journalist writing it. As to the particular numbers which Senator Teague has brought to our attention-he mentioned six deaths in the last four months-I am unable to confirm whether that information, in fact, is accurate. But if one looks at the figures across the board for national averages of suicides, that figure seems to be extremely high. Indeed, the numbers which have resulted unfortunately in suicide do not substantiate that figure at all. The information available to my Department is not complete in this regard. We have no way of knowing precisely what kind of information is available in the community on these matters. Nevertheless the figure appears to be substantially incorrect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Teague drew our attention also to some evidence that was alleged to have recently been provided by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment wherein it was claimed that there had been some 66 deaths from cancer. It seems as though the journalist has misunderstood that piece of information. In fact the figure of 66 was used in reference to the number of disability claims in respect of cancer which have been lodged with the Department of Veterans' Affairs and in no way had any reference to deaths as a result of that disease.</PARA>
<PARA> On many occasions in this place I have made reference to the point that this kind of sensational reporting tends to heighten the difficulties faced in this community by veterans who are suffering problems as a result of the Vietnam war. It might be said that this applies to certain other statements in regard to the conduct of the Vietnam war generally. I deplore such statements. They continue to raise problems in the minds of Vietnam veterans and cause them more difficulty in seeking rehabilitation in this community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that Senator Foreman referred in his question to certain eminent economists but failed to mention their names. Therefore I have no basis for confirming the claims which he made. It is certainly true that the Fraser Government's policies in respect of interest rates and, in particular , the provision of housing finance have behind them the very real desire to bear down on the expansion of the money supply in order to keep the deficit under control and thereby keep interest rates as low as humanly possible. That kind of statement stands up very well in comparison to the international situation which does not need reiteration on this occasion. It is clear that Australia has done particularly well in the area of real interest rates relative to other nations. To accept the kind of criticism which is implicit in Senator Foreman's question is to deny the very real efforts that have gone on in this country to reduce inflation and to improve the house owning potential of the Australian community which is demonstrated by a continuing level of home ownership in this country of some 72 per cent and which has not declined significantly in recent times. These kinds of things need to be made known to the Australian people generally.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer to the recent announcement of the housing policy, the provision through the banking system of some $400m for housing finance for people generally, the provision of special benefits to the States for low income earners and, of course, the general contribution by way of taxation and the housing grant which has been well discussed in this place on previous occasions. The kind of nonsense perpetrated by Senator Foreman in this regard is baseless. The facts stand for themselves. The Fraser Government is doing all that it can to contribute to the welfare of home owners and to ensure that interest rates in the community are kept as low as possible in the current economic circumstances.</PARA>

The Falkland Islands are on the list of non-self-governing territories considered by the Decolonisation Committee of twenty-four under section 73 (E) of the charter of the United Nations. The people of the Territory have the right to self-determination. On 7 January 1981 the islanders' legislative council asked the United Kingdom Government to continue discussions with Argentina with a view to reaching agreement to freeze the dispute over sovereignty for a determined period.

That body is proceeding well with its work. It is hoped that in the months ahead it may reach definitive recommendations as to technology and markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can give an unequivocal assurance that in Australia we will respect fully the Treaty on Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and all its implications. There would be no way that we would upgrade the uranium to the point of weapons standard in any uranium enrichment industry in Australia. There would be no way at all. I am quite emphatic about that. That is also very easy to police. Incidentally, a uranium enrichment industry is not secret in itself. It is not an industry that is radioactive. It is essentially a chemical industry. In fact, it is an industry which seeks, by a knowledge of the differing atomic weights, to separate the two different ions out of the material. It is an industry which has commercial secrets as to the nature of the technology, be it diffusion, centrifuge or chemex. A high degree of secrecy is involved in that. But the International Atomic Energy Agency would supervise any such industry and would examine whether the material was weapons grade, as would the Australian Safeguards Office in Australia. I have no difficulty at all in giving an assurance that if we do embark upon a uranium enrichment industry, which is a part of the normal industry flowing from the mining and milling of uranium, it would be subject rigidly to all the safeguards and there would be nothing to fear from that.</PARA>

As to the ability of any member of parliament to monitor, the matter is one of very high scientific technology and detail as well as commercial secrecy. It would be quite beyond the technical expertise of any member of parliament to monitor it. It is for that reason that this Parliament has set up the Australian Safeguards Office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for National Development and Energy whether he will confirm the announcement yesterday by the Minister for Education that a limit of 1,000 tonnes a year is to be placed on the present $80 a tonne subsidy for liquefied petroleum gas. If so, is this, as reported in the media, the first step in a government plan to scrap the subsidy altogether? If that happens, is the Minister aware of the problems that this will create in rural communities?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1823" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the subsidy of $80 a tonne was begun early in 1980 at a time when the price of LPG, which had been in parallel with the price of crude oil, soared well beyond that price. That subsidy brought the price back to about $147 or $150 a tonne. The current legislation indicates that that subsidy will expire in March 1983. The Government is in the process of looking at this matter and has made no decision at all yet. However, quite some time ago the Government observed that there were a number of apparent breaches in the use of LPG under its energy policy. Basically the situation is that the Government took the view taken by all nations of the free world that LPG is a prime fuel and should be used essentially in priority for automotive purposes and for petrochemicals and not used where unnecessary, for burning for heating fuel purposes. It recognised, however, that many country districts had no alternative sources, and the Government therefore provided the fuel with a subsidy while no alternative such as natural gas was available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, it never intended that there should be wide usage of it by large industries or an expansion of its use in industries, and therefore some time ago some upper limitations were placed on industries in regard to its use so that it would not be used in a non-priority way. This policy has been known to industry for quite some time. In due course it will be necessary by way of ratification, as happens in these matters, for legislation to be brought before this Parliament, but because the matter has not been considered and finalised by Cabinet in terms of any future subsidy no inferences at all should be drawn as to the future.</PARA>

Will the Government, in formulating its policy concerning the Falkland Islands crisis, not only take into account that part of the United Nations Security Council resolution calling on Argentina to withdraw its armed forces, but also give regard to and convey to the British Government the view that, firstly, the type of armed conflict being pursued by the United Kingdom with the destruction of human lives involved is out of all proportion to the injury to its sovereign interests said to be at stake and thus offends that aspect of the just war doctrine and, secondly, that such armed conflict was premature in that the steaming time for the war fleet set the time limits for a negotiated settlement rather than allowing the full exhaustion of non-violent means of resolving the conflict?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Tate is expressing the policy of the Australian Labor Party on this matter, because he is applying judgmental values. Of course, it is true that one should strive to achieve and maintain peace by all civilised methods, and by non-military methods if one can. But peace is not an end in itself if, indeed, peace denies to people freedom and human dignity and imposes punishment on them. The true goal is the free person and the dignity of the free person. There is no doubt at all that within the Falkland Islands there was a total breach of peace and a severe act of aggression by the Argentinians. If Senator Tate makes such judgments on the British actions, presumably he knows all the details that he drew them from. I certainly would not make such judgments, nor I think would the British people or the great bulk of the Australian people. They are subjective judgments and I think that at the moment they are certainly untimely. I am sorry that members of the Australian Labor Party, by interjection and otherwise, are taking these severely critical viewpoints. Of course, in all these matters, the Australian Government would seek to pursue its ends by peaceful methods.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am not able to say on behalf of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs how many more disabled people may have been able to gain employment. I know that the Minister drew attention to those who were able to gain employment and who, as implied by the question, had found work during the past year. My colleague Senator Chaney would also have knowledge of some statistics that may be of interest to Senator Watson. Mr N. A. Brown, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, said late last month in a statement on this subject that it was true that one of the major problems facing disabled people in obtaining work experience and training is the fact that they first have to find the employment opportunity and then have to keep it to take part in full, normal community life. I think that would be the objective of all of us. It was particularly stressed during the International Year of Disabled Persons, when the right to work was also stressed very strenuously by disabled people and by those who sought to assist them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Programs of assistance can be given through a range of voluntary bodies and through the Commonwealth Employment Service. I understand that that has improved the employment opportunities of many disabled people. I think what the Minister drew attention to was the fact that so many of those who found their first employment opportunities were able to find permanent employment. This, of course , is what we wish to see. The Minister said that in Queensland last year more than 5,000 people were placed in employment under programs through the Commonwealth Employment Service. A response that he gave on 28 April to a question on this subject contains some interesting statistics. It may be of interest to Senator Watson. I will draw to the attention of the Minister the interest shown in the active promotion of employment opportunities for disabled people to continue what may have been commenced during the International Year of Disabled Persons and to encourage what we hope will be efforts at least at a similar level or at an improved level in future years. If I can find any other statistics that are readily available from the Minister for Employment I will see that Senator Watson is given those statistics.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no need, I believe, to explain why this matter of public importance is raised today. In the last two weeks reports of the Victorian emergency relief project have been released. If we add to those reports subsequent Press reports amplifying and increasing the coverage of those two initial reports of the committee, and if we take into account the personal experiences, I believe, of many senators and members in this Parliament, we will know the seriousness of the situation which faces many of the disadvantaged people in this country and the organisations which are trying to assist them. We have seen in recent times the unusual situation of organisations like the Salvation Army, which are normally reticent in making what may be construed by some as political comment, speaking out loudly about the increasing needs they see, about the inadequacies of the social and economic system which is supposed to alleviate and prevent those needs and the difficulties that they are facing in trying to assist people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had for several years now a concerted attack on the welfare system-the welfare state, if you like-as it exists in this country in which misleading propaganda has been distributed. We have seen the traditional attempt to denigrate the poor and disadvantaged, to blame them for their state-so-called ' blaming the victim'-and at times to question their worthiness to receive support . We have seen all this despite the fact that since 1977, according to figures released by the parliamentary statistics group-figures which I think most people have seen-outlays on social security as a percentage of gross domestic product in this country have been dropping. However, it is in times of economic strife such as this that the usual attempt is made to blame the disadvantaged and those on welfare in the community for our economic ills. The Opposition deplores these attacks and denies their validity. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the other side of the coin needs to be presented and it has been presented partly in the reports to which I referred which were published in the last couple of weeks. The Government needs to be given the opportunity to make a statement on the situation as it exists and as it is reported by those who are close to the scene and not as it is imagined by those who are comfortably off and completely separate from the scene or as it is portrayed by editorialists, politicians and others in the community who may not wish to recognise the problems which exist. People who are poor, who have insufficient goods, services and income to provide them with a minimum acceptable standard of living, exist in our society-which, after all, is one of the richest societies in the world-in disturbing and increasing numbers. Our attention has been drawn to this phenomenon by the increasing unemployment figures and by the evidence reported in the media and given to Senate committees recently by those caring for the homeless, particularly the youth homeless, and, as I said last week, in the report of the Victorian Emergency Relief Committee, which described the increasing demand for emergency relief and the decreasing capacity to cope with this need. </PARA>
<PARA> These reports show that an increasing number of our citizens, some 50,000 in Victoria, have to beg-there is no other word for it-for money, food, clothing and all sorts of assistance, and they must do so in increasing numbers. The high incidence of unemployment, the increasing phenomenon of underemployment, continuing high inflation levels eroding the standard of living of those on fixed incomes, and the high cost of land, building and finance in general all add to the burden of those on low incomes, pensioners and those on benefits. The nature of unemployment, which is now longer in duration-periods of over 12 months are now not at all uncommon-means more long term poor and this group is added to by the increasing number of supporting parents. Yet these two groups are most frequently the targets of conservatives and reactionaries who are only too willing, as I said earlier, to blame the victims for their plight. This problem, I suggest, is worrying and should be worrying to us all because the plight of the poor and the disadvantaged tends to be self-perpetuating. The poor have worse health, worse education and worse housing and are treated less fairly by our systems of justice. Those suffering from ill health or poor education, those who get into difficulties with the law, tend to have less opportunity to work and thus have less adequate housing. This leads to ill health and all the other problems associated with it. This vicious cycle is seen more and more by members of parliament and welfare workers and is generally reflected in the reports which inspired us to bring forward this matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite a social security system which has developed over many years we still have poverty and we still have disadvantages which are unacceptable in what should be an equitable and egalitarian society. At the same time this system is continually under attack for being too generous. By international standards Australia is not a generous country in its care of the disadvantaged, yet, like so many other countries, it has had a so-called welfare backlash. As Professor Peter Wilenski said some time ago in a lecture in Adelaide, Australia is probably the first country to suffer a welfare backlash before its citizens get the welfare. It is in the light of this general attack on the system, such as it is in this country, that it is worth taking a close look at the picture which is presented in the reports from the Victorian group. It shows only one aspect of the problem, but it is an important aspect which reflects the general situation. I do not have time in this short debate to repeat the exercise of comparing our expenditure on welfare with other comparable countries. That has been done many times before. But it is clear that the system which many would make more harsh is not coping at all well and is leaving too many people in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Emergency Relief Project defined emergency relief as 'the provision of one off assistance and, with increasing frequency, on-going assistance to people experiencing continual or recurring crises'. I point out that this varies with the traditional definition and the definition previously used by similar groups which was usually to describe emergency relief as temporary or one off assistance to assist people to cope with a financial crisis . This changing definition is the result of the changing nature of the assistance which has had to be given by agencies such as the Salvation Army, the various city missions and the Society of St Vincent de Paul which have found themselves coping with the more recurrent crises and an increasing number of crises and which doubt their capacity to cope with the increasing numbers in the future. They are unable to give as much assistance as they would like. They have to spread their resources over far more people. They estimate that the amount given in emergency relief in Victoria has increased from $1.9m to $4.6m since the report of the Department of Social Security and the Australian Council of Social Service on the same subject in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> The examination which was made of the people who need such relief is disturbing . Eighty per cent or more are people already on social security pensions and benefits; 27 per cent are single parent families; 53.3 per cent are families with children; 28.2 per cent are on unemployment benefit-a proportion 22 times the percentage of the Victorian population-16.5 per cent are on supporting parents' benefit; and about 15 per cent are on invalid pensions. That approximately 80 per cent of those people are pensioners and beneficiaries points up the inadequacy of our social security payments, particularly for the three most frequent client groups reported in this examination-unemployment beneficiaries, supporting parent beneficiaries or pensioners and invalid pensioners. Those groups make up 60 per cent of the total contacts. Twelve per cent of the people who sought emergency relief had no income when they sought assistance. Most of them were waiting for a payment from the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> Compared with a similar report in 1978 produced by the Department and the Australian Council of Social Service, the recent examination shows an increase in certain groups particularly the single unemployed. Supporting parents remain the single most over-represented group of the social security claimants. The report provides overwhelming evidence from the figures and case studies of individual agencies and from aggregate figures of all the participating agencies of a vastly increased demand, coupled with a reduced ability to give worthwhile aid. The social worker from the Salvation Army's Spring Street centre in Melbourne, Captain Colin Berris, claimed that there was an increase of 135 per cent in interviews between 1979 and 1981 while available funds for that organisation had increased by only 40 per cent. In the same period the average value of a food voucher had dropped from $16.25 to $10 for a family and $5 for an individual. I quote from an article in the Age of 16 April which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Captain Berris denies that people's problems are caused by imprudent financial management, rather than inadequate benefit levels. 'I sit here day after day trying to balance people's budgets and I see they cannot survive on the benefits . It would probably be all right if they did not have to pay gas, electricity bonds, and buy shoes and clothing for their children . . . Senator Chaney should ask himself how much does it cost to feed, clothe, and house three children.'</PARA>
<PARA>We have demonstrated in the Parliament many times, in fact, every time we debate a social services amendment Bill, the number of people receiving payments which have left them below the poverty line. We know that, on March 1982 figures, a single invalid pensioner receives a pension which is $8.60 below the poverty line; a supporting parent beneficiary with three children receives a benefit which is $35.03 below the poverty line; an unemployed breadwinner with a dependent spouse and three children is $42.07 below the poverty line; a single unemployed person over 18 years is $20.20 below the poverty line; and a single unemployed person under 18 years is $42.30 below the poverty line. Those are and always have been disturbing figures. Indexing the pensions and benefits only closes the gap. It does not do much about decreasing the number of people who will require benefits. I turn to a report called 'Advance Australia-on a Food Voucher?' which was produced by the Victorian Emergency Relief Committee. On page 5 the following statement appears:</PARA>
<PARA> Although begging in the streets is forbidden, tens of thousands of people are forced every year to beg for the necessities of life. They beg for cash, food, clothing, household goods and accommodation from charitable agencies like the Salvation Army and the Society of St Vincent de Paul. </PARA>
<PARA> The absolute degradation felt by people who have to swallow their pride and go to an agency and beg for assistance is something most of us in this country know nothing about. Having to tell your story to strangers, and then be offered a totally inadequate amount of assistance, because the agency is low on resources, is a cruel irony when leaders presently boast of prosperity and growth rates ahead of other Western countries. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a world of difference between the rhetoric of a lucky, prosperous country in which all of us can flourish, which we hear so often in this place, and the reality of the situation as described by the welfare agencies. Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of the Salvation Army's Spring Street centre invited politicians, especially the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) who is at the table, to share the shattering experience of interviewing people forced into the indignity of begging for emergency aid. We should briefly look at where these people have to go and what they have to do. First of all they go to friends and relatives for help, because of pride. Then they go to welfare agencies who operate on a shoestring, whose aid is increasingly limited and who must make agonising decisions about giving people a small amount of money, food vouchers, used clothing, toys, et cetera. In Victoria they may have to go to the clerk of the court for a handout from the poor box-that relic of a bygone era-and confront people who vary in their sympathy and experience. They almost always have no training in social work and they require, through no fault of their own, demeaning details of people's poverty. The situation does not exist only in Victoria. In Tasmania there is a similar problem. An article in the Hobart Mercury stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The unprecedented demand for food, blankets, electric radiators, clothes and linen has eroded the stocks in Hobart--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the stocks of the various agencies-</PARA>
<PARA>and an urgent plea has gone out for more donations. </PARA>
<PARA> Record unemployment has altered the role of welfare organisations to one of helping people in peculiar circumstances to providing support for a host of young families in dire straits. </PARA>
<PARA>Both the Salvation Army and the Hobart City Mission point out the difficulties and the problems they are facing. Other agencies, of course, have expressed concern. In the report of the Victorian Committee, Captain Berris from the Salvation Army said:</PARA>
<PARA> But while we continue to spend approximately $4,600 per month on food vouchers at $5 or $10 a time, I cannot help but become extremely depressed about the lot of our fellow Australians who lose their health, jobs or partners, and who have to try to survive on inadequate pensions or benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The President of the Society of St Vincent de Paul, Mr Thomas, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the levels of benefits and pensions are too low initially and do not keep in step with the escalating economy . . . For any-one remote from the disadvantaged areas of life, it is reasonable to assume that those acknowledged as being recipients of pensions and benefits will, of course, always be the major identifiable components who require essential primary or secondary assistance from non-government organisations . . . That is an unfortunate fact of life today. However, the increasing gap between the 'haves' and 'have nots' must be a major concern for each one of us. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that it must be of major concern to this Parliament. We must get over this situation in which people are becoming, as a Melbourne Age editorial this month said, 'beggars, but not by choice'. The Government has taken a certain interest in emergency relief in recent years, but it has been an inadequate interest. It has allocated $500,000 in each of the last two years, but there the matter has stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had unfortunate lengthy discussions about who is, in fact, responsible for funding emergency relief. We have had a government which, at best, questions whether it is responsible and, at worst, denies that it has a role. As 80 per cent of the recipients are the Commonwealth's responsibility we suggest that the Government has two roles: Firstly, to fund, through responsible agencies, an adequate level of relief; and, secondly, to initiate policies which prevent such catastrophic situations occurring. Of course, in the brief time allotted for this debate one cannot go into the details of such policies, but they certainly involve increasing employment opportunities, the great cause of people in need in this area, instead of relying on market forces. In this long awaited economic recovery we must have positive action. We must have income support. We must improve the level of pensions and benefits, particularly those paid to children of pensioners and those on other social security benefits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to have some debate in the Senate this afternoon on matters which touch on the operation of social security and the welfare of some of the most needy citizens of Australia. I think it would be fair to say that not a great deal of debating time in the Parliament is devoted to those people. It is, perhaps, desirable that they should get more time than they do. Senator Grimes, who led for the Opposition in this debate, suggested that the reason for this matter of public importance coming forward was a series of reports which have been issued in Victoria over recent weeks and the newspaper publicity which has flowed from them, as well as the experience of individual senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge the value of reports which attempt to put before the public the reality of the situation of more needy Australians. The value of reports and examinations of this sort, I think, can be very simply demonstrated. In 1978 my Department co-operated with much the same group of people in Victoria as has produced the recent spate of reports. The initial inquiry at that time suggested that a very significant proportion of those seeking emergency relief-some 30 per cent, I think, at that time-were seeking relief because of delays in the administrative procedures of my Department. As a result, the administrative procedures for getting quicker payments from the Department were attended to. It is encouraging to find that in the material which has been issued over recent weeks we are told that of those people seeking emergency relief the percentage has dropped to between 7 and 8 per cent who would attribute their need to problems or delays in my Department. I simply point to that as an indication that there is value in having those things drawn out. It is possible to expose things which need attention, which can be given attention and which will ease the situation of people who are in need. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the Senate also that the production of the report on emergency relief is not something that was done against the wishes of either the Government or my Department. Indeed, we supported to the extent of some $57,000 the study which produced the report on emergency relief. The monitoring project which was put in place was put in place with the active collaboration, support and assistance of the Government. I noticed in the acknowledgments the acknowledgment of at least one officer who was seconded from my Department to work with the agency. Again, I mention that merely to show that there is a genuine concern on the part of the Government to see issues such as this exposed so that they more readily can be given attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Also if there has been any attack on welfare of the sort which concerns Senator Grimes, it has certainly been no part of the Government's role to mount an attack on welfare. For my part, any denigration of the poor would be a particularly reprehensible activity and something of which I would have no part. There are some very difficult areas in the welfare field. I think there is sometimes some very confused thinking about the nature of the debate which ought to take place. I think it is a pity that this debate today probably will not provide a vehicle for the examination of some of the broad and difficult issues which will face Australia if we are to try to ensure a more equal and more just society. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Grimes managed only at the very end of his speech to address himself to some of the possible solutions to the problems about which he expressed concern, I do not think that we will get a wide-ranging debate on the correct economic and other policies which will do something to ensure that Australians are as well off as possible. There are very difficult questions in the taxation field. There are questions of reliance on direct or indirect taxation and of whether we should have capital gains and wealth taxes in this country. They are matters which, we are told by the Sydney Morning Herald, have been wiped from the political agenda because neither the Australian Labor Party nor the Liberal Party of Australia embraces the idea of taxes on capital. Reasons for that were explored by that newspaper recently in a way which I think made a very good contribution to the debate about inequality of incomes and so on in Australia. Apparently all of those matters are off the agenda, both for this debate and, indeed, for debates in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters which perhaps need attention, if we are to direct this question, include the question of whether we would better achieve our social objectives by the provision of universal benefits or by directive measures; that is, by means or income-tested measures. Again, these are very difficult questions. There are a variety of views, even among those who, I think, would identify themselves as the welfare lobby. The recent reports from Victoria suggest, for example, that there are problems in income or means-tested benefits which are best avoided. Some of the problems were explored in an intelligent way by Mr Forell in the Melbourne Age, I think this morning or yesterday morning. </PARA>
<PARA> There are difficulties with respect to the means or income testing of benefits. Those difficulties can be got round by providing universal benefits. But there are very large questions about whether Australia or Australians are prepared to contribute the levels of either taxation or contributions called by a name other than taxation, if we get into the field of national superannuation, which will support a level of universal benefits that will be adequate to remove any traces of poverty from this community. They are genuine and difficult questions which would face any government in this country. They are questions which do not admit to easy answers and do not admit to absolutely right answers; rather, they admit to possible differences of approach which need to be explored, tested and drawn out so that the people of Australia can, along with their governments, make sensible choices for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to hear Senator Grimes's acknowledgment, towards the end of his speech, that the matters of employment and unemployment are basic to these questions that are raised in the debate today. That means that we are entitled to ask what sorts of policies are likely to affect that key factor in terms of who is likely to be poor in Australia and who is not? Is it a fact, for example, that more taxation will encourage employment, or will more taxation tend to increase unemployment and, hence, social need and difficulty? Is greater government spending likely to be helpful or unhelpful? Some history within the last 10 years in this country suggests that a mere expansion of government spending may not, of itself, be helpful to creating employment but may, indeed, create the conditions for disemployment. I refer to 1974 in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> There are serious questions about whether a larger deficit or an easier money supply would in the short term or in the long term produce more or less employment. These are serious questions for government and I would address them in this debate in the short time which is available merely by saying that the economic policies of this Government have always been directed to achieving the maximum sustainable levels of employment in Australia because we accept that that is a matter which goes very centrally to the welfare of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important question which is raised in this area is: What are the causes of the claimed increased need in this community? I think it is instructive to look at what the reports state, whether they be reports from the groups in Victoria which have recently published reports from the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat which published a report on poverty measurement recently or reports from Professor Henderson's group. I think it is instructive that all of those indicators point to the same thing, namely, that increased unemployment and an increasing number of single parent families are very significant factors in increasing the hardship within the community. I have just addressed the matter of economic policy and the policies which are most likely to reduce unemployment and to keep employment as high as possible. But I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that we have a situation in which there is an ever-increasing number of sole parent families. Those sole parent families are the result of personal choices by members of the Australian community. Those choices are creating real hardship for the families involved. That is a matter which is giving rise to greatly increased government expenditure and taxpayer contribution. There appears to be no end to that in sight. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to a couple of matters concerning the report on emergency relief in Victoria. That report, along with the other reports which have been issued, has been put to study in my Department because, of course, we are anxious to learn what those reports can tell us. My advice, which is very preliminary advice, is that the report on emergency relief does not actually quantify changes in the size of the population needing relief. What it does is infer an increase based on the premise that agency expenditures increased by nearly 100 per cent between 1978 and 1981 with the actual units of payment being made dropping. Of course, it also draws upon the experience of people in the field such as Captain Berris, who was quoted by Senator Grimes. But I think we can accept that the agencies which are in the field are having increasing demands made upon them and that they are having increasing difficulty in meeting those demands. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the conclusion that frequency of requests is increasing the report does not adduce substantial evidence of that. If honourable senators look at table 10 of the report-I suggest that honourable senators who are interested do that-they will find that, rather than it demonstrating that there has been an increase in the frequency with which people are seeking emergency relief, it demonstrates that the position was relatively stable between the period when the previous study was done in 1978 and the period when the studies whose results were recently released were done. We find that in the 1978 study 55 per cent of those who sought emergency relief had previously had emergency relief. The figure in the more recent reports is 55.9 per cent. In the 1978 study-to complete those figures-45 per cent had not had previous assistance. The figure was 44.1 per cent in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> A relative stability has been shown in the actual figures which have been produced. We rely on oral evidence, apparently, to draw a different conclusion. The analysis of the peak December-January period shows that 85 per cent of recipients emergency relief were going to an agency for the first time. So during that period a great number of the people were simply first time seekers of emergency relief. In that sense the report does not offer firm evidence to support the contention that the role of emergency relief agencies has changed in relation to the frequency with which they make relief payments to the same clients. </PARA>
<PARA> Another fairly important point from the point of view of determining what is the best approach to meeting the problems that the claims for emergency relief evidence is the fact that, whilst a great majority of claimants are recipients of pensions and benefits from my Department, the figures indicate that some 94 per cent of the clients of my Department do not seek additional assistance. In other words, the figure disclose that approximately 6 per cent of recipients of benefits from the Department of Social Security seek emergency relief, if the figures, such as they are, are reliable. The significance of that is that, if one is concerned about that group of people in the community who are unable to manage or who are requiring additional assistance from their fellow citizens, to approach the problems of a minority of pensioners and beneficiaries on the basis that all pensions and benefits should be substantially increased is to approach them in a very expensive way. I think that is a matter which needs very careful consideration, given that the overall approach is likely to be extremely expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> Many welfare groups come to me and put propositions that various levels of average weekly earnings are the appropriate targets for which the Government should aim. Currently, for example, it is suggested that we should increase pensions and benefits to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings with a long term aim of increasing them to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings. I proffer the comment that that is a very expensive way of trying to meet the problem of that minority of people who are unable to live on present pensions and benefits. The cost of going to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings would be $870m. That would be an additional $870m at current prices. To go to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings would cost $2.7 billion. I very much doubt whether a government, be it a government in which the Minister for Social Security was Senator Grimes or in which I was the Minister for Social Security, would see its way clear to increase those payments by an amount which would add to personal income tax at the rate of about $10 per week per taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the figures disclosed by the report-that a relatively small proportion seek that additional assistance-suggest that we should be approaching the problem in a way which tries to define the people who are in that difficult situation and directing assistance to them rather than universally increasing levels of assistance at very much greatly increased cost to all taxpayers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is on the basis that we are something under 23 per cent now. It is calculated on the basis of recent figures. A point was also raised concerning where responsibility lies in this area. That is a matter which I find distasteful to debate for obvious reasons because it is distasteful to be arguing about who is responsible while there are areas of real need. But it is a fact that the Commonwealth accepts the very broad responsibility for income maintenance. Presently my Department is spending about $10 billion a year. Next year I have little doubt that, with no change at all, the bill will go up well in excess of $1 billion. We have accepted very broad responsibilities to literally millions of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Traditionally, meeting the short term or emergency needs of people who are in difficulty has been the responsibility of State and private agencies. That had always been so in Australia until a couple of years ago when this Government took the initiative of making a limited amount of money-just under half a million dollars-available to agencies in that field. I think it is important that the responsibilities of the Commonwealth should be met by the Commonwealth and that we should avoid the Commonwealth seeking to pick up the responsibilities of States in these areas and thus reducing its ability to do its own work well. The more widely we spread our effort the less effectively can we do the job. I am, therefore, against a substantial shift of responsibility from the States to the Commonwealth in any area in which traditionally States had responsibility. The shifts tend to be in the other direction. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, in 1980, at their instance, the States ceased having responsibility for the maintenance of deserted wives for the first six months of desertion. Prior to that time the State welfare departments had the responsibility of looking after the income maintenance of women who had been deserted and left without support. The Commonwealth picked up that responsibility. Indeed there was a period when we shared that expense with the States. The States chose to pass that full responsibility to the Commonwealth in 1980. That meant a saving to the States of about $32m. There was an immediate assumption of new cost responsibility by the Commonwealth, a lifting of responsibility from the States and, I would have thought, a freeing up of welfare resources which should have made it easier for the States to meet their welfare obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the Senate that in considering where responsibility lies, whether it is for the relief of poverty or for the conduct of services generally, it is reasonable to expect the States to meet their traditional responsibilities and the Commonwealth to meet its responsibilities. The $500,000 which we pay to voluntary agencies is a very small proportion of assistance in this field. I do not believe that that very small amount should be used as a lever to suggest that all other agencies, be they State or private, have thereby given up their responsibility in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has a continuing commitment to an adequate income maintenance system. I take this debate to be an important debate on areas in which we might find inadequacies. I point to our continuing major commitment to indexation, which is a needs-based policy which Professor Henderson said was basic to the maintenance of the welfare system. That is costing the Australian taxpayer between $700m and $800m a year, and is an important part of our commitment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The matter of public importance under consideration today concerns the increasing number of citizens needing emergency relief because of inadequate income and services. This was a concern which lay behind Notice of Motion No. 45 in the name of Senator Don Chipp which was introduced into the Senate last week. This notice of motion, in part, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in the opinion of the Senate, the Government is failing in its responsibility to provide adequate income support for Australian families and single people in need and that the Government should consider the following measures as a matter of urgency, but no later than in the Budget for the year 1982-83 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>At the moment I do not want to go into what those following measures were but I will do so a little later because I have never been one who likes to disappoint the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney)-heaven knows. A little later in the debate I want to specify not only where the measures should be taken but also how they can be paid for. The rest of Senator Chipp's notice of motion went on to identify the Australian Democrats' list of priorities, together with certain taxation reforms designed to ensure that the additional funds necessary would be made available. I do not think anybody in this country is not aware of the fact that there is an alarming increase in the number of people seeking emergency relief from voluntary agencies. There are plenty of statistics to show that that is so. The Salvation Army, for instance, has seen the number of its interviews for emergency aid per month jump by 235 per cent since September 1979 . </PARA>
<PARA> According to the report of the Victorian Council of Social Service 80 per cent of people seeking emergency relief did so while receiving government pensions or benefits. A further 12 per cent had no income at the time of applying for relief , and most of those were awaiting a Department of Social Security payment. The proportion of those seeking relief while in receipt of the unemployment benefit has increased from 17.2 per cent in 1978 to 28.2 per cent in 1982, or almost one -third. If those are the available statistics on those who in fact are seeking relief, one wonders just what exactly the situation is with regard to people who have not yet, for one reason or another, been forced formally to seek relief from a voluntary agency, as happened in the case of the invalid pensioner I saw in my office last Friday. </PARA>
<PARA> This man was dressed as well as he could afford to be, although his attire was rather shabby. He was a quiet man who still retained a certain semblance of his dignity. He has a wife who is also an invalid pensioner. He said-I believe him when he gave me some written evidence a little later in the interview-that he budgeted strictly each year allowing for, as much as his crystal ball gazing would let him, whatever inflationary trends were likely to eat away at his income. Yet, as he pointed out to me, increased charges for electricity, interest, oil heating, gas, telephone and water rates et cetera in the past 12 months have resulted in his being almost $400 over budget, even allowing for increases in his pension. He gave me a letter in support of his claims. It stated:</PARA>

<PARA>He was not begging; he simply came to see me to see whether there was some way I could get him out of the hole in which he appears to be. The point is that he as yet has not gone to an agency looking for assistance. He has not had to do that yet because he is fortunate enough to live in a neighbourhood in which people who can give do so when they can. If their pea crop is particularly good they hand some over. If they have stripped their apricot trees and made jam they hand over some bottles. If there is a glut of tomatoes he gets a few jars of chutney. That is the sort of thing that neighbours and friends do for neighbours and friends. It does not diminish the dignity of those people to the same extent as formally approaching an agency does, but it helps them along with their budget. I am not knocking that in any way at all. I think it is great to see that Australians still practise this form of economic mateship. </PARA>
<PARA> The man went on to say that he could no longer afford to insure or register his car. He did not see this car as a luxury, particularly as he and his wife are invalid pensioners and they find moving around in any other way rather difficult . He said that he and his wife were looking for other areas in which to save money. He made the point that he is a State superannuant and that this means that he and his wife get only part of a social security pension. He is considering asking that his cost of living allowance on his superannuation not be increased in order to retain the very essential concessions he gets with his part pension. I stress again that this man and his wife are not among the increasing number of unemployed people, single parents, pensioners or struggling families who are placing a heavy burden on all voluntary welfare agencies in this country. He is a hidden statistic. </PARA>
<PARA> The Age editorial of 20 April, on the other hand, had some very telling remarks to make about government income support schemes and their inadequacy and the need for this situation to be reversed. The editorial was terse, to the point of being rude, in some of the comments it made on a government which could allow this condition to develop. I am in no way questioning the Minister's commitment to supplying the needy with the services and income support that they need; I am questioning the whole Government's commitment to supplying these sorts of services and income support. I have said before-I will repeat it now-that I firmly believe that the Minister is a man of infinite compassion and understanding who is doing all he can to correct an invidious situation.

<PARA>BEGGARS, BUT NOT BY CHOICE</PARA>
<PARA> In 1978 a report on emergency relief prepared by a voluntary agency, the Action Research Centre, appeared under the title: ''Life Wasn't Meant to Be Impossible' '. Unfortunately, as an increasing number of Australians are discovering, life in present-day Australia is, if not impossible, at least extraordinarily difficult. Those who are feeling the pinch most are those who always suffer when times are bad: the unemployed, single or deserted mothers, large families and pensioners (particular invalid pensioners). More and more, they are being forced to beg for assistance from welfare agencies because their Government welfare payments-particularly those which are not indexed-have failed to keep pace with the rises in living costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Proof of this is to be found in a report prepared by the Victorian Council of Social Service and released yesterday. It shows that the demand for emergency relief from people in Victoria without food or money almost trebled last year. In the first six months of 1981 there were 13,335 requests for cash or food, compared with 5,013 during the same period in 1980. Significantly, 80 per cent of those seeking emergency relief did so while at the same time receiving Government pensions and benefits. Where emergency relief was once regarded as a one-off payment to meet a financial crisis, the report says voluntary agencies are now being asked to supplement income permanently for an increasing number of people who are living in a chronic state of poverty, punctuated by periodic crises. </PARA>
<PARA> While the report is confined to Victoria, there is no reason to believe that the situation it documents is peculiar to this State. Indeed a report by the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat on poverty six months ago found that 1.7 million Australians were living below the Henderson poverty line. Even after applying more stringent tests to the concept of poverty, the secretariat found that 1.06 million, plus another 130,000 juveniles living away from home, were living in poverty. Increasingly Australia is becoming a divided society. The gap between the haves and the have-nots is growing, partly as a result of weaknesses in the tax system; and more and more people-particularly the young-are being excluded from a fair opportunity to share in the country's wealth. </PARA>
<PARA> While this should be a matter of concern to Governments, both State and Federal , there is little evidence that this is in fact the case. On the contrary, both have been locked in a constitutional argument over responsibility for those in need. The short answer is that both are responsible, and both can assist. Ensuring income security for the disadvantaged in our society should not be left to the voluntary welfare agencies. The Federal Government, for its part, should as a matter of urgency re-examine the whole range of pensions and benefits. Old age and invalid pensions have been indexed since 1977. But unemployment benefits and benefits paid to single parents (such as the children's and guardians' allowances) are reviewed each year, and as a result have fallen well behind the cost of living. The benefit for unemployed 15 to 17-year-olds, for example, has been frozen at $36 for the past five years. The Government argues that to give them more would encourage them not to work. Yet as the Victorian Council of Social Service report showed, people on unemployment benefits were the major group seeking emergency relief. If the Government cannot find work for them, or sustain a buoyant economy, it should at least ensure that they don't starve. </PARA>
<PARA> Welfare payments have increased markedly in the past 10 years. Nonetheless there are still areas of pressing need-single parents and the deserving unemployed especially-and the next Budget should see a substantial increase in their welfare payments. At the same time the Government should seriously consider the suggestion made by the Minister for Trade and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch, during the Lowe by-election-that the means test should be re-introduced for all age pensions and other social security benefits. It is neither socially just nor equitable that social security benefits should be available to many thousands of well-off middle-class people who do not need them while hundreds of thousands of other Australians live in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> The State Government, for its part, could help by providing gas and electricity subsidies or concessions to those receiving pensions or benefits. In its policy speech the Victorian ALP promised to extend to single parents the present pensioner concessions, such as reduced rates and fares on public transport. There is scope for extending this kind of help. Ultimately, the aim must be to find ways of ensuring income security for all Australians. It is a moral responsibility which no Government, whatever its political coloring, can avoid. </PARA>

If the Government is not sure exactly how it can solve the problems that the Age editorial brings forward, we on this side of the House are not afraid to show it where to turn. Earlier in this debate I mentioned the notice of motion that Senator Chipp had given. This was aimed at substantially increasing benefits and pensions while at the same time recovering some of the money presently denied to the Government from those already wealthy members of the community who are avoiding paying their fair contribution to Consolidated Revenue-such as mining companies, tax evaders and so on. The point that Senator Chipp makes in his notice of motion is that if these people supply to Consolidated Revenue their moral dues, neither the Minister nor this Government will have any difficulty at all in facing up to their responsibilities for that minority of people, or what the Minister refers to as a minority of people, who are particularly needy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. We believe that it is simply not acceptable that a resource rich country such as Australia should have 50,000 Victorians and another 200,000 people from other Australian States forced each year, and in growing numbers, to seek aid from organisations such as the Salvation Army, the Uniting Church's care agency, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Mission of St James and St John and regional and suburban voluntary welfare agencies, as well as State departments of community welfare. In New South Wales and South Australia, government relief programs are stretched past their limit. In Perth-I understand that Senator Giles will be covering this in more detail-a special crisis fund has been launched to make grants or loans available to the needy. The responsibility for income security rests fairly, squarely and constitutionally with the Federal Government. The measures that Senator Chipp outlines in his notice of motion could well be covered if, for instance, a mining resource tax were levelled at the pithead; if a capitals gains tax were to operate, excluding of course principal residences and other things such as small farms and small businesses; and if there were a concerted attack on tax evasion. We estimate that this would raise a total of something like $1.5 billion, considerably outstripping the amount necessary to give the needy in Australia a reasonable level of income security. A spokesman for the South Australian Council of Social Service has recently said that a survey is being conducted of its member organisations involved in emergency relief. The spokesperson said that indications at the moment are that the South Australian situation is particularly serious. Despite the fact that Mr Burdett, the State Minister, has announced a further $50,000 allocation for the Department for Community Welfare in South Australia, that Department-it is doing the best it can under exceptionally difficult circumstances-is still only in the position of being able to provide emergency relief of $1.20 per person per day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance that has been brought before us today by the Opposition is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The increasing number of citizens needing emergency relief because of inadequate income and services. </PARA>
<PARA>This is one more time the Opposition has brought such a matter before us without proposing any remedies and without saying what we should do about it. I do not believe any person on this side of the chamber would refute that larger numbers of people are applying for emergency relief, particularly for food and clothing. This has been mentioned by all the voluntary organisations which I have visited. However, that is not the whole story. Those agencies also tell us it is not necessarily the need for additional income that is the problem but the need for education and often re-education on how the recipients could budget their finances. The agencies stress the need both for education in budgeting and for information as to what benefits the recipients are entitled to receive. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give an example of the people who go to these agencies. We are told that deserted mothers go there for help immediately after their husbands have walked out. There were 250,513 divorces between 1975 and 1980. So 250,000-odd women have been left, perhaps without any money. For the mothers amongst those their first port of call is these agencies. The women have no idea what to do or where to go. They go immediately to one of these voluntary agencies for food and information. To substantiate the need for education on budgeting, let me use the figure of the Victorian Council of Social Service. It shows that roughly 94 per cent of all social service beneficiaries never seek emergency relief. In other words, 94 per cent of pensioners on benefits manage their finances. Before the Opposition or anyone else can claim that I am suggesting that the amount the Government gives social security recipients enables them to live in the lap of luxury and that they are squandering their money, I stress that I am certainly not doing so. I am merely pointing out that as much as we would like to greatly increase the benefits there are limits to government expenditure. Total expenditure by government on social security in the last 10 years has risen considerably. It has risen from $1.2 billion in the years 1969-70 to $3.8 billion in the Labor years-1974-75-to $9.89 billion in 1980-81. It is estimated to rise to $11 billion this financial year. That means that every taxpayer paid in 1970-71 less than $5 a week in current figures out of his tax for the welfare system. It was $12 in 1974-75. In 1979-80 it was just $30. It is estimated that it will be $40 a week for every taxpayer in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Can we just cast our minds back perhaps a few years to the comments of the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in 1975 when the Labor Party was responsible for payments to pensioners and beneficiaries. I am well aware that these quotations have been used before in this place, but I think they are very important and put the dilemma of all governments in perspective. Mr Hayden, in the last Budget Speech he made in this place, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to provide more and more government services or transfer payments from the Budget without ultimately having to pay for them through cutting back after-tax earnings via increased taxes. It is not possible to get quarts out of pint pots . . . Many articulate groups in the community champion their favourite causes and I know that we will soon be hearing from them. I hope that, when, we do hear, they will help the Government and me by indicating what alternative expenditure cuts might have been made or what tax increases they would be willing to bear . . . I now want to say something about general welfare programmes. What we can do immediately in the welfare area is enormously restricted by the extent of our other programmes, and what we can responsibly spend. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that really makes it very clear that all governments-not just this Government-have their problems. Much as we would like to spend larger amounts, that has to be weighed in balance with the rest of the Budget. Senator Grimes and Senator Haines have not told us what they would do. Senator Grimes said very broadly that he would expect us to increase payments across the board. He did not say by how much. He did not say in which particular areas. He just said: 'Increase payments'. It is quite an incredible situation for the Opposition to bring before the people of Australia a matter that it considers of great public importance and just say bravely 'increase expenditure' without saying where we should make our cuts, although Senator Grimes said, again very broadly, that we should make remedies in the area of tax evasion. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely none. The Opposition should not bring on a matter of public importance and not proceed to say what it would do were it in government. I believe that the areas of greatest concern to our Government are the sole parents and the long term unemployed. In 1974 there were 26,286 sole parents and it cost the Government $40.6m to support them. It is estimated that in 1982 there will be 124,000 sole parents and that it will cost not $40.6m but $600m to support them. From 1975 to 1980, as I have already said, there were 250,513 divorces. That is an incredible number. The majority of mothers in that area have to rely on the taxpayer to get the deserted wives pension. We do not have the figures for the number of children included in that number of divorces, but it is estimated that by the time 1982 is out there will be over 340,000 divorced people in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What have we done in this area? The Government has done a tremendous amount. There has been twice-yearly indexation in line with the consumer price index for all pensioners and for the majority of beneficiaries. This includes unemployed persons with families too. There have been increased benefits and family allowances. I cite a few figures because I believe that this is tremendously important. In 1976 a single parent with, say, five children-they are the people who I believe are really in trouble-received over and above their pensions as a result of the increases in children's benefits, the mother's guardian allowances , family allowances and so on, an additional $51.75 per week. That has gone up to $95.05 in 1982 additional to their pensions. This has increased because the benefit for the children has increased from $7.50 to $10; the guardian's allowance has risen from $2 to $6, or $8 depending on the age of the child; and, of course, the family allowance for larger families has gone up considerably this year. Again, the free health card for the parent and dependants has been given to both the unemployed and the single parents. Emergency relief to the tune of $500,000 has been provided for the first time to community welfare agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980 the Commonwealth Government took over the responsibility from the States, as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) said earlier, for the payment of supporting parent benefits. It was considered the States responsibility to support the mothers for the first six months of eligibility. It has saved the States $31.5m. Where have the States spent that $31.5m? Have they, indeed, put that in the area of assistance to this particular group? I would like to know where it has gone. In 1981 supplementary assistance was increased from $5 a week to $8 a week. The Government extended family support service schemes for another three years. An amount of $10m has been provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Long term unemployment is the other area of greatest concern, but it can be helped, as Senator Chaney said earlier, only through a well run economy. All I ask is that we look at the inflation rate in the Labor years because in the Labor years inflation was running between 16 and 17 per cent. The inflation rate at the moment is just under 10 per cent. If we look at unemployment in those years we find what happened as a result of that inflation. The unemployment rate rose from the usual 2.2 per cent that had been the Australian average to 4.9 per cent. It was 2.2 per cent in 1973-74 and it rose to 4.9 per cent in 1975-76. The unemployment rate has risen to 5.8 per cent in 1980-81. It increased in the first few months of this year but went down last month. We have yet to see what the average unemployment rate will be for 1982. If we want more jobs for the unemployed the answer is a lower inflation rate and a healthy economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines told us of the budget of a pensioner who came to her explaining how he was not able to make ends meet. Senator Haines said that, included in that budget, were home loan repayments. She said that it was not a sin-I wholeheartedly agree with her-to buy one's own home. However, she went on to say that this pensioner was now unable to meet the running costs of his car. I believe that it is the Government's responsibility to spend taxpayers' money in the areas of greatest need. We must get back to our original priority of helping those people in greatest need. I do not believe that the taxpayer should be meeting such home repayments no matter how justified they may be or perhaps even the costs of running a car. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines and Senator Grimes both said that there was a high percentage of social security beneficiaries and that they constituted the main group receiving emergency assistance. My only answer to that statement is that if it were not so we would not be focussing on the correct group of people who--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I assume that the people about whom Senator Walters professes to be most concerned-those in greatest need-would account for the misplaced obsession of the Government with single-income families. Under the taxation changes introduced in the last Budget the Government will forgo about $1,000m in revenue through its subsidy of $830 to each taxpayer who can afford to have a non-earning wife. The family of a taxpayer on average weekly earnings with two children received almost 6 per cent of disposable income in financial assistance for children in 1975-76, whereas that family received less than 3.8 per cent in that way in 1980. Australia's current level of financial assistance to families is one of the lowest of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries, along with the United States of America and Japan. At the same time, Australia is one of the most generous in its financial assistance to a taxpayer with a dependent spouse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Professor Else Oyen, a professor from the University of Bergen in Norway, who was the Australian Broadcasting Commission's guest of honour on 27 July 1980, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Many years ago, during the first few years of this century, people from all over the world travelled to Australia to look with awe and admiration at the Australian welfare state. Here was the cradle of solidarity with less fortunate citizens. Here was the concern with society, responsibility for all its members and the willingness to take responsibility for that concern. A series of welfare programmes saw the daylight, like the old age pension, the invalid pension, maternity allowances, as well as a state arbitration system. </PARA>
<PARA>Needless to say, Professor Oyen was bitterly disappointed to find that in 1980 large and persistent poverty gaps had not been closed and appeared to have widened. Levels of benefit had been condemned by not being sufficiently adjusted to allow for inflation and welfare rights had not been established for the population at large. Far from establishing such rights, this Government has established a large and growing proportion of people who are completely dependent upon social security payments, not just for days or for weeks but for months and for years. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1973 we were shocked by the findings of the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, which told us that the poorest Australians were those in single- parent families. There are now about 200,000 lone parent pensioners in Australia , many of them condemned to long term dependency and long term poverty. June 1981 figures show that 87 per cent of supporting parents had no additional income or received less than $20 additional income a week and 77 per cent of A- class widows were in a similar situation. There is no incentive for these women to take poorly paid part time jobs because the penalty on lost pension, lack of child care at reasonable cost and lack of school and vocational care create insuperable problems. The cost to the community of 80,000 B-class widows is a direct consequence of the unemployability of women who have been out of the work force for decades and whose re-entry is apparently not the concern of the Government. The future social costs to this country of children whose only experience has been of poverty and privation is likely to be substantial. Current costs are homelessness, alcohol and drug dependency, alienation, psychological disturbance, despair and suicide. These are already with us. </PARA>
<PARA> At the second Poverty Inquiry Conference in Melbourne in September 1980 Professor Henderson identified growth in unemployment as his reason for poverty being so much worse than it was in 1973. This produced three main effects on the taxpayers and on the Government decisions that were being made. He made three additional points: Firstly a check on the growth of real wages in an attempt to reduce the rate of inflation and an increasing reluctance to pay taxes to provide income maintenance for the poor; secondly, a compounding effect of slow economic growth while the numbers of pensioners and beneficiaries continue to increase-subsequently, a reduction in the real value of the unemployment benefit and the family allowance while prices and costs continue to rise-and, thirdly, the wave of reaction against taxation and government expenditure which has restrained the growth of public employment in the service sector while the manufacturing industry has not taken up the slack. </PARA>
<PARA> Do Australians really understand what lobbyists are talking about when they call for tax cuts across the board? As the value of each welfare dollar has diminished the number of applications for aid has increased by leaps and bounds. It has more than doubled over the last two or three years. A suburban financial counselling centre in Western Australia reports a trebling of calls on its facilities over the three years of its existence under the family support scheme . This service has had some money available for relief but it will have none after 30 June this year. The one below-award salary provided for this project is shared by two overworked counsellors, another common and deplorable consequence of inadequate funding policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite Federal Government contributions since 1979, emergency relief is still very largely dependent upon private and voluntary funds. Government funding of all types in Victoria has been identified as providing 23.75 per cent of the total funding-that included State and local funding-in 1981-82. Because the problem is so diverse and because it is impossible to say how much and how many people are affected and exactly who are those in need of emergency relief, one is certainly very optimistic about the fact that emphasis has now been given by the Government to the need actually to identify the answers to these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 and 1977 the main causes of need for emergency help were cyclical or truly emergency ones related to particular localities where manufacturing industry had been forced to close down, where industrial disputes had deprived people of income for a period, or where particular geographical and locational factors were involved. This changed in 1979-80, becoming endemic rather than epidemic. The Western Australian Council of Social Service received funding from the Western Australian Department for Community Welfare to employ someone to commence a similar system of identification which not only will establish an emergency relief uniform recording system but also will facilitate the co- ordination of existing services. Most of the money available is private as distinct from public but it is rapidly drying up. As we were told today, the Salvation Army has had to reduce from $16 to $10 its average payment for food relief. Some of the trust funds work in a rather discretionary fashion. Their practices could be identified as punitive and sometimes bureaucratic. They are certainly slow moving. I know of families who have been evicted while the fund that had been approached was making up its mind whether to help with the rent arrears which were the cause of the eviction. It has been described to me that money from these funds simply keeps the masses off the streets and provides a supplementary dole system. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect on individuals is cumulative degradation, loss of dignity, loss of power over decision-making, marital tension, enforced relocation which amounts to dislocation, insecurity and loss of personal direction. Those who seek financial counselling are not suffering from mismanagement, despite the impression that Senator Walters has apparently gained in her State; they are suffering from lack of money and in many cases the condition is chronic. The people who are most at risk have no reserves to cope with unexpected events such as sickness in the family, rental rises, escalating electricity, gas and water charges or a death in the family. I am glad to hear that 94 per cent of pensioners are coping but the other 6 per cent still constitutes many people. They are those who are repeatedly being seen by the assistance agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Other elements which certainly do not help families on very low incomes to cope are the lack of child care, which means that the individual responsible for the care of young children is unable to seek work; the lack of opportunity to work; the lack of training-this boils down again, I suppose, to the lack of jobs, the shortage of housing and the high prices that must be paid for housing. One supporting parent, whom I know with three children finds that her income is just sufficient to feed and house her family. Like many in a similar plight she has no resources of her own to call upon for electricity, gas or water rates. Like many, if emergency relief is not available, she and her children have to move in with relatives and the electricity and gas is cut off. The water supply is reduced to a dribble in Western Australia. The cost of reconnection is then an added burden on the funds. It is a common practice now for the emergency relief services to provide sufficient food for two weeks for a family so that the bills for electricity can be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> A recently widowed woman of 43 with no children who will be on unemployment benefit until she turns 50-she is unlikely to find a job after 20 years out of the work force-receives $116 a fortnight. She pays $70 a fortnight on her house- she is another one of these 'imprudent' people who happen to be paying for their own home, if I understand the interjections from the senators opposite. She pays $40 a fortnight for food and other essentials. She must allow $10 a fortnight for electricity. I think the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) would be well aware of the essential nature of that particular little budgeting strategy in Western Australia. She is already $4 overspent on her benefit every fortnight and has no money with which to repay her personal loan taken out to cover the expenses of her husband's illness and death. </PARA>
<PARA> Another widow, with a 16-year-old son, who will also be on unemployment benefit until aged 50, unless miraculously a job turns up, has been forced to leave her home and has now to pay $110 a fortnight rent out of her $116 a fortnight pension. No other rental accommodation is available for her. I again quote Else Oyen:</PARA>
<PARA> You firmly believe that Australia is one of the highest taxed countries in the world. This is hardly true. A recent survey of taxation in the 25 OECD countries shows that Australia is number 21 on the list. </PARA>
<PARA>We have a wretchedly inequitable collection and transferral system to try to move taxation from those who are comfortable in this wealthy society and to provide for a dignified standard of subsistence-let alone living-for increasing numbers of Australians. I am not convinced that decent, taxpaying Australians are satisfied with the present state of affairs. I join with those who call for a reformed tax system, the expansion of public sector 'human' services, immediate action not by emergency relief-life is one unremitting emergency for too many people-but by identifying those who are most vulnerable and assuring them of a decent income. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak today in support of and, indeed, to applaud the work that is being carried out by the Department of Social Security in this country under extremely tight monetary conditions and with work load increasing almost daily. The subject matter of today's matter of public importance is not only a complete and arrogant disregard of the facts but also a slur on the hard-working social security officers, social workers and clerical and other personnel who deal with people in need. The Federal Government, through the Department of Social Security under the efficient and sensitive direction of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), is providing an enormous financial service to those in our community who are in need in almost every aspect and sphere of assistance ranging from the unemployment benefit, through assistance to pensioners, care of the aged and handicapped, family allowances, child care services, emergency services, Aboriginal assistance, help for the disabled and homeless to indirect assistance to community organisations and programs. Here, too, I pay a tribute to the many organisations in our community which are helping people in need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government is putting its money where its mouth is. It is substantially helping those who are less fortunate in our community. Even though this Government is in the process of restraint in government expenditure, it has not failed in its responsibility to protect the more vulnerable groups in our community. Australia's most precious institution-the family-constitutes the major area of priority for this Government. The 1976 changes brought in low income families excluded from previous arrangements in the family allowance scheme. This provided assistance to some 300,000 families with 800,000 children who had rceived little or no help under the old arrangements. The 1981-82 Budget increased the allowance for large families, with the result that more than half a million families have been assisted, including nearly half the dependent children in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> In a similar endeavour to help those in needy groups the Government has increased the tax threshold since 1975-76 by 66 per cent to $4,195. It has increased the dependent spouse and sole parent rebates from $400 to $830 and from $200 to $580 respectively since 1975-76, which is an increase of more than 100 per cent. I would very much like to see an increase in the amount of tax rebate for a dependent spouse. I would like to see a more realistic taxation deduction. I would like to see the rebate of $830 increased, as somebody suggested, to $1,340 or a little bit more than that if possible. I suppose that it is easy enough to make suggestions. If that suggestion were implemented there might not be quite such a call for child care services, because more money would be available at home. We might find that if there were not such a call for child care services more jobs would be available and so many married women would not have to go to work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has altered the health arrangements to meet more specifically the needs of low income groups. Pensioners and beneficiaries, too, have seen changes designed to assist their special needs. The Government has introduced a twice-yearly full indexation of most pensions and benefits. There have been increases in supplementary assistance directed to those most in need. There was an increase in additional pension benefits for children in 1980-81-a rise from $ 7.50 to $10 per child per week. There also have been increases in the mothers and guardians allowances from $4 to $6 a week. There has been an extension of public health benefits for sickness and supporting parents beneficiaries and there has been an extension of Commonwealth support for sole parents. All of these initiatives have been directed towards assisting the low income families- those in most need-and I believe that they have done just that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government has made some valuable changes with regard to age pensions and beneficiaries. It has introduced automatic twice-yearly indexation of pensions in line with consumer price index increases to ensure that pensioners are protected against inflation. This has meant that the standard rate of pension has risen by over 70 per cent since 1976. Unfortunately, of course, costs have also risen substantially in that time. The change from a means test on assets to a test on income only has meant that the number of individuals eligible to receive government assistance has increased. This initiative has assisted many people who were disadvantaged under the old system and has enabled them to obtain some pension support. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government outlay for social welfare has increased from $6,367m when the present Government came to office in 1975-76 to $11,357m. It has almost doubled. It now amounts to almost 28 per cent of the 1981-82 Budget outlay. That is a lot of money in anybody's language. Assistance to the aged has increased from $2.2 billion in 1975-76 to $4 billion in 1980-81, and a further increase to $4.6 billion is estimated for 1981-82. The Government has raised the upper limits at which people may receive some pension payment from $61.90 to $159.40 per week for a single person and by $103.40 to $266.90 per week for a married couple. These limits change in accordance with CPI increases. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these initiatives show the commitment of the Fraser Government to maintaining the position of those individuals who are solely or almost totally dependent on the pension. The tapered income test which replaced the old means test has been a step towards ensuring that those in greatest financial need receive the greatest financial assistance, while at the same time offering some reward to others for self-help provision. I feel that there is something to be said for allowing permissible earnings of pensioners to be $50 a week. I think that is a step that the Government could take. I am sure that it would be very helpful to pensioners. We would have to be careful that this allowance did not put pensions into the tax bracket, but I am quite sure that our Treasurer (Mr Howard) will take that into consideration in the next Budget. The Department of Social Security also provides an important range of welfare services directly to individuals and to organisations throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as providing these services, an important aspect of the operations of the Department of Social Security is its assistance through subsidy programs to State, local government and community organisations which provide services to people in need. The Federal Government outlayed $9.4m in subsidies to help fund a total of 128 projects under the handicapped persons welfare program. Under a three-year scheme a further $23m will be made available for approved projects. I have been associated with a project in the Woodridge area in which my son-in-law is very interested. Under that project help and therapy are given to handicapped people. The Lutheran Church also has such projects in Dalby and Southport. All churches are very much concerned with helping people in need. We must give thanks to all those who provide this assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The program for accommodation and home care for aged and disabled people is designed to provide a wide range of care and services for the aged or disabled people and to ensure that their needs are being appropriately met. Under this program a three-year $225m funding scheme commenced on 1 July 1980. Over 670 projects providing over 13,000 beds were selected for funding. We have to be conscious of the fact that these days people seem to be living longer. There is certainly a great need for care for the aged. A great deal of this work is being done by churches and other organisations throughout Australia. Australia's first nursing home specifically designed for people with multiple sclerosis received approval under the program for a capital grant of almost $450,000. Expenditure on grants under the Aged or Disabled Person Homes Act during 1980-81 totalled $ 29.5m. In 1980-81 expenditure under the Aged Persons Hostels Act totalled $16.2m . These are large amounts of money and when added together they make a very significant contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth makes grants under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act towards the capital and operating costs of voluntary welfare organisations and local government bodies which provide accommodation, meals and welfare services to homeless people. I think that I have given a fair resume of what this Government has been doing. I think it is something that we should remember. </PARA>

In New Zealand, which I visited recently a system exists whereby local authorities provide help to make sure that people on the dole are working for the money that they get. I have told the Senate about the amounts of money allocated by this Government to welfare services, the unemployment benefit and other benefits. We must realise that this Government is ensuring that the community has the most efficient relief services possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has stated its policies clearly and has always acted on them. On the other hand, the Opposition has not. From statements that have appeared in the media recently, Senator Grimes appears to be at odds with his leader. The Sydney Morning Herald of 8 March points out that Senator Grimes supports an assets test while Mr Hayden, in an interview on the Mike Walsh Show on the same day, stated that the Australian Labor Party wanted to improve, not restrict, access to benefits. A report that Senator Grimes supports an assets and an income test appeared in the Australian of 9 March. I think that before members of the Opposition declare that the Fraser Government is not doing enough in the social security area and that the ALP could do better, they should all get together and firstly agree on what they would do. They have already caused unnecessary worry and anxiety to thousands of Australians, firstly with Mr Hayden's reference to a wealth test and, secondly, with Senator Grimes's talk about both an income and an assets test. We read in today's Press that the number of positions in the Department of Social Security is to be increased by 580 for the 1981-82 year. Surely, at a time of Government cut-backs and reductions, this is proof of this Government's commitment to help those in our community who are less able to cope. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the Senate will make important changes to both the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, Mr President, the Senate will be pleased to know that the National Health Act will be amended to authorise the provision, by the Commonwealth, of free vaccine for immunisation against the disease of mumps. The inclusion of a mumps vaccine at Commonwealth expense in the immunisation programs presently conducted by the States and Territories complies with the principles of good public health and is an indication of the Government's continuing concern to safeguard and improve public health. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed, Mr President, to substitute a combined measles/mumps vaccine for the measles vaccine currently being provided. The combined vaccine will be administered to children at 12 months of age in accordance with the childhood immunisation schedule recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council. </PARA>
<PARA> It is anticipated that around 342,000 children will be immunised in a full year with the new vaccine. At today's prices of $4.65 per dose, the Government will be contributing $1.5m a year to the new immunisation program. Although this will , in part, be offset by the phasing out of the single measles vaccine, the additional expenditure at to-day's prices will be in the order of $1m each year.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the proposed changes to the health insurance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware of the considerable attention that has recently been focused on what is commonly described as medical benefits fraud by medical practitioners. This Bill contains new measures which will present a very strong deterrent against such abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now possible to estimate, from statistics compiled by my Department, that the extent of fraud and overservicing by some members of the medical profession is of the order of at least $100m a year in medical benefits, of which about half is attributable to fraud and half to overservicing. My references to fraud relate to such matters as making claims for services that were not provided, whereas my references to overservicing relate to the provision of services which were not reasonably necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Before proceeding to outline the provisions relation to fraud I wish to emphasise that it is the Government's view that it is a minority of the medical profession who are abusing the health insurance system. It is for that reason that I believe these provisions will have the support of the great majority of medical practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> In commercial terms, medical practitioners are in a virtually unique position. The financial structure of their practices is largely underwritten by the medical benefits scheme which is publicly financed through both taxation and medical benefits fund contributions. Furthermore, most patients are generally not in a position to question the correctness of medical accounts. The operation of the medical benefits scheme is therefore very heavily dependent upon the trustworthiness of medical practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing health insurance legislation already contains provisions for penalties in the form of imprisonment or fines to be imposed by the courts on practitioners found to have committed medical benefits fraud. However, those provisions do not take into account what might be termed the commercial aspects of such fraud. Furthermore, there are sometimes substantial practical difficulties faced by the prosecution in obtaining what might reasonably be considered to be adequate penalties in medical benefits fraud cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that a medical practitioner who has been proved to have committed medical benefits fraud on two or more charges is guilty of a most serious breach of trust and should be dealt with accordingly. It believes that this serious breach of trust warrants the exclusion of that practitioner from the financial benefits of the medical benefits arrangements for a substantial period. Accordingly, this Bill contains provisions under which services by a practitioner who has been found by a court to have committed medical benefits fraud on two or more charges will not attract payment of medical benefits for a period of 3 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I must emphasise that there will be adequate provision for appeal. First, in relation to the initial findings by the court, the practitioner has the usual rights of appeal to a higher court. Furthermore, before a first disqualification for medical benefit purposes comes into effect, the practitioner concerned may apply to the Minister for a review of the disqualification. During the course of any first period of disqualification, the practitioner may again seek a review of that disqualification by the Minister. The minister will be empowered, upon any such application, to modify the disqualification by several means, or a combination thereof, including:</PARA>
<PARA> a reduction of the period of disqualification from three years to some shorter period;</PARA>
<PARA> permitting the continued payment of medical benefits for certain specified types of services;</PARA>
<PARA> permitting the continued payment of medical benefits in respect of services to specified groups of persons or services in specified places (such as hospitals).</PARA>
<PARA> Provision will also be made allowing an appeal by a practitioner to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of a decision by the minister on an application made to him for modification of a disqualification. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out to the Senate that the provisions which I have outlined above concerning ministerial reviews of disqualifications apply only in respect of a first period of disqualification. They do not apply to any subsequent disqualifications which may arise where the practitioner concerned has again had two or more medical benefits fraud offences proven. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the publishing and laying before each House of Parliament of a statement setting out the details and effects of a practitioner's disqualification. There is also adequate provision made for patients of a disqualified practitioner to be advised of the particulars and effects of the disqualification. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators to note that the provisions which I have outlined relate to cases of medical benefits fraud proven by due legal processes through courts of law. They are founded upon, and are limited to, the financial aspects of transactions through the medical benefits scheme and they stand apart from any penalties the courts may see fit to impose in relation to the criminal aspects of such cases. In order that the necessary supporting regulations and administrative arrangements may be made for the operation of these provisions, they will come into operation on a future date to be fixed by proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government has given priority in this Bill to the problem of fraud, it is also very concerned at the extent of overservicing that is believed to occur. It intends therefore to review the existing legislation relating to overservicing and take whatever measures are shown to be necessary to control this other area of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes provisions of an administrative nature, concerning the issue of health care cards to people in the low income category as defined in the health insurance act. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the legislation provides for the making of a declaration that an eligible person having a low income is a disadvantaged person. Such a declaration operates for a period of 6 months and enables the person to obtain concessions under the health insurance arrangements. The person is deemed under the legislation to have lodged a further application for a declaration of disadvantaged person status at the end of the 6 months period. However, this has the practical disadvantage that a new declaration can only give continuous disadvantaged person status retrospectively. The amendment provided for in the Bill will enable the assessment of eligibility for continued disadvantge person status to be carried out over the last four weeks of the six months period and thus for a new declaration to be made before the end of that period. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, Mr President, medical practitioners have been moving towards incorporation of their practices under company laws in order to gain certain benefits in relation to superannuation and to limit their personal liability for damages. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department has been involved in deliberations with representatives of the profession and with other interested organisations to ensure that, in relation to health benefits matters, the incorporation of medical practices does not affect the personal responsibility of practitioners for their services, and that they continue to be individually subject to the provisions of the health insurance legislation relating to the making of false statements and claims and the provision of excessive services. </PARA>
<PARA> In principle, the Australian Medical Association has made quite clear its position on maintaining the personal professional responsibility of medical practitioners to their patients, whether or not they are employees of incorporated medical practices. </PARA>
<PARA> It is consistent with this approach that a practitioner who provides a service to a patient ought to be personally identified on any documents used in connection with the claiming of benefits. Accordingly, the Bill before the Senate provides that Commonwealth medical benefits are not payable in respect of a service unless these documents contain information to be prescribed by regulations. This will enable the making of regulations requiring accounts, receipts and assignment forms to bear the name of the individual practitioner who has provided the service and other associated information. </PARA>
<PARA> Also consistent with the principle of personal accountability of practitioners are the provisions of this Bill which aim to ensure that, in the emerging situation of incorporation of medical practices, or in other employment situations, individual practitioners will continue to be subject to existing provisions concerning irregularities in connection with claims for medical benefits and controls over the provision of excessive services attracting medical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed new provisions will provide that, where a practitioner is an employee of an incorporated practice or some other type of employer, both he and the practice or other employer will be accountable in relation to the making of false statements or claims in respect of medical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to overservicing-that is, claiming medical benefits for medical services that are not reasonably necessary-the existing legislation provides for a system of medical services committees of inquiry. These committees are able to make recommendations that practitioners who are found to have provided excessive services should be counselled, reprimanded or required to repay benefits. The provisions of this Bill will ensure that, in proceedings before such committees of inquiry, practitioners employed by incorporated practices or other types of employers cannot, in effect, shield behind alleged directions by the incorporated practice or other employer. The incorporated practice or other employer will also be subject to the operation of these committees. However, in a case of incorporated practices, the other practitioners who are not directly involved, will not be affected as individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the basic registration of medical practitioners to practise is effected under State and Territory laws. Responsibility for ensuring the personal accountability of practitioners to their patients insofar as clinical procedures are concerned, is primarily a matter for the State and Territory authorities. For this reason I am therefore consulting with my State and Northern Territory colleagues with an aim of obtaining, as far as practicable, appropriate co-ordination of their registration laws and those of the Commonwealth which are concerned with medical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for time limits to be imposed on the lodgment of claims for commonwealth medical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Claims lodged by the public on the funds will no longer be automatically accepted for payment if the service was rendered prior to the introduction of current health arrangements and more than two years have elapsed between date of service and date of lodgment. The date the current health insurance arrangements came into operation is specified as 1 September 1981 and provision exists to vary this date in the event of future changes. It should be noted that there is no intention to impose a time limit on the lodgment of claims relating to services rendered within a current scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> A time limit will also be imposed for medical benefits claims where the doctor bills the Commonwealth direct. A claim will no longer be automatically accepted for payment by my Department if the claim is not lodged within six months of the service being provided. </PARA>
<PARA> At the discretion of the Minister for Health, the time limits referred to above may be extended where this is considered justified, particularly to avoid any hardship that may be caused to the claimant. </PARA>
<PARA> A period of grace of three months will be allowed after the legislation is enacted and before the restrictions are imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already indictaed, there is presently no time limit on the lodgment of a claim involving Commonwealth medical benefits. The major reasons for the imposition of time limits are the difficulties and costs currently experienced in processing 'old claims' and the opportunities for fraud and incorrect payment that the present system provides. It is hoped that in the future these problems will be substantially reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Registered medical benefits organisations are currently required to lodge claims for reimbursement of Commonwealth medical benefits with my Department and also to provide such support information as is prescribed. A similar requirement exists for the organisations to lodge claims for advance payments of Commonwealth medical benefits. Such claims are required to be accompanied by certain information including prescribed information about earlier advances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill presently before the Senate provides that the form and the manner in which the required information is to be provided in support of claims for reimbursements or advances, may be prescribed by regulations. It is intended that the regulations will specify the manner and form by reference to the media on which the information is to be recorded-for example, disc, magnetic tape or film-as well as the format for the data and the actual information content for each item of data. </PARA>
<PARA> Information is currently supplied in a non-standard fashion which has required my Department to operate expensive manual and computerised systems. For this reason it is considered, in the interests of economy and efficiency, that the new provisions are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 106AA of the Health Insurance Act presently provides for the publication of the particulars of determinations made by the Minister for Health in accordance with the report of a medical services committee of inquiry on alleged cases of overservicing on the part of medical practitioners. As a further means of discouraging such improper practices, Mr President, clause 26 of the Bill will amend section 106AA to require the Minister to prepare a statement setting out the particulars of any such determination and have a copy of it laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of its preparation. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 31 of the Bill makes a similar amendment to section106G of the Health Insurance Act which contains similar provisions relating to the reports of optometrical services committees of inquiry. Again a statement setting out the particulars of any determination by the Minister will be required to be laid before both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, Mr President, will also make important changes to section 130 of the Health Insurance Act. This section concerns the divulging and release of information obtained by a Commonwealth officer in the performance of his duties under the Act. It is believed that these proposed changes will, amongst other things, greatly assist the Government's attempts to combat and discourage the instances of fraud, overservicing and other improper practices to which I have previously referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The present provisions of section 130 are mainly concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of information, concerning the affairs of other persons, which is acquired by officers in the performance of their duties under the Act. May I take this opportunity of re-affirming the Government's continued belief in and support of this very important principle. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also believes, however, that in order to assist in the discouragement of the sort of improper practices to which I have just referred and the effective administration of other Commonwealth or State Acts, provision should be made to allow the release, by my Department, to specific persons or authorities, of information relating to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to section 130 will therefore allow the release of information concerning the conviction of a person on charges of fraud under the Act, to the Commonwealth Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs, specified State authorities and personnel and authorised personnel of registered health insurance organisations. The new provisions will also allow the release to these persons of information considered to be relevant to, respectively, the administration of an Act administered by either the Department of Social Security or Veterans' Affairs, the administration of a specified law of a State or Territory, or the carrying on of the business of a specified registered health insurance organisation, whichever the case may be.</PARA>
<PARA> These provisions do not open the way for indiscriminate use of information concerning the affairs of individual members of the public. Protection of the identity of individual persons will be maintained except in cases where the person has been convicted of an offence under the health insurance legislation or where the Minister has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person has committed, or been a party to, such an offence. Furthermore, persons under the control of any recipient organisations or authorities shall not divulge information made available by my Department except in the performance of their official duties within that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the amendments to the National Health Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that, under the new health funding arrangements, States and Territories generally have the responsibility for determining levels of public hospital charges. However, the levels of public hospital charges, and the related benefits, are a significant factor in determining basic hospital contribution rates. </PARA>
<PARA> As a general principle, the benefit available from basic hospital insurance should generally cover the charges raised by public hospitals, provided the charges do not bear too heavily on the hospital insurance system, and, therefore , on contributions to the basic hospital tables. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Act extend the existing power of the Minister for Health to declare standard hospital inpatient fees for hospital benefit purposes to cover professional and outpatient service fees for which basic hospital benefits are also payable. They will ensure a consistent approach by the Commonwealth in this area and, at the same time, provide a mechanism for the Commonwealth to protect the interests of contributors where hospital charges raised conflict with Commonwealth policy or would increase basic hospital table contribution rates to an unreasonable extent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes the conferring on the Minister of an additional power to control management practices of registered health benefits organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has always maintained a policy of minimum interference in the internal administration of registered health benefits organisations. It also believes that healthy competition in the industry promotes efficiency, assists in keeping contribution rates at minimum levels and, therefore, is in the best interests of contributors. These views remain unchanged. It is believed, however , that a broad power to deal with inappropriate management practices would be desirable. As the National Health Act currently stands, there are provisions that may be used in relation to specific instances of undesirable management practices, but only on an ad hoc basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to conferring powers to deal with inappropriate management practices, the new provisions will authorise the Minister to issue directions to a registered organisation, other than a friendly society, prohibiting it from carrying on business other than business as a registered organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> A further minor amendment proposed in the Bill relates to the processing of rule changes of registered health benefits organisations under the National Health Act. The Minister's power to approve changes to rules relating to benefits and conditions for the payment of benefits for non-basic tables will be extended to cover existing tables as well as new tables. However, the overall policy of allowing organisations considerable scope for innovation and flexibility in relation to non-basic health insurance benefits cover would not be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has for some time now viewed with concern the various problems that have necessitated many of the amendments proposed in this Bill. These proposals have been foreshadowed for some considerable time and will receive, I believe, the full support of the Australian people. Much careful thought and planning has gone into their preparation. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, Mr President, I firmly believe that the Bill contains important provisions which will be of great assistance in ensuring that the provision of health care in this country remains as efficient, equitable, cost-effective and free from abuse as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Albury-Wodonga Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware of the assistance that has been provided by this and previous governments for the development of the Albury-Wodonga growth centre, and for some time past the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria have been reviewing the financial arrangements under which the growth centre was funded. </PARA>
<PARA> Early in 1981 it was agreed between the three governments that the States would be relieved of their obligations to repay loans and to pay interest on the loans provided by the Commonwealth. In lieu of repayments, it was agreed that the Commonwealth would have access to funds generated from development activities. The proposed amendments to this Act will enable the new agreement to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Special arrangements have already been negotiated with the States in relation to funds provided to them for on-passing to the Albury and Wodonga councils, and the arrangements relating to these funds are not included in the new agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Only some $1.2m was provided for Albury-Wodonga development under this Act. The bulk of the funds for Albury-Wodonga-some $117m-has been advanced under the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974 which does not require amendment for the new financial arrangements to become effective. </PARA>
<PARA> The new financial agreement with New South Wales and Victoria will be tabled in the Parliament when it has been executed by the three Governments. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 to provide a mechanism for Australia to introduce reciprocal countervailing duty measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Last November, following the countervailing action taken by the United States against Australian lamb exports, the Government announced that Australia would be introducing this amending legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, the amendments will allow Australia to take reciprocal countervailing action in any case where another country applies countervailing duty against Australian exports without applying an injury test or using a concept of a subsidy broader than the concept currently embodied in the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States legislation already contains provisions that have the same effect as the measures proposed in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Problems were created for Australia last year when America threatened countervailing duty action against Australian lamb exports without applying the necessary 'injury test' and adopting a broader definition of a 'subsidy' to that currently contained in the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty with America has been overcome for the time being as a result of a bilateral understanding with that country. This understanding was made on the basis of Australia joining the Subsidies and Countervailing Duties Code and, consequently, the 'injury test' is now accorded to Australian exports by the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government however, has indicated that it will review its membership of the Code in the light of experience and the option of considering withdrawal from the Code remains open. Accordingly, the decision to join the Code does not negate the adoption of the principle of reciprocity in relation to countervailing duty actions by Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Committee stage of the debate on the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982 in the House of Representatives on 22 April, as reported on page 1801 of Hansard the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner ) quoted a passage from a published paper of mine which, he claimed, supported the Government's argument on voluntary unionism. His quote was quite selective and taken out of the full context of my argument. It amounted, in fact, only to the first step in an elaborate four-step argument. To the extent that the Minister purported then to describe my full argument, his account was a perverted caricature. In order to set the record straight and, perhaps, also because it will assist any proposed select committee in its deliberations on this matter-although I detect some scepticism in the breast of Senator Chaney on that score-I seek leave to have the full text of my paper which was delivered on 20 June 1979 and published as Monograph No. 9 of the Industrial Relations Society of Victoria incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>COMPULSORY UNIONISM AND CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION:</PARA>
<PARA>POLITICS, MORALITY AND THE CASE FOR LEGAL REFORM</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Gareth Evans</PARA>
<PARA>All lawyers-and most practitioners of industrial relations-know that there is no necessary connection between law, politics and morality. Very often the demands of each tug in different directions, with considerations of morality as often as not coming in a poor third. It is not always easy to reconcile conflicting attitudes and accommodate moral principles in a legal form which is universally acceptable, but it should always be the responsibility of legislators to try. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Commonwealth law on conscientious objection to trade union membership is embodied in S. 144A of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, a new provision enacted by the Fraser Government in October 1977. Recent experience amply demonstrates that this law is far from being universally acceptable. It may be that the nature of conscientious objection claims is such that no law, however well drafted, can entirely eradicate disputes about them. But equally, it is not clear that any real attempt was made by the Government either to think through the issues of principle underlying the enactment of S. 144A or to take into account genuine differences of opinion which exist about the proper scope of any such clause. In what follows I shall attempt to sketch out, successively, the state of the present law, the different attitudes of those who are affected by it, and the considerations of morality or principle which in my view ought to govern its operation. The concluding section endeavours to pull the threads together and make some specific suggestions as to how the law should be changed to make it more generally acceptable. No-one should underestimate the difficulty and sensitivity of this task, but nor should anyone underestimate its urgency. Until the law is changed, conscientious objection will continue as an industrial relations minefield, capable of exploding at any time. </PARA>
<PARA>Present Commonwealth Law</PARA>
<PARA> Conscientious objection clauses were first introduced into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1956, as part of the S. 47 preference provision. Under them a conscientious objection claim could not in any way be made at large: it had to be in the context of seeking exemption from the operation of a preference clause in an award. Nor were there any penal sanctions provided for unco-operative unions or employers. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 47 was not without its difficulties from the trade union point of view. It conferred no right upon unionists to participate in hearings before the Registrar, nor to appeal against a Registrar's decision to grant exempt status,1 nor was there any provision for revocation of exemption certificates once granted. But by and large S. 47 was uncontroversial in its practical operation. Not many applications were made-including renewal applications only 238, or an average of 11 per year over the whole period 1956-77-60% of these were granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The present S. 144A is a very different kind of provision. A number of features of the old S. 47 clauses are, it is true, retained: the description of ' conscientious beliefs' as including those which 'are or are not of a religious character'; the requirement that a successful applicant pay the equivalent amount of the union fee to consolidated revenue; the absence of any provision allowing participation by the trade union in proceedings before the Industrial Registrar; the absence of any revocation procedure; and the absence (indeed now explicit prohibition) of any right of appeal against the granting of exempt status. </PARA>
<PARA> But what is different about the new section is that it is not in any way tied to the existence of a preference clause in an award, thereby making it possible for any unionist to claim exemption from membership of any union at any time. Furthermore, it contains a number of provisions imposing substantial penal sanctions against unions and employers, whether acting individually or in concert, who in any way pressure or prejudice the position of an employee possessing an exemption certificate. </PARA>
<PARA> For whatever reason-because the scope of this section's operation is wider, or because more people know about it, or because more have felt encouraged by the present Government's announced hostility to compulsory unionism to take advantage of all the opportunities S. 144A offers for mischief-making, or for some combination of these-the fact is that the new section has been very much more controversial, and very much more utilized, than its predecessor. Between 1977 and March 1979 fully 534 applications had been made under S. 144A of which 194 had to that date been granted. And a number of them-most conspicuously the Biggs2 and Aper3 cases in 1978 have provoked explosive industrial disputes</PARA>
<PARA> It became evident early in the life of S. 144A that, whatever its other merits or demerits, it was not especially well drafted. Some of its numerous ambiguities and uncertainties were clarified by the Federal Court in a reference of a number of questions of law by the Industrial Registrar in the Aper Case, so far the only case to be litigated under the new section. This case held that a self-employed person could not be issued with a S. 144A certificate; that the ' associations' in respect of which a belief had to be held meant all classes of industrial association and not just those registered or capable of being registered under the Act; and that in order to qualify as grounds for exemption, a conscientious objection had to extend to all associations and could not be confined selectively to one or more individual associations. </PARA>
<PARA> But what the Full Court in Aper left unanswered, or incompletely answered, was at least two other questions of equal and possibly greater practical importance, viz. just what kind of character does a belief have to have in order to make it 'conscientious', especially in a non-religous context; and what precisely are the rights of unions-and the obligations of the Industrial Registrar-in respect of participation in the Registrar's exemption proceedings? On the first question the Court gave some guidance, but not enough to be really helpful in marginal cases. On the second, its utterances were positively Delphic, creating more confusion than clarity. These are questions on which the legislation must, in my view, be explicit if it is to retain any credibility at all, and I shall return to them again below. </PARA>
<PARA>The Politics of Conscientious Objection</PARA>
<PARA> The conscientious objection issue is one that tends to arouse strong passions among all those whom it touches. This fact, here as elsewhere, makes the task of the law reformer that much more difficult. The prescription, however, is not to put the whole question into the too-hard basket. What it means, rather, is that the nature and force of the various competing attitudes must be carefully assessed and fully taken into account in proposing and drafting changes to the law. Law reform, and particularly industrial law reform, which is undertaken in a political vacuum is almost invariably destined to be either irrelevant, ineffective or counterproductive. Here there are at least four distinct groups4 of persons whose views are immediately relevant: objecting individuals, trade unions, employers and politicians. </PARA>
<PARA>Objecting Individuals</PARA>
<PARA> The base line position of individuals objecting to trade union membership tends to be quite straightforward. Compulsory unionism-indeed any other form of compulsory association-is a grave infringement of civil liberties. The right to freedom of association must extend to the freedom not to associate. There is no justifiable reason for forcing anyone to join an organization against his or her will, especially when that organization is doing something or supporting something of which that person does not approve. The extent to which arguments of this kind should be accepted is a matter taken up in the next section; for the moment they are simply noted. </PARA>
<PARA>Trade Unions</PARA>
<PARA> The views of most trade unions can be put equally bluntly. As recently articulated for example, by the Secretary of the Federated Storemen and Packers' Union, Simon Crean, they can be summarized as follows.5</PARA>
<PARA> Compulsory unionism is legitimate because those who receive the benefits of union action should pay the price. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one can opt out of paying taxes because he disapproves of the Government, or the society in which he lives: why should union membership be any different?</PARA>
<PARA> Unions are prepared to recognize genuine conscientious objection cases. They have done so in the past-at least when religious claims have been made-and will continue to do so in the future, whatever the law. It is not quite clear what would ever constitute genuine conscientious objection on non-religious grounds, but unions would be prepared to look at such claims if and when they arise. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no need for any statutory procedure to protect the rights of individuals, for unions can be relied upon to regulate themselves in these matters. But to the extent that a statutory procedure is laid down, it is objectionable insofar as it does not give unions the opportunity to participate in conscientious objection hearings, to thoroughly test objectors' beliefs, and to appeal against adverse decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Employers</PARA>
<PARA> The views of employers tend, as is the case in many problem areas of industrial relations, to be somewhat mixed. Employers-because of their preference, by and large, for a quiet life-are not nearly as universally or unequivocally on the side of conscientious objectors, and against closed shops and compulsory unionism, as some of the more strident industry pronouncements would suggest. Among the arguments one often hears in favour of compulsory unionism are the following. </PARA>
<PARA> It serves industrial peace by eliminating the resentment, clashes and direct industrial action that may result from unionists and non-unionists working together. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be desirable where a particular union has a record of settling its grievances via conciliation and arbitration rather than direct action and can give guarantees to this effect for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> It may have a moderating influence on unions whose membership is comprised largely of those who join only because they have to. </PARA>
<PARA> If all employees join and vote in union elections this is likely to result in a leadership more in tune with rank and file opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> If union muscle is such that compulsory unionism will occur anyway, there will be less dislocation if this is imposed by law rather than forced by direct action. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, it is certainly true that employers would in principle overwhelmingly support the rights of conscientious objectors, and the desirability of their having protection of some kind in industrial legislation. But I believe that it is equally true that the great bulk of employers would readily acknowledge the desirability of the trade unions affected by such claims having some kind of say in determining whether particular conscientious objection applications are genuinely based. </PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party</PARA>
<PARA> The views of conscientious objection that will ultimately count most are, for better or worse, those of politicians. Here, as might have been predicted, a relatively clearcut divergence exists between the Liberal Government and the Labor Opposition. The Labor Party's Federal Platform does not directly address the issue but, as Keith Marshall has noted, the ALP position was clearly put on the record by Bill Hayden in a major address delivered to the BWIU Federal Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> 'We will change the present unworkable conscientious objection provision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. You know, as I know, that the union movement has always acknowledged conscientious objection. That fact was never more obvious than in the great debate that followed the embroiling of Australia in the Vietnam War. </PARA>
<PARA> A Labor Government will provide the right to offer opposing argument when conscientious objection application for exemption is being heard, and it will provide the right of appeal after the decision. The present formulation of the conscientious objection provision is nothing more than an extension of the Prime Minister's tactics of provocation and confrontation.'6</PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party did not oppose the amendments to S.47 introduced in 1956, and does not now oppose the continued existence of conscientious objection clauses in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. But it regards the present terms of S. 144A as quite inadequate to ensure that conscientious objection claims made, and accepted, are genuine and not spurious. </PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal Government</PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of the Fraser Government, on the other hand, must be presumed to be embodied in the terms of the present S. 144A-a provision which clearly elevates the position of the individual applicant for exemption at the expense of competing claims of the trade union concerned. Conscientious objection claims are regarded as a matter solely between the applicant and the Registrar, in the resolution of which the views or concerns of the relevant union have no part. The Government's position on these matters, and in particular on the desirability of amendments to S. 144A of the kind canvassed by the Labor Party, was spelled out in the following letter to me from the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations replying to a question asked in Parliament six weeks earlier:</PARA>
<PARA> 'I refer to your question without notice to my colleague the Attorney-General, concerning matters arising out of the recent dispute in which Melbourne tramway employees refused to work with Miss Barbara Biggs who had obtained a certificate of exemption from trade union membership. (Hansard, 13 September 1978, pages 518 -519). </PARA>
<PARA> You raise two matters in your question. Firstly, you ask whether I would table papers relating to Miss Biggs' application for a certificate of exemption. As you will be aware, it has long been the established practice and understanding that applications for, and hearings of applications for, conscientious objection certificates are to be regarded as confidential to the applicant and the Registrar. Miss Biggs' application proceeded on that basis and accordingly it is a matter of propriety and good faith that the well-established understanding operative at the time at which her application was made and heard should not now be over-turned. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter you raised was whether the Government would amend section 144A of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to provide for representation of, and cross-examination by, unions at hearings of applications; to require the Registrar to publish reasons for his decisions; and to allow an aggrieved union a right of appeal to the Commission. The operation of section 144A is being kept under review and if the Government were to be satisfied that these or any other alterations are desirable, appropriate amendments will be made to the section.'7</PARA>
<PARA> Just what it will take to persuade the present Government that amendments to its legislation are indeed desirable remains to be seen. I am not sure that, where trade unions are concerned, this Government is susceptible to any kind of reasoned argument. But, imbued with that spirit of optimism which a few more years in politics will undoubtedly knock out of me, let me at least make the attempt, in what follows, to sketch out some grounds for changing present law and practice which I hope do have some moral and political force. </PARA>
<PARA>The Morality of Conscientious Objection</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the standard arguments of both individual objectors and trade unions, as sketched out above, tend to put the matter too crudely and too absolutely; the underlying issues of principle are rather more complex than either side will readily admit. A more credible account, I suggest, is one which acknowledges that both sides of the debate have important points to make, but steers a balanced course constructing a conclusion which owes something to both sides. This argument can be stated in four steps, as follows. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. It must be accepted that a logical corollary to the undisputed democratic right of free association is the right not to associate. As a matter of first principle, no-one should be forced to join any organization against his or her will. If that right is acknowledged in principal, it ought to be capable of enforcement in practice, if necessary by statutory means. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. But that is not quite enough to conclude the argument in the particular case of trade unions. In the industrial context, additional considerations of fairness come into play. This is the argument that those who reap the benefits of action undertaken on their behalf ought to contribute directly to its cost. The unions' interest in the outcome of claims to exemption from membership is, to this extent, well founded in principle: it is not just a matter of realpolitik. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. But the fairness argument is not, by itself, conclusive either. What it does do is shift the onus of proof back to the objector. It means, that those who wish to opt out of union membership should be able to produce strong, persuasive and genuinely conscientious reasons for doing so. Reasons based on mere personal dislike or distaste for unions, or for the activities of any particular union, are not enough. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Since unions have a direct and immediate interest in the outcome of exemption claims-based not merely on self interest but on principle-it would appear reasonable that they be entitled to participate in the determination of such claims. Such participation should certainly extend to the right to put counter evidence and submissions to the determining body, and arguably should also extend to testing by cross examination, the applicant's case. Applicants for conscientious objection status are no less likely than applicants for anything else to rely on irrelevancies, half-truths and untruths; it is important in all cases that these be exposed. The present inquisitorial system, whereby unions are excluded from the proceedings between the Registrar and applicant, may or may not as a matter of strict law offend the canons of natural justice, but that this exclusion is offensive to any principles of fair play, is perfectly clear. </PARA>
<PARA>The Criteria of Conscientious Objection</PARA>
<PARA> The terms of S. 144A do not, as has already been stated, give the Registrar much help in determining what is a genuinely conscientious objection. S. 144A (1 ) requires him to be satisfied 'that the person's conscientious beliefs do not allow the person to be a member' of any industrial association. 'Conscientious beliefs' are then defined in S. 144A (2) to mean:</PARA>
<PARA> 'any conscientious beliefs, whether the grounds for the beliefs are or are not of a religious character and whether the beliefs are or are not part of the doctrine of any religion'. </PARA>
<PARA> The question remains as to what it is about such beliefs, be they religious or non-religious, which makes them 'conscientious'. There is very rarely much contention on this score when religion-based claims are in issue, although in the past it appears that it has usually only been members of somewhat exotic sects, like the Exclusive Brethren, who have regularly taken advantage of the law. The real practical problems arise when non-religious claims are in issue. The Federal Court in the Aper Case addressed itself generally to the issues in this way:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Quite clearly there are persons, such as those adhering to the faith of the Exclusive Brethren, whose faith does not permit them to belong to any associations. In addition, no doubt, there are others within the community who conscientiously believe that industrial relations are best settled by individual negotiation and bargaining between employer and employee and who would be unable , by reason of that belief, if conscientious, to join either an employer or an employee organization. There are, we have no doubt, others in a not dissimilar position who hold a relevant conscientious belief about all relevant associations.'8</PARA>
<PARA> So far so good, but still in this passage the central question remains unanswered: that is, what is the nature of a conscientious belief about industrial relations, as distinct from some other kind of belief. </PARA>
<PARA> On this question, on which everything else hangs, there is a relative paucity of case law: in the Federal industrial jurisdiction, only the Aper Case itself, and in the State industrial jurisdiction, just one early N.S.W. case on similarly drafted legislation.9 There are a considerable number of authorities interpreting Commonwealth statute law on conscientious objection to military service but these-while certainly very suggestive-at best only indirectly assist the Registrar in resolving industrial cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Court in the Aper Case does quote extensively from a leading High Court military case,10 but its primary object in doing so is to muster support on the particular 'war analogy' for its conclusion that a conscientious objection under S 144A has to extend to all industrial associations and not a selected minority. The passage cited in Aper from the decision of Barwick C. J. in Thompsons Case emphasizing the durability depth and sweep that an opinion must have to make it conscientious does however indicate the general drift of the Federal Court's thinking. So does the following short passage which is the only one bearing on the present problem offered by the Aper Court in its own words;</PARA>
<PARA> '. . . the fact that the section had its origins, as did the legislation dealing with military service, in provisions requiring the existence of a conscientious belief founded on religious grounds indicates the depth of conviction which is required. It involves an innate conviction of what is morally right and morally wrong.'11</PARA>
<PARA> Most of the ingredients for our guidance in conscientious objection cases are now to hand. But in none of the relevant authorities, least of all Aper itself, is there anything as convenient as a fully worked out check-list of criteria for conscientious objection. Pending the writing of specific criteria into the statue itself-which would be, ultimately, the most desirable way of getting some clarity and uniformity of approach-we shall have to construct a check list of our own. </PARA>
<PARA>Clarifying the Criteria of Conscientious Objection</PARA>
<PARA> The best starting point for such an exercise is probably the definition offered by Dwyer C. J. in a frequently cited12 Western Australian case Grondal v Minister of Labour and National Service with the language of which it is obvious the Aper Court was familiar</PARA>
<PARA> 'I would say that a conscientious belief is an individual's inward conviction of what is morally right or morally wrong, and it is a conviction that is genuinely reached and held after some process of thinking about the subject. It represents a conclusion that is uninfluenced by any consideration of personal advantage or disadvantage either to oneself or others, and perhaps when put to the test should be ordinarily combined with a willingness to act according to the particular conviction reached although this may involve personal discomfort or suffering or material loss.'13</PARA>
<PARA> My reading of such hints as are thrown out by the body of case law generally, leads me to suggest that one can identify four distinguishing characteristics of a conscientious belief, as follows.14</PARA>
<PARA> 1. It Reflects a Moral Position. A conscientious belief involves a belief that something is not just right or wrong, but morally right or wrong. As the Aper Court put it, picking up the language in the Grondal Case, 'it involves an innate conviction of what is morally right and morally wrong'.15 A 'moral' position can perhaps be described as one taken in accordance with what is perceived to be a moral principle-as distinct from being based on whim or impulse, or being a mere reflex response to some stimulus. Another way of identifying a moral position, familiar in philosophical writing, is to say that the person espousing it must be willing to have it universally adopted-to say, in effect, that 'the principle holds not just for me but for everyone'. On this view it would be a moral objection to say that it is wrong for me to be to be forced to join a union-but it may be a moral position to object to anyone being forced to join a union. </PARA>
<PARA> It should perhaps be added that a moral position can, clearly, be based on religious or non-religious considerations; it can be orthodox or unorthodox, logical or illogical, demonstrably true or demonstrably false. What matters is that it be the product of principled belief as to rightness or wrongness. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. It is Compelling in Character. A conscientious belief is one that involves a sense or feeling by the person claiming it that it is his duty to espouse it. A belief of a casual or 'take it or leave it' kind is not conscientious; it must be characterized by some depth-i.e. reflect a deep conviction, not a shallow or superficial one, capable of being easily swept away. Barwick C. J. in the Thompson Case16 refers to the 'compulsive quality' of a conscientious belief. </PARA>
<PARA> The language of S. 144A itself makes this point to the extent that it requires a person's beliefs 'do not allow' him to join an industrial association. This particular phrase also appears in the military legislation, prompting Barwick C. J. to add in the Thompson judgment, 'the use of the expression 'does not allow' in the section reflects the depth and nature of the required conviction'. The Aper Court, it will have been noted in the passage cited above, also refers to the 'depth of conviction which is required'.17</PARA>
<PARA> 3. It is Durable. A conscientious belief is one that is held with a degree of tenacity and consistency over time, although this is not to say it must be absolutely unchanging. Barwick C. J. states this criterion very clearly in his judgment in the Thompson Case:</PARA>
<PARA> 'A conscientious belief because it is a matter of conscience with its compulsive quality is durable though not unchangeable . . . . Though durability is in general a quality of the demands of conscience, conscientious belief as I have said may change . . . . But that such beliefs may change does not, to my mind, impinge upon the proposition that the section requires a present conscientious belief . . . .'18</PARA>
<PARA> 4. It Involves a Subordination of Self-interest. A conscientious belief is one quite unmotivated by considerations of personal advantage or disadvantage. It would be difficult to take seriously a claim that one 'shouldn't have to join a union because there's nothing in it for me'. Dwyer C. J.'s dictum in the Grondal Case makes this perfectly clear. And, putting what is essentially the same point another way, nor should an objection be regarded as conscientious if (as was the case to some extent in the Aper Case) it is based solely on personal experience of rough treatment by a particular union or even the union movement as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The four criteria identified do of course, to some extent overlap in a mutually reinforcing way. Nonetheless in determining conscientious objection claims, it is both possible and helpful, for the Registrar to seek satisfaction from the applicant as to each point in turn, in order to build up an overall picture as to the nature and intensity of the belief under scrutiny. If this approach is adopted it ought to be possible in practice to fairly readily distinguish a genuine conscientious belief from an objection which is based on either</PARA>
<PARA> (a) intellectual persuasion (e.g. a belief that union activity in some industry , or in the economy as a whole, is economically unhealthy or ultimately counter- productive); or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) predilection, personal preference or emotional leaning (e.g. an intense dislike of going to meetings, or a distaste for the personal style of union leaders). </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to say that a genuinely conscientious belief cannot also have attached to it elements of one or both of (a) or (b). The point is simply that a conscientious belief can and must be distinguished from either: it must be the case that one's conscience rebels against the imposition, not just one's intellect or taste-buds. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be acknowledged that it remains easier to say what a conscientious belief is not than what it is, and this is still particularly true of objections mounted on non-religious grounds. The criteria outlined would in theory still leave the potential for a non-religious belief to come within the protection afforded by S. 144A, but it is difficult to articulate in practice what the elements of such a belief might be, and it is obviously easier to see how religious beliefs would qualify. Certainly none of the highly publicized recent applicants-least of all Miss Biggs-would seem, on a proper analysis, to get to first base. But if all that is so, it follows not from any deliberate attempt on my part to narrow down the operation for the section, but simply from the true meaning, when properly analysed, of the words which Parliament itself has chosen . </PARA>
<PARA>Changing the Law</PARA>
<PARA> There are five specific changes to the law which I would argue should be made. All of them have been foreshadowed to a greater or lesser extent in the preceding discussion, and most can accordingly now be stated quite briefly. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. Criteria of Conscientious Objection. It would be helpful though not essential, for the definition of 'conscientious beliefs' in S.144A to be extended so as to embody the four criteria developed above. Failing any such legislative change, I would argue that those criteria are, in any event, those that ought to be applied if the true meaning of the present section is to prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Right of Appearance and Cross-examination before Registrar by Interested Organizations. The law at the moment is in a state of some uncertainty as to whether any such right exists. In the Congdon Case Gaudron J. held that the former S.47 conferred no such right (and that as a consequence there was no right of appeal of the Commission under S.88F of the Act because any such right was contingent upon the organization having standing before the Registrar).19 In the absence of any explicit provision conferring standing upon interested organizations in the new S.144A, one would have thought that reasoning continued to apply. However in a cryptic passage in the Aper Case, the Federal Court seemed to lend some credence to the notion that unions whose interests are at stake have a positive right to have their voice heard:</PARA>
<PARA> 'We agree with the view expressed during the course of the hearing that the inquiry before the Registrar would necessarily be conducted in accordance with the rules of natural justice and would involve giving notice and opportunity to be heard to organizations likely to be affected'.20</PARA>
<PARA> This view does not appear to have been based on any detailed argument from counsel, and does not sit well with the decision in the Congdon Case unless it is construed to mean that unions should be given an opportunity after the event to comment orally or in writing on evidence which they have not directly heard nor had an opportunity to challenge at the time of its presentation. But if this is all that is meant, why state the point in terms of 'natural justice', which would seem to imply rather more than a post hoc opportunity to comment?</PARA>
<PARA> The Law ought to be clarified and if necessary corrected, to ensure that unions do have the right to be present to cross-examine and give evidence. As was argued earlier, their interest in the outcome is such that in principle this is only fair. One should also emphasise the important practical point that exposure of an applicant's case to searching test in a semi-adversarial context may well be the best way of revealing manifest deficiencies in that case. It is difficult to believe, for example, that Miss Barbara Biggs would have obtained a certificate in the first place-or that the industrial disputes this provoked would ever have occurred-had her application been properly tested at the outset; her membership of other trade unions in the past, her willingness to join others in the future, and the nature of her objection as being essentially based upon dislike of unions who disrupted vital industries, and the Tramways Union in particular, would all surely have emerged and made a finding of 'conscientious' objection to 'any' association impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Statements of Reasons. Reasons for a decision should be required to be given by the Registrar. This is a necessary practical precondition for any appeal, and also a time honoured way of obliging any decision-maker to think carefully through the elements of a decision before making it. Nothing concentrates the mind more wonderfully than having to not simply intuit, but articulate. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Right of Appeal. A right of appeal is available to an applicant aggrieved by the Registrar's failure to grant him or her a certificate of exemption, but this right is explicitly denied to anyone equally aggrieved by a certificate being granted. There is no reason in principle why the normal S.88F appeal rule should not apply here as elsewhere, and both the possibility of bad individual decisions and the desirability of a uniformity of general approach makes it appropriate and sensible for unions to have this right. It certainly cannot be claimed that there is any inherent triviality about conscientious exemption claims such as would not justify their taking the attention of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or the Industrial Division of the Federal Court: the whole community is now only too well aware of the industrial consequences of unacceptable decisions on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Revocation of Exemption Certificates. There is no clear basis in the Act upon which an application for revocation of an exemption certificate could be made by anyone during the currency of that certificate: It would simply be a matter of contesting or refusing the renewal of such a certificate when it expired, normally after twelve months. But circumstances do arise from time to time when it becomes apparent that a revocation would be amply justified and would much assist the resolution of an industrial dispute if it occurred. A classic example occurred during the Biggs controversy when, with the dispute still flaring, the lady in question declared in the media that she had before the Registrar been 'virtually forced to say what I didn't believe-that all unions, and the concept of unionism, are bad'.21 Whether this was in fact an accurate report of her encounter with the Registrar is beside the point: what is crucial is the acknowledgement of a state of belief inconsistent with the continued possession of a S.144A certificate. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally</PARA>
<PARA> It may be that the views I have expressed on this subject will not wholly coincide with those of many of my colleagues in the Labor movement, particularly those trade union leaders who are inclined to argue for the removal of all legislative constraints and a return to simple self-regulation. But I am enough of a civil libertarian-and enough of a cynic about the real world-to want to see important basic rights enshrined in legislation and not just left in reliance upon good will, even if that good will can reasonably be expected to be forth- coming in the overwhelming majority of cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, however, I am under no illusions as to the one-sided way in which S. 144A has so far worked, and was perhaps intended to work. If it is to be accepted as an important civil safeguard, and not just a charter for mischief- makers and a source of endless industrial confrontation, it is very important indeed that its substance and administration be reassessed, and that correcting amendments where necessary be introduced, along the lines suggested. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is dealing with two pieces of industrial relations legislation which have been introduced by the Government and delayed while it tried to get its act together in relation to these proposals. The Bills represent the umpteenth attempt by this Government to grapple with industrial relations problems in Australia. I say, quite clearly , that anybody would be blind to suggest that there are not very serious and very sizable industrial relations problems in Australia. We have too many unions and too many arbitration systems. We have a progressively weakened federal system of arbitration at a time when the opposite thing should be happening. We should be strengthening the centralised wage fixing capacity and strengthening the capacity of a national arbitration commission to control the industrial relations climate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We live in a country where there is no wages policy. The authority for that proposition is contained or displayed on the one hand by such diverse authorities as the report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which was quite critical of the absence of a wages policy in Australia and, on the other hand, by such eminent authorities as the former Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Andrew Peacock, who, only a fortnight ago when explaining, for purposes of his own, what was wrong with this country alleged, on a number of occasions, that the absence of a wages policy was crucial to the concerns which we face as a country. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only do we not have a wages policy, but also there is no policy from this Government on the introduction of technology as it affects the work force; there is no incomes policy, and, what is more, there is no prospect of an incomes policy under a government such as the Fraser Government; and there is a high level of industrial disputation. The year 1981 had the worst strike record in this country for seven years. The rate of average weekly male earnings in the December quarter of 1981 increased by 5.8 per cent. The previous comparative high figure which is sometimes cited by this Government was for the December quarter 1974 when wages increased, per employed male unit, 5.4 per cent as distinct from 5.8 per cent in 1981. That happened because of the absence of a wages policy. I think it is significant to point not only to that high level of industrial disputation but also to the fact that, at the same time, we have the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression. We have the highest level of unemployment which would usually be regarded as a factor in limiting industrial disputation if we saw punitive arguments as the means of stopping industrial unrest. </PARA>
<PARA> For a variety of reasons there is a very serious industrial relations problem in Australia. We have heard advanced, in the context of that very serious industrial relations problem, arguments by Government senators and, indeed, by Government Ministers that Australian wages have to be competitive with the countries of South East Asia if we are to have any sort of export-led recovery. I see the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) is shaking his head. That argument has been advanced frequently by his colleagues, if not by him. I do not really understand what that means. If it means we have to have a comparative wage situation with Korea or Singapore, I think we ought to start thinking again about where this country is going. In the context of those factors which I have mentioned-the absence of a unified industrial relations system, the absence of a wages policy, and the absence of a prospect of an incomes policy, a high level of industrial disputation and so on-we find a government which will tackle none of these basic problems. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has been introduced at a time when the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), who enjoys the distrust of employers and employees alike, is about to be removed. This Government introduced this legislation in that context. The Minister for Industrial Relations stood, on certain assumptions, for deputy leadership of his party and finished up with five votes. That shows the confidence which the Liberal Party has in that Minister's competence and capacity to carry out the administration of his portfolio. Of course, we have, at this time in this sort of situation, a government which will tackle none of those fundamental problems but which embarks, instead, upon a course of confrontation rather than concensus. It is a sort of Falkland Islands syndrome within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation has been introduced again which does not have the approval of the employer organisations in any substantial degree. It is designed to appeal to the sort of gung ho, hip-shooting fringe-dwellers of the National Country Party and is really not, in any sense, based on any analysis of what the needs of this country are in terms of sound industrial relations. Once again there is an attempt to manipulate industrial relations as an arm of government policy for cynical, political purposes. This legislation is another step towards the law of the jungle in Australian industrial relations at a time when Australia desperately needs consensus, desperately needs a steady hand in government, desperately needs in business circles a degree of certainty about where this country is going and desperately needs a degree of leadership from government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget some of the fundamental facts. According to World Bank statistics the decline in per capita income of this country is incredibly significant in terms of OECD figures. I remind the Senate, as I suppose I have done on previous occasions, that that decline has been documented in government reports, such as the report of the Crawford Study Group into Structural Adjustment, and so on, and has been drawn attention to in a number of publications; but it seems to have been completely ignored by the present Government. Professor Kasper drew attention to it in a submission to the Crawford Study Group, a submission which has been quoted at some length. I simply make the point that, on world data, in 1966 Australia stood fifth in the world in terms of per capita income after the United States of America, Sweden, Switzerland and Canada. By 1973 we were tenth-we had moved from fifth place to tenth place. </PARA>
<PARA> The band-wagon of Australian growth, development and increasing wealth had turned out to be a hearse by 1973. By 1979 we had gone to eleventh place, having been passed by a number of the European democracies, and we have now been passed by Japan. It is interesting to note the order of those countries which had a higher per capita income than Australia as at 1979: Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark , Germany, Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, France, Canada and so on. Both the United States and Canada have slipped, but in 1982, of the OECD countries, only Italy and the United Kingdom remain below Australia in terms of per capita income. Similarly, if one looks at Australian growth rates one will see exactly the same sort of level of performance. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention these things because if we are to improve that sort of performance-I would argue that we have a desperate need for better economic performance in this country-central to improved economic performance is an improvement in the industrial relations environment in this country. I repeat that that is central to it. That involves some sort of agreement about fair shares in Australian society. It involves matters of, for example, tax avoidance-the tax avoidance industry was succoured by this Government until quite recently. It involves questions of redistribution of wealth away from the poorer section of the community to the wealthier section, as has happened under this Government. In my view it involves questions about the sorts of taxes we are prepared to impose on capital accretions of wealth, something which the Liberal Party sought to remove from the agenda of political debate in this country as though it were a naughty expression which should not be discussed in Australia. Alone again, Australia being amongst the OECD countries which do not have a significant form of capital or wealth tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just made the point that the horrendous thing is that in the last election campaign attempts were made to remove that issue from the agenda of political discussion in Australia. As I have said, central to this issue of economic recovery is the need for a better industrial relations performance. Some time ago-in 1975-in a moment of temporary aberration the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) recognised that fact when he talked about the basis for any successful industrial relations policy being trust, mutual respect and good will. There is no capacity at all in Australia for trust, mutual respect and good will in industrial relations as long as this Government remains in power under the present leadership. That is one of the tragedies which is again exemplified by this piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said earlier that the Crawford report on structural adjustment made the point that if there were to be any restructuring of Australian industry, which is desperately needed, it had to be done on the basis of concensus and a common pact between employers, government and trade unions. The capacity to reach that concensus is no longer there. One of the reasons it is not there is the policies followed by this Government, which are exemplified by this sort of legislation. As I said earlier, this is about the twelfth time since the Fraser Government came to power that it has sought to rectify industrial relations problems by legislation of this kind. This legislation is as doomed as the last lot and the lot before that were because it is not based on any notion of the importance of arriving at a national concensus on industrial relations policy. At the end of my comments I intend to move an amendment to the motion that the Bills be read a second time, to the effect that this legislation be referred to a select committee of the Senate for examination. </PARA>

<PARA> We see only one course which will avoid this Government going down that old road-paved with ancient typewriters-which it has followed in the past. We do not want the Government to go down that road again. We believe that a Senate committee should examine the fundamental issues in this legislation. Of course, we have tried this before. Last year I introduced a Bill proposing a greater capacity for amalgamations of unions. It was rejected by the Senate. But one of the important factors about that legislation was that it sought to progress towards union amalgamations which would be based on a community of interest, as determined by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Mulvihill says with that flattery which comes so seldom from him, industrial realism was present in that legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to comment specifically on some of the provisions of the legislation. The first comment I make is that it weakens the influence and power of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission at a time when exactly the opposite process should be taking place. In Australia we have this ludicrous situation of having seven bodies capable of fixing wages and conditions of employment. There are six State arbitration systems and a national arbitration system. If one adds all the State parliaments, there is a total of 13 bodies. The arbitration Commission exerted a role as a centralised wage fixing tribunal for some time in Australia-in the period to June last year, when the Prime Minister flew overseas to the royal wedding and abandoned industrial relations in Australia to the troglodytes. That is when the real problems started again. The objects of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, apart from the object of securing industrial peace, as far as it is possible, include the strengthening of the representative organisations of employers and employees because they are fundamental to the industrial power of the Commonwealth as set out in the Constitution. It is fundamental that the representative organisations of employers and employees be strengthened in order that they might participate in that process provided by the Constitution and, of course, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> My second major objection to this legislation is that again it shows the chronic confusion of the Fraser Government between wages policy and the dispute settling function of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Wages policy is something we do not have any more. The Arbitration Commission is, in my view, the most suitable body to provide a centralised wage fixation system for this country. I think it is very important to realise, in relation to industrial matters as well as many other matters which are of concern to this country at a time of economic chaos, that people at every level of society and of every walk of life in Australia are asking: Where is this country going under this Government? It is essential that we look towards the preservation of existing institutions and provide for continuity and development of those institutions rather than rely on peculiar ideological theories imported from abroad-creatures of fashion-which fill the vacuum in conservative heads for a few months and then go out of fashion. That is what we are doing. It is important that there be continuity in the development of institutions and that the central function of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission be strengthened rather than weakened , as it will be by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is quite complex; it has many provisions. I want to deal with some of the major ones which are the subject of the matters we intend to refer to a Senate select committee. The first of those matters is the so-called stand- down provisions. The current situation, briefly stated, is that if an employer has an industrial dispute in his establishment or finds that sections of his work force cannot be usefully employed because of industrial disputation either in his establishment or somewhere else he is entitled to go to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. If, after argument, he establishes a prima facie case before an arbitrator or a judge, he is able to obtain a so-called stand- down clause which entitles him to stand down those employees who cannot be usefully employed because of industrial disputation. That provision, of course, will remain. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, by this legislation introduced at this extraordinary time, is proposing to introduce another provision which will give employers the right to stand down employees automatically by simply making a declaration to the effect that the employees are engaged in industrial action, however defined-it is not very clear how it is defined. Employers may also stand down employees if they cannot be usefully employed or if their business is suffering substantial loss or damage. That effectively provides for a unilateral declaration by an employer that in his opinion a section of his work force cannot be usefully employed. It goes without saying that during the period that unilateral declaration made by an employer is in force those employees who are stood down as a result will not be paid. That is at the whim of a single employer. Absolutely no safeguards are provided in this legislation against any abuse of that process by an employer. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian economy of 1982, when we are looking to the future, it is not the time to turn back the law relating to industrial relations to what it was in England in 1782. That is what this Government is doing. The British courts decided in the eighteenth century that as a matter of common law one could employ somebody, sack somebody but not suspend anybody. An employer could not leave somebody in limbo, without pay, at his whim. That was the common law prior to the introduction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in Australia. That will happen under this legislation if it is carried, and that is what the Government presumably seeks to do. It is extraordinary that any Parliament would condone that situation in a country which has all the difficulties that this one has to which I have referred. I hope that the Government will look to the future rather than to the long distant past. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no safeguards against the use of that provision by employers. There is no provision for a hearing before an impartial tribunal, no concept of a fair go, which one would have thought was integral to the notion of obtaining any consensus about anything in this society, and no provision for appeal. The dispute which leads to the standing down of employees without pay might in fact be caused by the employer. He can still stand them down. It is not an unlikely circumstance that the dispute might be caused by the employer. Nearly 30 per cent of industrial disputes in Australia are attributed to mismanagement by employers. In such a situation an employer could still stand down employees under these provisions. That is totally disastrous if we are to strive in any sense towards a better environment and a better atmosphere in industry and proceed to try to reconstruct the economy on the basis of some common sense of direction. That is the point we have reached and that is what is required. </PARA>

<PARA> The second important point in this legislation is the question of the registration of unions, the provision that says, effectively, that unions can only be registered from now on if they are based on an industry. That is conceptually, in my personal view, highly desirable. But, of course, there is no adequate definition of 'industry' in this legislation and there is no mechanism for dealing with the enormous difficulties which would be encountered in implementing such a policy. One has to have regard to social, industrial and political realities before one embarks on these crazy, ideological goals. One of Evelyn Waugh's novels says: 'People devote so much time to building utopias in which no civilised person would want to live.' That is precisely what this Government is presumably trying to do with this bizarre legislation. It is trying to build some sort of industrial relations utopia which just will not work. None of the people involved in it believe it will work. They believe it is just another cynical exercise in manipulating industrial relations. We are very critical of the method adopted to achieve this proposal for industry based unions. This goal is desirable in my view. This country, economically, would be well served if the goal could be obtained, but it cannot be obtained by using a hammer. What is the opposite to a carrot in that situation?</PARA>

<PARA> The third point I want to mention is the question of the abolition of preference to unionists and members of industrial organisations, the so-called ' voluntary unionism provision'. It is beaut conceptually that everybody in this world should be able to join whatever he wants to and not join whatever he does not want to join. It just does not work like that. The whole question of preference for unionism is a matter which should get serious study from scholars such as Senator Crichton-Browne who is sitting over there. There is a history of preference to unionists. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has the power to grant that preference on the basis of a variety of matters relating to ensuring industrial peace in a particular industry. Time is eluding me but I am sure that some other concerned person will take up that question in the context of the debate. As I said, these matters are too important to be left to this Government. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982 is no ordinary piece of legislation. It is potentially the most dangerous, inflammatory and repressive piece of legislation that has been introduced into this place since I have been here. This Bill strikes at the very heart of our Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and our system for fixing wages. It does not address itself to the problem that has been encountered in this country since indexation failed-that is, it does not make clear what system or wage fixation we should adopt. That is the first matter the Government should address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Understandably the Australian Democrats have been very concerned about this Bill. We are acutely aware that the responsibility for this Bill passing or not passing into law rests squarely on the shoulders of all five Democrat senators. It would take only one Democrat senator to vote for this legislation and it will become the law of the land with the potential, as we see it, to provoke the greatest industrial confrontation this country has ever seen. For these critical reasons we have had extensive discussions with large numbers of people, such as employer organisations and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and particularly with small business people, farmers and individual unionists. They are all in agreement that this legislation would harm moderate unionists, that it would put some employers into financial peril and that it would go no way at all to restraining the excesses of militant unions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have given the legislation extensive thought. The Democrats have got their thinking on the matter clear. We have circulated widely amendments which we believe would lessen the impact of the more extreme parts of this Bill and allow it to perform some constructive purpose in our industrial relations law. Nevertheless, we support the amendment that Senator Button has moved which recommends that this legislation be referred to a select committee. We are prepared to support that move, providing the findings of that select committee are made clear to this House no later than the first sitting week in September. We do not want this committee to be used as an excuse to delay a decision on this matter. We are particularly concerned with the aspects of the Bill relating to voluntary unionism and to the automatic standing down of employees. Our amendments relate to those critical areas. We are happy for the whole Bill, together with our amendments, to be considered by the proposed select committee. We will be supporting that initiative by the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like briefly to explain the purpose of our amendments and outline our detailed consideration of this legislation. The first thing to remember is that the nature of the conciliation and arbitration system in this country is such that benefits negotiated by unions, and thus financed by union members, flow to union members and non-union members alike. We have a unique system in Australia; our system of conciliation and arbitration is unique and it has some advantages. It means that the benefits negotiated before the Commission flow equally throughout the land so that we do not have in Australia, as is fairly common in some countries-notably in the United States of America-pockets of poverty and depression. We have a very egalitarian society. No doubt the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1904 has contributed to that situation. But it also makes the rapid escalation of wages easy. For that reason we advocate that some compromise between direct bargaining-collective bargaining between managers, employers and unions directly-and our present system of conciliation and arbitration should be worked out. This is the critical issue that the Government has to face. So far it has not done so. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past many workers have recognised that in order for them to be effectively represented and effectively protected all eligible workers should be members of the relevant union. It is probably not an exaggeration to say that the viability of our conciliation and arbitration system rests on the collective representation of workers through unions. This is the very principle that the Government now attacks. If it has such grave reservations about unionism, it should say so. It should address itself to the problem of wage fixing, rewrite the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and give a new approach to wage fixing and to unionism. Historically, nevertheless, employers have preferred to deal with organisations representing the industrial interests of their employees, rather than directly negotiate with individuals. In large organisations dealing with hundreds and thousands of employees it would be extremely difficult if the work force were not organised through representation by a single body; namely, a union. So to bring in legislation which attacks the very principle of collective representation of workers before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is to attack the very basis of our current system without putting an alternative in its place. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to the three contentious areas and outline what the Australian Democrats suggest should be done. The areas are: Automatic stand-downs, the abolition of the preference provisions for unions and the very contentious clause 20, which allows individual employees to seek massive damages if they claim they are being disadvantaged in any way by not being members of unions. First, I refer to the right to stand down. The Democrats believe that the right of employers to stand down employees when there is industrial action and their employees cannot be usefully employed is vital. It is certainly vital for small business. Without it small business could not survive. However, we believe that the existing Act already gives employers an easy to obtain stand-down provision. Any employer can apply to the Commission at any time for a stand-down provision. In addition, he can apply for a general stand-down provision, that will remain in the award, in anticipation of industrial action, which provision can be implemented immediately the effects of industrial action become apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the original Conciliation and Arbitration Act was amended in 1977 to make obligatory the rapid and expeditious hearing of stand-down claims. Since 1977 there has been no evidence that the Commission has delayed hearing a stand- down claim. Nevertheless, we are anxious that stand-downs do not operate against small business in any way and we have suggested amendments that will have the effect of requiring the Commission to hear applications within two days and of giving employers the right to appeal to the full Commission if they are unhappy with the finding. To eliminate the Commission in the area of stand-down applications, as Senator Button pointed out, would be to give employers enormous power. They would be able arbitrarily-simply by signing a declaration- automatically to stand down employees without any reference or appeal by the employees or the employer to the Commission. This in effect would give employers an open slather to break the spirit and the letter of the law and would eliminate the guarantees that employees have to be paid a weekly wage, to have a reasonable assurance as to their future and, in the event of their services being terminated, to be paid a termination sum. So automatic stand-downs without any reference to the Commission, as we see it, could have very far-reaching repercussions. Our amendments are designed to speed up hearings, but we are very strongly opposed to automatic stand-downs. </PARA>
<PARA> The second contentious area relates to union preference. It is significant that union preference has been in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act since 1910 and that successive governments of all persuasions have not seen fit to alter this essential provision. It is in the Act for a very good reason-because the whole system depends on unions arguing their cases before the Commission. Therefore, it follows that there has to be reasonable membership of a union before it can represent employees in its area of operation fairly. We have come up with a solution which we believe attacks the two conflicting problems. There should not be undue coercion of individuals to join a union, but we have to keep in mind the essential fact that unions are necessary under our present system. We have said in our proposed amendments that the existing preference clauses should remain but that in future the Commission should be restricted from allowing further preferences to be put into the Act. The existing preferences would remain but we would allow either the employer or the union to apply for the withdrawal of those existing preferences if they so wished. We do not anticipate that there would be any rush by either employers or employees, through their unions, to withdraw the existing preference provisions in the Act. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. It would also allow existing private arrangements between companies and unions to remain. As we read this new legislation, all existing private agreements between employers and unions could be subject to challenge and to penalties if the challenge were successful. Our third set of amendments addresses itself to the very contentious clause 20 in the proposed new section 144A. This proposed new section, as it is now drafted, makes it illegal for unions or employers to coerce in any way individuals to join a union and, if the individuals are disadvantaged, they have the right to apply to the civil courts to claim damages. Our discussions have led us to believe that this complex and contentious measure would, again, disadvantage moderate unions and would have little or no effect on militant unions. Further, it would render employers vulnerable to legal action for massive damages even though they may have been acting in good faith.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have suggested a solution which we believe is worthy of very careful consideration by the Commission. In the Act there is an existing provision for conscientious objectors to apply to the Industrial Registrar to get a certificate of exemption from joining a union on the basis that they pay a fee to Consolidated Revenue. This conscientious objection clause has worked very well. There have been cases where people have applied to the Registrar and have obtained a certificate on the payment of a fee. In an attempt to balance the essentially conflicting requirements of compulsory unionism and the rights of an individual not to join any organisation if he so wishes-these are two conflicting principles-the existing conscientious objection clause should be widened so that an individual can apply to the Registrar for a certificate of exemption on the basis of principle only. These principles are spelt out. The individual may have a religious objection, a philosophical objection or just about any sort of objection to joining a union. </PARA>

Essentially, simply by broadening the definition of conscientious objector, we are able, within the existing Conciliation and Arbitration Act, to bring in a fee for service. We can think of no other way in which the conflicting principles can be reconciled. We request that the Senate and the select committee give very careful consideration to this suggestion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, there is no definition. It seems strange to us that an Act of parliament dealing with industry unions avoids defining, in any meaningful way, exactly what the Government means by an industry union. We make it clear that we support the original approach and Bill drafted by the Department of Industrial Relations and agreed to by the National Labour Consultative Council-that is, the Bill introduced last year by Senator Button. That at least gives a practical approach to one way in which industry unions could be encouraged. As an employer I am very concerned at the fact that the companies with which I am connected have six, seven or ten unions often competing with one another, any one of which can at any time lay a log of claims on my doorstep and start negotiating. This is leading to enormous problems in industrial relations. If there is some way in which we can encourage one union to represent the employees in a particular industry or company that would be a tremendous step forward. The concept of industry unions is vital. Unfortunately, it is not spelt out in enough detail in the Bill, nor does the Bill show how this concept of an industry union can be encouraged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that the passage of the Government's legislation in the form in which it is presented would have far reaching consequences for industrial relations in this country. We further believe that certain important provisions within the Bill could be unconstitutional. The amendments that I have outlined briefly and which have been circulated I believe offer a fair balance between legitimate but competing claims of unions and employers. We hope that the select committee can represent a consensus of all political parties in the Senate; that it will look at the Bill in a constructive way, as the Democrats have certainly tried to do; and that it can come up with some practical solutions which the Government can think about. We stress again that we have done our thinking. We are not supporting the select committee's consideration of this Bill in any way as an attempt to defer its passage. We will not under any circumstances vote for an extension of time past this Parliament's first sitting week in September. </PARA>

I am not referring to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) who represented the Minister for Industrial Relations and made the speech on Mr Viner's behalf. Mr Viner has made his second reading speech. He has made his bed and he will lie in it. The second reading speech contains a number of inaccuracies which must be put to rest here and now. It is my intention to do just that. The Minister commenced his speech by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> In my Ministerial statement to the House on 'Wage Determination and Industrial Relations' on 16 February I informed the House that I intended to introduce a number of legislative initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will recall that the Minister was forced by the Senate to provide some documentation in support of his ministerial statement on 16 February. The documentation which emerged was pathetic. It provided no real basis or proof of the so-called legislative initiatives which were implied in the Minister's speech to the Parliament on 16 February. One therefore wonders why the Minister made his statement on 16 February when it did not contain the specifics which were desired by the Senate. He did so because 16 February was before the Lowe by -election. It was purely and simply a political act. If industrial relations in Australia does not want anything else it certainly does not want political manipulation, either by Mr Viner or by the extremists within the trade union movement. For purely political purposes the Minister came into the House and made an unsubstantiated statement. He did so for the purposes of the Lowe by- election. Following that he rushed the legislation into the House of Representatives just before Easter-in time for the Victorian election-with no real, mature consideration being given to the clauses of the Bill. This is despite the fact that unions and employers, generally speaking, were opposed to the provisions of the legislation and had made their opposition known to the Minister. That was all done for a political purpose-the Victorian election. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened? Mr Thompson, the then Victorian Premier, jumped on the bandwagon and said that he, too, would go along with the Federal Government and institute some measures relating to industry unions-whatever that may mean-in Victoria. How he would have done that is another question. Of course, honourble senators know the industrial relations setup in relation to Victoria. They know that the registration of unions as it applies in, say, New South Wales and Queensland and in the Federal jurisdiction does not apply in Victoria. Not only did the Minister not come out with a definition of industry but also, of course, the Minister as well as everbody else, would have known that-unless something has happened since the time I was involved on a day to day basis in the industrial relations arena-the situation could not have existed. In any event, there was no machinery in Victoria to allow this to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> All that Mr Viner did was to create an atmosphere in which certain moderate unions had to explain to their members what effect the disastrous proposals of Mr Viner would have on those in the trade union movement who seek to achieve orderly industrial progress; for example, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association in Victoria, with something like 70,000 members, prior to the Victorian election distributed to all of its members a detailed report of what the Viner proposals would mean. The Association did not want to do that. It has no record of party political action and certainly no record of party political action against this Government or against the Victorian Government except, of course, when it came to an industrial matter relating to trading hours. But the Association was forced by Mr Viner to notify its 70,000 members, many of whom would have normally been Liberal voters, of the disastrous effects of the Viner proposals. Of course, the political ploy of Mr Viner backfired. The Liberal Party lost the Lowe by-election and the Victorian election. Quite obviously there were other factors, but this action of Mr Viner shows that he does not understand that thousands upon thousands of people within the trade union movement are quite well aware of the situation within the trade union movement and object very strongly to its manipulation by the extreme Left and by the likes of Mr Viner. </PARA>
<PARA> I go further. Mr Viner's second reading speech was seen to be a dishonest presentation of the Government's case and a distortion of the facts. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I now present a Bill to the House about matters that I then foreshadowed. </PARA>
<PARA>He then made this classic remark:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of elements but its philosophy can be distilled to three main things: Protection of the rights of the individual . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably, the Minister is talking about the right of the individual to decide whether to become a member of a trade union. Is he talking about that or is he talking about the freedom of individuals to form the associations of their choice? He cannot be talking about the latter because, according to the fine print of the Bill, the Minister assumes that he knows what an industry organisation is. The Minister will prescribe this by regulation. That flies in the face of international agreements relating to freedom of association. It is tantamount to the dictatorship in Poland saying to Solidarity: 'No, you are not a union. The union shall be structured in this, that or the other way'. The proposals in this legislation usurp the authority of the Industrial Registrar, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the Federal Court of Australia and the High Court of Australia. That authority is arrogated by the Minister. The implications of this must surely be studied. I trust that that will be one of the most important functions of the proposed select committee. The Minister stated that the philosophy is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to open the door to movement from within the work force so that present union rigidities and monopolies are loosened and structures created which are more suited to a modern economy and representative negotiations between employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA>What a lot of nonsense. We are asked to buy a pig in a poke in deciding what industry unions mean. As I and Senator Button have mentioned and as was mentioned by Senator Siddons in his speech just a moment ago, there is no definition whatsoever. The Minister arrogates power by regulation to do what is now the job which is done by the Registrar, the Federal Court and the High Court . The Minister talks about monopolies. Clearly, one understands that the Minister's proposals could well establish a monopoly union situation in certain industries. Whether that is a satisfactory situation and whether it is consistent with the Government's strategic policy for this nation are questions which the Government itself must answer. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to the point that the Minister made in his speech. It is a distortion of the facts. He said that the Government's decision to withdraw the power of the Commission to award preference is a protection of the rights of the individual. In fact, it is no such thing. That statement shows the ignorance of Mr Viner of the very basis upon which preference for unionists provisions were inserted originally in awards of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Mr Justice Higgins, in one of his original judgments, clearly indicated that his award of preference was in pursuance of the principles of freedom of association which ensured a circumstance whereby an employer could not impose an anti-union will on his employees and whereby the employees were encouraged by virtue of the award provisions to belong to unions. Of course, those provisions must be read in conjunction with section 144A of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act-the conscientious objections provision section 144A prescribes that where a person satisfies the Registrar that that person's conscientious beliefs do not allow that person to be a member of an organisation and where that person pays the prescribed fee the Registrar shall issue a certificate to that effect. We should bear in mind that the definition of ' conscientious beliefs' is stated as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . any conscientious beliefs, whether the grounds for the beliefs are or are not of a religious character and whether the beliefs are or are not part of the doctrine of any religion;</PARA>
<PARA>The Government seeks to repeal section 144A of the Act. It seeks to lump conscientious objectors in with all others who decide not to join a union-the backsliders, the freeloaders, and the agents provocateur, of whom there are some . Here is the Government lumping genuine conscientious objectors, for whose rights I have stood up and fought over the 23 years that I have been a member of the trade union movement, in with backsliders, agents provocateur and simple non -payers. That also is a question which no doubt will be considered when the legislation is considered in the select committee. The members of some groups, including religious groups, for their own reasons, having made a practical judgment-I do not agree with them-as to the rightness or wrongness of the situation, have some conscientious objections to belonging to a union. I invite them to make submissions to the proposed committee when it is set up. I am certain that their submissions would be quite contrary to the Government's attempt to lump them, genuine conscientious objectors, in with all the backsliders. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals that have been mentioned by Senator Siddons have some merit. Although I do not quite understand them, I assume that he means that all persons who are not members of a union should be required by some means or another to pay a fee for service; in other words, that there should be a recognition of the fact that unions spend a great deal of effort, time and money in achieving award provisions which are applicable to members and non-members alike, while always preserving the rights of conscientious objectors. Senator Siddons pointed out that the Australian Democrats' amendments seek to allow existing award provisions to operate but in some way to allow objections to be taken to other provisions similar to what the Government has set out in its legislation. I cannot quite correlate that objective with Senator Siddons's statement about the need for those other than conscientious objectors to pay a fee for service. No doubt that will be explained in detail to the committee. In any event, the Parliament does not have any power to invalidate existing award provisions relating to preference for unionists. There may be a misunderstanding of that provision by some honourable senators, but I am quite clear that the Parliament does not have that power. It is not given the head of power in section 51 (xxxv) of the Constitution. The Minister went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Fundamental to the Government's approach is its belief that the expression and pursuit of democratic freedoms, including the rights of association and the withholding of labour, and the operation of free institutions, such as trade unions, cannot survive in the absence of law. </PARA>
<PARA>That is true, but when we come to framing laws we must ensure that democratic procedures are adopted. Is it democratic-this is another question that ought to be considered by the committee-to reduce the required number of persons approving an amalgamation to 12 1/2 per cent plus one? That is what the Bill provides. At present for an amalgamation to be effective 50 per cent of the union members must vote in the amalgamation ballot, half of whom plus one must vote in favour. Now the Government is proposing that 25 per cent must vote in the case of an industry union-whatever that might mean-half of whom, 12 1/2 per cent, plus one must vote in favour if the amalgamation is to take effect. Is that a democratic procedure? That is also a question that surely must be considered as relevant when the committee deliberates on this measure. The Minister in his statement said:</PARA>
<PARA> The notion that for some reason unions are so different that they and the conduct of their members should stand beyond the law is untenable and at the root of much of the industrial trouble Australia has experienced in recent years . </PARA>
<PARA>But the question must arise as to how this legislation overcomes that situation. Clearly, it does not do so. The Minister's statement was quite contrary to that of the Acting Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, in January 1982. Mr Anthony said:</PARA>
<PARA> You cannot stop strikes and make people behave responsibly simply by passing laws. </PARA>
<PARA> We need a new national spirit, a spirit of goodwill and unity; to see what our problems are and what needs to be done about them. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made by the Acting Prime Minister. But the Minister for Industrial Relations is bringing down legislation which is opposed by thinking people within the trade union movement and by thinking employers. Of course, it will be of central interest to the proposed committee to know what the central trade union movement is doing about regulating itself in matters of industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, at the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress, the President, Cliff Dolan, adverted to rules 13 and 14 of the ACTU relating to the conduct and control of industrial disputes. The more that this is emphasised, the more likely it is that people such as Mr Viner will be painted into a corner and will not have available to them the political motivation to bring down such political legislation as that which is now before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his second reading speech, made another statement concerning the preference for unionists provisions. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It may be of interest to honourable members to note that this is consistent with provisions passed recently in the United Kingdom Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>How recent is 'recent'? The only amendments which have been passed to the United Kingdom's employment Act were passed in 1980. If that is recent then so be it. But what has been the effect of those amendments relating to preference for unionists and the sanctions that are imposed? We should bear in mind that the Commission cannot award compulsory unionism. Therefore the Government's suggestion that this is an anti-compulsory union Bill is fictitious. It is contrary to the facts. It is not only a distortion of the facts but also it is untrue. There is no provision in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act whereby the Commission can award compulsory unionism; none whatsoever. Any such award has been found to be invalid. For the Government to go to the country and say that this is an anti-compulsory union Bill is untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see what has happened in the United Kingdom following Mrs Thatcher's amendments to the employment Act. I am sure that this will also be of interest to the proposed committee. The United Kingdom legislation-the recent legislation , according to the Minister-came into effect on 1 October 1980. Statistics for industrial disputes in that year showed that the proportion of workers directly involved in disputes whose causes were trade union matters-this is what the English legislation was designed to overcome-was 7.7 per cent. In the year following the legislation that figure had risen to 23.2 per cent of all disputes . That is notwithstanding the fact that the number of disputes had declined because of unemployment. Yet the Minister, Mr Viner, is blindly following Mrs Thatcher down the road to perdition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills that we have before us are the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982 and the Commonwealth Employees (Voluntary Membership of Unions) Bill 1982. In responding to the debate which has taken place, I acknowledge the much greater interest in this chamber in the legislation than is evidenced by the number of speakers who have spoken this evening. I understand that a significant number of honourable senators on both sides of the chamber wished to contribute to the debate. They withdrew on the assumption that a motion referring the Bill to a committee would be passed and that in that circumstance an extended and very lengthy debate on the Bill at this stage would not necessarily be of any assistance. I indicate that it is not the wish of the Government that the Bill should go to a committee. The Government will be opposing that motion. Indeed, the Government will also be moving an amendment to the motion in case it is passed. From the indications I have had from the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Independent senator, Senator Harradine, it would appear that provided all those parties vote together the Bill will go to a committee. I acknowledge the interest of honourable senators on this side of the House who sought to speak on the Bill but who have not spoken because of the situation in which we find ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are some curious aspects to this debate. All honourable senators who have spoken so far have expressed concern about the need for consensus in Australia, a consensus which will form the basis of a better system of industrial relations . I do not think that anybody who has spoken, be it for the Opposition or the Australian Democrats, or Senator Harradine, has claimed that the system is perfect. Of the three speakers so far, Senator Harradine, least of all, has conceded defects in the system. I think that was probably due to the shortage of time. Even he would concede that the system is not necessarily functioning satisfactorily in many respects. I join with those honourable senators who believe it is important that there should be good will. I agree with the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) which was read into the debate a little while ago. All those sentiments are very important. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to what is curious about this debate. It seems to me that when one reads the debate in the other place and considers the debate here it is extraordinary how, in a field in which we are seeking to build consensus and goodwill, so much attention is given to attacking the person and the personality of the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) and so little attention is given to the fact that there is broad agreement about the need to move in the directions Mr Viner has set forth in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that Senator Harradine is alone in his total opposition to some aspects of this Bill. But I draw the attention of the Senate and the people of Australia to the fact that the Bill puts forward a proposal for a first minor step towards the possibility of industry unions-a step which the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button), who has spoken for the Australian Labor Party today , embraced. It was embraced by Senator Siddons on behalf of the Democrats. There has been some quarrel with the technical aspects of this step and whether there has been a sufficient definition of industry union and so on. I will come to that point later. If one looks at that aspect of the Bill, at the broad concern which has been expressed in the industrial relations community, in the Government, the Opposition and so on about the need for us to be moving towards industry based unions, one sees that the discussion on this Bill could contribute to a greater consensus. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the provisions which are in the Bill and which I will refer to in more detail shortly do not warrant the comments which were made, particularly in the House of Representatives and to a lesser extent, in the Senate. When we look to the position with respect to stand downs, we find that, notwithstanding the accusation that this is a Bill which will cause industrial conflagration, Senator Siddons, leading for the Democrats, conceded that for small business in particular the protection of a stand down power is important. I will deal again, in more detail, with the attitude of the Australian Democrats with respect to this matter. The key point I wish to make is that this Bill deals with three areas on which I believe there is a broad consensus in the community. Whilst it may be fair for the Parliament to be critical and difficult about the way that sections of this Bill might be phrased and to say that more could be done to define an industry, I believe it is absolutely wrong to categorise a Bill, which essentially deals with the individual freedom of people as to whether they join a union, the question of preference, which relates to industrial unions, and the question of stand downs, which the Democrats, at least, believe is a very important issue for small business and, I think, for the whole business community, as divisive and difficult in the sorts of words that have been used here today. I suggest that people outside this place who are concerned about whether we take an intelligent approach and try genuinely to tackle the problems of Australia compare the pleas for reason and consensus with the way this debate has been conducted. I commend for their attention the debate on this Bill which took place in the House of Representatives and the Opposition's contribution to that debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill deals with a series of propositions, some of which, of course, do not give rise to any dispute at all. There are certain technical matters on which I will not waste time. There are matters which relate to the extension of periods for which union officers may hold office. There are various matters which, I understand, have been through the NLCC which are broadly agreed to by all parties and therefore will not be subject to any opposition in this place. There are provisions which relate to various reciprocal arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States which would avoid unions jumping from State to Federal jurisdictions in circumstances of deregistration. I suspect that the Opposition may be opposed to that, but I understand that the Australian Democrats are not opposed to that and were that to come to a vote it would have the support of this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> So there are various elements of the legislation which are widely supported and which would have a majority in this place. That is one of the reasons why I regret that the fate of the Bill could be to be referred to a committee. These useful provisions will, like all other provisions in the Bill, be delayed if that occurs. It is no good the Democrats saying that they will not move to send it to a committee to delay it. Of course the effect of any reference to a committee is to delay the provisions, however desirable they may be. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the major elements of the legislation and to what the Government has proposed and what attitude had been adopted by honourable senators opposite. We have a proposal which relates to industry unions. I have said already that there is broad agreement in this place that we should move towards a system of industry unions instead of the craft unions which have been a feature of our situation. I think--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that point, although it is quite adequately explained in the second reading speech. Honourable senators should have taken the trouble to read it. In that regard I remind honourable senators of Senator Button's concern about our need to move gradually and in accordance with the reality of the industrial situation if we are to move to industry unions. If that view is based on the fact that there is an industrial reality outside this place which needs to be accommodated in the legislation, why is there any complaint about the proposal in this legislation that the question of what is an industry should not be precisely defined at this stage but should be defined by regulation after consultation with the parties concerned? It should be defined after consultation with employers, employees and the National Labour Consultative Council. It is clearly established in the second reading speech that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is proposed to leave to regulations the prescription of the classes of industry for which a union can be formed to enable discussions to be held with the ACTU and employers as the process of change is initiated. In this way the development of industry unions can occur in consultation with unions and employers directly involved and the peak employer and union bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could more clearly fit the problem which was defined by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech. We will be feeling our way in this area. We will be moving to a desirable objective. I suggest to the Senate that the scheme of the Bill which has been put down by Mr Viner on behalf of the Government acknowledges that this is a novelty and that it is a matter of moving into some uncharted waters. </PARA>
<PARA> Another small point with respect to industry based unions was the point made by Senator Button which suggested that unions of any other sort could no longer be registered. That shows a misreading of the Bill. There is nothing which affects the existing classifications of unions which may be registered under the legislation. Those provisions are not touched. Those provisions remain; we have added to them. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was addressing myself to the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill which is being debated in this chamber. I had made the point that, whilst the Bill had been described as one which would produce a high level of disputation and, indeed, was described by the Democrats as one which would produce unprecedented industrial confrontation, it in fact deals with propositions which have support or partial support right around the chamber. I mentioned the support for industry unions which had been expressed by the Opposition, the Democrats and the Australian Council of Trade Unions and, I think, not by Senator Harradine but that may have been by omission. Certainly within the Government there has been long-standing support for that proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The availability of the stand down power to small business is admitted by the Democrats to be of fundamental importance, yet the attempt to extend that is again seen in very dramatic terms. I was trying to direct the attention of the Senate to the great degree of common ground and to the common sense which lies behind what has been put forward in this legislation. To return to industry unions with which I was dealing at the time of the suspension of the sitting, the position of the ACTU was laid down in its constitution as long ago as 1927. It refers to the development of the trade union movement towards an industrial basis and the amalgamations of unions where practicable to establish one union in each industry or sector. </PARA>
<PARA> We find this is supported by the Jackson Committee to Advise on Policies for Manufacturing Industry in its report of October 1975 which referred to the present fragmentation of unions, the difficulties to which that gives rise and the fact that that is a fertile field for demarcation and jurisdictional disputes. Let me refer to the remarks made by Senator Button during his contributions to debate in this place on the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill (No. 2) on 25 November 1981. His comments made it quite clear that he regards demarcation disputes as a serious problem. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Further, the present position of the law discourages and delays attempts to form industry based unions by adding another pitfall in the procedure which must be followed to effect an amalgamation between more than two unions. </PARA>
<PARA>The most significant criticism made of this attempt to come to grips with what everybody says is a desirable goal seems to be that there has been an inadequate definition of industry. As I pointed out before the suspension of the sitting and as Senator Button pointed out, the industrial scene is one in which the realities will impose themselves on the pattern. It is fair enough that we should be putting forward a proposal which involves the careful preparation of regulations describing an industry, regulations which will be drawn only after consultation with the employers and the unions which might be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I see this Bill, which I support, as an attempt to take an early step towards what has been agreed as a generally desirable goal. I regret that the Opposition in the Senate should see the need to subject this matter to further inquiry and debate over months and to delay the introduction of the legislation. The Bill also deals with the matter of stand downs. On this matter Mr Viner said:</PARA>
<PARA> If unions are to have as a basic principle the right to strike then it is surely not unreasonable for employers to have at their individual disposal the right to protect their commercial interests in circumstances where they are put at risk by union action. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that there is at the moment an inequality in this area. It is a fact that unions are able to go on strike without notice and without safeguards being present and cause employers very considerable difficulty. In the absence of some provision of an award permitting a stand down the employer is not in an equal position. I think that the remedying of that defect is something which would be seen as a very considerable advantage by a large section of Australians. The fact is that that inequality of the position between the employer and the employee in these areas is something that is widely recognised. It is no good harking back to the days when the employee could be seen as somebody who could be just put upon at the will of the employer. I think those days have long gone. The public, which is so often the victim of industrial action that is not going through the protective provisions which are available and not being subjected to the processes of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, understands that there is an inequality of bargaining power which needs to be rectified. I want to refer to the support which has been given to this concept by the Australian Democrats. A few days ago they publicly said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats believe that the right to stand down employees who cannot be employed due to industrial action elsewhere is necessary for employers, in particular for small businesses, if they are to survive. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Democrats' view we are talking about something which is necessary for small business if it is to survive. That is why this legislation ought to be proceeded with and passed. This is an important power if, in the words of the Democrats, employers are to survive. I was asked where the safeguards are. That was an important point in the challenging of this section. Will those honourable gentlemen opposite who are asking for safeguards accept mandatory safeguards against employees going on strike? It seems to me that that is a reasonable quid pro quo and I accept the logic of the position. If honourable senators wish to assert that there should be safeguards, surely there should be mutuality in those safeguards. But we do not have a system in which the right to strike is entrammeled by having to get the permission of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; the right to strike is availed of without warning. I suggest that if there is a genuine belief that we should produce some equality in this area the need for the sort of safeguard which has been claimed is not there. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of the Democrats on this matter is that if the Government does not accept their amendments they will vote against the automatic stand down proposals. I simply draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that there is no difference in principle between us in the sense that there is an acceptance of the need for stand downs. The difference is on a narrower point of what safeguards should be available. I point out that the safeguards are not available with respect to the prevention of a strike which could be very damaging to employers. The question of equality, therefore, is non-existent if one accepts the Democrats' view, and it was the point of equality which was stressed in the debate on this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The third major area with which this Bill deals is the field of voluntary unionism. It is in this area that, I think, it is quite evident that there is some real philosophic difference between us but it is a difference in which I think the Government's position is much closer to the community consensus than is the position which is being adopted by the Opposition. It was evident from the tone of the debate we heard that to some people the fact that a man is not a member of a union is something which one would say is almost pejorative-that it is a sign that there is something wrong with that person because he is not a member of a union. I would have thought--</PARA>

I have to say that I do not believe that that is the basic attitude of members of the community whom every honourable senator in this place is supposed to represent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The basic objection put forward by Senator Harradine was that the provisions meant that conscientious objectors were lumped together with backsliders and others whom he described. The simple fact is that if the obligation to become a member of a union were removed there would be no need for a conscientious objector provision. A person is free to make up his or her mind as to whether to become a member of a union. I find it quite extraordinary, as I think does the great bulk of people in Australia, that honourable senators opposite should find if offensive that people should have freedom of choice about whether to join a union. If they do not join a union it can be an impediment to their obtaining employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation has been described in strong terms by the Opposition. I point out that in leading the debate for the Opposition Senator Button said he thought it was 'beaut conceptually'-they are his words-but he went on to talk about the practical difficulties in moving to a situation in which no preference is given to unionists. If there is a genuine wish in this chamber to follow the sentiments that were so carefully expressed, I believe, by Senator Button for the Opposition and by Senator Siddons for the Democrats we should be trying to build a consensus and we ought to be capable of examining, without heat or emotion, the concept of whether a man can be forced to join a union to see whether the patterns of the past are to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the general comment about this legislation that there seems to be a great preparedness to attack it because it differs from some practices of the past. Senator Button has had extensive practice in the law in this field; Senator Harradine has had extensive practice as a union official and knows the field; and Senator Siddons is an employer of a large number of people and has had practical experience in this field. With great respect to those honourable senators who believe they are practitioners, including the honourable senator shaking his head, perhaps only the practitioners are satisfied with the past pattern of industrial relations in this country. Many of the people in Australia are not satisfied and are looking for the sort of changes the Government is introducing in this legislation. They are looking for a community in which people are free to join or not to join a union, in which a man is entitled to earn his livelihood without being forced to join a union, in which an employer can protect himself against strikes, and in which unions are organised on an industry basis, which is supposedly common ground around this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A series of matters is being raised by interjection now, and I have no time to deal with them. If the sentiments expressed in this debate are genuine, to some extent that will be borne out, if the Opposition succeeds in having this matter referred to a committee, in the way in which the committee is conducted and the way in which the members show by their membership of that committee whether they are genuinely trying to get to the facts, the truth and solutions which will work. Whilst I oppose the reference to a committee and whilst I am about to move an amendment to the amendment moved by Senator Button, if Senator Button's amendment, requiring the legislation to be sent to a committee succeeds, I believe it is incumbent on the committee members to work in the spirit of the speeches made in this place and to demonstrate by that that their remarks are genuine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has been elected three times on an industrial relations platform which includes commitments to industry based unions and to voluntary unionism. To suggest that, when we bring in this legislation in the terms which I described, it should go to a committee is specious and unnecessary. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Paragraph (d), line 1, leave out 'seven', insert 'eight'. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Paragraph (d) sub-paragraph (1), leave out 'three', insert 'four'. </PARA>
<PARA>That amendment should have been circulated, but I shall quickly explain it. Senator Button's amendment calls for the setting up of a select committee which will have seven members: Three nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, two nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, one to be nominated by the Leader of the Australian Democrats and an independent senator. The purpose of my amendment is to restore what has been the main practice in the Senate, which is to have an equality of Government and Opposition or non- Government senators. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. The normal Senate practice has been to have an equal number of government and opposition senators. I therefore moved that amendment. I sought information from the Clerks as to the practice. It is well known to all honourable senators that our standing committees operate on the basis of an equality of membership with, effectively, a government majority. If we look at the record from 1970 to 1979 we will find 11 select committees, and in the case of all but two of them there is an equality of numbers with a government chairman. One exception is the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in regard to which former Senator Murphy moved that there should be an opposition chairman, namely Senator Rae, who chaired the Committee before the election of the Labor Government. The other exception which is a precedent for this matter is the Senate Select Committee on the Rights of Migrant Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it will be something of a test of the sentiments expressed by Opposition speakers who claim that we should build a consensus in this area to see whether they are prepared to accept an amendment which will be in accordance with the most usual arrangements of the Senate and an earnest of their good faith in this matter. There is a tradition in this place whereby many committees -both select and standing committees-are able to tackle problems in a sensible way and are able to produce reports which are not based on party divisions. In this area in which there are claims from members of both the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats that we should be moving towards a national consensus, they should be prepared to show their faith in the processes which have so often served the Senate and, I believe, Australia well. I commend the Bills to the Senate and I oppose the Opposition's amendment. I moved my amendment to ensure that, should the Opposition's amendment be passed, the resolution will be in a better form than it otherwise would be. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: It is a sad thing that when so much lip service is paid to the idea that we should be striving for some unity of purpose in this area, Bills which do no more than take the first step towards the promotion of industry unions and to increase the freedom of people to belong to unions or not to belong to unions as they choose without the interference of the laws or anybody else in their lives, should be regarded as being so contentious, as something that the Senate cannot deal with for months and as something which gives rise to the sort of comments that were made in this place about the Minister who brought them forward. I commend the Bills to the Senate and trust they will have passage. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans says 'sanctimonious pap'. It is easy to lounge back there and make that remark. I would like to hear from Senator Evans some time as to how he believes that kind of a remark helps constructively in a debate which affects industrial relations, one of the most contentious matters of this time. Senator Chaney quite properly said that at least as far as the Australian Democrats are concened, and I think as far as the Australian Labor Party is concerned, the distance between us is not as far on these matters as it might appear to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the standdown provisions. The Australian Democrats certainly believe that some rights should be given to a small business person to stand down an employee who cannot be gainfully employed because of industrial action elsewhere. For instance, there may be an electricity blackout, or a Transport Workers Union strike may prevent raw materials from coming into a factory. There is no argument-I do not think the Labor Party would advance an argument; in fact , I know that the Labor Party do not advance an argument-that an employer in such a situation should be forced to keep on his employees ad infinitum and go bankrupt. The Labor Party agrees that there is justice in standdowns in that case; the Australian Democrats agree that there is justice in that; and the Government agrees that there is justice in that. But the Labor Party and the Democrats say that by bitter experience it is wrong to give all employees an automatic standdown right which in the past they have abused, particularly in the building industry, standing down workers four days out of five because standing down an employee is much cheaper than sacking an employee. Abuses have crept into this. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wants to facilitate stand-down provisions, the Democrats will support it, but will not support it in what it is trying to do in this Bill. We absolutely agree with the Labor Party that, if there is such a simple methodology of standing down an employee, some unscrupulous employer can simply go to a justice of the peace and make a declaration, saying: 'I believe that nine out of 10 of my employees should be stood down' and if ipso facto they are stood down they have no right of appeal to any person. I do not believe that any reasonable-minded person, particularly the Minister, can see justice in that. All we are saying, and as far as I can understand it all the Labor Party is saying, is: 'Let that declaration be subject to some appeal'. The appeal mechanism is there in the form of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. That has worked for five years. I have yet to meet an employer who objects to the present provisions in the Act. My colleague Senator Siddons, the most distinguished and experienced industrialist in this chamber, has not spoken to an employer who objects about the present provisions in the Act. Let the Minister name one employer who has asked the Government to change the standdown provisions in the Act. Let the Minister name one employer who can recount an experience of the present legislation acting adversely against him. We have issued that challenge in earlier debates and not one name has been trotted out. In fact, we can quote the names of employers who have come to us and said: 'For God's sake, stop the Government doing this insanity because it will breed confrontation and chaos'. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, as Senator Harradine suggests, there is a dilemma with the preference provision. It is a very big dilemma. The Democrats agree with Senator Chaney that no one should be forced to join an organisation. I do not know the expression Senator Harradine used, whether he used the term 'backsliders' or ' freeloaders' or whatever. It is difficult to get a word that describes them without giving offence. I have been guilty of using the word 'bludgers'. I find that offensive. It is a peculiar type of individual-he may belong to an industry or a factory-who allows his mates in that factory to pay their dues of $50 or $ 60 a year to a trade union, and that is the average union fee, to win safety conditions, better showers, better wages and other conditions and then says: 'I am not going to make a contribution to the fight for better conditions or better safety, I am simply going to be a freeloader'.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a far better word than 'bludger' or 'backslider'. We agree on that. We have come to a consensus on the word 'freeloader'. There is a dilemma about preference. The Australian Democrats' compromise is a fee for service. We say that we should not force anybody to join a union but we can take away preference and institute a fee for service that is paid either into Consolidated Revenue or to the union fund where it cannot be used for political purposes. We say that a person in an industry should not be a freeloader but should pay towards the costs of fighting injustices or gaining better conditions . A person should not be forced to pay money into an organisation, namely, a union, out of which money can be extracted to supplement a political party, whether it be the Communist Party, the Labor Party, the Democrats, the Democratic Labor Party, the National Civic Council or whatever, against his wishes. We say that is wrong. We have put forward a compromise. We are not saying that it is the answer to everything; we are saying it is a possible answer. That is why Senator Button's proposition that the matter should go to a select committee appealed to us. Had the Government demonstrated that in either of these two areas urgency called-namely, that massive damage was being done by the employers not having the right of automatic stand-downs or that preference for unionists had caused massive disputation and the loss of incredible amounts of time in disputes in the last year-we would have been reluctant to defer this matter by sending it to a select committee. The Government has not done that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What does Senator Button's amendment mean? It means that for three sitting weeks or 16 actual weeks between now and the first sitting week in September we will ask distinguished members of the Senate to take public evidence. We will ask members of the Senate to say to small business people, trade unions, big business and industry associations: 'Come and tell us the bugs in this proposed legislation. Is there any way in which this legislation, good though its intent might be, can be improved? Are there any ways in which this legislation might unconsciously cause strife?' Is there anything wrong with that proposition? I think that Senator Button has done a most responsible thing in moving his amendment. The Government could have said: 'To move and pass this amendment will cause chaos in the community'. But no Government speaker has said that. Senator Chaney has not said it; nor has any Government speaker in the other House. The Minister has not said it; nor has he demonstrated it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to pay the debate the respect which I think the contributions of Senators Button, Siddons, Harradine and Chaney deserve. I think it is one of the best debates that we have had in the Senate chamber for some time. I conclude by commenting on the amendment to the amendment, namely, the amendment moved by the Government proposing the constitution of the committee be changed. Senator Button has moved that there be three Government senators on this seven-person committee; that is, two Labor, one Democrat and one Independent, who, of course, is Senator Harradine. The Government has put forward a proposition that the number be increased from seven to eight and that the Government and this side have four each. I am not opposed to the Government having equal representation on this committee but if the committee polarises on party lines, which it would do in the election of a chairman, there would be four votes for a Government nominee and four votes for a non-Government nominee. There would be a tie. I understand that then a coin is flipped and whoever comes up heads is chairman of the committee and has not only a deliberative vote but also a casting vote. It has been put to me today by Government Ministers that in these matters it is traditional for a Government member to be the Chairman of a select committee.

It does not matter a damn which party is in government when it comes to this chamber exercising its business. In fact, I have heard those sentiments quite properly expressed by Government senators time and again and have applauded them for it. So, it is a total irrelevancy to say, for any reason-the least of which should be a traditional one-that a Government member should be the chairman of a select committee. I would have thought that the person best suited to the task should be the chairman of any committee of this chamber. I would be very happy to vote for the Government's amendment so that the committee would have four Government and four Opposition members, but that means that the election of the chairman is then left to the flip of a coin. My friend and colleague Senator Siddons tells me of his recent experience on another Senate select committe that was appointed to inquire into the Bendigo Clothing Factory. He said that that committee was ruthlessly mismanaged because a Government member was chairman. The Government overrode objections and the Government directed the business of that committee towards its own ends, and we are not going-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill was adjourned last night I was in the process of explaining the Australian Labor Party's support for the use of fully retrospective legislation as a counter to certain classes of tax avoidance and in particular the appropriateness of the application of retrospective legislation to the accumulation of tax free capital gains in defiance of section 26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act by the Bell and Bond corporations in the last couple of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will recapitulate what I said about retrospectivity only to the extent of summarising in the couple of minutes I have left the basic elements in the ALP's position. They are essentially four-fold. They cannot be repeated too often. Firstly, we take the view that fully restrospective legislation is the most effective known deterrent to the use of tax avoidance schemes. It is a way of dealing with those schemes which will make unnecessary continued resort to massively detailed amendments of the kind that we have been seeing in recent years. Secondly, our position is that the use of retrospectivity is justified only where blatantly contrived schemes are concerned, namely, the kinds of schemes which have no conceivable commercial justification other than tax avoidance, the kinds of schemes which nobody could go into other than with their eyes open as to their true nature and the kinds of schemes which Parliament could easily be persuaded were of this nature. Thirdly, we take the view that full retrospectivity is not appropriate where wide-ranging discretions of the Commissioner of Taxation are needed to deal with some particular avoidance scheme or arrangement. Rather, we take the view that this kind of legislative strategy is appropriate only in the context of very specific measures to deal with equally specific known abuses. Finally-perhaps most importantly of all-we do not advocate the retrospective application of penal provisions. We regard retrospectivity as appropriate only to ensure that the taxpayer ends up paying the tax which was due and at the otherwise applicable marginal rates in respect of the scheme in question. We think it is possible to gain general acceptance for this approach. We look forward to the day when both the Government and the Australian Democrats will join us in seeing not only the desirablility but also the inevitability of taking measures of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that we welcome this legislation as a serious-minded attempt to cope with some major loopholes evident in the previous law. We do not think the legislation goes far enough for the reasons that I have explained but at least it makes the attempt. If the cancer of tax avoidance with all its inequality and all the sense of injustice that it creates is to be rooted out we have to get a lot tougher than this Government has so far been prepared to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are tonight debating the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982 which seeks to make ten principal amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act. The Bill before us is a demonstration of the Government's continuing determination to crack down on tax avoidance, particularly in the areas of trust estates, profits, the disposal of certain shares and transfer pricing. I think the Bill also demonstrates to the Australian community the human face of the Liberal-National Country Party coalition. Clause 9 provides an extension of the deductions which are available under section 78, principally to include donations to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the various States and the Territories and donations of $2 or more to three appeals concerned with relief for Poland-namely , the Help Poland Live appeal conducted by the Australian National Committee for Relief to Poland, the Australian Red Cross Poland Appeal and the World Vision of Australia Poland Emergency Appeal. The measures relating to donations to appeals for Poland were announced on 18 February 1981 and deductions for donations of $2 or more, under section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, applied as from 5 February 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me deal with a number of areas in which we intended to close up loopholes that existed in the Income Tax Assessment Act. Honourable senators may recall that in 1980 a series of amendments were passed in relation to trust estates. Those amendments were intended to close up the loopholes in the then existing legislation. Unfortunately, in our society it is the business of a number of practising accountants and lawyers to seek a number of legal technicalities whereby they can overcome certain provisions of the Act for the benefit of their clients. It is the intention of the Government to trace these loopholes through and to introduce legislation to crack down on such tax avoiding schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains two principal amendments in relation to trust estates. The first one concerns beneficiaries who are presently entitled to income which does not relate to an individual; in other words a company or a beneficiary acting in the capacity of a trustee of a further trust estate. By this we mean that a number of multiple trusts are in use, in each of which an indefeasible vested interest below the tax threshold applies. In the first case, that of trusts, we seek to tax the income to which a beneficiary is presently entitled at the tax rates appropriate to the status of the beneficiary, subject to a tax threshold of $4,195. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second case we are seeking to close a loophole which developed as a result of amendments made to the principal Act in 1980. In the 1980 legislation we provided an initial threshhold of $1,040. Tax was applied to the trust income of children, being unearned income, which exceeded that threshhold. An exception was when the income was derived from employment. Astute tax avoiders set up trusts which had the formal content of trusts in respect of services rendered, thereby overcoming the exclusion in relation to employment income over the threshhold of $1,040, which would have attracted a tax of 46 per cent. There is an obvious injustice and we are determined to crack down on that loophole. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned that the astute tax avoiders have manipulated section 26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Section 26AAA sought to bring to tax profits made on property sales made within 12 months of purchase. These astute tax avoiders sold their shares in a company that actually made the profits. The intention of the legislation before us tonight is to bring to tax the profits made on the sale of shares in companies which engage in property aquisition and sales, subject to a profit making undertaking or scheme, within a 12-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area about which I wish to speak-I do not wish to speak on all the areas covered by the amending legislation-relates to depreciation. The Bill provides for a concessional basis for taxing industries associated with basic iron or steel production. We welcome the opportunity which is given to the steel industry to write of by way of depreciation charges its capital equipment costs over a five-year period. I think it is somewhat unfortunate that only one industry has been picked out. Australian manufacturers need the Income Tax Assessment Act and its associated regulations to provide greater flexibility as far as depreciation charges are concerned. We would also like to see a reduction in the number of categories in the income tax order relating to depreciation, and an increase in the rates, thereby enabling Australian businesses to become much more competitive on the international scene. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian businesses are in a great deal of difficulty in that they are being hamstrung by inadequate depreciation charges and have to compete in price on overseas markets. In other words there is less incentive for Australian manufacturers to invest in new equipment where the charges are inadequate. I certainly would press for an extension of the sorts of depreciation rates that are currently embodied in the legislation which are restricted to the iron ore and steel production industries, to cover the manufacturing industry generally. We hope that by effecting a reduction in the number of categories we will bring about a greater flexibility which will enable Australian industry to compete more effectively in the international scene. Certainly this Bill, if it is passed, will provide that flexibility to the iron and steel industries, but we would like it to be extended in the future to the whole of manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to report on the attack on transfer pricing. Honourable senators will know of the concern I have had ever since I came to the Senate about certain practices by multinational companies operating in Australia and effectively transferring their profits out of Australia. That means that the Australian tax authorities do not get their just share of the revenue. Furthermore, it places Australian manufacturing firms owned by Australians at a tax disadvantage and a cash disadvantage, because they are not really competing on equal terms. I think Senator Siddons spoke in some depth on this matter. He comes from a firm which is Australian-owned and Australian controlled and which possibly has to compete with some of these firms which, we thought, under the provisions of the previous section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, were forbidden to engage in transfer pricing practices. As a result of a number of representations and an investigation and report by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources concerning the aluminium industry, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) at last recognised the need to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act and introduced extensive amendments to the provisions which had stood for many years in the form of section 136 to limit the practice of transfer pricing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us tonight also makes provision for certain medical expenses paid to a group or company practice to be tax deductible. Honourable senators might recall that in Peate's case a doctor's arrangement was shot down by the High Court of Australia under section 260 of the Act. Technically, the decision in Peate's case represented good law to the present time. It was felt by the Government that tradesmen and others had the advantage of taking others into a practice, partnership and so on but if a doctor tried to do such a thing he would be shot down by virtue of Peate's case. Certainly, the Commissioner of Taxation could take action, probably under Part IVA, by virtue of that decision. This amendment does not enable doctors to take their wives into partnership, but it enables them to take other practising doctors into partnership. In cases where a doctor takes a fellow doctor into partnership and they form a company and render services to a client, the client, if he has concessional expenses over $1,590, can claim a rebate on the item. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather unfortunate that a number of professions have sought to reduce their ethical status to take away their personal liability responsibilities, but I suppose they are recognising some of the present day practices of increasing amounts of litigation being directed in respect of professional negligence. They are taking measures to protect themselves against what might be excessive court claims. This amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act recognises the change in the professional arrangements that are being made, particularly in the medical profession. There is a basic condition that a doctor must be in partnership with his professional colleagues, in other words, with other doctors. The provision forbids a doctor taking his wife or children into partnership. Certainly, that practice could be attacked very strongly under Part IVA and all its penalties would be applied. Peate's case is still good law so it is necessary to introduce this change to enable medical practitioners to combine in a company and to enable the recipients of their services to be able to claim expenses which will be rebatable provided their total concessional expenses exceed $1,590. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has questioned some of the penalties that were mentioned in relation to transfer pricing. Some honourable senators felt that the penalty of a 10 per cent charge was not high enough and, prima facie, this might appear to be the case. But that argument overlooked the fact that the 10 per cent penalty is not a tax deduction, so the effective charge is not 10 per cent but more in the vicinity of 18 or 19 per cent. Transfer pricing practices are not in the same category as the ordinary Part IVA arrangements. By these arrangements I mean the blatantly contrived, artificial schemes for which Senator Evans felt there was some justification in introducing an element of retrospectivity. Perhaps the 10 per cent charge for the late payment in these days of higher inflation, even though it is not tax deductible and is an effective charge of 18 or 19 per cent, will be subject to change at some future time. I hope that the Minister who replies will make some comment on this later in the evening. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other matter I wish to raise in relation to this Bill is that I thought it was regrettable that in this debate the Reverend Fred Nile's name was mentioned rather uncharitably. The Reverend Fred Nile is now a member of the Legislative Council in New South Wales. I draw honourable senators' attention to his maiden speech in the Parliamentary Debates of 25 November 1981. In that speech Reverend Nile recognised that because of Press reports people were getting a one-sided view of his philosophy. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable members of this House would have heard of my name before and have perhaps formed impressions of me based mainly on the mass media. All honourable members know how dangerous that can be. I would rather be judged in this House for what I really am, rather than the news media image, which may or may not be true to life. </PARA>
<PARA>Reverend Nile then spoke about his concern for high taxation, unemployment and inflation. He drew attention to the working class having to bear the burden for certain types of income taxation. It is probably appropriate, when considering the question of tax avoidance and moral ethics, to refer to the final paragraph of Reverend Nile's maiden speech. He quoted French philosopher, Albert Camus, who won the 1957 Nobel Prize, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The world expects of Christians that they will raise their voices so loudly and clearly and so formulate their protest that there is not even the slightest doubt what they are saying. Further, the world expects of Christians that they will eschew all fuzzy abstractions and plant themselves squarely in front of the bloody face of history. We stand in need of folk who have determined to speak directly and unmistakeably and, come what may, to stand by what they have said. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have often read that it is important to have pauses in speeches and my pause was at the beginning. I want to make a brief contribution to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982. There has been a wide-ranging debate on this topic. It is a complex piece of legislation. Senator Hill, who spoke earlier, made that point and certainly Senator Watson did. The Bill contains provisions dealing with tax avoidance, both internationally and domestically, relating to short term capital gains and gifts of art. It also deals with zone allowances, living away from home allowances for Service personnel, depreciation for the steel industry, gifts to charity, changes to rebate provisions for medical expenses and so on. It is a complex, wide-ranging piece of legislation. It adds further complexities to an already highly complex piece of legislation. The income tax laws are becoming increasingly incomprehensible. Their very incomprehensibility is a cause of much litigation and many loopholes in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Income Tax Assessment Act in Australia now runs to more than 1,000 pages. I make this point simply because it is our view that a very wide-ranging inquiry into the Income Tax Assessment Act is now needed, with the aim of simplifying tax laws. I do not want to be always attributing blame in relation to these matters. It is not necessarily helpful to the political debate to do so. But I make the point that in 1975 the Taxation Review Committee under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Asprey tabled its report. Whatever one thinks about each and every one of the many conclusions which the Committee drew in that report, it was a very thorough document. If one looks even through the index of the Asprey Committee's report one will see many references to the importance of simplicity in tax legislation. Part of the blame for the present situation must be attributed to the Fraser Government, after six and nearly seven years in government, because it allowed the Act to deteriorate and become so complex. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed also to introduce retrospective legislation to close off tax loopholes. I think that is very important. In various debates in this chamber we have discussed the desirability or otherwise of retrospective legislation. But in respect of the major social evil with which this country is confronted, namely tax avoidance, there should no longer be much room for argument about the desirability and moral and social validity of retrospective legislation as a means of preventing tax avoidance. The result of that failure has been a flourishing tax avoidance industry. It is now anybody's guess as to how much a wealthy section of the community is getting away with in terms of tax avoidance. That goes to the very moral fibre of this country. The fact is that 85 per cent of pay-as-you-earn taxpayers are paying 22 per cent more tax as a result of the last Budget because others in this society, through selfishness or for other reasons, are not paying the tax that they ought to be paying. That is a crucial moral, political and social issue for this country to face up to. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been debating industrial relations legislation here today. It is not only a question of what legislation like that contains, what machinery it provides for conciliating disputes, or what machinery it provides for fair shares in wages policy. We cannot get anywhere with those sorts of issues in the system in which a wages policy is sought to be established-not by this Government but by a better one than this, one would hope-unless there is confidence in the integrity of a progressive tax system. There is no confidence in the integrity of a progressive tax system in this country. Because of that, there is no room for establishing under this Government the basis for a social consensus about fair shares in respect of incomes and wages. The importance of that, I believe, cannot be overestimated because, until agreement is reached about that important social issue, not only are fair shares impossible but also the symbolism of a just society in terms of distribution of income is not there. So tax avoidance, in a sense, has become a symbolic issue. As I said before, it is an important moral and social issue which goes to the core of the integrity of the Government and the system of government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the main aims of this legislation is to amend section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act so as to close off loopholes relating to transfer pricing. This provision of the legislation is to be applauded. The only sad thing about it is that it is seven years too late. In 1975, the Asprey Committee, to which I referred, mentioned the need to close off these loopholes which were available to transnational corporations. If one looks at the Asprey report they were, obviously, then being exploited by these corporations which ensure, if they can, that their profits are maximised in places with low tax rates such as Hong Kong, Manila and Malaysia in certain circumstances. What companies do in this situation is to ensure that their profits are earned in countries which have a low level of taxation. In 1975, as I have said, the Asprey Committee commented on this and drew the attention of the Government to it. Now, after a seven-year honeymoon or whatever-a seven-year itch; certainly a seven-year irritation for this society-the Government has finally seen fit to act on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, companies have been putting their bickies in the tin for the rainy day which might happen when we get a decent government in this country and they have to pay their taxes as they ought to pay them. It is not just simply a case of Australia, as a society, losing tax revenue from these people. The potential damage caused by transnationals engaged in transfer pricing can include many other things other than the tax revenue loss to government. It can include loss of profits to local shareholders, which is something that local shareholders ought to be more conscious of. They do not have legislation to protect them, as trade unionists do under the Fraser Government, to make sure that they do everything exactly as they are told! Shareholders are not in that position. Perhaps they are not as aware as they ought to be of the loss of profits to local shareholders from transfer pricing. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, transfer pricing results in loss of higher wages to Australian workers for the same sorts of reasons. Businesses which operate in this country, and their employees, are all in the same boat. It is not a very healthy boat at the moment. There are a lot of leaks. But they are all in the same boat and the sooner there is greater recognition of that fact, the better it will be for this country. Further, transfer pricing can lead to a reduction in our balance of payments, already notoriously sick. It can lead similarly to a loss of foreign exchange. So, while we welcome the action incorporated in this legislation, we regret very much that it has come too late. We regret very much the fact that the penalties provided by the Government for this form of tax avoidance are inconsistently low when compared with penalties applied elsewhere in the legislation and are inconsistent with the moral turpitude-if I may use that stern Victorian expression-of tax avoidance. We want to make it quite clear that --</PARA>

We applaud the Government's action. We say that it is well worth while in many respects, but it is too late and the penalties provided are too small. That is consistent with this Government moving with the speed of the Arctic land mass towards doing something about tax avoidance. The Government will begin to catch up with a few tax avoiders by the year 2000. When one looks at the speed of light with which the tax avoidance industry has developed under this Government, one will see that it is a turtle and a hare sort of race but the turtle here is hopeless in every respect. It has no brains as well as no speed. It has no conviction about dealing with tax avoiders and no strength of character. It has nothing. It is a miserable turtle of a government, if I might continue with the analogy. I will give an example of what I mean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When this Government tried to act against the Commonwealth Aluminium Corp. Ltd, which is owned by Kaiser Aluminium and Chemical Corp. of the United States of America and Riotinto Zinc Corp. of the United Kingdom, the High Court of Australia in its decision sided with the company. It was an extraordinary decision of the High Court but it was not surprising, as the Court was presided over by the former Chief Justice, that such a decision should have been arrived at, particularly in view of the fact that the Asprey report suggested, as I have said, in 1975 that section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act was inadequate. The High Court was at that time adopting a very narrow interpretation of these provisions of the Act and at last the Government was finally forced to do something. All we are able to say about that is-I hope I may not appear too churlish-I suppose better late than never.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, even this legislation will be argued about by lawyers and challenged . But at least we have begun to get to the stage where some of the loopholes in the income tax assessment legislation might be closed off. Of course, the whole problem of transfer pricing could be made much easier to deal with if the Government demanded fuller information from transnational companies. In my view it would not be an outrageous thing for a government to do. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has recommended ground rules or codes of conduct for transnational companies. Senator Carrick, the Leader of the Government in the Senate rushes into the Senate brandishing the OECD report with the favourable parts for the Government marked with one of those yellow pencils.</PARA>

That is what Senator Carrick does when he comes into the Senate; he uses the OECD report for support rather than for illumination and he does not read those sections of the report which are not particularly comforting to the Government, like the section which says that the Government has no wages policy. As Senator Walsh pointed out, he does not refer to the passages of the report which are glaringly inaccurate, as is exposed by the diligent Senator Walsh, the shadow Minister for Finance, who has now left the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has recommended ground rules or codes of conduct in relation to transnationals. One would hope that the Government will take those up and insist on greater information being supplied by transnational companies operating in Australia. The OECD has said that companies should not be given the option of making available to governments the fullest information; they should be required to make available the fullest possible information. Without that information it will remain a difficulty for the Commissioner of Taxation to determine whether transnational companies operating in Australia are flouting the laws. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of debate about taxation legislation over a long period we on this side of the Senate have pointed time and again to loopholes which ought to be closed off by retrospective legislation, to the size of the tax avoidance industry in Australia and to the fact that the tax avoidance industry in Australia removes the possibility of any consensus about where this society ought to be going. It removes the possibility of having an incomes policy in this country or, at least, a wages policy-which this Government does not have. Without these things and while people are making enormous sums of money out of tax avoidance one cannot have a consensus on any of these issues in a country such as Australia and the country has no prospect of economic rehabilitation. We have pointed out these things over three or four years now. </PARA>
<PARA> While we have been doing that the tax avoidance industry has burgeoned from posing a couple of thousand identified tax avoiders in 1975 to having some 23, 000 tax avoiders in 1982. That is an indication of the size of the tax avoidance industry and the way it has flourished under this Government-to the detriment of other taxpayers and to the detriment of any possibility of agreement about what are fair shares in a society such as ours. </PARA>
<PARA> The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has recommended to governments such as the Fraser Government in Australia that there should be guidelines and codes of conduct for transnational companies operating in a country such as this, and that those guidelines should require those companies to give the government of the sovereign state-if Australia be a sovereign state any more-very clear information about their activities. Only then can a fair and proper assessment be made of true tax liability. Until such a fair and proper assessment is made there will still be massive tax evasion, the lack of morale in the society that goes with tax evasion and the constant criticism by trade unions and others that it is not fair for their members to be placed in a certain economic situation by government policies while so many others can avoid it by avoiding the law. In the context of this debate we again tell the Government that it ought to establish guidelines for transnational companies. If the Government is genuinely concerned, as a government, about the tax avoidance issue and is not just looking after some of its mates, it will do something about it as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the amendment which has been moved by my colleague Senator Walsh. The essence of that amendment is to ensure that penalties relating to tax avoidance are consistent and sufficiently high to be a genuine deterrent against that practice which is a social evil of enormous proportions. The second purpose of the amendment is to ensure that transnational corporations operating in Australia comply with the OECD and United Nations codes of conduct and to see that this Government insists on their so doing. Thirdly, we are concerned that the Bill fails to take retrospective action against persons flouting the tax system through blatant avoidance schemes utilising section 26AAA of the Act. Fourthly, our concern is that the Bill endorses use by the medical profession of corporate and trust arrangements with significant tax avoidance implications. </PARA>
<PARA> I need to say nothing about the medical profession and its tax avoidance activity except that, if anything, it enjoys a reputation in this society marginally lower than that of politicians. I spend a lot of time in the Senate urging better performance from members of this Government-they are politicians par excellence-because if we get better performance from this Government in the areas of tax avoidance and industrial relations, which we have discussed in this place and elsewhere, politicians will move up the hit parade well ahead of the medical profession, which will continue to slide down with the connivance of this Government which is allowing that profession even further opportunities for tax avoidance. I think it is most unfortunate that those unhappy doctors who have so much to answer for in this community-other than at the occasional times when they look after us-should be encouraged in that activity by this Government . I commend to the Senate the amendment moved by Senator Walsh and I hope that the Government will take some of the advice which we have suggested it profitably might take if it wants to look a bit better before the next election than it looks now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982 amends quite a considerable number of provisions of the income tax law. Within this debate I wish to speak about various amendments but not about the Bill as a whole. The Bill will counteract tax avoidance through transfer pricing, introduce new zone allowances and grant tax deductions in respect of certain charitable donations. These are the amendments that I wish to speak to briefly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Button had a considerable amount to say on transfer pricing. I also note that the report from the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources made comments in regard to the development of the bauxite, alumina and aluminium industries. The Government indicated that the proposed measures suggested in the report have been adopted by this Bill. While transfer pricing is mentioned particularly in regard to the mining industry, as a senator from the Northern Territory I note that transfer pricing has been carried out in other spheres of primary production. Transfer pricing means that, for example, the price of an article purchased at a certain price on the north coast will increase by the time it arrives in Hong Kong or Japan. That means that an Australian producer, in partnership with an overseas firm, misses out on profit. There has been much to say about the mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the north the same principle has applied to the production of pearls and prawns. There have been business arrangements between Australian firms which have overseas partners whereby the Australian partner, being the minority partner, has not been able to control the price of the pearls or, for that matter, the prawns. The majority partner overseas fixes the price at a much lower level in Australia, but when he transfers the product to overseas markets the prices increase tremendously. While there is a loss to the nation in income tax there is also a loss to the producer. I am pleased to see that action is being taken to counter this problem. Measures have been adopted to allow tax deductions for donations to Polish relief funds. This is very commendable. As honourable senators would realise, there have been many appeals throughout the nation to raise funds to send to Poland to assist the unfortunate people there through their period of privation and strife. This measure will be an incentive for people in Australia, who wish to assist the Polish relief funds, to make tax deductible donations. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very commendable, although it has no part in this Bill, that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) indicated last week that the flow of migrants into Australia is to be increased by some 10 per cent to 14 per cent. It is to be expected that the number of migrants coming to Australia this year will be 120,000-odd. I hope and expect that we will see an influx of Polish migrants who have been living in very poor conditions since the problems in Poland began. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the points I am very pleased to see relates to the zone allowances. Mr President, as you realise, over the years the zone allowance has brought considerable help by way of a taxation concession to the people in the outback. But over the years the level of the allowance has not increased and so its effect has deteriorated to some extent. The Government introduced this allowance in 1945 because of such things as the high cost of living, the problems associated with living in remote areas and climatic conditions. It was introduced to provide many of the people in the outback with the same degree of comfort as their cousins in the capital cities and along the eastern coast who live in better conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the lifestyle and living conditions have become more sophisticated, particularly in the cities, there has been little change in many parts of the outback. At times I wonder whether there has been any change at all. I can well remember when the zone allowance was introduced. In the 1940s and 1950s an outback airline used to service some 128 places in the north of Western Australia, the whole of the Northern Territory, western Queensland and South Australia. That airline was Connellan Airways. That magnificent airline did a remarkable job and weekly or bi-weekly brought air services-mail, perishables and freight-to the people of the outback. It was an extremely good service, but over the years, through high costs and various adversities, it declined until it closed down. To some degree other charter lines have taken over. The services that the people in the outback had in the 1940s and 1950s really have not been brought up to date. To some extent living conditions have improved for the people out in the bush or the northern coastline. These people live vast distances from markets and from cities. The cost of transport, whether it be by aircraft, road or barge, has increased tremendously for people living in these very isolated areas. I often visit them in this Territory which comprises approximately 540,000 square miles and wonder how they have the courage and the tenacity to remain and work in these conditions. They are very dedicated people. There are many families. Their earnings-whether they be salaried employees or earning money from their own business-are not high at all. Their salaries are little more than, if not equal to, those of people in the city or in the country towns. Yet they live in conditions of adversity and in very high cost areas. </PARA>
<PARA> It amazes me, when I wander through the outback and visit Aboriginal settlements and go through the little co-operative stores and the bush stores and see the orders that have to be brought several hundreds of miles to people- whether they be on cattle stations, mining fields or what have you-how on earth these people can afford to live. To some minor degree the zone allowance assists them. It was thought that the zone allowance was to be cut out completely but many representations have been made to the Government from the people of the north asking that zone allowances continue and that they be reviewed. I am very pleased to see that the Treasurer, John Howard, saw fit to bring about an inquiry. The report of that inquiry was tabled in June 1981. It is interesting to note that the Committee which reviewed the matter saw fit to continue the zone allowance, but did not see fit to increase the allowance applicable to zone A or zone B. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA> The change follows a careful examination of the zone allowance system in the light of the report of the public inquiry into the system of income tax rebates for people living in more isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangements given legal force by the Bill with effect from 1 November 1981, the basic rebates of $216 for zone A and $36 for zone B will not be altered, but the part of the zone rebate that is related to dependants will increase. </PARA>
<PARA> It will rise from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the relevant dependant rebate amounts for zone A and from 4 per cent to 20 per cent for zone B. </PARA>
<PARA>That is something which people will not refuse. Interestingly, the speech continues:</PARA>
<PARA> A special basic rebate of $750, in lieu of the ordinary basic zone A and zone B rebates, will be available for people residing, or spending the required period of time, in particularly isolated areas in either zone--</PARA>
<PARA>That is zone A or zone B-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, at places in excess of 250 kilometres by the shortest practicable surface route from the centre of the nearest population centre of 2,500 people or more. 1976 census data will be used to establish the population of centres for the purpose of the special basic rebate. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that after the 1981 census a review will be conducted and that a continuing review will be conducted every five years thereafter. I suppose that we cannot grumble at the recommendations of the inquiry, which have now been encompassed in legislation. I represent people of the outback. I feel that there is every reason in future reviews to increase the rebate from $216 in zone A and $36 in zone B to something that is much more effective. It must have been very difficult for the members of the inquiry to make a recommendation that would be effective in the Northern Territory, particularly in the isolated areas, particularly in those areas where a special basic rebate of $750 will apply. As I indicated a few moments ago, this was determined on the basis of a radius of 250 kilometres, by the shortest practicable surface route, from a town of no more than 2,500 people. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the map. I am referring not only to the Northern Territory, but also to Western Australia and Queensland. The effect of this planning will be that many places will miss out on the special basic rebate of $750. They will be categorised as zone B, for which the basic rebate of $216 applies. Because of the area that falls within the radius of 250 kilometres of a population centre of 2,500 people, very little of the Territory will be left to which a special rebate allowance will apply. Places such as Borroloola, which is on the Gulf of Carpentaria, small isolated areas, Aboriginal settlements and cattle stations will come under the special basic rebate of $750, but a vast number of people will remain on the basic rebate of $216. Paupers cannot grumble at this because it is at least something. But, as I said, I hope that in the future it will once again be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the situation in Arnhem Land. People living in places such as Milingimbi and Maningrida and various other places have to have their supplies delivered by barge, at very high costs. These people will not receive any further zone allowance but will continue to receive the basic rebate of $216. However, as I said, I am very pleased to see that this basic rebate will remain and that reviews will take place. The people who receive the special rebate will be quite thankful. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that in future we will see a very comprehensive review undertaken. I would like to see a review of the principle applied in determining the people in isolated areas who are to receive the special rebate. I do not think that using the 250 kilometre radius from a town of no more than 2,500 people is sufficient. As I have said before, too many people who should receive the special rebate allowance do not receive it. Once again, while I am being critical of the allowance-I believe it is not sufficient and that many more places in the Northern Territory should attract the special allowance-I am thankful that at least we will still have the zone allowance. I look forward to the time when it will come under review and the people, particularly those people who live in very isolated areas, can be given much more of a go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are discussing two Bills in a cognate debate; namely, the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 and the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1982. The first Bill contains a number of tidying-up amendments in relation to colleges of advanced education. The second Bill deal with schools . I will address myself to some of the issues covered in the first Bill, particularly those issues concerned with the amalgamation of colleges of advanced education. I point to what will be a continuing problem in relation not only to colleges of advanced education, but also to universities and, in some cases, to community colleges such as that in Darwin. I refer to the problem of supplementation. Until the last Budget the arrangements for supplementation were that the Government would pick up the additional costs that had accrued to tertiary institutions such as colleges of advanced education at the end of the financial year, particularly in relation to those additional charges over which the institutions had no control. Examples of this would be the recent academic salary rises, rises in inflation, particular wage decisions given to non- academic staff, electricity charge increases and the like. That range of charges in most cases would not be able to be predicted by the administrations of CAEs and, therefore, does not fall within their competence to budget for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has now adopted a new procedure-prospective supplementation. This, of course, means that real increases now will not be covered. An estimate is made of the additional costs which might arise in the ensuing year and the CAEs are granted that amount. The Government has made it very clear that there will be no financial relief whatsoever for institutions that go over those types of expenditures. The reason I raise this matter in relation to this legislation is that it deals with some of the problems resulting from amalgamations. I think we should take particular note here that there are specific problems that those amalgamated institutions will be running up against. Those institutions face a twofold problem now. Their constituent elements were granted that prospective supplementation. Therefore, each of the constituent elements, had it continued as a single institution, would have specific problems built into it. Over and above that, the amalgamations, of course, in many cases have added additional charges, some of which the Government has specifically funded for, some of which it has chosen to ignore.</PARA>
<PARA> The amalgamation problems merely compound the problems of supplementation because the ensuing administrations within those institutions will now be expected to budget not only within that prospective supplementation grant but also within the proposed additional costs for which the Government has estimated . If either of those or, what is more likely, if both of those groups of expenditures exceed the budgetary expectations imposed on them by this Government, that amalgamated institution, at the end of its first year of operation, will be in dire financial trouble. I believe that in most cases the Government has overestimated the reserves of those institutions and their capacity to adjust in the type of rapid way that the Government seems to expect.</PARA>
<PARA> I also point to the fact that this Government has not been able to project the additional cost rises in the economy. Given the vast range of economic advice that this Government has available to it, it has not been able to budget and stay within its means. Why should this Government expect that a tertiary institution which has far less access to those detailed projections and assessments should be able from month to month to eke out its total budget arrangement and stay within the total amount that the Government has projected? It hardly seems fair for any institution, let alone those institutions that have newly amalgamated, to have that imposed upon them. I suggest that the impressive name that we give to what the Government has engaged in-'estimates of increased costs'-is little more than a guesstimate of what will actually happen. Indeed, anybody who knows anything about the way some of these estimates are made is rather taken aback that the Government's source of advice in relation to them often rings people in various institutions and asks them what they think will be the outcome of a wage case or other particular element that may affect CAEs. I do not believe, and I am sure that the Government cannot believe, the rhetoric it is putting out in relation to this. The consequence of this economic situation for the CAEs is that they have set about attempting to cut back. I will refer to a specific area in which CAEs would be able to cut back. If they are to cut down on their courses, for example, and trim their sails somewhat, the obvious place to look for cut-backs would be the major component of recurrent costs, the salaries of staff. If we look at the latest report of the Tertiary Education Commission in relation to the staff in CAEs we discover that, with respect to combined university and CAE staff, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> In both sectors the number of staff aged 55 years and over is relatively small. Based on a retirement age of 65 years, approximately 9 per cent of staff at universities will be due to retire within the next 10 years. For CAEs the corresponding figure is 7 per cent; in some of the States the normal retirement age for staff who belong to State superannuation schemes-</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, some of those are still in CAEs-</PARA>
<PARA>is 60 years, which at a maximum could produce a retirement rate as high as 17 per cent over the next ten years. </PARA>
<PARA>We are not looking at 10 years. We are looking initially at one year in terms of the amalgamated institution or at a rolling triennium. It concerns me that it really is not possible for those internal budgets of CAEs to meet the types of propositions put up by the Government and seemingly from which the Government has no intention of retracting. In other words, there will be forthcoming no additional financial relief for the types of problems that may very well emerge from those amalgamated institutions. Other types of problems of CAEs, I think, also have not been given full weight by the Government. I refer to a lot of discussion about the economies of scale in the major institutions. I give as an example the Brisbane College of Advanced Education, which encompassed a number of campuses spread throughout Brisbane. Previously those campuses had their own administration and operated individually. The Government quite rightly saw that in the initial phase of the Brisbane College of Advanced Education, there would be increased costs involved and it allocated additional funds. However, the Government estimated that in some way after the initial period, economies of scale would set in and that these additional costs would not be faced. I suggest that the only way in which those economies of scale could be obtained would be by cutting back the services offered by those constituent colleges. If those colleges maintained their level of operation I suggest that there would be no economies of scale. Indeed, on any organisational principle one would expect increased costs because of the problems of communication between a variety of campuses. In other words, one would expect that the various institutions and their administrations would stay in place and that all that would be likely to happen would be the imposition of a further administration up above to co- ordinate the work between the various campuses. I do not believe it has been shown that the types of savings that the Government is projecting onto the CAEs will necessarily occur. As I have already said, if those cuts do not occur then those institutions will be in dire financial trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which some of these amalgamations took place is only to be deplored. Nevertheless, in recent times we have found a striking resilience on the part of those institutions to grapple with the problems with which they were presented by the Government. In many cases those institutions presented to the Government extremely useful propositions and methods for amalgamation. Only a few of those proposed amalgamations have yet to be concluded. I believe that we should be rather reticent about accepting the particular method that the Government used in this case as a model in the future for educational re-organisation. I do not believe that the method that the Government used is a good one or that it should set a precedent for further work in tertiary education institutions in this country, particularly in the area of the CAEs. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned with the possible destruction in future years of the CAE presence in my State. The CAE was initially amalgamated with the James Cook University. I am concerned that the northern areas of such a big State could eventually be left without any effective CAE presence. I do not denigrate in any way the administration of James Cook University but merely point out that universities and CAE have tended to develop, at least in recent years, different attitudes and different projections of their role within the tertiary education community. Hybrid institutions, such as the James Cook University would become, do not necessarily sit very well within our educational structure. A simplification and redefinition of the roles of universities and CAEs would be an extremely useful activity in the future, not in terms of imposition but in terms of co-operation with those institutions. A great deal of change will be necessary in the tertiary education area in the future. These changes could be carried out by the institutions themselves to the advantage rather than to the detriment of tertiary education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Other points in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 to which I wish to direct my attention concern a number of matters that I do not necessarily want to go into now. Indeed, some of the points which are relevant will probably be just as relevant in a subsequent debate quite soon on another set of Bills to be presented in this chamber by which the Government is seeking once again to introduce fees for second and higher degrees. It probably would be as well to leave the discussion of those points until that debate takes place. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I refer to the research centres of excellence. Ther has been a great deal of support for this proposition within tertiary education institutions in Australia. I think this concept is a welcome advance in this area. My major concern relates to the source of funds for research centres of excellence. While it is extremely difficult to say categorically where the funds come from, I think a reasonable case can be made out that the research centres of excellence have been funded from savings made by all tertiary institutions in this country. In other words, all institutions have cut back expenditure in order to obtain a funding arrangement for the research centres of excellence. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government initially raised this idea in its policy speeches I believe that it gained a great deal of support around Australia for the inovation. However, the Government lost rather heavily once it was realised that funding for the research centres of excellence would not be in addition to funding already available to other tertiary institutions. That was unfortunate. The notion of research centres of excellence is particularly attractive for a country such as Australia which has a fairly sparse population in comparison with its geographical spread. The Government must pursue concentration in certain areas. In other words, it must seek to establish staff and capital equipment in particular places around Australia. These various centres then attract students. This is better than trying to spread ourselves rather thinly across the whole of the continent. </PARA>
<PARA> If research centres of excellence are to work an additional step is required. The funding of staff, establishment costs and capital costs have been provided. Although I said earlier that I was critical of where the money came from to provide for those centres, those things have been provided. The missing element is the post-graduate students who provide the base for future operations. Here again we face the crucial problem of the funding of students. Having concentrated our research in certain areas, it is imperative that we provide reasonable funds for post-graduate studies within this country. We must educate our citizens who, at that level, are already products of a very expensive education system. We must not lose one prospective post-graduate student. The funding of those students will ultimately make or break those research centres. It will establish them either as renowned international centres dealing with particular areas or simply centres dealing with particular research studies. To make them centres of excellence we must gather together the best students and the best staff and fund them adequately. Anything less than that will be merely another farcical operation in tertiary education in this country, of which we already have sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said before that the Australian Democrats hold very firmly the notion that educational funding, particularly at this level, is crucial to the economic growth of this country. It is absolutely vital for us to be able to progress well past the year 2000, which after all is only 18 years away; it is not light years away. We must, since we have not done so in the past, grapple with the essential task of setting national goals for our tertiary education institutions . They can be set only by a co-ordinated operation between all governments- Federal and State-within this country so that we can agree on what is needed. We need to fund the institutions and the students to produce the highly educated citizens in this country who will in turn support and be the mainspring for our economy in the year 2000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating two Bills cognately-the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill. Both Bills provide for cost supplementation to educational institutions-the first to schools and the second to universities, colleges of advanced education and technical and further education institutions in the States and the Northern Territory. The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill also provides for changes to the 1982 schedule of grants for universities and colleges in pursuit of the Fraser Government's policy to reduce the number of colleges of advanced education in Australia. In addition, the Bill provides for a transfer of funds set aside under the 1982 legislation for research centres of excellence and community language courses to the Australian National University, which receives funds under separate legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will deal first with the common purpose of these two Bills, that of providing for cost supplementation. Cost supplementation has been pursued until now by both Australian Labor Party and Liberal governments in order to maintain the value of Federal government grants to the States, in terms of supporting schools , and to universities, CAEs and TAFE institutions. This Government has announced that it is abandoning the policy of cost supplementation. These Bills represent the last time that the Government will maintain the value of the grants it promises to schools and to tertiary institutions. The Bills provide for supplementing allocations to schools and tertiary institutions to take account of cost increases which occurred during 1981. The majority of these cost increases were the result of wage and salary increases and were, therefore, unavoidable. These Bills signal the end of the practice of compensating State governments and tertiary institutions for the inescapable additional costs incurred during the previous year. The purpose of cost supplementation is, of course, to maintain the value of the education dollar and to safeguard the standards of education in our schools and tertiary institutions. The abandoning of this system and its replacement by a wholly unsatisfactory procedure is yet another attack on government schools and tertiary institutions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has announced that as from 1982 it will introduce a new system whereby a component representing anticipated price increases will be built into Federal Government grants in respect of schools and tertiary institutions. The measures by which the Government arrives at its anticipated price increases remain somewhat mysterious, the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) having declined to reveal the basis for the calculations. However, we know that under the anticipated price increases formula schools and tertiary institutions are getting less than they would under cost supplementation. The Government's anticipation of price movements as reflected in education grants passed through the Parliament late last year has proved to be an underestimation. I have here a table which illustrates the difference between the actual grants, with their anticipated price increases component, and the level at which those grants would have been had the proper estimate of inflation incorporated in the Budget Papers been used to calculate them. This table was prepared by the Parliamentary Library for my colleague, John Dawkins. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This table indicates that the Government's new policy will result in schools suffering a shortfall of approximately $14.3m and tertiary institutions losing approximately $26.5m in 1982. It is clear that the Fraser Government's aim in introducing the new formula is to further reduce funds to public education. In line with the philistinism for which this Government has become infamous, the Minister for Education has set the scene for further encroachments into tertiary fund and funds for government schools. What such reductions will mean in terms of schools is that children in government schools will face an inevitable reduction in educational resources. These children will miss out on such things as art and craft facilities, sports facilities, library books and school excursions. Innovations such as microcomputers for school use will disappear. The many excellent and dedicated teachers in the government school system will be handicapped and the educational standards of government schools will decline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Government will try to justify reductions in funds for schools by pointing to the slight decline in enrolments in government schools. However, as the Schools Commission pointed out in its latest report, a marginal decline in enrolments does not necessarily create economies and may in some circumstances force up per pupil costs in government schools. If in every government school throughout Australia one child leaves one class in any given year that does not reduce the number of teachers needed or the school facilities needed to service the rest of the children. Any enrolment decline would have to be significant to affect these factors. The Government's argument that the decline in funding for government schools is to take account of falling enrolments is specious. I think we should see the Government's actions for what they are-a further channelling of public money out of the public sector and into the private sector. If the Schools Commission's recommendations for 1983 are adopted there will have been between 1976 and 1983 a 10 per cent reduction in real terms in funds for government schools and a 78 per cent increase in real terms in funds for non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> It is figures such as these which demonstrate the government's hyprocrisy when it cries poor. Government members and senators are very fond of making speeches saying that they would like to be able to spend more on education, social welfare or health but that in view of the current economic stringencies increased spending is not possible. Yet we all know that this Government has not reduced public spending. This is the biggest spending, biggest taxing government in the history of Australia. Yet, wherever possible, it channels the money that it collects away from the public services for which the community pays its taxes and into the private sector for facilities which are available to only some sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Anticipating some of the criticisms that will come from Government senators, I must restate that the Labor Party does not oppose Federal support for non- government schools; that is, we support funding of non-government schools on a needs basis. This was the policy which the Labor Government implemented in office. This is the policy which we will implement under the Hayden Government. However, at the same time as acknowledging the continuation of needs-based funding for the private school sector we must make clear that we will not tolerate concurrent deterioration of the public education system in which 75 per cent of Australia's school-aged children are enrolled. It is very clear that the abandonment of cost supplementation, which is provided for in these Bills, will contribute to such a deterioration in the public education system. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation for tertiary institutions is no less serious. Earlier this year the Academic Salaries Tribunal recommended modest salary increases for academics in universities and CAEs. The cost of providing for these salary increases in 1982 is $75m. With the abandoning of cost supplementation, universities and CAEs know that they will not be reimbursed for that $75m at the end of 1982 and are faced with the dilemma of where to find the money to pay these salary increases.</PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) who represents the Minister for Education whether this $75m provided for in the anticipatory cost increases component is supposedly included in the 1982 grants to universities and CAEs. If this $75m was not adequately provided for it is estimated that something like 300 jobs in universities and CAEs would have to be abolished to save this amount. Such large scale sackings of staff would result in severe reductions in the quality and availability of tertiary education in Australia. I ask the Minister to give the Senate, during the course of this debate, an assurance that the Government will not allow such a situation to arise, that it will not leave universities and CAEs short of necessary funds. This scenario of universities and CAEs being forced to come begging to the Government for additional funds to cover cost increases which could not be anticipated is indicative of the effects that the abandoning of cost supplementation will have. </PARA>
<PARA> The second substantive matter dealt with in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill is that of structural and funding changes consequent on the Government's forced amalgamation of 30 colleges of advanced education. I reiterate the Labor Party's opposition to the manner in which these amalgamations have been carried out. These amalgamations were ordered as a result of the razor gang's report and not as a result of any serious study as to the best use of educational resources in this country. The arbitrary figure of 30 colleges was apparently arrived at simply in pursuit of the Government's obsession with cutting costs and reducing the public sector. While it is doubtful whether the amalgamations will in fact save very much money , it is not doubtful-it is certain-that the quality and availability of education at the institutions involved are suffering. These amalgamations have been carried out without any educational objectives in mind and they have taken place to the detriment of students and staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than a rationalisation of single purpose institutions over a three-year period as suggested by the Tertiary Education Commission, the Government has achieved the elimination of 30 separate institutions over one year, at a cost of great disruption and dislocation to all institutions involved. The number of CAEs in Australia has been reduced from 69 to 45 during this period. However, the Government is not yet satisfied. Even though its target of abolishing 30 separate institutions has been reached, including six institutions which were not on the Government's original list of 30, the Government still insists that six more colleges amalgamate. These six institutions were on the Government's original list. However, they have been unable so far to make satisfactory arrangements for amalgamation. In this legislation the Government insists that these six colleges go ahead with amalgamation and it makes grants to them conditional upon their active pursuit during 1982 of what the Government has chosen to call consolidation. These institutions are: In New South Wales, the Milperra College of Advanced Education, the Armidale CAE and the Newcastle CAE: and, in Victoria, the State College of Victoria at Hawthorn, the Institute of Early Childhood Development and the SCV at Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> All these institutions face very serious problems in achieving amalgamation and there are very strong arguments for retaining them as separate institutions. I do not have time to go over those arguments this evening; however, I am sure that all honourable senators have received information and documentation from the institutions concerned. It appears that the Government intends to ignore the arguments for retaining independence of these institutions, to ignore the damage to education which it is causing and now to eliminate not 30 but 36 of Australia 's colleges of advanced education. I wish to comment briefly on the effect these amalgamations are having on the educational prospects of Australian women. Amalgamations and closures of higher education institutions have occurred principally among those institutions specialising in teacher education. As honourable senators will be aware, women form a majority of the students and a large proportion of the staff in teacher education. Cutbacks in this area have had a disproportionate effect on women as have the majority of the Government's attacks on the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very clear that this Government is not committed to public education, that is, education to which all members of the public have access. It appears to be intent on crippling the public sector and reducing the number of CAEs in order to reduce its commitment to public sector education. While the Labor Party condemns the Government's forced amalgamations of CAEs the major purpose of the Bills currently before the Senate is to provide, as I have pointed out for the last time, for cost supplementation to schools and tertiary institutions. To the extent that the Bills provide cost supplementation they have the support of the Federal Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Twice a year the Senate and the other place debate Bills to provide financial assistance through the States to schools and institutions of higher education. At this time of the year we look at the supplementation of the amounts that were made available and announced in the Budget context. In this event the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 and the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1982 provide supplementation of $53.7m with respect to tertiary education institutions and $3.7m with respect to schools. As the total amount that the Commonwealth Government is making available to schools this year is over $1,000m, $3.7m is a drop in the bucket in the supplementation arrangements. It is a technical increase to make up for the impact of inflation. With regard to higher education institutions, the Commonwealth makes available nearly $2 billion, and this $53.7m is again somewhat of a drop in the bucket although, of course, set out in the Schedule to the tertiary education Bill are particulars of two very good initiatives that have already been referred to-that is, the centres of excellence program of research in universities and community language courses to be developed in higher education institutions, such as the teaching of modern Greek at a superior level at the Monash University in conjunction with the other two universities in Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The debate in the Senate tonight is following traditional, well worn routes of talking about the mechanism of supplementation and, by inference, about the adequacy or inadequacy of the total financial provision. Senator Ryan's speech was a direct echo of Mr Dawkins's speech in the House of Representatives some days ago. Senator Macklin's speech was a direct echo of his own thoughts expressed six months ago in the Senate. My speech so far is somewhat of a rewrite of what I said 12 or 18 months ago. In considering the Bills before us I wish to get away from the minutiae of the financial technicalities that are virtually a matter of procedure at this time of the year. I wish briefly to begin to ask some larger questions about education in Australia. As to the matters that have already been raised in debates such as this-and for those who are interested and who may wish to look them up in the future-I refer to my own speeches of 13 May last year responding to the Review of Commonwealth Functions decisions on education, of 28 October last year, with regard to the secondary and tertiary education Bills and of 11 March this year on the question of cost supplementation becoming prospective supplementation. All of these matters have been covered previously and I do not think the debate so far has provided any degree of enlightenment on the matter to the Senate or to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that honourable senators should encourage one another to start a fresh debate in Australia about where education is going at the secondary and tertiary levels. The two levels are intertwined. We talk about equality of opportunity and the questions asked by parents and their children. Are the schools serving them for adulthood, employment and all the multi-purposes of an education experience? Parents are asking: Are our children really being served? In the universities we are seeing a traditional set of courses and research in excellence continuing. But the questions are still being asked. How can university and college education, provided to only a small minority in Australia , be extended to bring employment benefits to those of other professions, trades and careers?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that in our debates about the minutiae of financial processes we have brought ourselves to these wider questions. Have we addressed ourselves to the retention rates in secondary schools? Throughout the century there has been a gradual increase, and after the second World War a much increased rise, in the proportion of 15, 16 and 17-year olds staying on in schools. But does the public know that in the last few years those retention rates have fallen away, particularly amongst male secondary students? They have actually dropped. Has the road of progress to enlightenment in secondary education turned the corner? Are we heading back to a lower state of achievement? The recent decline in the retention of students at the middle teenage level in our schools is partly a reflection upon the too high level of youth unemployment in Australia, as in most developed technological societies. It is also a reflection upon a dissatisfaction by those children and their parents with the education system as it is. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of us in the Senate have tried to touch upon the inadequacies in the secondary system. We have talked about the 20 to 25 per cent-usually the lowest achievers-in the schools who lose motivation and self-confidence, who are turned off by school and who are bored with a curriculum that, for the most part, is geared for academic entry to universities and colleges. When will we arrive at the day when there is a real unison in the question: When will we start to serve those children? That question is being asked not only in the Senate but also by the public. When will we start to re-order the curriculum in our schools so that we are not just year after year lamely accepting the curriculum that is geared to university entry? This question remains very much in the minds and on the lips of the public in Australia-in the countryside, in the cities, in government schools and, to some extent, also in non-government schools. I believe that the resources that have been made available to an increasing extent during the 70s must be applied to meet the real needs of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter is now beyond debate. The Budget Papers and all the appendices to the reports of the Commonwealth Schools Commission and the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission show an increasing monetary amount spent year by year by government on all sectors of education in Australia. Noticeably, very increased amounts have been spent in the area of technical and further education-that is, in trade training in the technical and further education colleges around Australia. Also there have been real increases in the total amount of money available from government in the secondary and primary schools area and in higher education. Some Opposition spokesmen will debate, as we have heard tonight from Senator Macklin, that the excellent initiatives that have been taken in the centres of excellence program have, by various readings of the figures, taken away from the amount that is available for the ongoing basic programs in universities. I am not convinced by those arguments, but it is undeniable that the total amount available from governments to universities, colleges, technical and further education and secondary and primary education has continued to increase in real terms. In the early 70s there was almost a doubling in the resources made available to education. </PARA>
<PARA> That doubling in resources met the question of the day, when there was a quite fervent education debate in the Australian community. But what has happened to that education debate? It has fizzled and there is desperation and frustration amongst the parents and children of Australia. The debates that too often occur in the Senate are in a technical language. They are point scoring debates about classifications of money that are lost on ordinary students and families. They have become the preserve of teachers unions, university staff unions, college unions and, to some extent, the political machinations of various institutions governing councils and their representatives, such as some vice chancellors and principals. The debate has been too often pitched at point scoring to see what amount in the proportion of votes can be gained for one party or another, to see how we can con the professionals amongst the teachers in the schools and the academics in higher education to see that we are identifying with them. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the debate in recent years has been lowered to an appeal to those professional people. I do not believe that we have with us any more, in the questions that are asked in these debates, the people whom we fundamentally are seeking to serve. I wonder when honourable senators will receive views, letters and petitions from other than professional teaching unions or academic unions. When will we receive any point of views from the ordinary public? People see, year by year, an increasing financial allocation by governments. They see more and more equipment in schools. They see teacher-student ratios becoming more favourable and then they see a plateau in the funding. It is still being maintained at a high level, yet they are still confused about where it is going and whether their children are really being served. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to what I believe are two broad but fundamental questions that have been left aside by the past debates about the minutiae of financial procedures. Are the children of Australia being served by the schools? How can the benefits of a university education be made available equally to other trades, professions and careers within Australia? What have we to learn from comparisons with Japan and the United States in terms of the higher proportion of 17, 18 and 19-year olds continuing with full time formal training? Those countries are much more directly geared to employment prospects and to the real needs in adulthood of their Japanese or American students. What have we to learn in Australia from the example in Canberra of a retention rate double that generally the case in other parts of Australia? Is that only a reflection upon the more affluent families that live in the capital city? Is it a reflection upon the largely professional families that live in Canberra and give the traditional motivation to their children to go on with higher education?</PARA>
<PARA> Are there other factors? How can we be sure that the opportunities for making available education opportunities of direct benefit to the young people of Australia are being fully taken up? One is still left, often, with the view that there is a remaining inertia in the curriculum systems at almost all levels of education in Australia. I do not wish, with too broad a sweep, to disparage the people in all the State systems, in the independent schools, in universities who are, in a professional way, seeking reform in the directions that I am indicating. But I think we should much more humbly and much more carefully try to be accountable to the ordinary people of Australia, and bring to these debates the questions that the ordinary people are asking and not just consider the views of the academic and education professionals or the newsletters of the teaching unions. We should consider the real concerns of the ordinary families and young people of Australia. I hope that opportunities such as the debate of these Bills will, in future, lead us to more substance in education considerations by the Senate. I support the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Senate has decided to support these measures which Senator Teague has described as supplementary measures for education which have been introduced in this period of the year. One matter that I want to comment on was raised by Senator Ryan and relates to cost supplementation. It was stated in the debate and it is, of course, well known that there has been a change in the method of cost supplementation in the current year, 1982, compared with the past. Senator Ryan raised the question: If the amount for prospective cost supplementation has already been provided for 1982 how will institutions, both tertiary and secondary, manage to cope with some substantial increases in salaries which have occurred, particularly at the tertiary level as a result of the Academic Salaries Tribunal's report?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, the Government has provided prospectively, in the funds provided for the current year, for cost supplementation. However, it is aware of and concerned about the very substantial increases that have occurred in the areas that I have mentioned. As a result, the Government will be reviewing the level of allowances for cost increases which have already been made for the current year for both the Schools Commission and the Tertiary Education Commission. These allowances are made up of a number of components, including provision for the national wage cases. The Government will review that situation when the result of the present national wage case is known. I hope the Bills have a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to clarify a matter which arose in Question Time earlier today when, at the end of a series of questions concerning the Falkland Islands crisis, I asked a question which drew the response from Senator Sir John Carrick that I was making untimely and severely critical remarks concerning the participation of the United Kingdom armed forces in the naval battles and aerial bombardments that have occurred on and around those islands in the last few days. I rose in response to a specific point made by Senator Sir John Carrick in response to Senator Chipp in the course of which Senator Sir John Carrick said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Aggression cannot be allowed to go unhindered. </PARA>
<PARA>I rose also in response to the general tenor of the remarks by Senator Sir John Carrick and other Government spokesmen, which was to concentrate, as I saw it, on Argentina's failure to comply with the United Nations resolution passed, I think, on 2 May this year. No doubt the military junta in Argentina did engage in unjust aggression against the Falkland Islands and manifestly against the will of the inhabitants of those islands. To that extent I think all honourable senators agree with that part of the United Nations Security Council resolution which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Determining that there exists a breach of the peace in the region of the Falkland Islands,</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>2. Demands an immediate withdrawal of all Argentine forces from the Falkland Islands. </PARA>
<PARA> The mere fact that the Falkland Islands are only some four times the size of the Australian Capital Territory and are inhabited by only some 1,800 people is no reason not to be deeply concerned about the prospects of those islanders under one of the most repressive, dictatorial military juntas presently wreaking its will on the people over whom it has control. However, having said that, I believe-and I believed at Question Time-that it is incumbent upon the Australian Government to be even-handed. I think one need go no further than the United Nations Security Council's resolution to understand one of the bases of my question. The demand for an immediate withdrawal of all Argentine forces from the Falkland Islands was only one of three demands made by the Security Council in that resolution. The others included the demand that there be an immediate cessation of hostilities. The pertinent one is that the United Nations:</PARA>
<PARA> Calls on the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to seek a diplomatic solution to their differences and to respect fully the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that call for the seeking of a diplomatic solution is a call of equal weight to the demand that the Argentine forces withdraw from the Falkland Islands. I believe that call for a seeking of a diplomatic solution is crucial to an outcome which would minimise the loss of life. After all, that is the purpose of the Charter of the United Nations, regardless of whether one looks at Article 51 or Article 53. But my question went somewhat further and was triggered, as I have said, by Senator Sir John Carrick's response to Senator Chipp which was:</PARA>
<PARA> Aggression cannot be allowed to go unhindered. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that aggression ought not to go unhindered, but I was trying to raise the question of whether there are any moral restraints on governments in resisting unjust aggression. Are there any moral restraints or does unjust aggression permit unbridled waging of war against the unjust aggressor? Really it is an argument about ends and means. It may well be conceded that, as Senator Sir John Carrick said, the end or goal in view is a peaceful society of free men and women. But my argument, and the argument of the tradition that I was calling on, is that the end does not justify every means and that the means must be in moral harmony with the end that is sought, namely, peaceful relationships between human beings. </PARA>
<PARA> I felt that Senator Sir John Carrick did not grasp what I was getting at when I spoke of the just war doctrine and its requirement that response to unjust oppression should be in proportion to the injury being suffered and should be undertaken as a last resort. In saying these things I do not want in any way to indicate any thought on my part that Senator Sir John Carrick is not absolutely sensitive to the needs for moral restraint in the actions of combatants one to another. I would imagine that his distinguished war service and the suffering he was forced to endure during the Second World War would not lead anyone to any conclusion of indifference on his part to the need for moral restraint in the waging of war. However, the just war doctrine does have a long lineage in Western civilisation. I went to the Parliamentary Library and found, for example , that in the Times editorial of 24 April, entitled 'The War Within', there is talk about the general nature of war and its place in Christians' thinking. It states that there are two respectable traditions, one of total pacifism and the other based on the doctrine of the just war, which perhaps could be more properly described as the justifiable war. Amongst other things it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Just war can only be just if it is caused by injustice-aggression; if its aims are the restoration of justice . . . and if its conduct is conditioned by the doctrine of minimum force. </PARA>
<PARA>When one considers what might be involved in the doctrine of minimum force, on turning to the New Catholic Encyclopedia, volume XIV one finds under the heading the 'Morality of War' that, indeed, the principles of the last resort and the principle of proportion are set out. To be morally justifiable war must be the last resort. Every other reasonable means must have been exhausted. On the principle of proportion, it is made very clear that a balance has to be sought between the devastation and the destruction of life caused in the resistance to unjust aggression and the suffering of that unjust agression. If the resistance is grossly out of proportion in the damage it wreaks to the suffering of the injustice, then indeed the injustice must be suffered. One need go no further than the Age of today's date to see that the front page column written by that newspaper's Argentina correspondent, Peter Cole Adams, starts by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it can fairly be called overkill. </PARA>
<PARA>Some paragraphs later he goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> But when all that is said--</PARA>
<PARA>The 'that' refers to the unjust occupation of the Islands by the military junta-</PARA>
<PARA>Britain's response seems-at least from this admittedly peculiar vantage point- grossly out of proportion to the original offence. </PARA>
<PARA>I listened to PM this evening and to Mr Denis Healey, a former Minister for Defence in the British Government, a man therefore prepared to wage a just war if need be. He would have been in command of the military forces of the United Kingdom in themselves and as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation should it have been necessary to unleash them to resist unjust aggression, perhaps by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Europe. In other words, he is a man who is certainly not a total pacifist. He said tonight on PM-I have not been able to get a transcript from the Library but I do not think I will do him an injustice-that in his view the point was being reached in the Falkland Islands crisis where the loss of life was out of proportion to the injury which had been done to the interests both of the United Kingdom and of the Falkland Islanders themselves. As I have said, a quick walk to the Library revealed those three or four sources which indicate and validate the basis of my question which raised the just war criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> The just war criteria, which, as I have said, have a lineage reaching back to St Augustine, outlaws certain responses to unjust aggression. For example, one obviously cannot destroy civilian centres of population. That raises a huge question-mark on the nuclear strategic doctrine of the super-powers but it modifies other responses. The doctrine of proportionality lays down that the violence and destruction of lives involved in remedying an unjust situation has to be in some proportion to what has been done. When one looks at the Falkland Islands situation one sees that the occupation of these islands amounted to a denial of the United Kingdom's sovereignty over them, but there is no evidence of slaughter of the civilian inhabitants. There is no evidence that the captured marines were subject to unjust treatment. In fact they were flown to a third country and then back home. One needs to ask whether, in carrying out naval engagements involving the loss of perhaps hundreds of lives and in carrying out an aerial bombardment of Port Stanley-we do not know the measurement of the loss of life of that bombardment at the moment-the loss of life involved in that response by the United Kingdom bears a proportionate relationship to the injuries suffered to the interests of the United Kingdom in reasserting its sovereignty over those islands or indeed any relationship to the injuries suffered by the inhabitants. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the criterion of last resort. The taking of human life is such a tragic event in the history of nations that obviously it ought to be the very last step taken by a government. It has often been said in this chamber that it is wrong for a member of a union to withdraw his labour other than after having exhausted all possible avenues of negotiation and arbitration. That principle is even more applicable in the case in which there is the possibility that human lives will be lost. In sending this fleet into those icy and storm-tossed waters of the South Atlantic the British Government foreshortened the negotiating process. Once there, the fleet had to undertake the task of dislodging the invaders and/or render itself vulnerable to a first attack by the Argentine armed forces. Obviously it would respond in self-defence. In other words, the very arrival or presence of the fleet in those waters around the Falklands, in my view, signalled the end of the negotiating process. It seems to me that some more weeks at least ought to have been allowed to the negotiating process to enable a diplomatic solution, in accordance with the United Nations Security Council resolution, to be achieved, as indeed it will have to be in the next few days. Otherwise, as Denis Healey said on the PM program this evening, more lives will be lost than in fact are at stake on the island; if indeed any lives on the island are at stake. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, to raise this matter is not to engage in subjective judgments-at least not entirely. The whole point of the just war doctrine is to introduce into the political process or the military conduct of war operations objective moral criteria of proportionality and last resort. Those criteria are objective in the sense that they are criteria from outside the political and military processes and stand in judgment against them. It is true that conclusions as to whether the facts cohere with adherence to those criteria is a matter of personal judgment. A personal judgment, of course, has to be undertaken, if it is to have integrity, with proper regard to whatever evidence is available. But that is not the same as engaging in purely subjective assessments which are no more than the expression of a personal whim or predisposition. If that were the case the just war theory would fail in its purpose which is to encourage sensible discussion among reasonable people as to the limits restraining the armed resistance to unjust aggression. That was the purpose of my question. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this further clarification may aid the process of discussion of the sensible moral limits to which the United Kingdom is entitled to go in seeking to repair the wrong done to the international community. It has, as I think Senator Sir John Carrick said in certain of his responses, far more implications than this isolated incident. An injury has been done, as the United Nations Security Council has recognised, to the international community's interest in the peaceful resolution of disputes as to sovereignty. But the question is: How far should the United Kingdom armed forces have gone and how soon should they have acted in trying to remedy the wrong that has been done? As I said, I was seeking to clarify my question. I reiterate, because of my respect for Senator Sir John Carrick's service in the armed forces of this country, that I want nothing which I said to carry any suggestion that in asking my question or making my remarks tonight I do not recognise that Senator Sir John Carrick has a very keen awareness of the need for moral restraints in the waging of warfare, particularly given the horrendous weapons of the modern age. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer briefly to what is now becoming a hardy weekly subject of debate; the damage caused to many Australian Vietnam veterans by agent orange and similar herbicides used in the Vietnam conflict. I am rather sad that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), who was advised earlier tonight that I would make a speech on this aspect, apparently is not interested enough even to bother to be in the chamber. I feel sorry for the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick), who will have to carry the brunt on his broad shoulders. It appears that the Minister is not totally aware of what is happening in this field. Whilst Mr Killen is getting a lot of the flak for the big reduction in the defence vote, it is not really his fault, I am sure. It is more likely to be the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who said these things had to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to refer to something the Minister said in this chamber today at Question Time when answering a Dorothy Dix question designed to discredit a recent newspaper article which obviously caused him some discomfort. My view, and the view of other senators on this side of the chamber, is that he did not quite succeed. I should think that most people in this chamber are aware of recent Press speculation that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is in serious trouble in regard to a reshuffle of the Ministry. That is not a matter for us to comment on because those events will spell themselves out when the long forecast reshuffle of the Ministry takes place. I refer to a statement the Minister made on 15 February 1982 at the official opening of the Vietnam veterans counselling centre at Parramatta. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There have been calls by veterans for a judicial inquiry . . .</PARA>
<PARA>All of us on this side of the chamber have called for the same sort of judicial inquiry. Instead, an epidemiological inquiry was set up and subsequently discarded by this Government. The Minister went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> There have been calls by veterans for a judicial inquiry and I have said often that the best advice available to me is that such an inquiry would fall down for want of scientific answers. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government welcomes the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. </PARA>
<PARA>On 16 February this year, when answering a question from Senator Mason of the Australian Democrats, the Minister was apparently quite unaware of very important evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment about two weeks before that date. On 8 July 1981 the Minister issued a Press statement on his return from the United States. That statement reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Many American veterans seemed to be suffering delayed symptoms, attributed to service in a war which had divided the nation. All those persons he had spoken to-from Chairmen of Congressional Committees to Vietnam Veterans representatives -agreed that Agent Orange was not a key factor. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not true. On 9 July 1981, the following day, speaking on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program AM, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is no credible evidence at this stage of the game</PARA>
<PARA>Good Australian slang-</PARA>
<PARA>that indicates that there is any connection between Agent Orange and any disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> In fact in talking to Congressional leaders of both parties, talking to Vietnam Veterans, Bobby Muller for instance from the Vietnam Veterans of America, all those people said to me that this wasn't the issue. This was not the key factor. The key factor was the war experience. </PARA>
<PARA>Today further evidence has come to light to indicate that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs does not even know about this. I apologise to the Minister as he has now appeared in the chamber. I will quote from a telex of today's date which carried a story written by Laurie Oakes who is one of the better known political journalists around the gallery. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> A large pile of recently discovered documents on Australia's Vietnam war involvement could shed light on the issue of chemical spraying, according to a news report today. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents, some of which were classified, were mistakenly sent to the Annex of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, the report said. </PARA>
<PARA> Political journalist Laurie Oakes, speaking on TV ( . . . Channel 10s Good Morning Australia), said the previously unexamined documents could embarrass the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, can I wait until the Ministers have finished their conversation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Political journalist Laurie Oakes, speaking on the television program I referred to, stated that the document:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . may show if senior Government Ministers, including Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, knew of the dangers of chemical spraying and the involvement of Australian personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> He said about two dozen defence officials had been examining the records since they were discovered. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been quizzed by the Opposition for several years over chemical spraying in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence Minister Jim Killen and Veterans' Affairs Minister Tony Messner have provided answers based on the belief that all Vietnam war records had been examined. </PARA>
<PARA> But answers to parliamentary questions may have to be amended based on information in the latest documents. </PARA>
<PARA>That will apply to some of the questions that I have asked. The telex continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Issues such as whether Mr Fraser, when he was Army Minister and later Defence Minister, was briefed on chemical spraying in Vietnam, and whether he permitted Australian involvement, could be resolved by the documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Oakes, quoting a senior department source, said it was likely the newly discovered documents include some details of briefing Mr Fraser got during visits to Vietnam as Army Minister in the late 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite a spectacular discovery. I believe that it is the responsibility of this Government and the Minister in particular to give a full statement and also, if necessary, for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to make a public statement as to his involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Associated Press report quite clearly says that Mr Bobby Muller, the same person the Minister quoted last July, told two Australian Vietnam veterans to 'tell Senator Messner to quote him correctly in future'. On 20 August 1981 I asked the Minister a question about his trip to the United States of America and the fact that he had not contacted the Vietnam Veterans in Congress Organisation. I further asked him at that time whether the letter I quoted destroyed the credibility of the statements he made. It is unfortunate the Minister did not answer that part of my question. </PARA>

I invite him before he goes to bed tonight to read the Hansard report of his own speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Parliament and the people of Australia are getting rather testy about the whole 'Spraygate' cover-up and the reasons for it. The present Prime Minister- honourable senators will be aware of this-was involved in decisions about the use of toxic chemicals in Vietnam. I invited the Prime Minister, because of his previous ministerial roles, to make a clear and frank statement to the Vietnam veterans who are suffering and for whom this Government cares nothing. Honourable senators will be aware that quite recently I sent a number of cases to the Minister's Department hoping that some finality could be reached on them. We continued to use those toxic chemicals in Vietnam long after the United States forces had stopped using them because they realised the dangers. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that with the release of these further documents, even if they have gone to the wrong place and are now being examined by 20-odd public servants who are trying to sift through them, perhaps at this point in history the Minister will help the ministerial reshuffle if he quietly resigns tonight and says: ' Well, I have failed.' There has been an obvious cover-up which my party has spent many months trying to point out to the Minister, the Prime Minister and to other Ministers of the Government. I clearly say that the 'Spraygate' cover-up is coming apart at the seams. This matter has reached a stage where, if the Prime Minister is involved, Government members should start to stand up for themselves and be counted. He is an ailing and failing Prime Minister who has fallen down not only on this job but also on everything he puts his finger to. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister is incapable of handling this hot potato, perhaps over bacon and eggs tomorrow morning or over coffee and crumpets tonight he will suggest to the Prime Minister that he be given a portfolio that is less dangerous for himself and his Government and of more benefit to the Vietnam veterans who are paying in many degrees-mentally, physically and every other way-for a war to which this Government forced them to go. It would not worry me if the Minister had a George Cross for his service in Vietnam or if the Prime Minister had a Victoria Cross for his service in Vietnam. Neither one of them has any intimate knowledge of what happened in those countries. Neither of them has any war service at all and is, therefore, able to have any feeling for veterans who have suffered these things. </PARA>
<PARA> It was this Government in all instances that decided that we should get involved in an undeclared war. If it had not been for the Labor Government of late 1972 to 1975, very few of those Vietnam veterans would have got any of the concessions to which all normal returned service people are entitled, most of which have now been withdrawn. My colleague, Senator Tate, talked about the involvement in the Falkland Islands. The Government has now sent people to the Sinai. If we still belonged to the old British Empire five minutes after the beloved Prime Minister of Britain had declared war on the Falklands the Government would have been doing the same thing and we would have been involved in that situation too. The Government is letting the British use the Invincible which will not be able to carry aeroplanes when it comes to this country but is able to carry aeroplanes now. No doubt if the situation continues it will end up with the Government involving us all directly or indirectly. Perhaps it will be able to get the Invincible back as a secondhand aircraft carrier, although it cannot be called an aircraft carrier because we have no aeroplanes to put on it. There is the story that Malcolm Fraser is setting up a model aeroplane club and these will be flown off the ship's deck. Those are facetious asides. I hope the Minister will take note of what has been said tonight instead of exposing his giggling countenance to the chamber. He obviously thinks that the whole Vietnam involvement was a joke. He thinks it is an even funnier joke that people are suffering as a result of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to respond to Senator Tate's contribution tonight. I regret that I was not here for the earlier moment. I was not aware that the adjournment debate would commence a minute or two early. I am indebted to Senator Tate for his clarification. He expressed some concern earlier in the day . I have re-read the question and the answer. I want to assure him that at the time I accepted his question as a question put forward in good faith. My answer was meant to be an answer in good faith. One of the defects is that there may have been some misunderstanding on this matter. He will notice this when he looks at his own question. There is an inability at Question Time for honourable senators to expand on what they mean. The concentration on the British actions led to what I regard as a just response. I do not say this in any vexatious way, but I remind him that the substance of his question was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Will the Government, in formulating its policy concerning the Falkland Islands crisis, not only take into account that part of the United Nations Security Council resolution calling on Argentina to withdraw its armed forces, but also give regard to and convey to the British Government the view that, firstly, the type of armed conflict being pursued by the United Kingdom with the destruction of human lives involved is out of all proportion to the injury to its sovereign interests said to be at stake and thus offends that aspect of the just war doctrine, and secondly, that such armed conflict was premature in that the steaming time for the war fleet set the time limits for a negotiated settlement rather than allowing the full exhaustion of non-violent means of resolving the conflict? Will the Government convey the view that the British Government has failed to justify the use of armed force . . . </PARA>
<PARA>At Question Time I responded, not in any offensive way, that I regarded that as a subjective value judgment. Let me say at the same time, without attempting in any way to be ingratiating, that I accept as a valuable addition to the debate Senator Tate's dialogue concerning the concept of a just war and the conduct of people seeking peace. I accept that; I think it is a valuable addition to the debate. Senator Tate made several points which suggested that Britain had over- reacted. First of all, he said that Britain's reaction was judged by steaming time and not by the length of negotiations. I put to the Senate and to Senator Tate that it was important that time should not be allowed for the aggressor to build up such a huge force of a defensive military nature that, if some reassertion of sovereignty were necessary, the scale of any such reassertion would lead to a conflict of greater magnitude than was necessary. In fairness, I suggest that the idea of a blockade being imposed as quickly as possible to stop the building up of a very large military force ought to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly-here lies the great tragedy of the situation-the history of the United Nations, of which I am an eager supporter, is that it has shown itself to be virtually impotent to make decisions on such matters of sovereignty and to enforce those decisions. The history of the whole post-war period is that many nations now living in bondage previously had their sovereignty and seek sovereignty today. Senator Tate would know as well as anyone that the veto in the Security Council is the absolute destroyer of decision making of any real kind. The tragedy, therefore, is that nations find themselves either giving in to aggression, as the whole 30-year post-war period has indicated, or finding it necessary to take some action. </PARA>
<PARA> My response today was purely along the lines that I think it is a subjective judgment as to whether Britain acted faster than she need have done and whether more time could have been allowed. Equally, Senator Tate could say that my argument that a blockade was needed quickly to stop the building up of arms was a subjective judgment. Basically that is the only point of the dialogue. Since his question asked whether the Government would convey those views to the British Government, clearly my response was that they were views which needed to be tested, judged and evaluated. I think Senator Tate would agree with that. I think it would be a good thing if the kind of contribution that he made tonight could be developed in this forum because I think it added to this place. The principles of peacekeeping in this world ought to be debated and understood. Unfortunately I have to say that their ability to be used in this situation is very limited. I think we will need a longer telescope of history to decide the finer points of the justice of this situation. I hope, therefore, that none of us would sit in extreme value judgments. I do not say that Senator Tate has done so. The purpose of my contribution tonight has been to explain that. I thank him for his contribution tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate not to keep the Senate for any great length of time but to deal with the matters raised by Senator Keeffe in a most confused argument which covered a multitude of circumstances but which requires very little time to answer. First and foremost, I will refer to his reference to my visit to the United States of America last year. He raised the canard that I had not consulted any groups other than those representative of government. Some time after the question was asked in this place by Senator Keeffe on this point, I sought to provide a copy of the itinerary of my visit to the United States and the people I saw at that time. In brief, they covered congressional leaders from both parties within the United States, those veterans who operate counselling centres not only within the government organisation but also within organisations such as the Disabled Veterans of America and other groups in that country, and various health centres throughout the United States which are conducting studies on the health of Vietnam veterans, including the United States Air Force base at San Antonio in Texas, the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, and a number of other centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite apart from that, the point which Senator Keeffe centred on in his question in August last year was whether I had dealt with a group known as Vietnam Veterans in Congress. That followed a letter which I received from that group drawing attention to the fact that I had not consulted it during my trip to the United States. How that letter came to be in the hands of Senator Keeffe is a matter for pure conjecture, but on page 324 of Senate Hansard for 26 August 1981 I incorporated a copy of a letter which I sent to that group. Unfortunately Senator Keeffe was not in the Senate that day; he was away on a family commitment. I will read that letter again for Senator Keeffe's benefit so that he may appreciate the problem. The letter is addressed to one Mr T. Daschle, Chairman of the Vietnam Veterans in Congress, 439 Cannon Building, Washington, D .C. 20515. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Daschle,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter of 31 July 1981, signed jointly with Mr Panetta, concerning my visit to the United States earlier this year. It was unfortunate that we were unable to consult during the visit. My time in Washington was extremely limited, and some of the meetings with Government officials and veterans' organisations had to be fitted in during visits to other cities, as I needed to include in my schedule an examination of important research projects and practical programmes being conducted outside Washington to help veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time available during my visit to Congress offices, I was able to have discussions with members of the Veterans' Affairs Committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpose to make the point that those committees are made up of people from both sides of the political fence in that country. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> In requesting these meetings, the Australian Embassy made it clear to the staff directors of the two Committees that I would be pleased to meet any other Committee members who were in the position to join the meetings with the Chairmen. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who did attend the meetings were the Chairman of the Senate Committee and the Chairman and the ranking minority member of the House of Representatives Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Ambassador endeavoured also to arrange for me to meet representatives of the Vietnam Veterans in Congress by inviting Mr Bonior and you--</PARA>
<PARA>That is Mr Daschle-</PARA>
<PARA>to join us at an evening function on 18 June. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one point on which I would like there to be no misunderstanding. While the Australian Government gives no undertaking to base decisions on the opinions of any particular body, it does endeavour to consider the widest possible range of views relevant to veterans' issues in determining its policies. In this context, I would be happy to examine any submission you care to make which you feel would be of value. The Government is glad to have available information relevant to this aspect of its policy-making, the aim of which is to contribute, within the Government's economic possibilities, to the well-being of Australian veterans. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>I make the further point that there was no letter of reply from that group, nor after some 10 months have I received any information or any submission along the lines invited at that time. I have formed views in my continuing connections with veterans' organisations and the veterans' administration in the United States of America on these points. I come now to some of the more particular matters that are contemporaneous with some of today's news reports.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a big word for me. There was a reference today in one Australian Associated Press report concerning, I understand, a television broadcast by Laurie Oakes and certain revelations of information that has not come to the fore at the Australian War Memorial. Over four or five weeks a study of Vietnam files provided by the Army has been undertaken at the War Memorial. That follows the original statement, made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) at the time that this matter came to everybody's attention following some further so-called revelations of the use of agent blue in Vietnam, that there would be a further investigation of these matters. That investigation has been proceeding. An officer of my Department is involved in the investigation in which defence officials have been undertaking the major part of the work. There is no attempt by the Government to cover, as Senator Keeffe has suggested. We are endeavouring to investigate the matter further and to come to the right conclusions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular interest of my Department follows the consistent line which I have followed since I became Minister for Veterans' Affairs; that is, to establish first and foremost to what degree Australian soldiers were exposed to herbicides in Vietnam. It is hoped that a continuing examination of files and information that becomes available to us will be helpful in finally forming a view on that point. That investigation is in progress and there is no difficulty about the Government facing up to its responsibilities in that regard. We are endeavouring, as we have been since 1980, to uncover all information, scientific or otherwise, in this area and make it available generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Another news report that surfaced today emanated from New York. It also is an AAP report concerning statements by two Australian Vietnam veterans who are currently in the United States undertaking their own examination of the problem. They claim that they have had discussions with one Bobby Muller, who is known to me as the National President of the Vietnam Veterans of America. However, Mr Muller's words were not quoted in the report that has been drawn to my attention but rather the words of one Mr McCarthy, who claims to be the President of an organisation known as Agent Orange Victims International. Not having been present at any meeting between the two Australian veterans and Mr Muller, he talks of certain words which have been reported to him by the Australian Vietnam Veterans Association to the effect that I somehow misquoted a conversation which I had with Mr Muller in New York in June, in claiming that Mr Muller had said that there was no connection between agent orange and the disability from which Vietnam veterans were suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not Mr Muller who has been misquoted. I have been misquoted. I never said that. In fact, the latter part of the AAP report which I have seen makes that very point. Upon my return to Australia I said that I had had discussions with Mr Muller and that he had indicated to me that agent orange was not necessarily the key factor in the illnesses of Vietnam veterans. He said that the question of war neuroses and war experience was likely to be a very large and important factor in the welfare of Vietnam veterans. Senator Keeffe, in his saner moments, may acknowledge that that is the kind of point that I have been making since my return to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This has led to the Government adopting policies which are aimed at assisting Vietnam veterans who find themselves in unfortunate situations. The Government is offering free care in the repatriation general hospitals in cases of urgent need. It is providing care for Vietnam veterans and their families in country hospitals in cases of urgent need. It is establishing counselling centres throughout Australia which will employ not only experts outside the field of war services but also those who have worked in Vietnam, have some experience in this area and consequently have a feeling for those clients coming to them from the Vietnam veterans' community. These kinds of things are part of the Government's earnest in this regard. Clearly the Government is determined to help Vietnam veterans in this area. It has been my object and my policy since taking up my portfolio to adopt that approach and to try to find solutions to the very complex scientific questions which surround this whole matter and which have not been conclusively answered. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only one other thing to say. As I know that Senator Keeffe will be present at the meeting of the Australian Legion of Ex-servicemen and Women next Thursday afternoon in Brisbane when I will be present, I invite him to conduct a debate on this very issue before his peers in that organisation. I will be quite happy to meet any allegations that he might be prepared to make-allegations such as those he has made tonight in the Senate-publicly in open debate. </PARA>

<PARA> Are defence forces personnel seeking a loan to build a house under the Defence Service Homes Scheme usually required to wait about eight weeks for the finance while those seeking a loan to buy an established house must wait about 10 months for funds; if so, what is the reason for this disparity in processing time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Applicants who meet the eligibility and lending requirements for a Defence Service Homes loan to buy a new or previously occupied home are normally notified of loan approval within three to four weeks of lodgment of the application with the Defence Service Homes Corporation. However, settlement of a loan for the purchase of a home is subject to a waiting period of 10 months. By way of background, I mention that a waiting period of 11 months was introduced in August 1975. It was increased to 14 months in 1978 and reduced to the current period in August 1980. There is no waiting period for a loan to build a home. Depending on the nature and circumstances of an applicant's proposal, the processing time of an application for this purpose varies. The time taken is influenced by the availability of evidence of local building authority approval of plans and specifications and the applicant's being the registered proprietor of the land on which the home is to be built. A period of eight weeks would often be the processing time.</PARA>
<PARA> A waiting period does not apply to loans for home construction, mainly because experience has shown that a period broadly equivalent to the waiting period elapses before the home is completed and the applicant is able to occupy it. Furthermore, since the applicant is required to use his or her own funds and any supplementary borrowing before the Defence Service Homes loan is drawn, the applicant does not receive the benefit of the loan until the later stages of construction.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Prolonged efforts have been made, and are continuing, to achieve a sufficient level of Australian industry participation in this project. This involves maintaining continuous contact with appropriate United States Government procurement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No single all embracing industry program was proposed by my Department to United States agencies and the question of a veto did not arise.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I presume that the manual referred to in this question is the Defence Instructions (General) Admin 05-3.</PARA>
<PARA> The purchasing policies outlined in this Department of Defence instruction, which is currently being updated, applied when it was issued in mid-1977. However, the Government policy which allowed 'discretionary preference' in circumstances where the purchase of Australian made goods would assist a depressed industry or area within Australia, was superseded in late 1977, well before the Letter of Offer for the howitzers was accepted in November 1980.

<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following additional information to that provided at the time:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government recognises the sovereignty of the Western Australian Government in regard to development Agreements for major mining projects in Western Australia and does not intend to interfere in the comprehensive Agreement that had been entered into between the Western Australian Government and the Ashton Joint Venture partners. That Agreement provides, inter alia, for independent valuation and approval of marketing arrangements by the Western Australian Government but no proposals have yet been presented by the partners.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Commonwealth Government has a responsibility to ensure that the national interest is protected and, in exercising that responsibility, must be able to take whatever action it considers necessary.

<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has supplied the following supplementary information:</PARA>
<PARA> As he has stated, he sees it as necessary, in order to carry out the Commonwealth Government's responsibility of ensuring that the national interest is safeguarded, that there should be a Commonwealth valuer who would periodically check the value of diamonds being exported. However, it is not possible to indicate what arrangements might be put in place, including the role of a Commonwealth valuer because the Ashton Joint Venture has not yet decided how Argyle diamonds will be marketed when production commences later this year.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the more general question about export controls which the honourable senator asked on 25 February, the purpose of the export controls on certain minerals is to safeguard Australia's national interests and, in particular, to ensure that Australia receives fair and reasonable returns for the export of those minerals. These objectives are being achieved although no specific example can be provided because the Government has undertaken to the mineral exporting companies concerned that all aspects of its consultations with them and of contract negotiations will be kept confidential.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 March 1982 (Hansard, page 693) Senator Elstob asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Education, a question without notice concerning tertiary education tuition fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> On 4 December 1981 I issued a media release indicating that tuition fees for second and higher tertiary qualifications would not be re-introduced in 1982. The media release was issued as a result of the Senate's rejection, on 24 November 1981, of the legislation which would have provided for the limited re- introduction of fees. The Senate's rejection of the legislation was given wide publicity at the time.</PARA>
<PARA> I have no evidence that the timing of the announcement on tuition fees for 1982 has discouraged potential students from undertaking courses. There was certainly no intention on the part of the Government that this should be so.</PARA>
