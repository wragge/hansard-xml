<PARA>To the President and Members of the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the plan by the Australian Telecommunications Commission to close the Manual Assistance Telephone Exchange at Young will place in jeopardy the existing services to telephone subscribers in the district by:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The loss of a local emergency '000' service being given to nonmetropolitan telephone users in emergency conditions</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The loss of any local knowledge of the town and district being available to telephone users if this service is moved to a distant centre</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The loss of a local and personalised service provided especially to elderly and handicapped people.</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned believe that Telecom Australia should be instructed to seek the views of country telephone subscribers before proceeding with the closure of the manual assistance telephone exchange.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will call on the Government to halt the closure pending a full and open parliamentary inquiry into the needs and desires of affected subscribers and the full economic and social effects of the closure on this district, rural telephone subscribers and Telecom Australia employees.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of different forms of irregularity have been uncovered by the Corporation in its examination of this matter. Some relate to the fact that there have been sales of a manufactured product which was subject to financial cover and to delayed repayment of the advances which were due to be made. Another area of difficulty has been that some goods have not been kept in approved stores. One of the conditions for the obtaining of the funds is that the goods must be kept in an approved store, which is something that is approved by the Australian Dairy Corporation. My advice is that the company mentioned by the honourable senator in his question is not involved in the delayed repayment of any advances but the investigations have shown that the company has stored some product on which advances have been made in non-approved stores. So there is a deficiency in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce aware that currently the world steel industry is characterised by a gross over-capacity which is being supported by extensive use of subsidies, export incentives and protection measures-many of a non-tariff nature? Does the recent statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Australian steel industry is one of the few steel industries in the world open to import competition shed any light on the rising imports of steel and on the announcement that the Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Co. Pty Ltd plant near Launceston has retrenched 63 employees? Is the steel industry's distinctive position in being so open to import competition an inhibiting factor so far as local employment is concerned?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matters raised by the honourable senator in his question were really dealt with in a public statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce a few days ago, on 21 May. Sir Phillip Lynch mentioned in that statement that a reference would be sent to the Temporary Assistance Authority covering a range of steel products and that a reference would also be sent to the Industries Assistance Commission covering those products and some additional steel items. In the statement Sir Phillip Lynch pointed out that the world steel industry is a classic example of the problems facing world trade and, indeed, a very good example of why the sort of initiative that the Prime Minister has been pursuing abroad needs to be pursued. But quite clearly, in a situation where the Australian industry is one of the few steel industries in the world which is open to import competition, that does put it in a very difficult competitive position. It is for that reason that the references to the Temporary Assistance Authority and the Industries Assistance Commission have been made. The sorts of factors mentioned by Senator Watson in his question certainly do apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is, of course, the wish of the Government to maintain a healthy and competitive steel industry in Australia. The reference to the Industries Assistance Commission is an indication of the Government's acknowledgement of the difficulties which the industry faces and the views which have been put to it by the industry. The Temporary Assistance Authority is to report to the Government within 45 days of the date of the receipt of the reference. The Industries Assistance Commission report is to be presented within 12 months of the reference. When those reports are received the Government will, of course, be in a position to consider in detail the problems which Senator Watson has raised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there has been any sudden change in the competitive position of Australian steel. I think it is the proper policy of the Government not to make decisions on assistance without reference to those expert bodies which can give it impartial advice, against which it can judge what are the most appropriate decisions to be made. I do not believe that a reference in a shorter time would be likely to give the Temporary Assistance Authority a chance to give the sort of attention to the question which it deserves. I will, however, ask Sir Phillip Lynch to consider whether any shortening of the time might be considered. My judgment would be-I stress that it is no more than an individual judgment, made without having considered the matter in detail-that it would be unlikely that a shorter time would be possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

When did the Australian Dairy Corporation first become aware that funds of the Reserve Bank of Australia were being misused by dairy manufacturers? On what date was the Minister first informed?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts which surround this matter are facts which, I think, have been disclosed by the Australian Dairy Corporation as they have come to light. The Corporation has recently issued a Press release and I understand it will release further information as its inquiries bring forth further facts. As far as the instant case is concerned, I understand that a routine check by the Corporation gave rise to doubts as to whether one company, the United Milk Products Group in Tasmania, was strictly observing the Corporation's rules governing the use of these funds. Detailed inspection of the company's records by Corporation staff from 19 to 22 April confirmed that the company had sold product but had not repaid loans. Management then decided to undertake spot checks on an additional three companies to ascertain whether the Corporation's rules were being observed. When these checks showed that all three companies were in breach of the rules management decided to undertake an extensive program of checks of manufacturers. This program began on 10 May and is continuing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not have information as to the attention which has been given to this matter by the Board, but I will check that and let the honourable senator have a reply as quickly as possible-if possible, during Question Time today.

I do not see the relevance of the parallel which Senator Walsh has tried to draw in his question, but I will consider that matter to see whether it needs to receive a further substantive reply.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Institutions of higher education in the main are State institutions and are governed by Acts of State parliaments. Those Acts provide for the composition of the governing councils. Sometimes members of State parliaments are included among the members who are appointed by the State governors. I am not aware that many councils contain members of the Federal Parliament among their members. I have recently had cause to look through the calendars of some of the universities and I have noticed there a number of State parliamentarians but I have not noticed any Federal parliamentarians. I can advise Senator Teague that where the Commonwealth Government is directly responsible there is Federal representation. For example the Australian National University has two senators and two members of the House of Representatives on the governing council. I believe that Senator Peter Rae and Senator Georges have represented this chamber on that council. I know that the Minister for Defence has until recent times been a member of the council of the University of New England. I believe he was elected by the other members of that governing council . I was until recently a member of the council of the Cumberland College of Advanced Education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not able to give any systematic information on the number of senators or members of the House of Representatives who are on different councils. I understand that Senator Martin may be on the council for the University of Queensland. I think if we looked around the country we might be able to find a few Federal representatives. Senator Teague's question is a fair one. The Commonwealth does have a major role in funding universities and colleges. It would not be inappropriate for the Parliament to have a place on these bodies. This would be something which would need to be taken up with my State colleagues . It might be appropriate to take it up at the Australian Education Council to see whether it is possible to have greater representation from the Federal Parliament.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not able to give an immediate answer to the first part of the honourable senator's question but I will check it and let him have a reply. I have advice on the companies which are involved. The Australian Dairy Corporation investigations to date have shown that six companies had products withdrawn from sale, but had not repaid their advances to the Corporation. That is the first class of difficulty which has been uncovered by the Corporation's examination. These companies include Bodalla Co-op. Cheese Society Ltd, New South Wales, for which the amount involved is $305,000. I stress that is not an amount of loss. That is an amount advanced which is recoverable and, in the case of these companies, has been recovered. The other companies and amounts involved are: Colac Dairy Co. Ltd, Victoria, $130,000; Drouin Co-op. Butter Factory Co. Ltd, Victoria, $894,000; Petersville Ltd, New South Wales, $742,000; Unigate Australia Pty Ltd, Victoria, $1.25m; United Milk Tasmania Ltd, Tasmania, $1.7m. The total is $5,021,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, the Dairy Corporation's investigations so far have shown that four companies have been holding product, on which advances have been made by the Corporation, in non-approved stores. These companies are: Downs Co-op. Dairy Association Ltd, Queensland; Murray Goulburn Co-op. Co. Ltd, Victoria; Nestle Co . (Aust.) Ltd, New South Wales, and Unigate Australia Pty Ltd, Victoria. The amounts involved respectively are $19,000, $1,050,000, $1,100,000 and $3,990,000 . That is a separate category where companies have held product in non-approved stores. It has also been found so far that one company has claimed a loan on ineligible product. That company is Norco Co-op Ltd of New South Wales. The amount involved is $541,000.</PARA>
<PARA> To avoid any possibility of misleading the Senate, I should perhaps explain, having mentioned those amounts, that that total of $11.7m which has been found to be due for repayment has all been repaid or is properly accounted for. An amount of $7.74m has been repaid. The balance of $3.99m, which was initially found to be due by Unigate, because it was holding product in non-approved stores, has now been regularised because, as a result of the investigations, the company lodged applications on 20 May and the stores have been approved subsequently. So the advance is now in order. That deficiency was remedied.</PARA>
<PARA> While I am on my feet I might pick up a point which was raised by Senator Walsh in an earlier question and which I omitted to cover in my answer. The Minister was first advised of this on Wednesday, 19 May; that is, last Wednesday. That is a point which was raised by Senator Walsh earlier and to which I did not respond .</PARA>

Is it also a fact that, as part of that surveillance, the Federal Police became aware of meetings between the then New South Wales Minister for Police, Mr Crabtree, and the New South Wales police who were under surveillance? I ask the Attorney-General whether there is any substance in recent allegations that the New South Wales Government will deal with its own and that further retirements and/or resignations are to be expected. Can the Attorney-General say whether all of these activities and the allegations over the resignation of Mr Allen demonstrate the need for a national crimes commission which will investigate the truth or otherwise of these allegations about criminal activities in high places ?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Martyr has asked a number of questions, some of which deal with the operations of the Australian Federal Police. I am not in a position to answer the questions related to the operations of the police. I will refer those aspects of the question to the Minister for Administrative Services to see whether the police are in a position to make available any information on these matters or whether, being matters relating to the operations of the police , they should not be matters for disclosure. However, the other aspects of the question I can refer to in general. Copies of the so-called Allen papers have been handed over to the Australian Federal Police by the New South Wales Government, as requested by the Prime Minister. I understand that those papers are currently being studied by the Australian Federal Police but I have no further information in relation to that examination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Martyr asked specific questions in relation to the establishment of a national crimes commission. The Government believes that the extent of organised crime-I do not know that it is confined to criminal activity in high places; there is a great deal in very low places as well-that has been revealed in a number of recent inquiries is a matter of very great concern. I am not here pointing the bone at the inquiry into the activities of Mr Allen. I refer also to the extent of organised crime revealed in many other inquiries, such as the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, and other royal commissions which are also sitting.</PARA>
<PARA> The upshot is that the Government believes that there is sufficient evidence and concern to justify a very close examination of the question of establishing a national crimes commission. As I have said, I believe that it would be desirable that such a commission should be supported by the States as well as the Commonwealth. At this stage, the matter is being developed by officers of my Department, in close consultation with me. A submission will be made shortly to the Government for consideration. At this stage, no decision has been made. However, I emphasise that the matter of the establishment of a national crimes commission calls for joint action and consultation between the Commonwealth and the States and that such consultation will take place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Standing Order 418 , to which you properly drew the attention of the Attorney-General before he answered the question, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No Senator shall use offensive words against either House of Parliament or any Member of such House, or of any House of a State Parliament, or against any Statute, unless for the purpose of moving for its repeal, and all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on Members shall be considered highly disorderly.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to make the point that Senator Martyr was disorderly in that regard. One could well argue, I think unassailably, that Senator Martyr did not break the wording of Standing Order 418, but I suggest that either wittingly or unwittingly he came perilously close to breaking the spirit of that Standing Order. If that sort of question is allowed in future it will open up a procedure that could be used by both sides of this chamber to name members of State Houses or other people in a way in which that can then be properly used by the Press in headlines, and could well result in unfair and improper treatment being given to possibly innocent individuals. What I am saying is not necessarily a criticism of the question, but I ask you, Mr Deputy President, because of what I regard as the extreme importance of this matter as one of principle in regard to the procedure of this House, to contemplate it and perhaps make a statement on it, after consulting the Clerks, later in the afternoon.</PARA>

I intended to raise this matter after Question Time and to ask you, Mr Deputy President, and the President, when he returns, to consider this matter. I think it is significant that the question, which dealt with the matter of the New South Wales Parliament, was raised by a senator from Western Australia in the absence of the Leader of the Government in the Senate who is from New South Wales and that no honourable senator from New South Wales chose to bring up this matter in this way. There are certainly means of skirting around Standing Order 418 and getting down into the gutter in this way and abusing the privileges and the Standing Orders of this Senate.

In this country, on the other hand, the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation operates to build yet another bridge by which participation of people can be increased and their involvement in Australian society advanced. The situation is quite different. I understand Senator Townley's concern that we should not unwittingly be in breach of the Gleneagles Agreement, but I put it to him that the very great differences which exist in our practices and our structure make that very unlikely. The NASF has been funded and operates to increase the opportunities by which Aboriginal people can be involved in sport at all levels in this country.

It must be said that the many amendments which have been made in recent years to the Income Tax Assessment Act have enabled the closure of a number of his schemes by the Commissioner of Taxation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not able to speculate on where Senator Childs might get his information. It is a fact that the report of the mission was tabled in the other place earlier this month. The recommendations, which I understand to be unanimous, are a matter of public record. I have recently read those recommendations and to the best of my recollection they contain no recommendation along the lines indicated in the information given by Senator Thomas. In other words, there is no reference to the imposing of a tax on the export of sheep in the form that is suggested. There are recommendations which relate to the promotion of the export of carcass meats. That is a matter on which there was some unanimity of view. That recommendation, along with the other recommendations of the study mission, is under close examination by the Government. I know that the Minister for Primary Industry is expecting to have discussions with the parties to that mission and that he hopes to be able to make a public statement on the matter in the reasonably near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot go beyond that, except to assure the Senate that the recommendations are those which have already been published. They do not contain a proposal of the sort which is mentioned. It may well be that there are different views on how some of the commonly agreed objectives might be achieved and financed, but that is a quite separate matter and the sort of matter which no doubt Mr Nixon will be taking up with the parties to the mission. The really important thing is that a diverse group representing government, growers and the unions involved has been able to come forward with a group of common recommendations in an area which is important to Australia's trade, to the growers and to the trade unions involved. I think we should welcome that. There should be a common view. We hope that, flowing from those recommendations, Mr Nixon will be able to produce useful, positive actions by the Government which will have the support of all parties to the industry. It is an industry which has not benefited by disputation in the past.

The Minister will also recall that, during the debate on the appropriations for the Department of the Capital Territory and for the Department of Transport, Senator Peter Rae, last Wednesday, made an unwarranted attack upon my credibility, again referring to this matter. In view of the fact that the debate to which I have just referred was broadcast and attracted the attention of certain people listening to it who have since contacted me about certain matters, can the Minister tell the Senate whether there has been any escalation in the fee payable by Australian National Railways to the consultants over and above the figure he provided me with on 31 March 1981? If so, what is the total figure now involved?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was a similar question asked of me last week, or a question which, although not in the same detail, raised the same issue of principle. I do not recall my exact answer but it would have been in the terms that I would use now, namely, that there is no immunity for any section of the community for breaches of the law. That applies in this situation and in others. Whether there should be penal sanctions with respect to the application of industrial laws is, of course, a matter of some controversy among some sections of the community. That is a quite separate issue, in my view. We are not dealing here with the question of the application of industrial laws relating to disputes about industrial conditions, and so on; we are dealing with breaches of the general law which applies to the whole community and which has nothing directly to do with industrial relations. In any event, it is certainly a desirable thing, in all aspects of the community's activities, that there should be the same rule for one as for any other member of the community. I do not believe that most Australians or, indeed, most members of the Opposition would regard the membership of a union or anything else as conferring immunity from the law. That simply is a proposition which cannot be counternanced in a free and democratic society.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators will know, seven years of Fraser government has meant falling living standards, rising unemployment, the undermining of an effective social welfare system and increased poverty throughout Australia. But nowhere have the consequences of Fraserism been so pervasive and so devastating as in the Australian Capital Territory. Constructed as the seat of government administration and falling solely under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, the Australian Capital Territory has felt the full force of a government bent on withdrawing from its social responsibilities and diminishing public services. Under Fraser, Canberra citizens have felt very keenly the lack of any local or State government to cushion them from the consequences of Federal Government policies. Canberra provides the most clear-cut example of the failure of the Government's economic policies. Nowhere in Australia is that failure so evident as in the nation's capital. While the Government has cancelled public works, cut public expenditure , imposed staff ceilings and attempted to withdraw from public enterprise wherever possible, it has also failed dismally in getting private enterprise to step into the breach. So the Canberra economy has suffered a sharp decline and the people of Canberra-my constituents-have been the victims of all of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The employment situation in the Australian Capital Territory is unacceptable. In fact the rise in the number of unemployed locally is the most distressing result of nearly seven years of Fraser economic policies. Growth in employment opportunities in the Australian Capital Territory has failed to keep pace with even the relatively small population growth which has occurred during the last seven years. I have a graph taken from the 1980-81 annual report of the Department of the Capital Territory which clearly illustrates Australian Capital Territory employment and population trends since 1970. There was strong growth both in employment and in population figures until 1975. Thereafter, the population increased but there was a decrease in employment. Since 1975 population in the Australian Capital Territory has increased by approximately 39 ,000 and the total civilian work force has decreased by 1,2000. At this stage I seek leave to have this graph incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Unemployment rates in Canberra have consistently exceeded the national average. The latest figures are no exception. While there was a small decline in the number of jobless registered nationally in March, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics there was another rise in the Australian Capital Territory. In Canberra the overall unemployment rate was 8.7 per cent in March as compared with 6.7 per cent nationally. For adolescents seeking full time time work the rate in Canberra was an appalling 28 .2 per cent compared with the national figure of 17.2 per cent. In the Australian Capital Territory 41 per cent of full time job seekers are aged between 15 years and 19 years. This compares with a figure of 30 per cent at the national level. Many of these young people have no choice but to leave Canberra to seek work elsewhere. It is worth noting that that is happening. If young jobless remained in the Australian Capital Territory the statistics would be even more appalling than those which I have just presented to the Senate. In the important 15-year-old to 24-year-old age group there has been a swing to net outward migration, which of course in itself further depresses the economy of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the effect of Government policies on the private sector we find an equally depressing picture. Not only has the Government limited the growth of public employment through Public Service staff ceilings but also through cutbacks it has devastated the private sector, particularly the construction industry. Employment in private enterprise has suffered even more than public employment under the Fraser Government. In a Budget submission presented recently to the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), the Canberra Association for Regional Development said:</PARA>
<PARA> The mix of the economy is reverting to an increase in the public sector component-the private sector percentage has fallen from 40 per cent to 35 per cent in five years and is likely to fall further if corrective action is not taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment is being exported-and one breadwinner in five in the private sector is seeking employment elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>CARD points out that the reality of the Canberra economy is in direct conflict with the stated government policy of developing a strong private sector. Indeed, that is one of the ironies of the present situation, the situation which has developed ever since we have had a so-called private enterprise government running this Territory. The most serious losers in all this have been the people working in the private sector or the people who had their investment in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been a decline in government spending. The decline in government expenditure in the Australian Capital Territory has been the biggest single factor in causing unemployment and the decline of the private sector. The decline in government spending has been accompanied by a much larger decline in private capital expenditure in the Australian Capital Territory. I refer any senator who doubts what I am saying to the figures in the tables set out on pages 114 and 115 of the 1980 annual report of the Department of the Capital Territory. Those tables reveal that for 1974-75 expenditure by the Department of the Capital Territory amounted to $139m and $279m for the National Capital Development Commission. Total expenditure in the Australian Capital Territory amounted to $632m. In 1980-81 the budget for the Department of the Capital Territory had decreased to $96m and the NCDC budget had decreased to $112m in real terms, which is a decrease of more than 100 per cent. Total government expenditure in the Australian Capital Territory had decreased to $520m in real terms. The decline in government spending in real terms is huge but it must be pointed out, not nearly as large as the decline in private capital expenditure in the Australian Capital Territory which was more than halved in real terms since its peak in 1975-76. Private investment in the Australian Capital Territory is now estimated to be at its lowest level since 1969, reflecting the high failure rates for small businesses and the severe cutbacks in government contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1981 the Government cancelled or deferred eight or possibly nine major projects which could have breathed life into the Canberra economy and provided some desperately needed employment. Construction of the Australian Federal Police headquarters, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation headquarters, the Archives building and the federal Courts was deferred. Construction of the Australian Institute of Criminology was cancelled. The future of the Museum of Australia is in doubt. The proposed hotel convention centre for Canberra has been rejected. Total private and government expenditure on housing and construction in the Australian Capital Territory has taken a nose -dive since the Fraser Government gained office. From a peak in 1975 of over $ 550m construction expenditure has declined steadily to only $185m this year. I have a graph from the Master Builders Association of the Australian Capital Territory illustrating this disastrous position. For the information of honourable senators, I seek leave to table the graph. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I would now like to proceed with a discussion on housing in the Australian Capital Territory. Honourable senators who have been familiar with the development of the Australian Capital Territory economy over many years will recognise that the housing industry has been or was until the incoming Fraser Government changed the situation, the backbone of the building and construction industry. The decline in the construction industry has been greatly exacerbated by the fact that this Government cancelled the construction program for government housing in the Australian Capital Territory in 1976 and has only this year been forced by the growing demands of those who cannot afford to buy or rent houses on the private market to recommence it. Again the decline in construction of government housing has been accompanied by a decline in construction of private housing, and this is an indication of the economic stagnation which this Government has brought to the national capital. In 1975, 5,068 new dwellings, 3,620 private houses and 1,448 government houses were completed in the Australian Capital Teritory. In 1980-81, only 1,971 houses were completed in the Australian Capital Territory, that is, 1,970 private houses and one government house. Despite the fact that the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, announced with a great flourish at the time of the last Federal Budget that 300 new government houses were to be built in 1981- 82, fewer than 10 government houses have been completed so far this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By the Government's own standards of economic responsibility, it has clearly been a dismal failure in the Australian Capital Territory. Any private enterprise that followed the course which this Government is pursuing would very quickly go out of business. What private employer would pursue a policy of arbitrary staff ceilings, leaving adequate staff in some areas but severe shortages in critical areas? The Fraser Government is guilty of very bad management and irresponsible decisions, such as dropping the construction of government housing and the selling of Canberra's major public asset-the Belconnen Mall. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Capital Territory attempts to cover up his Government's bad management by flamboyant announcements of major new projects. The main problem with these new projects is that they never eventuate. Let us look at a few examples. We are still waiting for any sign of the National Semiconductor Corporation of California silicon chip factory. Yet that was a proposal which the Minister announced as being the salvation of the employment situation and the economy of the Australian Capital Territory. This project does not exist. I express at this stage my deepest scepticism that we will ever see that manufacturing initiative in the Australian Capital Territory. The Minister's most recent announcement was that a private enterprise film production project would be initiated in the Australian Capital Territory. Now it appears, from questions that have been raised in this chamber and in the other place, that the Government may have to close the tax loopholes which are facilitating the project by United American and Australasian Film Productions Pty Ltd. That is another project we are still waiting to see any sign of and which perhaps will not eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to honourable senators that the people of Canberra are sick and tired of listening to Mr Hodgman's promises of what will happen. The people of the Australian Capital Territory very clearly are aware of what has happened. That is their concern. That concern amounts to a judgment that the Fraser Government has been a dismal failure in this Territory. Even the local Liberal Party is doing its best to dissociate itself from the Federal Liberal Government and the Minister for the Capital Territory in the current House of Assembly election campaign. It is easy to see why. While Mr Hodgman is fond of slating Canberra bashers, his Government-the Fraser Liberal Government-is the biggest Canberra basher of all time. In this respect the Fraser Government is markedly different from its Liberal predecessors. Previous Liberal-National Country Party governments took some pride in developing the national capital, but this present small-minded Government has sought to downgrade Canberra and to disadvantage its people. </PARA>
<PARA> In the social welfare area the situation is particularly grim. I present more figures for the benefit of the Senate. In June 1975, 6,888 people, or 3.6 per cent of the population of the Australian Capital Territory, depended for their income on pensions and benefits. The figure for March of this year was 18,992- that is, 8.4 per cent of the population of the Australian Capital Territory. There has been an increase from 3.6 per cent to 8.4 per cent in the percentage of the local population being forced into dependency on government benefits. I defy any government which has presided over such an increase in poverty, misery and joblessness to argue that it has been anything other than a disaster. Relief agencies in the Australian Capital Territory, such as the Smith Family, the Salvation Army and the St Vincent de Paul Society-not to mention my own electorate office-are seriously overburdened by people who are in need of money, food, clothes and furniture. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the very unfair policies which the Government has implemented in this Territory is to force people on to charity. These days when constituents of mine who are in financial trouble or who have housing problems go along to one of the local departmental agencies for assistance they are directed, as a matter of government policy, to go and seek assistance from charities. We all acknowledge the excellent work done by charitable organisations in this community-no one is more aware of their excellent record than I am-but I consider it to be quite wrong that in the matter of basic living standards constituents are being directed to charities. There has been an absolute abrogation of responsibility to the poor and needy in this community, although their situation has been created as a direct result of the Fraser Government's economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Capital Territory Health Commission has insufficient funds to continue to support crisis services such as the Canberra women's refuge, the Caroline Chisholm refuge and Lifeline. These bodies are now sent off to make submissions for grants from the recycled gambling money in the Australian Capital Territory Community Development Fund. It is another very good example of the attitude of the Government to the provision of social services in the Territory that the only funding available for these organisations is that derived from gambling revenue. Inadequate funding for the Office of Child Care has meant that the Black Mountain creche cannot obtain a government subsidy. It and other centres in the Australian Capital Territory have been forced to charge higher fees for child care and thus put their services outside the range of the parents and children who most need them. The creche at the Bruce College of Technical and Further Education must close because of the lack of government funding. That too will have ramifications. When a creche at a training institution such as Bruce College has to close many parents-in most cases mothers seeking to acquire labour market skills-have to cease studying and developing those skills and, as a consequence, are forced to remain unemployed, or beneficiaries of government benefits. So the whole disadvantage is accumulated as a result of inappropriate government policies. The increased burden on relief agencies, the increased demand for government funding and government housing, and the increasing number of people on pensions and benefits are all reflections of the economic strain placed on the people of the Australian Capital Territory by the policies of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a time when Canberra was regarded by all Australians and also internationally, as the great success story of growth centres. It is a planned growth centre and for many years, under a succession of governments of different hues, it was extremely successful. It was a thriving, growing place where people could look forward to economic security for themselves, to jobs and to economic security for their children. That has all changed in a way which not only has disadvantaged local residents but also, I believe, has been to the detriment of Australians generally, all of whom have a stake in this place and are being undersold by present government strategies. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 June an election will be held in the Territory for the local House of Assembly, a body which at this stage has only an advisory role to the Government , but whose voice is the only voice which the Territory's citizens are allowed by the present Government to have in the running of their own affairs. This situation is extremely unsatisfactory from the point of view of anybody who believes in democratic principles. It has proven to be extremely unsatisfactory in that the policies which the Fraser Government has implemented, with or without-I would say mainly without-the advice of the local Assembly, or against its advice, have been disastrous. Surely, if people are allowed to elect spokespeople on local issues, we will end up with better policies than those to which we have been subjected for seven years. I believe that the people of the Australian Capital Territory will endorse, by the way they vote on 5 June, everything that I have said in the matter of public importance which I have brought before the Senate today. </PARA>

In fact, in these next few minutes I hope we will be able to get the argument on to a proper basis for deciding, indeed, how the economic strategies of the Fraser Government have worked in practice, not only as they affect Australia but also in terms of their effects on the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the first thing that we ought to do is to attempt to test the arguments put forward by Senator Ryan in her speech today to to see what, in fact, policies of the Australian Labor Party type really mean in terms of success in State administrations. I suppose the obvious thing to do firstly is to turn to the most recent political event on the calendar which was the election last Saturday week of a new Liberal Government in Tasmania and the complete throwing out, holus-bolus, of a Labor government which was so discredited, so disorganised, so split, so faction ridden and so destroyed by its own activities that it deserves no further consideration. The kinds of strategies and the kinds of bleats that came from the former Tasmanian Government are the kinds of things that we heard from Senator Ryan today. She talked about the public sector involvement and the greater degree with which moneys can be spent on particular activities. This is the kind of thing which Senator Ryan sees as the only panacea for the problems of any economy and particularly for the government of the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we ought to look at one or two other States. One State government that comes most quickly to mind which has a direct effect upon the residents of the Australian Capital Territory, is, of course, the New South Wales Wran Labor Government. If there is any example of the failure of Labor policies at State government level, it would have to be evidenced by that Government. There has been a lack of planning. Attention to political concerns rather than to the real interests of the people has been so paramount in the minds of the leadership of the Labor Party in that State and that attitude has resulted in the kinds of problems that will rub off on the Australian Capital Territory in the coming winter. We all know of the great power crisis in New South Wales-the problems of getting the power stations going in that State-and the difficulties that six years of Wran Labor Government in New South Wales have visited upon New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen this situation not only in the power area but also with regard to shipping as a result of the State Government's activity. Constant references have been made to 'Wran's navy', that pile of some 120 ships that sit off Wollongong, Sydney and Newcastle, unable to berth because of the problems brought about by a lack of loading facilities and because of industrial problems on the wharves of New South Wales. These are examples of the kinds of solutions which Senator Ryan would have us believe and accept as being the panaceas for the problems which she sees. </PARA>
<PARA> I have other examples. One is, of course, in my State of South Australia. Ten years of disastrous Dunstan Labor government in that State produced economic decline and stagnation in South Australia over that time. It is fortunate that, by the election of the Tonkin Liberal Government in 1979, this is now being turned around. We have seen an improvement in the economy of that State. We have seen the development of new job opportunities. Some 20,000 new jobs have been created in South Australia since that Government came to power. Why and how has this happened? It has happened through the power applications of the kind of commonsense, good housekeeping-approach which is antipathetic to the kinds of ideas which Senator Ryan put forward. We have seen the advent, in recent times, of the new Labor Government in Victoria. Already it has had to renege on promises which it made prior to the election of 3 April. Consequently this demonstrates that it already realises that its promises cannot be met. </PARA>
<PARA> What kinds of policies and what kinds of strategies, economic or otherwise, would Senator Ryan like to see us adopt here in the Territory. In recent times there has been some play by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, about what ought to be done to stimulate activity in the Australian Capital Territory. What kinds of things have emanated from him? He is the exponent, the front-runner, of all policies in relation to Australia and his economic expertise, at least amongst Labor Party people, seems to be well and truly accepted. The point is that people in the Australian Capital Territory have not had the opportunity of properly judging those policies simply because they have not been spelt out in any way. Neither Senator Ryan nor Mr Hayden, as Leader of the Opposition, has clearly said to us what they intend with regard to the Australian Capital Territory. Sure, there has been some bleating and some reports in newspapers about how we can spend our way out of the problems in the Territory. That sounds to me exactly like an extension of policies which have been proposed in respect of the whole of the Australian economy over the last six years. Those kinds of policies have been brought into absolute disrepute over that period by the very success of the Fraser Government's policies throughout Australia since 1975. We have seen a reduction of inflation and the creation of more jobs in the Australian economy. Some 200,000 jobs were created in 1980. These policies are bringing success. </PARA>
<PARA> What kinds of things would Senator Ryan put forward? She could spend her time more constructively in trying to explain to us how she would implement such policies so that the people of the Australian Capital Territory can properly judge what the ALP is proposing. I suppose the first things we should look at are the make work schemes which seem to be a common thread amongst all solutions found by the ALP. I am not sure whether that is a policy that Mr Hayden would put forward as a solution to the problems of the Australian Capital Territory but I remember well that in 1975, as Treasurer of this country, he wound up the Regional Employment Development Scheme. I take it that that sort of scheme is what he would like to see implemented in the Territory. Yet in 1975 that was the kind of policy to which he was opposed and which he realised was unproductive, too expensive and likely to increase taxation on the whole of the population, and which consequently would not lead to the kinds of benefits that he wanted. He recognised that in his more rational moments as an economic spokesman for the ALP and he implemented that policy when he had the power to do so when Treasurer of Australia in 1975. Is he now saying to us that that policy is to be reversed? Is he now going to argue that we should be spending more on make work schemes like the discredited RED scheme of 1975? Not even Clyde Cameron, a former Minister for Labour, supported that kind of policy in the end. He saw the damage that it was doing by creating more taxation on the people, destroying incentives and so destroying employment. These kinds of schemes have been discredited and yet they are coming forward again from the Labor Party. That is the situation as best as we can judge it. We need a clear statement of the Labor Party's policy. Certainly Senator Ryan has given no such clear statement today of what the ALP would do if it were in charge of the Treasury benches here in the Australian Parliament and could direct funds to the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other point that ought to be mentioned. We heard from Senator Ryan , in the latter part of her speech, a reference to self-government in the Australian Capital Territory. All of us know that this Government allowed a referendum in 1978 of the citizens of the Territory and they overwhelmingly voted against self-government. Clearly the people of the Australian Capital Territory do not want self-government. Yet, Senator Ryan claims to have behind her supporters who do want self-government. Perhaps there are a few. Maybe there are some who do seek this kind of answer to their problems. But is there an answer to be found in self-government? I do not know that we can answer that question today. It is not the central point of this debate. But one point must be made in that regard and that is that this Government has empowered the Commonwealth Grants Commission to investigate the funding of the Australian Capital Territory in such a way as could possibly lead towards some kind of self -government. This indicates the sinews of what is required if any kind of self- government is ever to be achieved. This Government is interested in researching all possibilities, not closing off the options as Senator Ryan would have us believe in regard to the various issues that she has raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming down to some of the particular difficulties that have occurred in this economy and the Australian Capital Territory in recent times, we can easily find the answer to Senator Ryan's dilemma. On the one hand, she is seeking to make political capital out of the kinds of problems that have emerged with unemployment, but, on the other hand, she is not prepared to shape up to a proper analysis of the facts. The truth is that Canberra, during a period of very rapid growth over the last 20 years, particularly in the period preceding 1975, saw a movement among Commonwealth Government departments of people coming from other centres, such as Sydney and Melbourne, to Canberra. In other words, there were holus-bolus movements of groups into the Canberra area. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, this stimulated a very significant rate of growth in the Australian Capital Territory's economy. Since that time and as that process has slowed down , there has been only natural growth occurring in the Public Service in the Australian Capital Territory. Naturally enough, this has changed the whole atmosphere in this area. One could not have reasonably expected that there would have been a continuation of that process of continual transfer of departments from other centres to the Australian Capital Territory. Anyone with half a wit would understand that there are only so many departments that can be transferred to the Australian Capital Territory. That is the point that the Labor Party, Mr Hayden and Senator Ryan refuse to recognise. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that there must be a limit to the growth that can occur from that kind of stimulus. As a result of particular government activity since 1975, there has been a gradual growth in this area, not anywhere near as great as that in the period immediately preceeding it. But that is no reason for adopting new policies in relation to the Australian Capital Territory. If we had reached a certain point when the policies of transferring departments to the Australian Capital Territory had run into a brick wall, clearly there would be a need to adopt other policies. This Government is doing that. Through the present Minister, Mr Hodgman, we have seen a development towards the encouragement of more private enterprise development in Canberra. We have already seen his initiative in seeking to obtain the services of a film studio in Canberra. Obviously, the spin-off from that kind of activity is far greater than the amount of the original investment and it will stimulate enormous employment opportunities above and beyond those people directly involved in such a facility . </PARA>
<PARA> We have also seen the recent negotiations with National Semiconductor ( Australia) Pty Ltd in relation to the development of a factory in the Australian Capital Territory. The reason that that particular effort has not borne fruit at present is obvious. It is that there has been an international downturn in the economy. Clearly, that has changed the basis on which the economics of such a situation could be worked out and determined to be viable. Notwithstanding that, the fact is that Senator Ryan refuses to realise or to admit that the Federal Government was prepared, upon the receipt of the original proposals from the Nat -Semi organisation, to fund that process to the extent of $19m. An undertaking was given to that effect. Does that indicate that this Government has no interest in the development of alternative facilities in the Australian Capital Territory? Clearly, it does not. Clearly, the Government was prepared to put its money where its mouth is in relation to these kinds of processes. These things are the core of what this Government's strategy is about. Senator Ryan by no means has been able to prove to us that those policies have not been successful in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan made a great deal of the problems of unemployment in the Australian Capital Territory, but the fact is that in April of 1982-these figures are provisional-those people seeking full time work represented around 5 per cent of the total work force in the Australian Capital Territory. That compares with the figure of 6.3 per cent for Australia as a whole. In terms of full time work seeking individuals, the Australian Capital Territory has an advantage over the rest of Australia. How does that stack up alongside the kind of argument Senator Ryan continues to put forward? Again we return to the sorts of solutions she talked of. She spoke of work creation schemes. What kind of work creation schemes?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently the honourable senator's leader has because the statement has found its way into the media in some way or another. We know too that there have been attempts by this Government to develop alternative private sector activities as well. Of course we know of the growth of tourism in this area in recent times. I understand that the most recent statistics show that there has been substantial growth in tourism in the Australian Capital Territory . That relates directly to the Government's Australian Capital Territory tourism budget last year of some half a million dollars. Clearly this promotion expenditure is aimed at stimulating job opportunities in the Australian Capital Territory. Yet we still do not see any specifics coming forward from the Labor Party on what it would like to see happen. The lack of detail which emanates from the Opposition shows that its arguments are designed purely as political stunts and clearly they have no backing in terms of how they might solve the problems of the residents of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One piece of evidence Senator Ryan threw into the debate which deserves some answer is a comparison of the number of people on welfare benefits. I think she said that some 3.6 per cent of the total work force in 1975 was on various welfare benefits. That compares with the 1981 figure of 8.4 per cent. Those are Senator Ryan's figures; I am unable to check them. She seeks to make the point that somehow there is a greater and rising need by people who are on welfare, and that they may need specific help other than that available through the social security system. She fails to make the point that this could well be another example of that phenomenon which exists throughout the whole of the Australian community; that is, the gradual aging of our population, causing more people to move into the welfare area. </PARA>

We know from listening to the radio every morning how active he is in this regard and how, through his various media activities, he is seeking to promote Canberra at every opportunity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must confess to being a little surprised at Senator Messner's objection to Australian Capital Territory matters being discussed at this time when an election is due to be held in the Australian Capital Territory on Saturday week. I would have thought that this was the right time to discuss Canberra's affairs; certainly not the wrong time. Instead Senator Messner discussed extensively-certainly in the first part of his speech-the affairs of New South Wales and South Australia where, to my certain knowledge, an election is not to be held on Saturday week. That aside, the Australian Democrats are also concerned about the effects of the Fraser Government's economic policies in the Australian Capital Territory. In Canberra we see something of a microcosm of the failure of the Government's economic policies throughout Australia. I think this is really the crux of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We see, both in the larger field and in the smaller field of the Australian Capital Territory, a society in which every day more and more families are entering the ranks of the poor. People who once regarded themselves as being reasonably well off are now struggling with much higher taxation in real terms, much higher interest rate charges on their home loans and rising costs over virtually the whole spectrum of family costs. Whatever one cites as statistics and cost of living tabulations, one has only to speak to any housewife in Canberra or elsewhere to get the same story, that it is becoming increasingly difficult for more and more people to make ends meet. We have a society in which , apparently, unemployment remains a major and intractable problem. The economy generally is in the doldrums, lacking the drive and initiative that a great and lucky country such as Australia should have. Because of artificial restrictions on the economy we have that problem and we will continue to have the problem as long as those artificial restrictions exist and these crude monetarist views of the economy are held. That is being demonstrated all over the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory are especially vulnerable to such things. As such, Canberra is a classic case of the need for remedial treatment. This is needed in Canberra urgently. It needs treatment to cushion the community against the fluctuating economic fortunes of society. The obvious answer would seem to be-others have said this along with the Australian Democrats-to broaden the economic base and to do so progressively from now on. The Government has certainly expressed a national policy of extending the private enterprise base. However, the effect of what has happened is that in the Australian Capital Territory the private sector contribution to the local economy has fallen by at least 5 per cent in the last five years and is likely to continue its downward spiral unless corrective action is taken immediately. In fact, it ought to have been taken much earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> We feel that the Government's lack of real interest in the welfare of the Australian Capital Territory is evidenced by this absence of a coherent, long term and disciplined program for the economic development of the Territory. As I shall describe later, a rational and achievable program of that kind has been put forward only today by the Australian Democrats leader in the House of Assembly, Mr Gordon Walsh, on his behalf and on behalf of his colleague in the House of Assembly, Mr Ivor Vivian. Indeed, he spoke on behalf of all the Australian Democrats in Canberra. I understand that the Australian Democrats in Canberra regard economic recovery in the Australian Capital Territory as probably the most important area of Democrats policy for next month's election. That should be so because it is the most serious problem facing Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been to shops and various arcades in Canberra talking to people. It is a fact that Canberra is seen now-certainly by retailers-as one of the most difficult places in Australia in which to run a business. White goods, clothing and commodities of that sort are cheaper in Canberra than they are anywhere else . They have to be sold cheaply to be moved. I think that is a serious situation. We find that, faced with this situation, the Government prefers to proceed with random, ad hoc, hit or miss policies for the Australian Capital Territory, apparently in the interest of short term political gain; that is, if it even bothers to consider the effects of its economic policies on the Territory at all . There is increasing evidence that the Government is not considering that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) has praised a recent submission from the Canberra Association for Regional Development, CARD, which calls for a five-year rolling public works program for the Australian Capital Territory. Mr Hodgman has called the CARD submission excellent, which is a very strong word. It means that it cannot be better. Mr Hodgman stated that the submission presents a very good argument. However, the Government's cynicism towards the Australian Capital Territory seems, to the Australian Democrats, to be evident in that its Minister, Mr Hodgman, regards the chances for success of this excellent proposal-to use his own word-as doubtful. That is not nearly good enough as an answer to the problems of the people of Canberra. I think it even gives an element of levity to a serious situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1978 the Government predicted an annual public works expenditure for the Australian Capital Territory of $165m in the year 1978 to be increased gradually to a figure of $375m by 1985-86. In fact, the reverse of the Government's projections has occurred. Since 1978 public works spending fell from $165m to $95m by 1982. This figure represents a shortfall of $131m in the Government's projections, which called for $226m in public expenditure for this year. That is obviously one of the reasons for the economic effects which the people of Canberra notice so greatly. In this uncertain climate it is not difficult to understand why the private sector is not able to pull itself up by its own bootstraps through self-help efforts, or why other businesses steer clear of investing in the Australian Capital Territory. The Government tends to watch its ideological magic formula, that somehow if everything is left to private enterprise, even the most unpromising circumstances, it will get things together. The Australian Democrats are a private enterprise party too; we are particularly concerned with small business. We are appalled at the terrible beating about the head which the Government is giving to small business in this country and the advantage it is giving to large business, particularly multinational business. We are not particularly multinational baiting or bashing ; there is very much a part for the multinational companies to play in the development of this country in a controlled, planned way. The fault is not in the multinationals but in the Government because of the emphasis that it is giving to the situation with regard to small business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In today's economic climate it is naive to expect small or large business to come to Canberra in the teeth of the wild fluctuations of Canberra's fortunes that are associated with changes in government policy. I heard early one morning last week a radio program in which a building expert spoke to young people in Canberra about whether they should go ahead and build a house. He came out quite directly and said: 'Do not ever consider building a house in Canberra. Do not any of you try to build a house in Canberra because it is a fact that you will buy a house-and there are plenty of houses on the market in Canberra- cheaper than you could build one'. That in itself is very serious. It is a significant and important indicator of what is wrong in Canberra. Additionally, it is unlikely to encourage many builders to come to Canberra or to want to stay here. It is hypocritical for the Government to urge private enterprise to assume greater economic responsibility when the Government's own piecemeal policies make the success of private enterprise in Canberra all but impossible. That is the truth of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Government expenditure provides the major impetus for economic growth in the Territory, cuts in the expenditure of the magnitude just outlined have resulted in serious economic dislocation. I made the point when I first rose to speak that Canberra is particularly vulnerable to economic dislocation for the reason that it does not have the versatility and diversity of income and business that it ought to have. The effects of this economic dislocation have rebounded very substantially on the young. This is a serious matter too. While the national level of unemployment declined slightly in March, in the Australian Capital Territory that figure increased. One-third of the unemployed in the Territory are between the ages of 15 and 19. The unemployment rate for people of that age nationally is 17.2 per cent. As I have said before many times in this place, that is a shocking indictment of the Government's economic policies both in human and social terms as well as economic ones. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian Capital Territory that already outlandish figure for unemployed youth of 17.2 per cent nationally becomes 28.2 per cent-well over one -quarter of the young people in Canberra are seeking jobs and cannot get them. The overall unemployment rate for young people and adults combined is 2 per cent higher than the national average and stands at 8.6 per cent. Because of this high level of youth unemployment, it is not surprising to learn that there is a significant and growing trend of out-migration by that age group of 15 to 24. That is a serious matter too. It means essentially that this community can offer no future to its young people. A more savage fate could hardly be visited upon it by even an ill-intentioned government. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, there are an estimated 9,000 to 10,000 underemployed or unemployed people in the Australian Capital Territory. What is worse, the Canberra Association for Regional Development has estimated that if private business fails to develop an industrial and commercial base by 1988-that is only six years off-the children now in primary schools in the Australian Capital Territory will feel the full effect of the stagnation and those now in secondary schools will have to go elsewhere to find work. This would make inevitable a split-up of their families and an impossibility for them to be in their family circle during those first vital years when they work which, as most people would accept, is a desirable situation. Already at present one in five breadwinners not employed in the government sector will have to go elsewhere to find employment. I cannot emphasise strongly enough that these are not merely statistics or percentages. They are a description of Australian people in the Australian Capital Territory who are denied their right to earn a simple and decent living. That is all they ask for and they have been denied it. As I have said here before, and will say again, that represents a fundamental failure of government and its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps some other specific examples can highlight the situation. The National Capital Development Commission's works program has been steadily reduced by 40 per cent in 1980 and by another 30 per cent in 1981. Even if we include money allocated to the new and permanent Parliament House and the Defence Academy, the program decline in recent years has been in the range of 15 per cent in money terms and, if inflation is taken into account, 25 per cent in real terms. Residents of the Australian Capital Territory are also hard hit by household rates, which have recorded percentage rises in double figures in recent years. The difficulties I have mentioned indicate clearly that urgent action by the Federal Government is required. </PARA>

That would have to be associated with greater prosperity. The housing problem in Canberra is due to the strangling of the economy here.

<PARA> To look at the situation accurately, we need to go back a little. There was a particularly high growth rate between 1972 and 1975, so much so that even the Labor Government at the time saw the need for a slow-down and saw the absurdity of the growth rate which it had created. Staff ceilings were introduced in July 1975 by the then Labor Government. The Public Service Board report for 1975 commented upon the decrease of 4.2 per cent during the 1975-76 year when it stated:</PARA>

I refer in passing to the National Mapping Council as one instrumentality which was to be moved. What would have happened to Canberra had the Government not changed in 1975? Perhaps we can get some idea of that from Senator Ryan's speech today, which was totally negative talk about the future of Canberra. That does nobody any good. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Capital Territory is not in as bad shape as the ALP would have us believe, but for electoral purposes the ALP is prepared to talk in this manner. It is time the ALP stopped electoral point scoring and started looking towards the welfare of Canberrans. That party is obsessed with doom and this sort of knocking is not likely to encourage the private sector to bring its money to Canberra and to develop it. The only thing the ALP has to offer in its policy for the House of Assembly election is more expenditure of taxpayers' money on work creation schemes, which are band-aid measures. The Australian Capital Territory is looking for employment opportunities for young people, opportunities that are worth while and will create career prospects for them. It is important that Canberra develop a base other than a public service one. I think all public servants would agree that it is important that there be a thriving private sector so there is opportunity for their children to obtain other types of jobs. We have heard from the Labor Party no proposals for development. It knocked the National Semiconductor Corporation scheme and the Tivoli Gardens scheme. It knocks any development proposal that is put up. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has referred to self-government, and I also refer briefly to that. Self-government was promised by the Whitlam Government, but what happened? Absolutely nothing. This Government held a referendum in 1978 to ascertain the views of the community, and they were given to us in the result of that referendum. This Government is taking positive steps to ascertain the financial situation so that the people of the Australian Capital Territory can know the financial implications of taking over what is referred to as self-government that the Labor Party would thrust upon this community. The Commonwealth Grants Commission is inquiring into the financial situation here to ascertain the relationship of those aspects of government which now apply. That could have been done by the Whitlam Government, but it did not bother to do anything about it. No details are given to this community as to what self-government under a Labor Government would mean. </PARA>

<PARA> Undermining investment confidence is something the Labor Party is developing into a fine art, along with the Australian Democrats. This was evidenced in the attitude that at least one of its branches adopted to the Belconnen Mall. If anyone were to tell me that the Federal Government should be in the business of retailing, I would not be able to understand how that conclusion could be arrived at. Capital works programs are going ahead in the Australian Capital Territory at present. In the current year $650m worth of capital and recurrent programs are under way in the Australian Capital Territory. That, I think, is a very significant investment. Of that, $80.3m is set aside for the National Capital Development Commission for building and construction and $30m for the new Parliament House and the proposed Australian Defence Force Academy. There are a number of private projects: Blocks of offices are being built in Hobart Place; a commercial development is being undertaken opposite the Travelodge motel in Civic; and the old Jolimont building site is being developed. The Defence Force Academy, when completed, will bring about 1,200 people to Canberra . Also, a four-storey building in Mort Street has just been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1980-81 financial year $7.5m was spent on the new Parliament House and $ 23m has been set aside for this 1981-82 financial year. Only today, at lunch time, honourable senators will have heard on the news about a housing display held in conjunction with the Civic Co-operative Permanent Building Society Ltd and the Housing Industry Association of Australia. It is a 15-house display, the largest ever in the Australian Capital Territory, and there is strong competition amongst builders to participate in it. A block in Mort Street changed hands just a week or so ago for more than $2m. These are significant facts that need to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> We, of course, have a fair idea of the Labor Party's attitude. The fact is that the Commonwealth Government's commitment to the Australian Capital Territory is clear. Senator Grimes interjects with parish pump just about every time I ask a question about the Australian Capital Territory, so the local electors can have a very fair idea of the attitude of the Labor Party to this community. Honourable senators may know that the shadow Minister for the Australian Capital Territory is also the shadow Minister for Defence. Defence, of course, is a most significant matter, yet the Australian Capital Territory portfolio is merely tacked on to it in the shadow ministry arrangements of the Labor Party. The Canberra Development Board has recognised the need for private sector development in the Australian Capital Territory and has identified higher technology and tourism as significant areas for development. It was this Government which invited the private sector to put up a submission on incentives to attract private enterprise to this community, and I think that should not be forgotten. In the last Budget the largest amount ever was allocated to the Australian Capital Territory Tourist Bureau to attract tourists. The effect of that campaign was very noticeable indeed, with an increased number of people in Canberra during the Easter period this year. The private sector is better organised in this Territory than it has ever been. It is investing in the community. More than ever there are things for tourists to do when they come to Canberra and more than ever there are things to encourage them to stay overnight in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to sport. Honourable senators may think that is not significant in this context, but I suggest it is, in that it creates tourism and jobs. The Australia Day sports carnival has been held for three consecutive years, this last year totally without Federal Government assistance. People who are familiar with these sorts of things commented most favourably on the organisation of it. In other areas we have the National Sports Centre-mainly occupied by the tenant, the Australian Institute of Sport-which is also used for major sporting activities. Perhaps I could tell honourable senators of the Mazda Cannons, the local basketball team playing in a national competitions at home and away; the Canberra Arrows, who play in the national soccer league; and the Canberra Raiders rugby team, which plays in a competition in New South Wales which is effectively, I think, a national competition. Canberra is coming of age. Sheffield Shield cricket matches were played here last summer. Honourable senators would all know that the International Amateur Athletic Federation World Cup meeting will be held in Canberra in 1985; not just because those teams decided to come here but because the Federation had put to it a proposal of such calibre, presenting to it facilities for sport in Canberra that the teams have chosen to come here instead of Tokyo, which was the other applicant city. To suggest that nothing is happening in the Australian Capital Territory is absurd. Some honourable senators may have enjoyed the performance of the opera Aida which was presented by the Canberra Opera Society in the National Sports Centre. That was no small feat for a community of this size. Again, some honourable senators may think that that is not relevant but I suggest that it gives an indication of the attitude, enthusiasm and morale of this community. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other businesses have opened in Canberra in recent times. I refer, for instance, to the $2m sawmill at the Hume industrial estate and the proposal by United American and Australasian Film Productions for a film studio which has already been referred to in this debate. The latter will bring to Canberra a great deal in the way of jobs and tourism and will be an added attraction to this city, apart from the skilled opportunities it will offer. I mention briefly the sale of the Belconnen Mall for those who are concerned about it. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) has said quite clearly that space is to be made available, as is proposed at present, for community groups and that a subsidy will be paid as it is currently paid. White Industries Limited has put forward a proposal for an international hotel containing a major convention centre, banqueting hall and other features which will leave the Glebe Park area largely untouched. That expression of interest is presently being considered by the Department with a view to future development in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> To suggest that nothing is happening in Canberra and that it is stagnating in the way that speakers in this debate have suggested is designed, I think, to mislead this community and deter the private sector from coming to Canberra and investing here. As a result of the activities of the present Minister, Canberra is now getting back $3m a year from the gambling activities of Victoria and New South Wales which take place in Canberra. It is a significant achievement by the Minister to have brought that revenue back here. We all know how involved he was in getting the film studio proposal brought to Canberra. We have been well served by our present Minister. The community has been well served also by the Liberal members of the House of Assembly who have been in the Assembly since its last election. The Minister has criticised the Assembly. Senator Ryan has said it is unsatisfactory. Mr Ellicott said it was not working. I think we all know why it has not worked. When the Labor Party was elected on the last occasion it chose to embark on a series of acts of confrontation. It in no sense understood the role of the Assembly as an advisory group to advise the Minister. It has no understanding whatever of what might be consensus in putting matters together which would be of benefit to the Minister. I think the failure of the Assembly lies firmly at the feet of the Labor Party and no doubt the same thing will continue in the future if it adopts the same attitude to the Australian Capital Territory as it has in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to make a statement concerning some aspects of the alleged social security conspiracy case which arose out of the debate in the Senate on 14 October last year and questions which have been asked of me in relation to the matter, particularly by Senator Grimes, and to incorporate the statement in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 14 October 1981, in the course of a debate on a matter of public importance raised by Senator Grimes, I said that I would try to get further information about proceedings that have been instituted in Greece against nine persons for alleged offences against the Australian Government in connection with what has come to be called the alleged social security conspiracy. I said also that I would consider making a statement to the Parliament about the matter. I confirmed my intention to make a statement in answer to a question without notice from Senator Grimes on 10 March. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Honourable senators will be aware that committal proceedings on charges of conspiracy are still in progress in Sydney against twenty defendants. Those proceedings resumed on 13 April 1982 when addresses on behalf of the defendants were commenced. It will be appreciated that we all need to be careful to ensure that nothing that is said in this House will prejudice in any way the fair conduct of the case in Sydney. Any reference to details of the allegations against any of the persons charged in Greece could be relevant to the charges of conspiracy before the court in Australia because those allegations concern similar conduct that is said to have taken place in Australia. Accordingly it would not be proper for me to discuss in any detail the evidence in relation to the persons charged in Greece. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. I now have available to me a good deal of material relating to the proceedings in Greece, much of which has come from the Australian Federal Police . I also believe that my Department has records of all material relevant to the proceedings in Greece that are obtainable from official sources in Greece. Against this background, may I outline the history of exchanges between Australian officials and officials of the Greek Government. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. In June and July 1978 and in January/February 1979 two officers of the then Commonwealth Police went to Athens and presented there requests for assistance in the investigation of a number of criminal matters in Australia. The first request for assistance was signed by the then Deputy Crown Solicitor, Sydney, in June 1978. On 24 January and 1 February 1979 I signed two other requests for assistance. The request for assistance stated that the Commonwealth Police desired to obtain information from nine named persons formerly residents of Australia who it was believed were involved in the alleged Social Security conspiracy and who were then residents of Greece. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. All nine of these persons have since been charged in Greece in respect of alleged breaches of Greek law committed in Australia. Senator Grimes has said that the requests for assistance were in fact requests to the Greek Government to charge on behalf of the Australian Government people whom the Australian Government could not extradite (Hansard page 1173). I categorically deny that the requests for assistance were made for the purpose attributed to them by Senator Grimes. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Reports by the officers of the Commonwealth Police who visited Greece in 1978 and 1979 make it clear that evidence was given on oath in Greece of the alleged complicity of persons named in the requests for assistance in the conspiracy in Australia. These reports also make it clear that copies of certain documents from Australia were taken to Greece and were given to the Greek police authorities. It was necessary that documents be given to those authorities so that they could carry out the investigations that had been requested to be made. It should be noted in this regard that it is not permissible for Australian police themselves to carry out investigations in Greece. It is necessary when investigations are sought to be made in Greece that they be made by the Greek police. I have obtained from the Australian Federal Police copies of documents written in the Greek language which appear to be partial records of the information given on oath to an examining officer of the Greek judicial system by the senior Australian police officer who went to Greece and these documents have been translated. The first of the documents appears to be a statement made on oath in Athens on 24 July 1978. That statement is, I believe, identical with parts of 'the second document' to which Senator Grimes referred in his statement to the Senate on 14 October 1981 (Hansard page 1173). Another document that has been translated is entitled 'Statement of an Examined Witness through an Interpreter' and purports to record in part a statement again made by the same officer in Greece on 13 February 1979. This document appears to be a copy of what Senator Grimes referred to as 'a Court report of the Court of the First Instance of 13 February 1979' (Hansard page 1173). </PARA>
<PARA> 7. I should say here that the documents that I was able to obtain through official channels relating to this case that are in Greek language appear to be incomplete. I therefore caused efforts to be made through the Australian Embassy in Athens to obtain a complete record of testimony given by the Australian police officer to Greek authorities. These efforts were not successful. I was informed that if testimony given by an Australian police officer in Greece was part of the investigation in that country it would be regarded as secret. Accordingly I took up an offer that Senator Grimes made in relation to the documents in his possession and obtained from him what appear to be complete records, in English, of the testimony given by the senior Australian police officer who went to Greece. Those records have been examined. There is nothing in that material to show that a request was made to the Greek authorities for proceedings to be taken against any person in Greece. Certainly nothing in the material that I have shows that any such request was made. It is true that the police officers who went to Greece were aware at all relevant times that persons resident in Greece could be charged under Greek law with offences in respect of things done in Australia. But they did not ask for proceedings to be taken. The testimony given in Greece was, I believe, given in connection with the examination of witnesses whom the Australian police had gone to Greece to interview. It seems clear that the evidence given in February 1979 was given because the Australian police officer was called before an examining magistrate and was required to give on oath an outline of the case to be presented in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. The fourth document referred to by Senator Grimes on 14 October 1981 is a report of the Council of Magistrates of Athens released on 2 May 1980. A copy of a similar document is also in my possession. The document that I have records an order of the Council of Magistrates that the nine persons named should be tried in Greece for offences consisting of conduct in Australia. It also orders the arrest of some of those nine persons. I understand that, of those arrested, all are now on bail and that none is in custody. Senator Grimes claims that all the evidence against those persons was evidence supplied by Australian Police. The documents themselves do not establish this. But even if it were true that the evidence relied upon by the Council of Magistrates was evidence that Australian police offices were required to give in Greece as part of their investigation of alleged offences in Australia, it does not follow that the proceedings in Greece were initiated by those police officers and still less by the Australian Government. It should be said here that it was the clear understanding of the Australian police officers concerned that the Greek authorities would not institute any proceedings in Greece against those of the nine persons named in the Australian requests for assistance who gave evidence in Australia and were indemnified against prosecution in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. I have reason to believe that the authorities in Greece may be under the impression that it was the wish of the Australian Government that the persons named in the Australian requests for assistance should be prosecuted in Greece. If that is the fact then there has been a misunderstanding of the purpose of the requests for assistance made by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. I turn now to the action that has been taken by the Australian Government in relation to the persons who have been charged in Greece. Special representations have been made on a number of occasions to the Greek Government about the fact that three of the persons who are being prosecuted in Greece have been indemnified or pardoned in Australia. The first of these representations was made on 8 September 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. On 30 October 1980 the court hearing the committal proceedings in Sydney was informed that the Crown had decided not to proceed with conspiracy charges against 111 defendants who had been charged with conspiracy, but in respect of whom committal proceedings had not been commenced. The Court was also informed that summonses for other substantive offences against the Crimes Act would be laid against those defendants in respect of whom evidence was available. In fact , summonses were issued against 73 of those defendants for the substantive offences against the Crimes Act. No further proceedings were instituted against the other 38 defendants who were discharged by the court on 14 November 1980. These matters were the subject of considerable publicity. I am confident that the Greek Embassy in Australia was aware of the developments. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Since October 1980 there have been at least six approaches by the Australian Government to the Greek Government or to the Greek officials about the proceedings in Greece. I have already informed the Senate of much of the action that I have taken. On 23 January 1981 I wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and asked that detailed advice which I provided as to the state of the proceedings in Sydney be passed on to the Greek Government. Due to a misunderstanding by the Department of Foreign Affairs this was not done. However , I wrote in June 1981 to the Minister for Justice in Greece about the case of the three persons who had been indemnified or pardoned in Australia. I also mentioned, in general terms, the fact that late in 1980 it was decided that the Crown would not proceed in Australia against some of the persons originally arrested in 1978. In December 1981, the then Acting First Assistant Crown Solicitor had discussions with the Ambassador of Greece about the matter. On 25 February 1982 a senior officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Crown Solicitor had further discussions with the Ambassador of Greece in the course of which it was made clear that the Australian Government does not request proceedings against any of the persons charged in Greece. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. The Australian Government has received a request for judicial assistance by way of supplying evidence from the investigating magistrate in Athens in relation to six of the persons who have been charged in Greece. We had been led to believe that such a request might be made because on 9 November 1981 officers of my Department learnt from unofficial sources that it was claimed that a request had already been sent early in 1981. A formal request was received in the Department of Foreign Affairs on 4 March 1982 and was forwarded to my Department on 19 March 1982. The Government has, now, informed the Greek Government through the Embassy of Greece that it cannot provide the assistance that has been requested. Two of the people to whom the request related have been indemnified against prosecution in Australia in respect of the matters for which they are under investigation in Athens. It is unlikely that the remaining four would now be facing any or any serious charges in Australia. The Government has informed the Greek Government that in all the circumstances it would be inconsistent with the attitude which the Government takes for it to provide the assistance that has been requested. We have welcomed the request for assistance because it has given us the opportunity to place formally before the judicial authorities in Greece the Australian Government's position in this matter. Hitherto we have had some difficulty in making our position known to the Greek judicial authorities through existing lines of communication. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. The latest information available in relation to the proceedings in Athens is that the matter is in the hands of the Investigating Magistrate appointed by the Public Prosecutor of the Court of Appeals. When the investigating magistrate has completed his inquiries he will report to the Council of Magistrates of the Court of Appeals which will decide whether any or all of the defendants will stand trial in Greece. It is not known when the investigating magistrate will complete his inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. In conclusion, I want to stress that the government has been at pains to ensure by any means at its disposal that its position is known to the Greek Government and to Greek authorities. We have done as much as I think it is possible to do to correct any misunderstandings that may have arisen about the position we take with respect to the proceedings in Greece. We will continue representations to the Greek authorities and will promote by whatever means are open to us an early and satisfactory conclusion to the proceedings in Greece. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make a few remarks on this matter. The statement arises out of a matter of public importance raised by me on behalf of the Opposition and repeated questions about the involvement of the Australian Government, directly or through its agents, in the charges which are laid in Greece against people accused of offending against Australian law in Australia. What happened was that in April 1978, two years after the original arrests were made in Sydney which led to what is known as the social security case, we noticed in the Sydney Daily Telegraph in May 1980 a report that nine persons had been indicted in an Athens court under Greek law on charges known as fraud against the Australian Government. We found that report disconcerting because at that time no person had been found guilty of these offences in Australia. That situation exists now. We were unaware of the fact that certain people had been given immunity from being charged in Australia and we were concerned later on also about the answers we got from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Minister for Social Security at that time regarding this case.</PARA>
<PARA> The charges that were laid in Greece were similar to those which were laid in the case in Australia. They involved the same incidents and some of the same characters, on both the defence and prosecution sides. The matter attracted my attention firstly because the charges were laid in Greece under Greek law for offences committed in Australia. This was something which we found unusual and later on disturbing. Secondly, we noted that three of the people charged were people who had been given immunity or who had been indemnified from being charged in Australia. Thirdly, the matter has been of concern because the vast majority of those people who were originally charged and arrested in Sydney have had the charges against them withdrawn. Fourthly, we believe that the statements made by the inspector in charge of the case, then Detective Inspector Thomas, and given to the Greek authorities were misleading and were outside the knowledge of the Attorney-General or the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr Newman). Finally, we believe those statements could have been construed by the Greek authorities only as statements of fact rather than allegations and that they could have been construed only as a request that charges be laid under Greek law. Bearing in mind all of those things, we do not believe that the statement put down today by the Attorney-General is a satisfactory one and we certainly do not think that it closes this case. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look at the statement page by page, although I realise I am not in a position to and should not hold up the Senate on this matter at the moment. Senator Durack, the Attorney-General, on page 2 of the statement first of all denies that the requests for assistance to the Greek authorities were made for the purposes of having these people charged in Greece. I suggest that that is true as far as the Attorney-General of this country is concerned. When he signed the request he may not have intended that it be used as a request for the purposes of having people charged under Greek law. I suggest that the evidence to which I referred in the matter of public importance, particularly the documents we got from Greece, shows that although the Attorney-General may not have thought that, Detective Inspector Thomas, as he was then, certainly thought that when he was the senior police officer in charge of what has been known as the conspiracy case or the social security case. He certainly believed that his job was to pursue people in this country and in Greece under Australian law and Greek law. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 4 of the statement the Attorney suggests that there is nothing in the material to show that a request was made to the Greek authorities for proceedings to be taken against any person in Greece. We know, for instance, that these documents are not a complete record of all meetings in Greece between Detective Inspector Thomas and the Greek authorities. But Detective Inspector Thomas was aware at the time that these people could be charged and his testimony to the Greek authorities, in documents which have been available to the Parliament and to the Attorney-General, does not only present the Crown case but also states as a fact that the people to whom he was referring were members of a conspiracy. I quote from the translation from the Greek record of the evidence given by Detective Inspector Thomas. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> These applications were based on false and bogus evidence supplied by a number of medical practitioners who had agreed to do so if the would-be applicants for an age or invalid pension agreed to pay . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The statements of the Detective Inspector were in this vein. They were not so couched as to imply that there were alleged offences. They were statements under oath containing assertions that it was a fact that these people had performed these illegal acts. They were taken by the Greek authorities as fact. This sworn evidence by Detective Inspector Thomas was the prime evidence, if not the only evidence, that was used to charge these people in Greece. </PARA>
<PARA> Detective Inspector Thomas was the agent of the Australian Government. He was sent to Greece with all the authority of the Australian Government, to produce this evidence. He produced it under oath, claiming to the Greek authorities that what he was saying was fact. Any reading of the documents that are now available about what happened in Greece can leave only this impression. Therefore the Greek authorities believed that they were dealing with someone who, in giving evidence under oath, was in fact stating facts. The evidence which was given in February 1979, we are told, was given because the police officer was called before an examining magistrate and was required to give on oath an outline of the case to be presented in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaving aside the question of whether Detective Inspector Thomas was called on or whether he offered his testimony, I point out that he was not requested to, and did not, give an outline of the case to be presented in Australia. He was stating under oath that certain things had happened and was giving evidence against these nine people. He was directly connecting them to a case which was proceeding in Sydney-a case which at that time had not been decided, which, I might point out, has not been decided now, and which, in view of the magistrate' s comments last week, may be some way from being decided. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 5 Senator Durack states:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes claims that all the evidence against those persons was evidence supplied by Australian Police. The documents themselves do not establish this. </PARA>
<PARA>They may not be the only documents. There may be other evidence. I suggest that if other evidence was used in Greece it is up to the Attorney-General to produce it. But in the absence of other evidence and after many months of seeking what evidence was used in Greece, I believe that we have all the evidence. I believe that the documents that are available to me, and, as far as I know, to the Attorney-General, do not present any other evidence. I do not believe that it was the clear understanding of the Australian police officers concerned that the Greek authorities would not institute any proceedings in Greece against these nine persons. I believe that it was the clear understanding of Detective Inspector Thomas and his colleagues that in fact what would happen would be that the Greek authorities would proceed in this way and that he was only too willing to assist them. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 5 of the circulated copy of his statement Senator Durack states:</PARA>
<PARA> I have reason to believe that the authorities in Greece may be under the impression that it was the wish of the Australian Government that the persons named in the Australian Requests for Assistance should be prosecuted in Greece. If that is the fact then there has been a misunderstanding of the purpose of the Requests for Assistance made by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that not only were the Greek authorities taking a reasonable approach when they interpreted the Australian request for assistance, associated as it was with the evidence of Detective Inspector Thomas, but also was there no other reasonable interpretation of what was going on at the time. A request came from the Australian Government naming nine people who had been involved in a conspiracy case along with 183 people in Australia. It was backed up by more detail and definite statements of their guilt by the senior police officer in the case, on oath, who knew at the most basic level that prosecutions along the same line could ensue in Greece; and that is what happened. There was no misunderstanding by the Greek Government. The so-called misunderstanding was a consequence of what I consider to be the misuse of the Australian request for assistance by a police officer at that time. That police officer, of course, is no longer in that police force. He is in legal practice now, while the people who were charged have been either discharged from the case, having suffered from their association with it, or are still, long years later, involved in a protracted court case. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 6 of Senator Durack's statement we find that the first action taken by the Australian Government was to make representations on behalf of the three people indemnified in Australia. But the Australian Government took this action in September, four months after the notification of the arrests had appeared in the Australian Press. These people had been given pardons but it took four months for the Government to put pen to paper or to organise a telex. There was no concern about the other people who had been charged, as to whether there had been a misunderstanding of the purpose of the request for assistance, though Greek Australians-most of them are Greek Australians-had been gaoled on the say so of a person who was then a police inspector. The whole matter was allowed to drift by by both the Government and the Attorney-General. We do not believe that this is satisfactory. We made several inquiries when the Parliament resumed in the Budget session. It may be that that is what led to the Australian Government taking the action that it took in September. </PARA>
<PARA> In paragraph 11 on page 6 of the printed copy of his speech, Senator Durack makes the point that the conspiracy charges were dropped against 111 defendants charged with conspiracy in Sydney, with no proceedings at all instituted against 38 of them. He then makes what I consider to be an astonishing remark, namely, that as these matters were the subject of considerable publicity he is:</PARA>
<PARA>confident that the Greek Embassy in Australia was aware of the developments. </PARA>
<PARA>As soon as these charges had been dropped, the Opposition, through me, asked Senator Durack, in this Parliament, about his responsibility to inform the Greek Government because of the relevance of this action to the overseas charges. It seems to me in light of this statement that he, in fact, did not do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I very much would like to know what the Attorney sees as his responsibility in such a situation. I suggest that his responsibility was more than to send Press cuttings across to the Greek Embassy or to draw the attention of the Greek Ambassador to what was in the Australian Press. I believe that it was his duty to send the complete statement of his understanding of how this affected the arrest of pensioners in Greece. It was his duty to reverse the so-called ' misunderstanding', as he now calls it, of the Greek Government of the request for assistance. It seems that he did not do so, and I find that extraordinary in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, on page 6, in paragraph 12, Senator Durack states that at least six approaches have been made by the Australian Government to the Greek Government or to Greek officials about the proceedings in Greece. I suggest that we need a full account of those proceedings if the Senate is ever to give any credence to Senator Durack's claim that he has taken proper action. One can only assume that his attitude to this matter has been, to say the least, casual. I suggest that the procrastination over answering questions as to what is going on in this case and the fact that we have had to drag information out of the Minister and the Government suggests that they believed that the whole thing would blow away. This case will not blow away in this country or in Greece and we should not allow it to do so. If we look at page 6 of the ministerial statement it seems that this matter was compounded by the fact that, although Senator Durack, as Attorney-General, wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 23 January and asked for detailed advice as to the state of proceedings in Sydney to be sent to the Greek Government through the Department of Foreign Affairs this was not done . On page 7 of the ministerial statement we find these words:</PARA>
<PARA> Due to a misunderstanding by the Department of Foreign Affairs this was not done. </PARA>
<PARA>This case is full of misunderstandings. We have the Greek authorities misunderstanding the nature of the request for assistance from the Australian Government and we have the Department of Foreign Affairs in this country misunderstanding something in this regard. So no details were sent from the Attorney-General of this country to the Greek authorities while nine people who were citizens of this country, three of whom had been indemnified, were under charge and in goal in Greece. Whose responsibility is this? I suggest that it is the Government's responsibility. The Government had a responsibility to look after these people who were Australian citizens and who had been residents of this country. The record of this sorry case is that the Government took no interest. On page 7 of this statement we find also these words:</PARA>
<PARA> I wrote in June 1981 to the Minister for Justice in Greece about the cases of the three persons who had been indemnified . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General referred to the others only in general terms. Not until 25 February 1982, 21 months after the arrests in Athens, did the Crown Solicitor make it clear that the Australian Government did not request proceedings against any of those persons charged in Greece. The alleged misunderstanding happened 21 months earlier but the Government was prepared to allow imprisonment, followed by monthly reporting to the police and fear among the arrested pensioners about what was to happen to them, without lifting a finger to say to the Greek authorities: 'We never intended these arrests to happen. We did not request that these proceedings go ahead'. According to the Attorney-General that was the misunderstanding of the Greek Government-a misunderstanding for which, I suggest , one certainly cannot blame the Greek Government in view of the nature of the request and the manner in which it was made by the police officer. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1981 the Government learnt from unofficial sources that it was to be asked for evidence-an obvious move which I raised when I initially questioned the Attorney-General about this matter. The Government has now informed the Greek Government that it cannot provide such assistance. Nearly two years after the arrests the Government has only now clarified its wish not to get embroiled in the Athens case-it should not be embroiled-and then only after it had decided that it probably would not have proceeded against four of the persons concerned and could not have proceeded against those with indemnities. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Attorney-General in hoping that there will be an early and satisfactory conclusion to the proceedings that are going on in Greece. But I suggest that there could have been an earlier and more satisfactory conclusion if it had not been for the half-hearted and casual approach of the Government in this matter. The Attorney-General complained about the difficulty of making the Government's position known to the Greek judicial authorities through the existing lines of communication. We have close associations with Greece. Greek migrants have been coming to Australia since the early part of the last century. We surely have some knowledge about Greek judicial procedures. We surely have lines of communication with Greece, if we have lines of communication with any community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell the honourable senator what has happened. We on the Opposition were so disturbed about what was going on over there that we obtained documents from the Greek courts. We got them out here and had them translated at our expense to find out just what was going on. It was only then that any action was taken. Detective Inspector Thomas had no difficulty in making his position known when he visited Greece with his request for assistance. He ended up in the Greek courts giving evidence on oath stating that certain things had happened in Australia. In this country those same people had been charged but most of them had not been in the courts at all. He went over to Athens twice as the representative of this Government. He went over there and gave totally unsubstantiated evidence under oath in 1978 and 1979.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that the Government had all the time in the world to set right the alleged misunderstanding that arose after Detective Inspector Thomas made his statements on oath. The Government sent Detective Inspector Thomas to Greece twice. I believe that it should have sent other officers to Greece twice, particularly officers who could speak Greek and who had some knowledge of the Greek judicial system. There are plenty of Greek-Australian lawyers in this country who have knowledge of that system. The Government simply has not cared, as it had not cared all along in this case. In excess of $7m has been expended on this case in Australia alone. It would have cost only a few thousand dollars more to deal with this so-called misunderstanding by the Greek Government that arrested nine people in Greece. Those people have been in a state of uncertainty ever since. The Australian Government has created great difficulties not only for those nine people but also for other Greek-Australians in Greece who have Australian pensions. When the Minister refers to promoting whatever means are open to us to sort this matter out, I suggest those means should include the despatch of a senior officer to Athens to talk to the Greek authorities, to put the Government's new-found belief that the charges against these people in Greece under Greek law for offences they committed in Australia under Australian law should be dropped. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Attorney-General has the clear conscience that he says he has on all of these matters I suggest that he should not object to my request that all the representations that have been made to the Greek authorities on this matter should be tabled in this Parliament. This case has been dragging on since 1978. All the questions raised-I will not put them as accusations-in this Parliament by the Opposition about the conduct of the case in Australia and the conduct of the case in Greece have been initially denied by the authorities in Australia but in every instance they have been demonstrated to be true. I believe that in the long run there will be a proper investigation of what happened from April 1978 until now. In the long run this case will demonstrate that authorities, even under our law, will not be able to discriminate against people in the way in which they have just because they happen to be of a different nationality. The Opposition will not let this matter rest; nor will the Greek-Australian citizens of this country. We will not be fobbed off by statements such as this, well meaning as they may be. I think it is time that the Attorney-General and other people really had a look at the behaviour of the officials and the authorities involved in this case so that we have no repetition of it in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the amendments made by the House of Representatives be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>When the Crimes Amendment Bill was before the Senate last year the provisions, as set out in the original Bill, dealing with the enforcement of fines were significantly altered by amendments moved by Senator Evans. At the time I questioned whether the new provisions would be workable. Since then, and before the matter had been dealt with in the House of Representatives, some quite strong complaints were received by me from three State Attorneys-General as to the additional work that would be created for State officers and judicial officers involved in the enforcement of fines imposed for Commonwealth offences and possible confusion due to the different procedures applying to Commonwealth and State matters. I have had it strongly pressed on me that these matters should be considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of this the Government accepted that it would be desirable for the Standing Committee to examine the need for changes in the procedures for the enforcement of fines, both Commonwealth and State, and the form that the procedures should take. I will formally ask the Standing Committee at its next meeting to undertake this task. The object will be to examine whether the existing procedures in the States are adequate, whether any changes in their laws are desirable, having regard of course to the matters that have been the subject of debate in this Parliament. However, that is going to take some time. There are a number of important reforms in this Bill, apart from the enforcement of fines. That was only one aspect of a number of proposed reforms. The Government believes that we should not delay in giving effect to the other reforms in the Bill on which there is widespread agreement in this Parliament and, I think, outside it. </PARA>
<PARA> So as to give effect to handling the problem in this way, the Government has moved to delete from the Bill the clauses which had been objected to so strongly by some State Attorneys and with which the Government itself had, on some aspects, some difficulty as well. The Government accepts that the present procedures for enforcement of fines require review to ensure that they are fair and reasonable to those who are affected and also that there ought to be uniformity in these matters throughout Australia. When the Standing Committee of Attorneys has completed the examination of the matter the Government of course will introduce any legislation that may be required to give effect to the Committee's conclusions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not oppose these amendments which have come to us from the House of Representatives but I cannot pretend that we take that stance with any spirit of enthusiasm. The measure, as Senator Durack has said, has had something of a chequered history. When the Bill was originally introduced in the Senate and debated in full on 21 October last year we supported it very strongly, based as it was on an interim report dated January 1980 of the Australian Law Reform Commission on sentencing, because it implemented, at least partially, some of the more urgent recommendations arising out of that report. We were very happy to see on the statute book, and did in fact regard as very long overdue, provisions setting guidelines for judges in the imposition of sentences of imprisonment and a whole series of other provisions facilitating in various ways the imposition of non-custodial sentences for offenders against Federal law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When this matter was debated last October we were, however, concerned that some recommendations that were equally as urgent and equally as important as those which the Government had picked up had been omitted from the Bill and we did seek to make certain additions to the Bill to pick up those recommendations in particular in relation to the subject matter of the imposition of gaol terms following default, that is the failure to pay fines which had been imposed. In particular we sought through the addition of proposed new section 18C a provision which was designed to ensure that imprisonment really was the last resort in situations in which an offender originally fixed with a fine proved unable in fact to pay that fine. The nub and substance of the provision, which I understand Senator Haines will have a little more to say about in a moment, essentially was to provide for further flexibility in the courts so that time to pay could be granted where the further interests of justice demanded or suggested it and so that, I repeat, imprisonment really was a last resort. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment that was embodied in proposed new section 18C was essentially fairly small in compass but it did round out the original scheme of the legislation and eventually the Government was persuaded, with a little help from this side and from the Australian Democrats, to that point of view. However, apparently so far as some of the States were concerned this was the straw to break the camel's back. They have reacted in a rather unhappy way, I think, to what they perceive to be the administrative burdens being imposed upon them not only by proposed new section 18C but also by a companion provision, proposed new section 18B which also deals with applications for further time to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> It is more in a spirit of sorrow than in anger that I record that the New South Wales Government-a Labor government though it may be-seemed to be the first to make these objections. I might hasten to add that it did not do so on the ground of principle but on the ground of administration because of the burdens which would be imposed upon a hard pressed court system. It was only a matter of time, of course, before other States leapt into the fray following the yodel that emerged from Attorney-General Walker. As I understand it, Queensland and South Australia have been among the more intransigent of those insisting that there are difficulties here that cannot be immediately overcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Senator Durack will be pleased to know that States' rights are alive and well even in the most radical of our States. I simply hope, on this as on many other issues, that considerations of national convenience and the interests of the Australian citizens at large will ultimately prevail. The question then became, given these objections, whether the passage of this Bill should in its final form await the further consideration of these matters to which the Attorney-General had adverted. The Attorney-General discussed the matter with me. I was obliged to agree, given the notorious lethargy of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General-not that I am suggesting that the Attorney put the proposition to me in quite those terms-that it would be better to proceed and get on the statute book and into operation those very many parts of the legislation which could have an immediate impact in improving and civilising the standards of criminal justice in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Might I say further in that respect that I do wish to correct the impression that was given by one of our speakers on this Bill in the House of Representatives that there had been no consultation by the Attorney-General with me as to at least one part of the amendment that now comes back to us. There was some misunderstanding in this respect at a staff level as a result of my own failure, which I readily acknowledge, to fully communicate the substance of the discussion which I had with the Attorney-General. It must be acknowledged that the Attorney has endeavoured to secure the acceptance of the Bill in its original form but has run into dificulties. As a matter of common sense it does seem to be the way to handle the matter; that is, to send the controversial parts of the Bill off to the Standing Committee but not to delay the passage of that which can, in fact, go through. I do hope that we will get a sensible review of this whole question from the Standing Committee. I do hope that we will get a satisfactory solution to this problem. I do hope that the neuroses of various kinds that have been expressed by the States will come to be, after further consideration, assuaged. I do hope that we will have further legislation reincorporating these provisions and perhaps some more like them later this year . </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I note that a further report is due in 1983 from the Australian Law Reform Commission on the balance of its sentencing reference. I suppose we could wait until then-the way this place and the Government tend to operate I fear that it may be that we will wait until then-to get these provisions back into the statute book. I hope that delay does not occur. The law of sentencing is already notoriously piecemeal. That situation has been made worse by the removal from this legislation of some important and central provisions in the scheme of sentencing justice that was there proposed. The lesson-if we can learn any lessons in this area from the performance of the courts and the legislatures in the last several decades-is that sentencing reform cannot really be achieved in a piecemeal way if the objectives of uniformity and consistency, and the policy objective of priority to non-custodial sentences, are to be achieved. I hope that the difficulties that have arisen with this legislation can be resolved by good will and further consultation. It is in that spirit that I indicate-again, as I said, with not much enthusiasm but for the reasons I have outlined-that the Opposition will not oppose these amendments which have the effect of significantly emasculating the Bill in the form in which it left this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Evans has already pointed out , on 21 October last year the Senate passed, among others, several amendments moved by Senator Evans which aimed to amend the Government's Crimes Amendment Bill 1981 to provide that imprisonment did not automatically follow the non- payment of a fine. Instead the court was to have to satisfy itself that 'the offender had the means to pay the fine and wilfully refused to pay it'. Where this was not the case the court could, under proposed section 18C (4), reduce the amount of the fine, give the offender more time to pay or vary the punishment. As Senator Evans has already pointed out, these amendments were supported by the Australian Democrats but not by the Government. They were based on recommendations made by the Australian Law Reform Commission in a substantial interim report which it brought down in January 1980. The report was prepared under the leadership of Mr Justice Kirby, assisted by Professor Duncan Chappell. The report dealt with a large number of matters but specified non-custodial options associated with fining, which is the subject of Senator Evans's amendments, as one of the two most urgent areas of reform. I refer the Senate to page 105 of the interim report which, in paragraph 160 entitled 'De- institutionalisation', states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To sentence a person to imprisonment is to order him to be deprived of his liberty by confinement. In our form of society, the deprivation of freedom is one of the severest methods of punishments we can employ. Moreover, it is widely held, and the quotations above reflect this, that imprisonment is in many ways an unsatisfactory form of punishment. This view is shared by the Commission. Neither the history of the use of imprisonment nor contemporary research lends any support to the persistent belief that the use of imprisonment leads to the diminution of crime either by way of deterrence or rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA>I would imagine that that statement was predominantly behind four of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's report, specifically No. 31, which is entitled 'Guidelines for Use of Imprisonment', and Nos 32, 33 and 34 under the heading 'Non-payment of Fines'. Recommendation No. 31 of the Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA> A law of the Commonwealth should be enacted specifying the general criteria which a court sentencing a Federal offender shall take into account before imposing a sentence of imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA>Then the report lists three criteria that ought to be considered. Recommendation No. 32 refers to the non-payment of fines and makes the statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Where a court is satisfied that an offender has wilfully and without just excuse failed to pay a fine imposed in respect of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, the court may order that the offender be imprisoned. In all other cases, the court should have the power to extend the time specified for the payment of the fine, to adjust the level of the fine, or award punishment other than imprisonment as is appropriate in the circumstances of the case. </PARA>
<PARA>No. 33 goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from general criteria, more detailed guidelines are required if the use of imprisonment in Federal cases is to be limited to appropriate circumstances and put on a rational, principled, consistent and uniform basis. Such guidelines should be developed by the Sentencing Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, recommendation 34 makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA> The so called 'short, sharp shock' use of imprisonment should be discouraged by Commonwealth law. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet despite these recommendations the Government chose in the other place to delete the amendments which this chamber had passed. During the Committee stage debate in the other place, the Minister representing the Attorney-General, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Viner, said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a question as to whether the new provisions are workable. Apart from this, strong complaints have been received by the Government from a number of State Attorneys-General as to the additional work that would be created for State officers involved in the enforcement of fines for Commonwealth offences and as to possible confusion and inefficiency due to different procedures applying in Commonwealth and State matters. </PARA>
<PARA>So clearly, as Senator Evans has already pointed out, at the first sign of objection from the States-not all of which, I might add, are noted for their reformist zeal or even for their payment of strict attention to the principle of civil liberties-the Federal Government was prepared to back off, leaving yet another area of law reform abandoned. Mr Viner went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Suggestions have been made that the matter should be considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Having regard to the matters raised by State Attorneys-General, the Government accepts that it would be desirable for the Standing Committee to examine the need for changes in procedures for the enforcement of fines, both Commonwealth and State, and the form that the new procedures should take. Therefore, the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) will ask the Standing Committee to examine this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>One is forced to wonder why originally in 1978 the Attorney-General referred the whole question of sentencing Federal offenders to the Law Reform Commission if the Government proposed simply to ignore the recommendations that the Commission made, or send them to yet another standing committee. I agree that some uniformity in the law is desirable, but for the life of me I cannot see why, because one or two States complain, we should immediately retreat to the lowest common denominator. I cannot understand why the Commonwealth cannot accept its responsibility to lead and to implement the work of the Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely it is time we got away from what appear to be the last vestiges of Dickensian attitudes to incarceration under which, as those honourable senators who have studied any history at all would know, people were tossed into gaol simply because they were poor. Thereby any possibility that they might have of getting themselves out of that predicament was neatly severed. Although at the moment we do not make permanent incarceration for failure to pay a fine, it is nonethless absurd that gaol is seen as an alternative at all unless-as was made a specific exception under the clause-failure to pay is wilful. I appreciate that the Senate does not need a lecture from me or anybody else on the failure of the penal system to rehabilitate criminals, or the tendency of a period in goal, however short, to harden rather than diminish the anti-social attitudes of wrong-doers, particularly of the young. The Law Reform Comission has devoted a considerable amount of space in the interim report to canvassing just that issue . So I am at a loss to understand not only why the Government cannot see its way clear to offer a reformist lead to the States but also why the Opposition is not pursuing the matter. I would have thought that it warranted more than simply an expression in another place by Mr Lionel Bowen of disappointment on the part of the Australian Labor Party that the Government was not prepared to accede to the amendments that had been passed in the Senate. I repeat, the Australian Democrats supported the principle behind the amendments last year and, indeed, do so again. Unfortunately, the five of us are powerless to implement anything at all in this place without the support of one of the other major parties, so there is precious little point in our pursuing the amendments that were deleted in another place. All I intend to do at the moment is indicate that we do not accept that the provisions made under the amendments are 'not workable'. We do accept the need for the amendments, as they stand, in a spirit of law reform and simple humanitarianism. Finally, we ask that the Minister move expeditiously to refer the matter to a Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and hope, with some justification we trust, that that Committee will do its work as quickly as possible and make suitable recommendations for changes in the law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then the debate will cover those two measures. Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) provides, under certain conditions, for access to Australian Taxation Office income records of individuals for the purpose of law enforcement and extends access to those records to an additional government department. The Department referred to in the Bill is the former Department of Housing and Construction. I am not sure what procedures are required following the dismemberment of that Department which has taken place since the Bill was passed by the House of Representatives. I do not know whether it is necessary to move a minor amendment to change the wording or whether it can be done by regulation. Whatever the outcome, the section of the bureaucracy which has replaced the Department of Housing and Construction will have access to tax records of individuals for the purpose of administering the taxation rebate for people who fairly recently took out the housing loans which were provided as an election stunt just before the Victorian elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3), in its original form, did no more than exempt the company Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd, which is to be established, from income taxation. But on 6 May the Government added to the Bill an amendment which was actually relevant to access to confidential records of the Australian Taxation Office and therefore ought to have been included in Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2). However, that Bill had been passed in the House of Representatives on the previous night. The amendment made to Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3) was, in fact, suggested by the Opposition. It restricted access to confidential taxation records to circumstances in which there was reason to believe that the person concerned was guilty of a crime punishable by six months' imprisonment or more. The Opposition also sought in the House of Representatives to require the approval of both Houses of the Parliament before law enforcement officers would have access to confidential taxation records. That section of the proposed amendment was not accepted by the Government, but subsequently will be moved by Senator Evans at the Committee stage in the Senate. I repeat, the Bill includes part of a proposed amendment which stipulated the conditions under which access to the confidential records of individuals would be made available. Again, I say that that provision ought to have been a part of Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2). The Opposition will seek to amend further Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3). </PARA>
<PARA> This untidy and, I must say, highly confusing procedure, is a function of the indecent haste with which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wound up the House of Representatives in the first week of May. He was, of course, eager to take off on the tourist circuit yet again. The Prime Minister was also fearful of keeping the Parliament sitting when it could be closed down, because a sitting parliament provides a forum for the ventilation of contemporary scandals , to which this Government is extraordinarily prone. We saw in the Senate today yet another example of the way in which the Parliament can be used to ventilate scandals involving senior Ministers of this Government and to extract information which would not be likely to be extracted if Parliament were not sitting. The Government, of course, had it had the numbers, would have closed down the Senate by now. Therefore, the disclosures pertaining to the misuse of Reserve Bank of Australia money by certain dairy companies and further evidence of maladministration in this industry, for which Mr Nixon is responsible, would not have been disclosed if the Government had had its way. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to speak at length on the access to confidential information requirements of Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982. The purpose of the amendments is partly to clamp down on tax dodging. Indeed, it was prompted by the requests or urgings from the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and by the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. But as well as being a minor weapon in the arsenal opposing the anti-tax dodging arsenal, more importantly perhaps the intention of the amendment is to give law enforcement officers access to personal tax records in the belief that such information will help to secure convictions for offences not related to breaches of the taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, as far as the tax avoidance or tax dodging elimination content is concerned, it is a very minor weapon. The crucial weapon to be used in any effective crackdown on tax avoidance is, of course, the credible threat of retrospective legislation, which is a policy that the Australian Labor Party alone, of all the political groups represented in this Parliament, has. Only the Labor Party is serious about stamping out tax evasion and tax avoidance. Therefore, only the Labor Party can secure the substantial tax reductions for all honest taxpayers which would be made possible by an effective crackdown on tax avoidance. After a Labor government is elected some time in the next 18 months, I eagerly anticipate the first piece of legislation being introduced into the Senate to do just that; that is, to crack down on anti-social tax avoidance. In advance, I throw down the challenge to whichever members of the Australian Democrats may still be in the Parliament at that time and to Senator Harradine who, barring double dissolutions, will still be in the Parliament at that time, either to support that legislation or to face a double dissolution election arising from it. I cannot think of any issue on which I would be happier to fight a double dissolution election against the ditherers in this Parliament than legislation to crackdown on tax avoidance in the only way in which it can effectively be done and in the simplest way in which it can be done . </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the Income Tax Assessment Bill (No. 2), as I mentioned earlier, implements the Government's policy on tax rebates for certain classes of people who have housing loans. This was announced in a sort of desperate last -minute bid to save the Liberal Government of Victoria from the crushing defeat which it subsequently suffered. It provides for a rebate of $500 to a couple in the first year after a housing loan has been taken out. This is reduced by $100 in each of the next four succeeding years. If the couple in question have children, an additional $200 is added to the tax rebate for which the couple, or the principal taxpayer, will qualify. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not oppose that provision, but it would be remiss of me if I failed to mention that, welcome no doubt though that pittance may be to a limited number of people who hold housing loans, it falls very far short of compensating for the massive increases in interest rates which have occurred under this Government in the last couple of years. I cite some specific examples . If a loan for $40,000 were taken out in March 1980, the increases in interest rates which have occurred since that time would have added more than $21 more to the repayments than will be provided by this Bill. That applies to a couple without children. A couple with dependent children who took out a loan of $40, 000 in March 1980, even after the adjustment for the rebate provided for in this bill, will be worse off by over $17 a week because of the massive increases in interest rates that have occurred in that two-year or 26-month period. A couple who took out a loan for the same amount, $40,000, in March 1981, after adjustment for this rebate and for increases in interest rates, will be more than $6 a week worse off. A couple who took out a loan of $40,000 14 months ago, after the necessary adjustments have been made, will still be $2.30 a week worse off. So, this Bill provides for almost nobody complete compensation for the massive increase in interest rates of the last couple of years and the consequential increase in monthly housing loan repayments. On behalf of the Opposition I now move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2):</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Bill contains insufficient safeguards to ensure that access to tax records is not abused, and-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that appropriate amendments will be moved in the Committee stage, by Senator Evans and not by me. The amendment to the motion for the second reading continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Bill fails to provide adequate compensation to Australian home buyers for the massive increase in interest repayments over the last 2 years'. </PARA>
<PARA>I have demonstrated the evidence to support the second proposition. I will move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1982, but I understand that, procedurally, that should be done at a later stage. That Bill contains an amendment, which was added as an afterthought by the Government, stipulating the conditions under which access to private taxation records will be made available to law enforcement officers. Disregarding that, it is a Bill to provide the Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd with exemption from income tax. It is a Bill that takes us right back to the razor gang farce of 30 April last year. The razor gang exercise was Malcolm Fraser's 1981 stunt to divert attention from the sorry mess his Government had made of the Australian economy, and of Australian society. Of course the 1982 stunt was the grand plan for world economic recovery, launched a couple of weeks ago when the Prime Minister of Australia, who is shown by the objective statistical record to be one of the dunces in the class of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, promoted himself to lecturer. </PARA>
<PARA> Even allowing for the fact that the razor gang exercise of last year was primarily a stunt with a few silly decisions tacked on to it, this particular decision was almost unbelievably stupid. It was a decision to sell off to the private sector, so the Government said, the Australian Wool Testing Authority which had operated for some 25 years as a subsidiary initially of the Australian Wool Board and later of the Australian Wool Corporation, both of which were statutory authorities. The Australian Wool Testing Authority provided objective tests of clean wool content, average fibre diameter, vegetable fault and a number of other characteristics of wool quality which determine its commercial value and which can be objectively measured. It was an organisation with an unquestioned reputation for technical competence and integrity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he is. He is a former wool grower. He is probably still a wool producer but I am not certain of that. He was active in farmer politics and I think it would be fair to say that he was fairly well respected in farmer politics as at least being a man with a keen mind. I will refer to some of his references to this matter. On 14 May last year, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of farmer organisations and a number of branches of the Liberal Party of Australia which are aware of country problems--</PARA>
<PARA>Unlike the clumsy marauders of the razor gang-</PARA>
<PARA>have opposed the proposal to sell the Australian Wool Testing Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>By 4 June last year he had toughened his attitude up a bit and, in relation to the razor gang decision to sell the Australian Wool Testing Authority, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I can assure honourable members that there was no consultation-I have checked on this very closely-with the Australian Wool Council, which has followed on from the Australian Wool Industry Conference. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the grower organisation. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> There was very little, if any, discussion with the Australian Wool Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>When the Bill now before the Senate was being passed by the House of Representatives on 6 May this year Mr Bungey spoke very briefly on the Bill's second reading and expressed his opposition to it, on these grounds:</PARA>
<PARA> First, I believe tax exemption to a private company is completely undesirable. It sets a precedent which should not be set . . . My second reason for opposing both the Bill and the amendment is that the present wool testing arrangements are more than satisfactory and no change is required. Thirdly, additional wool testing costs will be imposed on wool growers because of the cosmetic changes proposed by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I think Mr Bungey raised a valid point when he said that the precedent of granting tax exemption to what is supposed to be a private company is a bad precedent to set. But of course in no sense is the Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd a private company except in the cosmetic sense. It is a fiction; it is a cosmetic edifice constructed to hide the embarrassment of this Government for having been stupid enough to accept the recommendations of the razor gang in the first place. This legislation is a farce and although I have some sympathy with Mr Bungey's view that the precedent of tax exemption for a private company, or a cosmetically private company, is a precedent that should not be set, the opposition will not oppose the Bill to grant it tax exemption because it should not have been a private company and in no sense, other than in the most technical legal sense, is it a private company now. </PARA>
<PARA> The razor gang in general and this decision in particular reflect very badly on the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, and the Minister for Finance, Senator Guilfoyle, both of whom were members of the razor gang committee. This decision demonstrates perhaps more clearly than any other single decision the sloth and negligence with which they approached their task, their ignorance of the subject matter with which they were dealing and their irresponsibility in making such recommendations. The reason for the recommendation appears to have been that the Government thought it could liquidate the Authority and claim its assets of $12m or thereabouts. It then found that it could not do that. Does that not tell us a great deal about the sloth and negligence with which these two Ministers and others approached their task? The Government, having found that it could not collect the $12m which it thought it could, did not do the sensible thing and drop the whole silly proposal but stumbled and fumbled along for a full year and then produced this cosmetic and completely unnecessary piece of legislation. Hence we go through this charade today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that Senator Guilfoyle, who assiduously promotes the idea that she is extremely competent, has lying around so many monuments to her incompetence. The notorious Greek social security conspiracy case, which was the subject of a statement earlier today by Senator Grimes, which has cost the taxpayers of Australia more than $7m and which has caused a great deal of anguish to a number of innocent people living in Australia and overseas, is one of the monuments to Senator Guilfoyle's competence. As Minister for Social Security, she initiated that case and those unsuccessful prosecutions. As Minister for Social Security, she also presided over the substitution of an income test for the means test for pensions in 1976. The Government has spent the last five years trying to work out how to get itself out of that hole. </PARA>
<PARA> In a debate in the Senate on 18 November last year, Senator Guilfoyle authoritatively stated that it was essential for primary producers to even out their taxable incomes through the use of income equalisation deposits in order to avoid the tax penalty which would otherwise be applied. By stabilising taxable income in that way, they incur a penalty; they do not avoid it. She is supposed to be one of the competent Ministers of this Government. The mind boggles at what the incompetent Ministers must be like. Far from being correct, she was precisely incorrect. The truth was the complete opposite of what she had asserted. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, as Senator Guilfoyle's crowning glory, we had her participation as a key member of the razor gang committee which produced this stupid recommendation to sell off an efficient body operating without causing any trouble to anyone and, consequently, the charade of this silly and unnecessary piece of legislation in the Senate this afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) and Income Tax Assessment (Amendment) Bill (No. 3) which, between them, seek to do three things. They seek, first, to give royal commissions and, through them, the Attorney-General's Department-and through that Department, the Australian Federal Police-access to certain tax records of people who the Commissioners believe may have committed serious crimes. Secondly , these Bills attempt to implement the Government's housing package, which was announced shortly before the Victorian election. Thirdly, these Bills seek to change the title of the Australian Wool Testing Authority to the Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats support both of these Bills. We have reservations about them, in that in many areas they do not go anywhere near far enough. But it is vital that both of these Bills receive a speedy passage. The Labor Party has just circulated in this chamber three sets of amendments-two sets to be moved at the second reading stage and a third set to be moved in Committee. I have sat here in absolute amazement listening to Senator Walsh accuse the Democrats and Senator Harradine of being soft on tax evaders. At the same time, he is prepared to move in this chamber an amemdment in Committee on these two Bills which, if passed-if the Democrats supported the Labor amendment in Committee-would delay the Bills at least until the Budget session. We are not prepared to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also not prepared to support Labor's amendments to the second reading stage, although these are in a form which if agreed to would not delay the Bill. They request two quite separate things. Firstly, they raise the point that the Australian Wool Testing Authority should not receive tax exemption. I shall speak on that subject at length, but I believe that that is a fairly minor matter. More importantly, the amendments cover two other aspects which, as far as we can see, are in conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that insofar as the legislation affects the secrecy provisions of income tax, it has already been amended by the Government in Committee in the Lower House. I shall explain that in greater detail later. We believe that in the Government's help to the housing industry and its rebate on housing interest rates it has not gone far enough, but at least it has made a start. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the three provisions of these two amending Bills in detail. Firstly, as to the provision that addresses itself to interest rates on home loans, we commend the Government for initiating the rebate scheme for housing, but it has not gone anywhere near far enough. The effect of sky-rocketing interest rates is placing an appalling burden on the section of the community that this Government, or any government, should seek first to protect, and should go out of its way to protect. I refer to the family unit, to the single income family, that is seeking to build a house and start a family. Sky- rocketing interest rates have caused enormous hardships to this section of the community. The Government's initiative through the rebate scheme only touches the sides of the problem. It does not address the basic issue. A one per cent increase in interest rates effectively raises mortgage repayments by 7 per cent. This is the basic problem. The Government must attack high interest rates overall if the economy is to be revived and if the burden placed on the family is to be alleviated. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Democrats support the initiative as far as it has gone, we are committed to an entirely different approach to housing and the management of interest rates. But we shall support this package as a step on the road to recovery and alleviating the problems of hard pressed home owners and future home buyers. My colleague, Senator Haines, will elaborate at much greater length on the problems of sky-rocketing home loan interest rates when the other parts of the Government's package are introduced into the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn now to the secrecy provisions of the income tax legislation. The Government's response to the request of the Royal Commission on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union in relation to access to taxation records must be welcomed. The means by which these Bills were passed in the House of Representatives and the means by which certain amendments were covered deserve some comment. The Labor Party raised the question of confidentiality and the Government took this aboard. As I understand it, amendments were moved to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3), which deals with the question of the Australian Wool Testing Authority, amendments which related to secrecy of income tax information. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government picked up one of the Labor amendments, and we now believe that the question of secrecy has been covered adequately. I must express wonderment at the ingenuity of whoever thought of this idea. Perhaps honourable senators will forgive me if I express hope that it does not become a regular practice of this Government to amend Acts by amending Bills to amend amending Bills. Essentially, that is what happened. If we are all a little confused, that is the reason. Under the provisions of these Bills the Attorney- General may not now disclose information he may be given by a royal commission except for the purposes of communicating it to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police who is then subject to the secrecy requirements. Rather curiously-at least on its face value-such information communicated to the Australian Federal Police in accordance with the provision of the Act cannot be used in court proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The intention clearly is to alert Federal Police to some wrong doing and to leave it to them to try to catch the criminals. We point out that this is at least a start, although it should be noted that many other countries that cherish democratic principles as much as we do in Australia have seen fit to allow their governments to give tax information to their police forces and to co -operate very closely with police in the fight against organised crime. Most honourable senators will be aware that the infamous criminal Al Capone was eventually arrested, tried and convicted of tax evasion-simply that and nothing else-because no other charge laid against him would stick. It seems to us to be a travesty that in Australia the community cannot be assured that Australian Al Capones will not be dealt with similarly. In other words, we believe there is a lot of room for further investigation by the Government into this matter of co- operation between the Taxation Office and the Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> One way in which this would be achieved-I put it to the Senate now as a suggestion-would be by swearing in a small number of Treasury agents with special police powers. Recent comments by the Commissioner of Taxation to the effect that he was not prepared to order his officers into a situation in which their lives could be placed in jeopardy highlighted the difficulty that currently exists. Police cannot get tax information which may lead to the conviction of criminals of all sorts. Tax agents are not equipped to operate as policemen. One possibility would be to set up a small squad. For lack of a better name we could call its members Treasury police. These people would be Treasury agents with at least some police powers. However the Government addresses itself to this problem we believe there is an urgent need for greater co-operation between the Department of the Treasury and the Australian Federal Police. Australian Al Capones can be dealt with effectively by no other means. </PARA>
<PARA> These two Bills also relate to the Wool Testing Authority. Senator Walsh dealt with this matter at some length. I must say that on this occasion I agree with him entirely. The Government has turned a complete 180 degrees, without any doubt. The razor gang said that we can do without a Wool Testing Authority or, at least, that it would get rid of it to private enterprise. This obviously was an ill-conceived initiative because the Government very quickly found out, firstly, that it was not sure that in fact it owned the Wool Testing Authority and, secondly, that the vital work the Authority is doing-Senator Mason talked of this at length at the time-should not be put in jeopardy. The Government in effect has reversed its decision in this matter by what is purely a device. It has called the Wool Testing Authority a publicly-owned authority by putting the word 'Limited' at the end of its name. It is a device only, because the Government has found that it is necessary to exempt the Authority from income tax if it is to operate effectively. In other words, as far as we can ascertain, it will be getting back to entirely the same operating mode that it previously operated under. If we look at it in detail, we see that there is essentially no change. The Government has gone back to where it started. I can only hope in passing that some of the other initiatives of the Government, the razor gang initiatives, are similarly dealt with; that is, that they are reversed. I refer particularly to the proposal to sell the Government Ordnance Factory at Bendigo.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government still has not made clear what it intends to do in these important areas where large numbers of people are employed and where there is a tremendous body of evidence to support the fact that these government factories and authorities have been operating with remarkable efficiency. It is placing a tremendous burden on the employees of these establishments. Under no circumstances do we wish to delay the Government's initiative on the Wool Testing Authority. We hope that in the Budget session, or sooner, the Government will quickly make its position clear in regard to the Government Ordnance Factory at Bendigo and the Government Clothing Factory at Coburg, to name just two. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats support these Bills, no matter how tortuously they seek to achieve their objects. We wish them a speedy passage. The fight against organised crime has gone on far too long to be handicapped by the Government having one hand tied behind its back. At least by these Bills the bonds have been cut. We now have to tackle the job of determining how the heavy boxing gloves will be used. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support much of what is contained in these tax amendment Bills but will make some serious reservations in relation to certain matters which were brought to the attention of the Government by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in regard to some proposals which have been taken up by the Australian Labor Party in the amendments which have been circulated. The Bills before us deal, amongst other things, with overriding those provisions of the tax laws which embody the traditional integrity and secrecy of dealings between the Commissioner of Taxation and those liable to pay tax. The Bills also deal with the implementation of the Government's housing interest rebate scheme and, finally, provide tax immunity for the Australian Wool Testing Authority as now constituted. I would like to make some comments on all of those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first matter is the attempt by the Government within this legislation to override those secrecy provisions which traditionally have been regarded as so important in Australia, that is, the protection of the confidentiality of communications and assessments by the Commissioner of Taxation with regard to those liable to pay tax. The Government, in attempting to override these provisions, is indeed responding to a very real concern within the community. I do not imagine that any honourable senator or any person within the Australian community would not be prepared to say that these secrecy provisions should not be overidden in those cases where clearly the information that could be obtained from tax records would be of assistance to a royal commission nominated by this Parliament. It is quite clear, as Senator Siddons said, that in Australia we do not have the advantages which have long existed in the United States where the Internal Revenue Service has played a very vital role in combating organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA> Insofar as this Bill makes some step, very guarded as it ought to be, towards enabling in certain circumstances tax records and information obtained by the Commissioner of Taxation to be made available to royal commissions looking into those matters which are of dire concern to the community, such as allegations of intimidatory or fraudulent practices in relation to the waterfront of Australia or the circulating of death-dealing drugs within our community-those drugs which damage particularly young Australian lives by undermining their mental or physical health or indeed lead to their early deaths-I will not suppose there is anybody in the Australian community who would not say that a commission ought to have available to it as much information as is possible to enable it to target on those who are responsible for the malpractices in relation to employment in the great waterfront industry in Australia, which is so vital to our survival as a trading nation or in relation to the circulation of such death-dealing drugs. But this Bill goes further than that and would enable the Government, by merely putting into the terms of reference of any royal commission that it ought to have access to these records, to give a right to such access. In that regard the Australian Labor Party is implacably opposed to the general extension of this right of access to all royal commissions. This is entirely out of harmony with the second reading speech of the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown). He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It bears repeating that these amendments do not evidence any policy of generally easing the strict confidentiality applying to tax records. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that not only could the Government write in such terms of reference to those of a royal commission inquiring into some quite narrow area of Australian life but also it could write such terms of reference into those of a royal commission perhaps set up as a crimes commission-which has been proposed quite widely over the last few months, and with a degree of community support- which could operate for years and have a more or less continuous existence with the powers of a royal commission without the Parliament ever setting the terms of reference and without the Parliament monitoring or putting under surveillance its continued operation within those terms of reference. In that regard the Labor Party and indeed the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills see some dangers. I think it is important to bring to the attention of honourable senators the fact that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which was established by this very chamber in order to alert it to the possibility that some legislation might pass through this place with a desirable social objective , on which we could all agree, but with means which unduly trespass on personal liberties, had this to say concerning the matter to which I am drawing attention :</PARA>
<PARA>the proposed sub-paragraph . . . would enable any future, unspecified Royal Commission to gain access to information by declaration of the Governor-General, without Parliamentary intervention or scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA>It is one thing to give the two existing commissions-the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking-these powers, named as they are, in the paragraphs of the Bill. I notice Senator Walters paying particular attention to this point. She was a very active member of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in coming to this conclusion; that in this provision, rather than naming the two royal commissions we have given to the Government a power to make tax records available to royal commissions whatever their area of scrutiny or inquiry and for however long or continuously they might be in existence. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee said this:</PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee would not regard the conferral of access to information on future Royal Commissions as necessarily required by Act of Parliament, it suggests that some form of Parliamentary control, whether by affirmative resolution of the Houses or the disallowance procedure, may be worthy of consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, the Labor Party has taken up that point and said that in its view if a royal commission is to be given access to tax records it ought to be by affirmative resolution of the Houses of the Parliament and not simply by Executive act. Let us face it, it could be the case that some royal commissions could be established with a very narrow range of inquiry or, indeed, for purely political purposes in order to embarrass some individual or some institution within our society. In that case we, as the elected representatives, ought to take it upon ourselves to say publicly in this forum that we think the matter is important enough to require that that royal commission have access to tax records which is, after all, to breach a long-standing provision and understanding within our laws. That is not the case and I would hope that the Government sees fit at some stage during the evening to indicate that it will agree with the concern expressed by the scrutiny of Bills Committee, which has as its main function the role of alerting senators to the fact that whilst we have a desirable social objective, it should be pursued by means which are appropriate and it is not appropriate to hand over that power to the Executive, to the Governor-General. It ought to be a power exercised by the elected representatives themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the legislation before us deals with the Government's implementation of its promise earlier this year to make provision for a rebate of tax for home loan interest payments made on or after 1 July 1982. This is another part of the generally depressing policy pursued by this Government in relation to housing. In fact, one wonders how seriously one can take the Government in relation to housing for Australians when within the last week or two the Government has dismantled the ministry for housing. It is a measure of the concern of this Government that there is no longer within the Australian ministry a Minister who is devoted solely to the question of fulfilling, in a socially just way, the housing needs of Australians. And who can say that those needs are not multiplying day by day, week by week, as ordinary Australians reel under the impact of Government decisions, particularly in relation to interest rates. What sort of government is it which comes into this place with a measure to do with housing without a housing Minister, without anyone to express concern , for example, about the fact that 270,000 Australians live in caravans, mobile homes as they are euphemistically called. Seventy per cent of the caravan dwellers in Melbourne-and I see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) taking a note of this terrible indictment of the Government which he represents in this place-are long term residents in these caravan parks. They are in a very uneasy state of mind. These caravan parks have emerged as last resort housing for those households without choice, particularly young households, who are forced to move out of their parents homes or who cannot afford rented accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will confine my remarks, given the time limits, to the Bill before us which, as I say, deals with a tax rebate for home loan interest payments. Of course, it is a totally inadequate scheme. The fact is that only some 10 per cent of all households will get anything from this particular scheme. Only some 30 per cent of first home buyers will be able to benefit from it. It seems to me that, whilst the Government will make much of this tax rebate scheme, one has to remember that it was introduced as part of a package, a package which included by government agreement with the banks, those immensely profitable institutions, that they ought to be allowed to raise their interest rates by yet another one per cent. In the four years from 1978 to 1982 there has been a tremendous increase from 9.5 per cent to 13.5 per cent in the interest rates on home loans, which has crippled many households and led to much of the social breakdown which is a feature of Australian society, as families find that they are at each other 's throats because of their inability to find that disposable income with which they ought to be able to pay, not for luxury items such as colour television sets, for example, but for those items which are essential to ordinary home and family life. Senator Messner smiles as though he is thinking: 'Senator Tate is on yet another piece of rhetoric rather than dealing with the real facts'. Let me quote from an article in the Sydney Sun Herald of 5 July 1981. It is entitled 'A Couple Losing the Battle'. I am sure that listeners to this parliamentary broadcast will recognise in this case a family living in their own street. This is not an isolated instance. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Maree and Robert Dobson of Saratoga, near Gosford (NSW), are a young couple battling to stay ahead of rising interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> They started repaying their $30,000 building society loan 12 months ago. Since then the interest rate has risen 2 per cent and their payments have climbed from $306 to $330 a month. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 'The repayments have gone up $20 a month while my husband's wage has risen by only $5 a week and mine by $6 . . . Maree said. </PARA>
<PARA>Both are trying to earn incomes to keep the household together. Their household wages have risen by $11 a month and their repayments have gone up by $20 a month . Maree is reported as having said:</PARA>
<PARA>If I was at home expecting a baby or raising a family there is no way we could afford it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly the case in many households around Australia. In my area of Tasmania, for example, I know of the distress caused to many families in Burnie and in surrounding townships when the Burnie pulp mill was forced by market conditions to dismiss a certain number of employees, many of whom had given many years of service and had expected to continue in employment in that mill. Of course, with interest rates as high as they are, any temporary unemployment difficulty, let alone a prolonged one, has a savage impact on the family concerned. A well known community figure of the north west coast, Mr Steve Daly, put it to the Federal Government some weeks ago that as retrenchments, coupled with these high interest rates, were causing such social distress in Burnie the Government ought to make available, to alleviate the distress of those families, some of those moneys which it promised would be available to alleviate the impact of that one per cent rise in interest rates. I made an inquiry, on behalf of Mr Steve Daly, of the then Minister for Housing and Construction. I received a reply from his private secretary which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I can provide no advice on how assistance can be given other than to suggest that such people seek the co-operation of their lending authority and endeavour to secure financial and material support from local charities. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the situation. The portfolio of the then Minister for Housing and Construction is now demolished and dismantled. It does not exist any more, so one cannot even turn to the Minister and receive the sort of reply that I received on 27 April 1982. The response of the Government on that date, only a few weeks ago, was to suggest that the person go to the banker or to charitable institutions. But the Federal Government, despite the fact that it said it would try to give assistance to those who were reeling under the impact of high interest rates, had no particular response to give. </PARA>
<PARA> I finally and very briefly deal with the Australian Wool Testing Authority. I have had an interest in this matter because it was on behalf of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association that I asked a question of Senator Chaney in this place almost a year ago today. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is it a fact that the Government's decision to sell the Australian Wool Testing Authority has been overwhelmingly rejected by woolgrowers throughout Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chaney replied, in part, in his usual whimsical way:</PARA>
<PARA> Some of that response has been in negative terms. </PARA>
<PARA>It certainly was negative. For example, all the major wool testing and wool brokerage authorities throughout Australia came to the same conclusion; namely, that the Government had acted for purely ideological reasons, with no regard for the impeccable integrity, internationally won, which that authority enjoyed, or for the fact that it was operating efficiently and, indeed, profitably. The Wool Council of Australia-Senator Andrew Thomas, Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, himself a well known authority on merino wool, is nodding in agreement-requested the Government to reconsider its decision in relation to the demolition of the Australian Wool Testing Authority. He acknowledges at least that that plea was put by the leading council of the wool growers of Australia even if he does not acknowledge its care. I am pleased to say that, with the political weight of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats in this place, the Government has acceded to that plea. It has now created a situation where the Australian Wool Testing Authority will enjoy tax free status. That is the purpose of the Bill before us. </PARA>
<PARA> The rural community has been served in this place by the Australian Labor Party and by the Democrats and has not been well served by those in the electorate who consistently claim to understand best the interests of the rural producers of Australia. For example, Mr John Kerin, the shadow spokesman for the Australian Labor Party on primary industry matters, enjoys a very high reputation. Even during this winter recess, as he moves around Australia visiting the various councils of rural organisations, farmers and graziers associations and so on, he continues to enhance his reputation as a man who well understands and fights for the interests of the rural industries of Australia. Given the time constraints I will bring my remarks in relation to this Bill to an end. I will probably have a little to say in the Committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will support the amendment to the second reading of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 moved by the Opposition in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Bill contains insufficient safeguards to ensure that access to tax records is not abused, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Bill fails to provide adequate compensation to the Australian home buyers for the massive increase in interest repayments over the last 2 years'.</PARA>
<PARA>However, I am not stating that I will support paragraph (a) of that amendment in the Committee stage. There are a number of reasons for this. Obviously, it would be in the interests of the scheme as a whole for various government departments to co-operate to ensure that the entitlement is there in the first place and that there is a speedy resolution of applications for the entitlement. I have grave reservations on the question of allowing royal commissions to have the sort of power envisaged. I believe, as does Senator Tate, that this is a foot in the door. It is something about which we should be very careful. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the Government bringing forward this legislation, as it has been amended in the House of Representatives, in such a fashion as to put the gun at the head of the Senate and say: 'If you do not pass it in its pristine form there will be delays in ensuring that entitlements flow to taxpayers'. If we were to succumb to that sort of pressure by the Government we would be throwing away our role as a House of review. We are presented with this sort of gun at the head attitude by the Government in respect of the Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill 1982, the Home Deposit Assistance Bill 1982 and the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill 1982. The Government is saying to us: ' Take it or leave it: The House of Representatives has made amendments to these pieces of legislation. If we amend them, they will have to wait until August before they can go back to that House'. </PARA>
<PARA> If we allow ourselves to be subject to this sort of intimidation by the House of Representatives or by the Government, I again say that we are abandoning our role as a House of review. I challenge the Government to announce its policy in the event of the Senate amending any of these Bills to improve them and to protect the rights of persons who under the old scheme would have been able to be assisted in respect of the provisions of the Home Deposit Assistance Bill and the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill but who would fall between the two schemes, the old scheme and the new scheme. I will be mentioning that at length when we come to debate those Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the Government that, if the Senate amends any of these pieces of legislation, including the Fertilizers (Subsidy) Amendment Bill, it is for the Government to make a simple policy decision stating that it will ensure that no benefits will be lost as a result of the discourtesy that the House of Representatives has shown not only to the Senate but to the whole of the nation as illustrated by its defiance of the Constitution by rising while we remain here in an attempt to pursue our role as a House of review knowing full well that no matter what we do the House of Representatives members have gone to the four corners of the earth and cannot be brought back until August. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had intended to speak only at the Committee stage in respect of these Bills but I understand that it will suit the convenience of at least one senator who is presently immersed in the basement studio of the Australian Broadcasting Commission if the vote on the motion for the second reading is delayed for a few minutes. Accordingly, I will say now what I otherwise would have said at the Committee stage. I hasten to reassure any honourable senator who might fear that my notorious garrulousness will get the better of me and that this is more of a warm-up for another similar burst in the Committee stage that that will not happen. My moving of the amendment at the Committee stage will be purely formal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I address my remarks in foreshadowing the Opposition's amendment purely to the area of and purely as it relates to the question of access to tax records. The relevant changes to the law which are effected by these Bills will alter the secrecy provisions, as we know, of the Income Tax Assessment Act to enable access to tax records by the existing Stewart and Costigan royal comissions on drug trafficking and the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union respectively and also to extend that power of access to future royal commissions which have appropriate terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the extension of the powers of royal commissions to enable access to tax records, certainly in respect of the Stewart and Costigan royal commissions, and sees advantages for this extension as a matter of general principle in the area of organised crime and similarly significant offences that we are talking about. But we do not reach that position of support lightly and we certainly have very grave reservations about the way in which this whole area has now been so broadly opened up by this legislation. The support for the principle of access to tax records is, I think, forced upon us, like any other group of reasonable Australians, by the revelations of the Costigan and Stewart royal commissions and the very powerful argument that emerges particularly from the interim report of the Costigan Commission as ot the utility of access to tax records in conducting investigations into high crimes and misdemeanours involving corporate manipulation, tax fraud and evasion, official corruption and matters of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The justification for access to tax records in this context is not that, as it is sometimes assumed, your average crook around the place is in the habit of concealing his activities from everyone in the world but comes to be overcome with a fit of penitence and accessibility when it comes to communications with the Commissioner of Taxation. There is an awful lot of nonsense talked about this, about the way in which everyone from your friendly neighbourhood brothel keeper up is in the habit of supplying fair, full and accurate returns to the Commissioner of Taxation in a way that they would not dream of doing were they asked these questions by anyone else. Of course, that is palpable nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The utility of access to tax records is not in order to enable the law enforcement authorities or anyone else to go simply to the disclosure of illicitly received income and to nab persons accordingly-out of their own mouths or from their own pens-but rather to use the network of data and information that can appear thus in the tax records to develop a much better picture of what is going on in some very complicated criminal transactions. This was put very nicely and simply by the Williams Royal Commission at page 372 of its report in the following terms when it referred to the kind of data which can thus be picked up. </PARA>
<PARA> Discrepancies between the income which can possibly be earned from a disclosed legitimate source and the income actually enjoyed and manifest in accumulated assets and lifestyle may indicate the nature and extent of a criminal activity related to--</PARA>
<PARA>In this case the example given was of drug trafficking. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Material contained in a return . . . may indicate sources of funds, lines of communications and associations, and open other lines of inquiry by, for example , identifying such things as bank accounts and similar matters. </PARA>
<PARA>It is evident that by putting together material of that kind the work of these commissions and inquiries and the work of law enforcement agencies can be much enhanced. Indeed, one could put it more strongly than that. To use the words of Mr Commissioner Costigan in his interim report which was tabled early this year:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me a scandalous waste of time and money for the Taxation Commissioner not to supply information to the Commission in areas of common interest. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition accepts that. We think that the argument is made out for access to tax records in the context of crimes of the seriousness of those which are in issue in the Stewart and Costigan areas of inquiry. That argument is well and truly made out. However, the reservations that we have is that there are insufficient limitations on the ways in which these powers can be exercised in the future. There are insufficient guarantees that the powers will be exercised only in areas where the issues are as open and shut as they appear to be in the Costigan and Stewart royal commissions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition moved two amendments in the House of Representatives to communicate our concern about the absence of sufficient safeguards. One of those amendments has now been accepted by the Government-not very gracefully, expeditiously and clearly, it is true, given the odd way in which it has tucked its acceptance of our amendment into another piece of associated legislation rather than the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) which deals with royal commissions. But accept it it has and we are duly grateful for that. That amendment sought to limit the classes of offence in respect of which a royal commissioner could make disclosures to the Attorney-General, and in turn the Attorney-General could make disclosures to the police authorities, to offences which are genuinely serious in nature. The identification of 'seriousness' which seems to be commonly accepted-it is the one which we advanced- is an offence which is punishable by a gaol term of more than six months. </PARA>
<PARA> The only comment I make about the Government's acceptance of our amendment moved those terms is that it seems to me to be extraordinarily odd that the Government insisted on using its own terminology, referring not just to offences , punishment for which exceeds six months imprisonment, but to offences punishable for imprisonment for life, as if the expression 'for life' was not covered by and subsumed by the reference to terms of imprisonment exceeding six months. We all know that 'for life' is a flexible term of imprisonment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all know, as Senator Macklin says, that some people have a short life but I would not have thought, on anyone's analysis, that a sentence of life imprisonment could possibly be considered as covering a period of less than six months. Be that as it may, it is essentially a semantic quibble. The real substance of our amendment, which remains unacceptable to the Government, is that which we will be moving formally at the Committee stage, and which I shall now anticipate. It is designed to ensure that, so far as any future royal commission is concerned, the Parliament shall have a voice in determining whether that royal commission should have the powers in question. As this legislation is written at the moment, as Senator Tate put it so cogently, any royal commission that might be established in the future-any investigation which formally satisfies that description, whatever its subject matter-will have power of access to tax records, however inappropriate that might be in the particular case, however much it might amount to the use of a sledge hammer to crack a nut in the context of the area of inquiry in question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For these reasons the Opposition proposes to move that these powers shall be capable of being exercised by only those royal commissions which are endorsed, by an affirmative resolution of both Houses of the Parliament, as appropriate to possess powers of access to tax records. Our point is very obvious. Royal commissions are established, and have been over a long time, for all sorts of purposes and reasons-for areas of inquiry as narrow as, for example, a particular local government administration or, on the other hand, as potentially wide and all-embracing as the national security. Issues that one thinks of in that context would include those raised in the Petrov inquiry, which still enjoys considerable notoriety. We do not think it appropriate that a royal commission of any kind, simply by virtue of satisfying that description, should acquire in an open-ended way, these quite enormous and hitherto, in our system of justice, quite unprecendented powers. </PARA>
<PARA> We propose a very simple amendment which communicates the proposition that I have outlined. It is one that I suspect would appeal to a good many honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. Of course, the difficulty with which we are confronted in moving such an amendment-which I still propose to do at the Committee stage, although I will not press it to a vote-is that if it were so pressed, if the Government were defeated and if the amendment were inserted, we would be in the most unhappy situation that the Bill would have to sit on the stocks until next August, in the event that the Government was not prepared to bring the House of Representatives back to endorse the amendment in question. </PARA>
<PARA> That point was made by Senator Siddons, and even more graphically by Senator Harradine, when he referred to the Government holding a gun at our heads in this respect. The Opposition believes that the House of Representatives should never have got up so early, should not have scuttled for cover, should not have used the first opportunity available to it to retreat from the fire that it was under from the Opposition. In particular, it should not have dispersed to the four winds knowing that important legislation such as this remained to be debated by the Senate-legislation which demanded considerable attention to detail in the interests of the protection of the civil rights and liberties of ordinary Australians. It is a disgrace that the Government, knowing that this legislation was on the stocks, should have chosen to treat the Parliament in this way. The Government should be back here doing its democratic duty in every one of the respects that I have mentioned, and in particular listening to what I am sure the Senate, had it freedom of action, would want to say about the limitations of this legislation. </PARA>

He asked whether an additional amendment to the Bill would be necessary. I am advised that the Acts Interpretation Act provides that where an office of permanent head is abolished the Governor-General may, by order published in the Commonwealth Gazette, specify another office of permanent head being the permanent head of the department that has taken over the functions of the abolished department. Once Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) has received royal assent an appropriate order by the Governor-General, specifying the particular permanent head concerned, will be sought.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second area of concern referred to by Senator Tate, Senator Siddons and Senator Evans related to the first part of the amendment to the second reading motion. Of course, the major thrust of the amendments which the Opposition proposes to move in the Committee stage is, broadly, to provide that there will not be the provision of information in these circumstances except where there is a resolution of both Houses of Parliament to establish that they are, in fact, a reasonable set of terms of reference and a royal commission which should have this information disclosed to it. It is clear that the Opposition is well intentioned in seeking to provide this kind of safeguard. However, I believe that it does not have appropriate concern for practical situations. There will be very real difficulties obviously when Parliament is in recess in seeking to establish appropriate terms of reference for royal commissions when it might be necessary and expedient to do so. That question of convenience, of course, is very valid also when we consider the broader question of the establishment of a royal commission in these circumstances in the first place. It is for the Government to establish royal commissions to which this information might be provided. Of course, the terms of reference would be decided by the Government in these circumstances. Naturally, one does take into account the kinds of concerns which have been expressed by Opposition senators. But the Government clearly has an obligation in these circumstances.

The major point I seek to make out of this is that whereas the table incorporated in the Hansard of the other place refers to negative effects upon net incomes of individuals, when one takes into account the rising levels of income since March 1980, a very positive change is demonstrated in net incomes of house owners after paying interest to lending authorities in the situations outlined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other matter I seek to refer to is the Australian Wool Testing Authority, which was referred to by all speakers in the debate. It is quite clear that the Authority, although it is now operating properly, has done so only in the last five years of its 25 years of life. It has now reached a position where it can stand alone without the support of the Australian Wool Corporation which has so far provided the staff and the facilities for its work. It performs what is a routine commercial function not necessarily with statutory authority status.</PARA>
<PARA> In the course of this debate many points have been made in connection with the requirement of the rural sector and the need to keep costs to a reasonable level . The Government has acknowledged that particular problem and therefore seeks to retain the tax exempt status which has applied in former times to the Australian Wool Testing Authority. I commend the Bills to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans-I suggest that the Senate give leave for the questions with regard to the remaining stages of the passage through the Senate of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1982 to be put in one motion at each stage, and the consideration of such Bills together in Committee of the Whole.</PARA>

<PARA> '(iii) a Royal Commission in respect of which each House of the Parliament has by resolution declared that the Royal Commission is a Royal Commission to which this sub-paragraph applies.'. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of the amendment is to require an affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament before any future royal commission exercises the powers of access to tax records that are provided for in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2). As I have indicated, I do not propose to speak any further on this matter, except to indicate that we shall not pursue it to the point of a division, for the reasons I have previously indicated. That is not because we do not believe that it is a serious matter; we do. We hope that the Government will take the opportunity over the recess to think again about the reasoning behind its rejection of this amendment and will come back in a slightly more conciliatory frame of mind, and with an appropriate amendment the next time an income tax assessment Bill wends its way through this Parliament. </PARA>

We are not in a position properly to review Bills such as these, because we know that if we pass an amendment to either Bill we shall have to bring members of the House of Representatives back from all over the world or else the Bill will not go through and will not operate. Therefore, we are over a barrel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard this amendment as having a great deal of validity. It is one of the matters which were raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.

I regard it-I have said this many times to my colleagues-as monstrous and outrageous that we should sit in review when the other House is not sitting at the same time. I am sure that the House of Representatives had things it could have done and it ought to be sitting. For the same reason that the amendment is not being pressed , I will likewise not vote for it now and delay the passage of these Bills.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today, at Question Time, following upon a question asked by Senator Martyr, discussion arose on the interpretation of Standing Order 418 as it relates to members of parliament. In response to the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Chipp, and the Acting Leader of the Opposition , Senator Grimes, who took part in that discussion, I undertook to consider the matter further. I have looked at the proof Hansard of the proceedings and given the matter further consideration. I now report to the Senate as follows: A reading of the Hansard confirms in my mind that the question asked was in order. The interpretation of the Standing Order is, in my view, essentially a matter for the Chair and I remind honourable senators that at the time of the question I drew attention to the provisions of the Standing Order for the purpose of reminding the Senate that imputations of improper motives and personal reflections on members are highly disorderly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have indicated already, a reading of the question has confirmed in my mind that the question did not infringe those provisions. However, the points made by Senators Chipp and Grimes are important and I shall draw the matter to the attention of the President. Of course, if the Senate or any individual honourable senators felt at any time that the intention of the Standing Order was being abused or was capable of being abused it would be proper for appropriate action to be taken to have the matter considered by the Standing Orders Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to raise a matter concerning the Daw Park Repatriation General Hospital in South Australia. Had the other House been sitting I would not have had this task tonight because my colleague, Mr Ralph Jacobi, the honourable member for Hawker, would have raised the matter in the other place. I want to put questions to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner). I understand that Mr Jacobi might have communicated with him about this problem in recent days. I ask the Minister whether it is a fact that the Repatriation General Hospital at Daw Park has traditionally had to manage at a lower level of staffing than have State hospitals in South Australia. Is it also a fact that, on average, 3.63 hours of nursing care are given to each patient in 24 hours at the RGH whereas the minimum recommended rate is four hours in South Australian government hospitals? I ask him also whether it is a fact that, following the Review of Commonwealth Functions, it has been proposed that by July 1982 there be a reduction of 40 staff in all categories at Daw Park Hospital. If implemented, will that proposal exacerbate the already critical staffing situation and, ultimately, result in the closure of services provided to ex-servicemen?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I further ask the Minister whether he agrees that the amount of medical care required by ex-servicemen who served in the Second World War is likely to increase in the future, not to mention the number of aged veterans who need proper care and attention in the hospital at Daw Park? When talking about aged veterans, I am talking about returned servicemen from World War I. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, is it a fact that the nurses at the RGH at Daw Park are currently disadvantaged by wage relativities and that expected community wage movements are certain to increase the salaries of nurses employed elsewhere in the State well beyond the salaries of those employed at the RGH? What action has the Minister taken to restore relativity? Does he also agree that, until relativity and staff levels are restored, not only nurses but also servicemen will be treated as second class citizens compared with their counterparts in State hospitals?</PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there is widespread discontent and concern amongst staff at the repatriation hospital at Daw Park flowing from the savage cuts in the recommendations of the Lynch committee which proposed a reduction in the staff level at the hospital. As a consequence, it is possible that the standard of care for ex-servicemen will markedly deteriorate and that the staff has unavoidably suffered an increase in its workload because of these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to be as brief as possible tonight. In the light of the matters that I have raised with the Minister and in the light of this appalling indictment of the Government's policy, will the Minister undertake to convene a meeting in Adelaide of staff representatives to enable them to air their grievances and, equally importantly, to ensure implementation of policies that will restore to our ex-servicemen the care to which they are entitled. I apologise for being so brief in my remarks, but I hope that the Minister, if he cannot give me an answer tonight, will read the Hansard report tomorrow. Being the responsible Minister, no doubt he has taken on board what I have said and will be able to give me an answer tonight. In the event that he cannot, I ask him to give me some answers to the questions that I have posed before the Senate rises. I ask him particularly to say to me and to Mr Jacobi, who has asked me to raise this matter, that he will convene a meeting of the concerned staff members at the hospital and have a round table conference with them to try to iron out some of the problems that they will be confronted with as a result of the recommendations of the razor gang. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply -Firstly, I am unable to confirm in detail the numbers and the facts that Senator McLaren has cited, but I make a number of points about the situation. First and foremost, it is true that the Review of Commonwealth Functions recommended a reduction of staff for all departments of the Commonwealth Government. The Department of Veterans' Affairs is in no way exempt from that. The decision in the case of the Department of Veterans' Affairs was a reduction of 2 per cent. That has been well known for some considerable time. That means that over the last 12-month period there has needed to be an implementation of that decision in all areas of the Department's operations. That is being undertaken in such a way as to ensure that services to veterans in particular are maintained at the highest possible level. I say that because we need to recognise that all hospitals, whether Daw Park in Adelaide or any other hospital , take in a substantial number of non-veterans and a further substantial number of non-entitled veterans. This means that there comes from those persons receiving treatment at Daw Park revenue which is not a direct cost upon the budget of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. That means that to be able to maintain the proper level of services to veterans it is possible to change the level of services that we are able to provide to persons who are not veterans or who are non-entitled veterans without necessarily affecting the wellbeing of individual veterans. Honourable senators will recall that the repatriation legislation requires the Repatriation Commission to provide direct care and benefit and to look after the wellbeing of entitled veterans in the first place. I have to reject criticism that the Department is not attending to its duty, in the way Senator McLaren implied during his remarks, in looking after entitled veterans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLaren raised the question of staff meetings. He may not know but some five or six weeks ago, in Adelaide, I had an interview with officials of both the Hospital Employees Federation of Australia and the Royal Australian Nursing Federation on this particular problem at Daw Park. They made appropriate representations to me. We are still investigating a number of points. I intend to have further discussions with them in the company of the head of the Department of Veterans' Affairs in the not too distant future. That date has not yet been settled as it depends on when the Senate rises. </PARA>
<PARA> The further point I make in that regard is that it is not really for the Minister, in circumstances such as these, to become involved in detailed questions of staffing levels, appropriate ratios and so on. Rather, these are matters for the management of individual hospitals. It must be said that conditions in various hospitals vary considerably from unit to unit. It is not always appropriate to apply measurements that might be used in one hospital, with one set of circumstances, to another hospital. I think that is particularly true when comparing State hospitals with repatriation hospitals. However, I take on board the point that Senator McLaren has made and I will further investigate that aspect of the problem. He can rest assured that I will be discussing the matter further with the union representatives in the not too distant future. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) It is true that, in calculating provisional tax, the allowance made for taxpayers with a salary and wage component in their taxable incomes is based on the declared rates of tax rather than on the higher PAYE tax instalment deduction rates. The legislative authority for the calculation of 1981-82 provisional tax is provided by Section 221YC of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, in conjunction with section 39 of the Income Tax Laws Amendment Act (No. 3 ) 1981. The tax payable on assessment of taxpayers subject to provisional tax, including those with salary and wage income, generally exceeds considerably the sum of the provisional tax previously paid and the credit in respect of tax instalments that had been deducted during the year of income. In those individual cases where provisional tax charged might be excessive, the self- assessment provisions of section 221YDA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are available to the taxpayers concerned.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No tax will be payable in 1981-82 by a person whose taxable income is $4, 160.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The prescribed schedules of pay-as-you-earn deductions incorporate loadings designed to permit leave bonuses to be paid generally without deduction of tax instalments and to cover any shortfall in deductions that might otherwise occur where employees receive, in addition to their earnings, small amounts of income that have not been subject to tax instalments. The first of these loadings enables the leave bonus to be paid in most cases without any further deduction of tax instalments at the time of its payment. If the bonus were treated, at the time of payment, as ordinary earnings for tax instalment purposes, the result would often be that tax instalments would be deducted at a rate higher than is appropriate, having regard to the employee's annual earnings. Also, the amounts of weekly income shown in the prescribed schedule cover amounts up to the top of each dollar step in weekly earnings. For example, the instalment shown against weekly earnings of $80 in the schedule of tax instalment deductions covers earnings of $80.00 to $80.99 and is that applicable to weekly earnings of $80.99 . It is for these reasons that weekly tax instalment deductions at the rate of $ 1 are required to be made from weekly earnings of $80 by a person without dependants.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) For a person without dependants earning $90 per week the tax instalments on an annual basis are $65.80 (approximately $1.27 per week) in excess of the 1981-82 tax payable on assessment on a taxable income of $4,680. The rate of tax as enacted for the 1981-82 financial year on taxable incomes of $4,196 to $17,894 is 32 per cent applied to the excess of taxable income over $ 4195. The tax instalments on earnings of $90 per week represent 45.57 per cent of the excess of $4,680 over $4,195. However, as indicated in answer to part (2) , the annual income that corresponds to weekly earnings of $90 is greater by the amount of the leave bonus which is not subjected to tax instalment deductions on payment, and the tax instalments are accordingly calculated on a higher figure. The weekly tax instalments are as prescribed in the Income Tax Regulations. At all levels of earnings, where the taxpayer's circumstances are such that the leave bonus and any income not subject to tax instalments or provisional tax are less than had been allowed for in the schedule, the tax instalments will be higher than the tax payable on assessment. On the other hand, if an employee receives a greater leave bonus or has more other income than is allowed for in the schedules, tax instalments would be insufficient to cover the final tax payable for the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) See (2) above. It should perhaps be added that, notwithstanding these arrangements, many salary and wage earners are required to pay tax on assessment because the tax instalment deductions are insufficient to cover the tax payable on their total taxable income. More than 650,000 debit assessments have issued so far this financial year to salary and wage earners. Any reduction in the rates of instalments would increase the incidence of such debit assessments. I believe that most salary and wage earners prefer to have tax deducted at rates that will ensure refunds rather than be faced with tax bills, however small, on assessment of their returns. Moreover, where an employee's circumstances are such that the instalments payable under the prescribed schedules are likely to exceed considerably the tax payable on assessment, the Commission of Taxation is authorised by section 221D of the Income Tax Assessment Act to vary the instalments.</PARA>

By way of alternative to the preceding concession, where livestock is disposed of by reason of the loss or destruction of pastures or fodder by fire, drought or flood or is compulsorily disposed of for the purpose of controlling or eradicating certain diseases, the profits may be excluded from assessable income and applied to reducing the cost of replacement stock acquired during the ensuing 5 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Allowable deductions</PARA>
<PARA> Depreciation is allowable on fences, dams and other structural improvements on land which is used for the purposes of agriculture or pastoral pursuits.</PARA>
<PARA> Depreciation on structural improvements used for the storage of hay, grain or fodder acquired or constructed after 21 August 1979 is allowable over 5 years.</PARA>

<PARA> preventing or combating flooding on the land.</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure incurred on and after 14 April 1980 on the acquisition, construction or installation of plant or structural improvements, or extensions thereto, for the purpose of conserving or conveying water for use on the land is an allowable deduction.</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure incurred before 1 July 1984 on the construction of stock yards of sub-divisional fences where the Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry has certified their construction assists in the eradication or control of brucelilosis or tuberculosis may be an allowable deduction.</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure incurred on or after 1 October 1980 on specified works for soil conservation is an allowable deduction.</PARA>
<PARA> An investment allowance deduction is available on certain structural improvements used in a business of primary production.</PARA>
<PARA> A primary producer is not restricted by the 7 years limitation on the recoupment of prior year losses that applies to non-primary producers.</PARA>
<PARA>Income Equalisation Deposits</PARA>
<PARA> Due to the wide fluctuations which may occur in their incomes from one year to the next, primary producers are encouraged to participate in the income equalisation deposits scheme. Deposits into the scheme are allowable deductions while the proceeds received on withdrawal of deposits for which income tax deductions have previously been allowed are to be included in assessable income of the primary producer in the year of withdrawal.</PARA>
<PARA>Averaging of Income</PARA>
<PARA> A special averaging rebate may be subtracted from ordinary tax payable where a primary producer's taxable income exceeds the average of the taxable incomes for a period of 5 years. Where the average income exceeds the taxable income, the rebate does not apply and tax is payable at ordinary rates. The rebate which is allowable in any year will depend on the extent of primary production and other income derived in the year.</PARA>
<PARA>Sales Tax</PARA>
<PARA> Generally speaking goods for use in a business of primary production, other than road vehicles of the kind ordinarily used for the transport of persons or the delivery of goods, are exempt from sales tax.

<PARA> (1) Reproduction of the 13 Aboriginal bark paintings used in the Australian Information Service (AIS) 1982 calendar, which is published by the Australian Government Publishing Service, was arranged through the Aboriginal Artists Agency, a non-profit company funded by the Commonwealth Government to represent Aboriginal artists in copyright matters. The agency determined that a reproduction fee of $100 should be paid to each artist. AIS paid these fees through the agency.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The bark paintings used in the calendar are from the National Ethnographic Collection held at the Australian Institute of Anatomy, Canberra. The Institute of Anatomy sought no compensation for their use, nor did the two collectors who are still alive, Dr H. Groger-Wurm and Dr K. Kupka.</PARA>

<PARA> Is it the case that service pensions are paid fortnightly if payment is by cheque, but if payment is made directly into a bank, building society or other account, the pension is credited to the account at twelve-weekly intervals; if so, will the Minister take steps to rectify this anomaly and have payments of service pensions paid into accounts fortnightly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All repatriation pensioners have the option to have pensions paid fortnightly by cheque or by direct deposit to an account at a bank, building society or credit union every twelve weeks. There are significant financial implications in providing a direct deposit facility on a fortnightly basis. This is a matter for consideration in the Budget context.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1658), Senator Button asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What action is the Government proposing to take to prevent the imposition of sugar import quotas by the United States of America? Is he aware of strong speculation that these quotas will be announced within a few days? Is he also aware of recent criticism by the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board of political pressure being exerted by the United States to displace Australian wheat exports to some of our traditional customers? Does the Minister believe that the announcement of sugar quotas might be delayed by the United States until the departure from Australia of the American Vice-President, Mr Bush? In view of this, will the Government be taking up vigorously the matter of sugar and wheat exports with Mr Bush during his visit to Australia which begins tonight?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In mid-April the Government became aware that the United States Government had under consideration the possibility of taking further protective measures on sugar imports and that there was a proposal to discriminate, in the application of these measures, in a way which would have disadvantaged our sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government immediately made clear to the United States Government our deep concerns about the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in my reply to a recent question without notice (House of Representatives Hansard, page 1848 of 27 April), I wrote to the United States Special Trade Representative, Mr Brock, emphasising that the allocation of import quotas among supplying countries on a discriminatory basis to favour those suppliers within the United States' own geographic region would be unacceptable to Australia. Australian officials subsequently made repeated representations to senior US officials both in Canberra and in Washington. The Prime Minister and I also took the opportunity to emphasise Australia's views during discussions which were held in Canberra at the end of last month with US Vice-President, Mr Bush.</PARA>
<PARA> Import quotas were proclaimed by President Reagan on 6 May to take effect on 11 May and to be applied non discriminatorily and on the basis of suppliers' recent historical trade performance in the US sugar market. While I could not possibly express satisfaction with any country's decision to introduce restrictions on imports of Australia's sugar, I am encouraged by the evident willingness of the United States to take careful account of Australia's concerns and views on this important bilateral trade matter.</PARA>
<PARA> I am now pressing the United States to reduce the current tax on sugar imports , imposed before quotas were introduced. If the United States can be persuaded to relax the current tax of approximately $US80 per tonne, there will be a considerable lift in returns for Australian sugar exporters in the United States market.</PARA>
<PARA> As to wheat matters, I am aware of the concern of the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board regarding the United States Administration's aggressive approach to wheat exports. Australia's concern is that in a period of increasing global wheat stocks, 'beggar thy neighbour' marketing practices will be damaging to all wheat exporters. At a recent wheat exporters' meeting in Ottawa, Australia therefore urged other exporting countries, in particular the EEC and the USA, to exercise moderation with regard to their wheat export policies.</PARA>
