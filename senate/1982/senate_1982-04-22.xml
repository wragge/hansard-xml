<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H7">Senator KILGARIFF</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister for National Development and Energy. The use of liquefied petroleum gas as an alternative source of energy has been encouraged by the Federal Government by a $80 per tonne subsidy, which is at present under review. I am sure the Minister is aware of the extensive benefit people in the outback have gained from the subsidy and of the fact that many have taken advantage of the benefit and expended capital on the purchase of LPG equipment. I ask the Minister whether he can indicate what proposals the Government is considering, when the three-year subsidy period comes to a close, to continue to promote the use of LPG which has been a boon to consumers living away from the natural gas outlets and pipeline areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1439" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon Sir J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subsidy for LPG was introduced at a time when the price of LPG per tonne, which had been roughly equivalent to the price per tonne of crude oil, suddenly leapt forward, creating a great disparity and threatening an upturn of LPG prices. The effect of the subsidy and the effect of arrangements with the Prices Justification Tribunal was that the price of LPG came down to what had been a previous price-about $147 a tonne in the more closely settled areas and dearer elsewhere. When this subsidy was imposed it was to continue to a date in March 1983 and, of course, it is to be reviewed before then. The subsidy was imposed primarily to provide for those who could not get alternatives, such as natural gas or electricity. I sympathise entirely with Senator Kilgariff in his problems in that regard with people in remote areas, but the subsidy was never intended to be for the use of those in the closer areas who could, with reasonable costs, transfer to alternative fuels. LPG, although in glut at the moment, is a prime fuel for use in the longer term for automotive and petrochemical purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the subsidy was imposed a number of changes have occurred. One of the changes is that, after rising very sharply, the price of LPG has started to fall on world markets. Now, with the subsidy, in general the price to consumers in many places is below what it was before the price rose or before the subsidy was imposed. The trend in the world for the moment may well be towards further falls , although the exchange rates may modify that trend. Against that background the Government will be reviewing in the course of the weeks ahead its policy on the subsidy. I cannot comment on that at this moment because it is a policy matter, but I appreciate the points that Senator Kilgariff has made and I will keep them in mind.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. Is the Government aware that when the Government of Argentina understood that British nuclear submarines were in the vicinity of the Falkland Islands the Argentinian Navy's aircraft carrier was withdrawn to port, where it appears it has remained ever since? It is known that there is a world- wide disposition of nuclear submarines and that they could be expected to be present everywhere in the world in a normal war situation. In that case, in a war in which Australia was involved what would the Government propose to do regarding our new aircraft carrier, Australia? Would the ship be kept in port or sent to sea? What would be her usefulness in either of those circumstances?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of matters of this kind have been canvassed in the debate that has taken place on the acquisition of the carrier. The Service advice has been fairly clear. There is a likelihood of different circumstances arising and different reactions would be made. The carrier would be deployed in a way which would be consistent with maximum safety. One cannot guarantee complete safety in any sort of war situation or belligerent situation. The carrier would be deployed, as indeed any warships, aircraft or anything else are deployed, in a way that would try to maximise safety insofar as that is possible in a belligerent situation. One can go on creating all sorts of hypothetical situations. Senator Mason seems to delight in doing so. These are matters essentially for the experts. Presumably we are going to have a number of these different hypothetical situations referred to by Senator Mason. I will refer the question to the Minister for Defence to see whether our Service advisers have any further comment to make on this matter that has been raised.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am not in possession of all the facts relating to some of the questions raised by Senator Martyr. I am able to say for the Minister for Foreign Affairs that a visitor's visa was granted to Rafael Gonzalez, after normal inquiries were made, to enable him to visit Australia from 6 April 1982 to 17 April 1982. I understand that Australian authorities were aware that 'Gonzalez' was a pseudonym. Gonzalez advised the Australian Embassy officials that he was not a signed up member of any Salvadoran organisation, but regarded himself as a member of the Popular Social Christian Movement. The MPSC is a member of the Revolutionary Democratic Front, the non- violent wing of the leftist movement in El Salvador. Members of the FDR have visited a number of Western countries, for example, the United States of America , the United Kingdom and Canada. Gonzalez has recently visited the United States , the United Kingdom and France. Gonzalez left Australia on 17 April after completing a number of speaking engagements. I understand that the information of the Minister for Foreign Affairs is that the visit was sponsored by the Committee in Solidarity with Central America and the Caribbean.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. The Minister will remember that I have asked a number of questions regarding the review of Commonwealth electoral legislation. The first such review was produced on 22 August 1979 and has not been released or acted upon. The second such review was announced by the Minister on 2 December 1980. On 23 April 1981 in a letter to me the Minister referred to the current review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act as nearing completion. On 29 October 1981 in an answer to a question from Mr Hayden the Minister stated that the review was thorough and wide ranging and that he was seeking views and opinions from a wide variety of sources. Is this review of 2 December 1980, which 12 months ago today was supposedly nearing completion, now complete? When can the Parliament expect to be able to have the report tabled? Is the Government afraid of what the review contains and, therefore, is it suppressing the report as apparently it did in the case of the earlier review? Does the review contain recommendations for reform along the lines discussed by the Minister with the Minister for the Capital Territory for the inclusion of party affiliations on the ballot papers for the forthcoming Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly election?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the Government's assessment of claims persistently made this month that the Soviet Union is supplying and using directly or indirectly chemical weapons or the so-called yellow rain against the people of Laos, Afghanistan and Eritrea? Also, in the light of these assessments , what credibility can be given to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Embassy's Soviet News Bulletin dated 19 April this year, circulated to senators and members this week, with its propagandistic headline 'Chemical Weapons should be Banned'? Will the Australian Government roundly condemn and systematically resist the use of chemical weapons such as those alleged to be distributed and used by the Soviet Union?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I understand that the Foreign Minister made some comments on this subject yesterday. I will deal with the information as I have it. If any further information is required I will ask the Foreign Minister to provide a response to Senator Teague. The Government has been concerned for some time at the allegations of the use of chemical weapons in Indo-China, Afghanistan and elsewhere. On 22 March 1982 the United States of America Secretary of State, Mr Haig, submitted to Congress a report on chemical warfare in South East Asia and Afghanistan. The report summarises an impressive body of data collected by the United States on chemical weapons usage in these areas. A group of United States experts in the field of chemical weapons is currently in Australia and has discussed the report's findings with officials from relevant departments as part of a process of on-going consultations and studies on the subject. The team was assured of Australia's support for efforts to investigate thoroughly the reports of alleged chemical weapons usage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, the Government has itself agreed to examine reported evidence of chemical weapons use in South East Asia. Samples of vegetable material said to have been the subject of chemical weapons attack have been obtained by the Australian Embassy in Bangkok from the Thai-Lao border region. Arrangements are being made to transport the samples to Australia where they will be the subject of scientific analysis. In addition, two government experts are currently in Bangkok and have made arrangements to examine a rocket grenade said to be a chemical weapon. A report has been received from the experts and is now under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia co-sponsored the resolution which established the United Nations committee of experts examining the allegations of the use of chemical weapons and has played an active part in efforts to conclude a treaty which would impose a comprehensive and fully verifiable ban on chemical weapons. The findings of any Australian investigations which it was believed could advance international consideration of this question will be conveyed to the United Nations committee established to examine allegations of the use of such weapons. As I said, if any further detail is required in response to Senator Teague's question, I will see that that is dealt with by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>

Senator Coleman asks specifically whether I am aware of a formal proposal from the Australian Medical Association as to what arrangements might be made to take its place. I am not aware of a formal proposal. I take it that the honourable senator is referring to an arrangement whereby the AMA, through the Medical Journal of Australia or through some other vehicle, might take on a function.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think some incorrect inferences have been drawn concerning the review of the National Health and Medical Research Council. An internal review of the Council normally occurs at regular intervals-each two or three years. The present review, however, is an external review to look at the functions, the structure and the operations of the Council in relation to its effectiveness and to consider matters of efficiency and cost. The review is not secret in any way. It was announced by the Minister to the Australian Society for Medical Research in December. The importance of that announcement, of course , is that that society took in much of the medical research establishment in Australia. The Minister announced to that body that the review would be taking place. For anyone to assert that it is a secret review is simply incorrect. My predecessor's actions are simply not consistent with anyone's assertion that this has been a secret operation. The review has been mentioned in correspondence and in submissions from people. Submissions to the review have been invited from a large number of organisations which have an interest in medical research in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

My experience with most of these reviews is that if somebody has an important submission to put in most reviewers are fairly flexible.

I will make contact with the people conducting the review and seek to have them considered along with others.</PARA>

Although this review is restricted to medical research it is not irrelevant to the review on ASTEC and we would want to link together our responses to both of these reports.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. I refer to the application by the city of Port Augusta for approval in principle to enter into the Commonwealth aerodrome local ownership plan and matters relating to the upgrading of the Port Augusta aerodrome. Is the Minister aware that Port Augusta is the base of the flying doctor service in South Australia, that it is the regional headquarters for many government departments, that it is the obvious base for the whole of the pastoral region of South Australia, and that it is receiving increased use from mining companies and has major potential in relation to the development and servicing of Roxby Downs? In view of the significance of the city in the exciting development of the Iron Triangle and the totally unsatisfactory state of the strip, with instances of stones being picked up by propellors and damaging aircraft and one instance of a passenger being injured when a stone was thrown through the windscreen of an aircraft, what is the current state of the city's application? Does the Government appreciate the urgency of the matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matters which have been outlined in Senator Hill's question are in fact substantially correct. In fact, Port Augusta is a most important developing centre of South Australia and is strategically placed for the forthcoming boom, led by the Tonkin Government, in that State. The subject of Senator Hill's concern-the upgrading of the air strip in that area-is something which will become of even greater importance as Port Augusta develops.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the details of negotiations, at this stage of the game it is a matter of some detailed negotiation between the Government and the city of Port Augusta, as I understand it. I am unable to comment precisely as to how far that has reached at this stage. However, it is clear that the Federal Government supports the entry of Port Augusta into the scheme with works of a slightly lesser scope than those which were originally proposed. No doubt that is the subject of the negotiations. As to when this might be finalised, naturally this would be an area of Government consideration in terms of Budget needs. No doubt it will be taken into account in the forthcoming Budget discussions.</PARA>

We do not yet have a resolution of that matter.

<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) It is correct that there is only one exporter licensed to export apples and pears from Tasmania, namely the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Marketing Authority ( TAMA). </PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is correct that the Australian Apple and Pear Growers' Association supports the issue of additional licences. I am not in a position to know whether or not this view is supported by the majority of Tasmanian growers. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is correct that the Apple and Pear Corporation received applications from six additional companies to export apples and pears from Tasmania. These applications were received in early February this year. The Corporation recommended to me that the applications should be rejected. It considered that the granting of additional licences to export from Tasmania would be contrary to the clearly defined policy of the State Government that exporting from Tasmania should take place only through TAMA and would be damaging to the long term development of export marketing from the State and the interests of growers. I accepted the Corporation's recommendation and rejected the applications. In receiving the Corporation's recommendation I am not informed of or obliged to take into account the votes of individual members on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) It is correct that the Corporation has received renewed applications for licences to export from Tasmania. These were considered at a special meeting of the Corporation yesterday. In accordance with the Regulations, the Corporation will submit its recommendations to me and I will then determine the applications . </PARA>
<PARA> (5) At this stage it is difficult to assess the effect of such a diversion on mainland prices. I am advised however that, subject to varietal preferences by mainland consumers, there should be scope to absorb additional quantities of Tasmanian apples on the mainland market as apple production in the Eastern States this season is estimated to be some 2 million cases less than in 1981. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Public Assemblies Ordinance 1982, as contained in the Australian Capital Territory Ordinance No. 10 of 1982 and made under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910, be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA>I move disallowance of this Ordinance on the grounds that it is not wanted by the people of the Australian Capital Territory, who will have to operate under its provisions. As evidence of my view that this Ordinance is not wanted by anyone in the Australian Capital Territory, I refer honourable senators to today 's Canberra Times where there is an account of a meeting held between the Australian Federal Police and the representatives of various organisations and groups who wish to march in the Anzac Day procession on Sunday. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that the Ordinance we are currently debating replaces an ordinance introduced in great haste for last Anzac Day at the behest of the Returned Services League because it wished to limit the right of participation in the Anzac Day ceremony in a very special way. That Ordinance was extremely controversial and quite unworkable. The Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, replaced it at a very late stage with the current Ordinance. Yesterday a meeting was held to discuss how that Ordinance would be implemented on Sunday when various organisations wish to participate in the Anzac memorial service. I quote from today's report in the Canberra Times the words of Mr Alf Clarke from the RSL organisation. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> While happy with the discussions, he was far from pleased with the Public Assemblies Ordinance and recent reports of RSL participation in its drafting. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Clarke is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We were not consulted in any way about this ordinance. As far as the league is concerned it creates far more problems than it solves. We'd be better off without it . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The only right of appeal under it is to the Supreme Court which, due to the expense of that kind of action rules out any of the smaller groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the league would have to think twice. Effectively there is no appeal. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Clarke's comments on the ordinance were echoed by a representative of the Interim Committee on Civil Liberties who said, 'The meeting made it perfectly obvious that none of the groups involved in the discussions liked the ordinance at all. It is very badly drafted and it's got all sorts of inconsistencies and loopholes. </PARA>
<PARA> We'll certainly be joining the chorus against it. It's bad and it ought to be repealed.'</PARA>
<PARA>If we have got to a stage where the very organisation, namely, the RSL, that initially wanted an ordinance to control the Anzac Day march is saying that the proposed Ordinance is so unworkable and so anomalous that the RSL believes that it would be better off without it, why are we proceeding with this Ordinance at all? It is very clear that a whole range of other organisations, civil liberties organisations in the Australian Capital Territory do not want the Ordinance. The locally elected body of the Australian Capital Territory, the House of Assembly, has rejected the Ordinance and has asked the Minister to set about in consultation with the Assembly, working on an Act of Parliament which will set out clearly the rights of assembly of Australian Capital Territory citizens. So at this stage no recognised group in the Australian Capital Territory wants this Ordinance. I understand from reports of yesterday's meeting that the Australian Federal Police who will be responsible for the enforcement of the Ordinance are unhappy with the Ordinance. I understand also that representatives of the Australian War Memorial, the body which undertakes the organisational responsibility for Anzac Day, is also responsible for the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> So I ask honourable senators to consider at this stage why this Ordinance should not be disallowed. I ask honourable senators to support my motion for disallowance. It seems to me entirely wrong that this chamber should proceed with a piece of legislation which is clearly now not wanted by any relevant group or organisation within the Australian Capital Territory. I urge honourable senators to reconsider their position in the light of what these groups have said in the last couple of days. Earlier on it did seem that some groups wanted the Ordinance. Now they do not. In my view and speaking from the most fundamental democratic principle that laws ought to reflect the wishes of the people who will be regulated by them, there is no case for doing anything other than disallowing this Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> Some anxiety and fear has been expressed as to what will happen if we succeed in disallowing this Ordinance today and there is no specific ordinance operable on Sunday when the Anzac Day service takes place. I simply answer that question by pointing out to honourable senators that until Anzac Day last year, in the Australian Capital Territory there was no special ordinance. The Anzac Day commemorative service, like all other public assemblies in the Australian Capital Territory, was carried out under and regulated by a variety of public peace law and order regulations which still exist and, of course, the common law which still operates. So it seems to me that there would not be a legal vacuum of any significance should this Ordinance be disallowed. It also seems to me that because of the wide-ranging discussion and debate in the community about what should happen on Anzac Day all groups will be acting with good will and seeking to avoid giving offence to any other group. I cannot see any problems arising if we have no ordinance on Anzac Day. On the other hand, if the Senate fails to disallow the Ordinance today and the police have responsibility of trying to enforce this Ordinance on Anzac Day, I think there will be numerous problems. That view is shared by a number of people, not least of which are the Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> Before proceeding to discuss the Ordinance in detail, I state very clearly what the Australian Labor Party's position is in relation to this whole episode. It is our position that we recognise the significance of Anzac Day as a major national day of significance. Labor Party people have always participated in Anzac Day commemorative services. I believe that they will continue to do so. We believe that all groups in the community ought to have the opportunity to commemorate Anzac Day in the way that they see fit, providing that that way is a dignified and orderly way and a way that does not give offence to any other groups. Indeed, that has been the history of Anzac Day. Until the recent intervention of Mr Hodgman in the Australian Capital Territory, we were able to participate in Anzac Day services here quite peacefully. I have had the honour to represent the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) at the local Anzac Day observances on a number of occasions. On other occasions I have participated as a citizen, as have many of my colleagues from the ALP in the Australian Capital Territory. In no sense can our opposition to this Ordinance be seen as any kind of criticism or any kind of undermining of the traditional significance of Anzac Day-quite the contrary. It is because we are concerned that Anzac Day should continue to be observed in an orderly and sympathetic way that we want this provocative Ordinance removed. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe also, when it comes to legislation, that laws ought to be framed in a way so that they protect the rights of individuals and not encroach on them. That is our fundamental objection to this Ordinance. It does not protect rights, it infringes rights. We believe that the role of the law is to promote order and not to promote disorder. Again, of course, it is clear that if this Ordinance is not disallowed today, it will promote disorder. It should be stated, too-I would like to state it as an Australian Capital Territory senator-that I do not see any fundamental conflict in the values and wishes of the various groups which have become involved locally in the Anzac Day debate. For example, I do not see any conflict between the aims of the civil liberty organisation, or the peace and disarmament organisation and the aims of the traditional Anzac Day observance. It seems that when our soldiers fought in major world wars they were fighting for things like civil liberties and peace in the community. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should be pointed out that the group called Women Against Rape, which because of its desire to participate in Anzac Day last year provoked the whole sequence of events, has decided, I think very sensibly, not to participate in the main Anzac Day march this year. It has announced that it will not attempt to join or participate in the main march. It will conduct its own commemorative service at 9 a.m. on Sunday which is a time before the Ordinance comes into effect, if the Ordinance is in effect on Sunday. I think that organisation's sensible and co-operative attitude ought to be acknowledged at this stage. But again, the objectives of the group seem to be not in conflict in any way with the traditional objectives of the Anzac Day commemorative service. The Anzac Day commemorative service seems to be a way of commemorating all the people who were victims of war. Certainly, I do not think that anyone would disagree that women who have been victims of rape in war are victims of war in a similar way to those who lost their lives or who were subjected to serious injury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In trying to assess the whole situation objectively, there have been a number of groups who wanted to participate. Their objectives were not fundamentally in conflict, but mainly because of the over-reaction of the Minister for the Capital Territory last year the whole situation has become chaotic and one which has been very distressing for the Australian Capital Territory community. I ask honourable senators to consider that. It has not been an easy time discussing this because a lot of people of goodwill have been brought into conflict with other people of goodwill in a way that has been very distressing. I hope we all feel that we have a responsibility to find some resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> I proceed now to some specific comments on the Ordinance, because, as I said when I had an opportunity to comment on this Ordinance yesterday, it is a very badly drafted Ordinance. It has a number of serious legal difficulties. It is for those sorts of reasons that the Senate would be acting quite responsibly if it decided to support my disallowance motion today. Let us look at what the Ordinance does. First of all, it sets out a provision whereby there should be on some days of the year a limited participation assembly rather than a public assembly. A public assembly means an assembly of not fewer than three persons who are assembled for a common purpose in a public place, whether other persons are assembled with them and whether the assembly is at a particular place or moving. A limited participation assembly is one held on Anzac Day, Canberra Day or such other days as may be declared under section 4 to be days of special significance. For such an assembly there is a special notification procedure whereby the authorised participants in the assembly may be limited to certain defined classes of persons. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the first major provision of the Ordinance. To have certain days set aside as limited assembly days is, in itself, a restriction of the rights of citizens. Why cannot Anzac Day and, for that matter, Canberra Day, which is a family festival day, be public assembly days when normal public rights to assemble are maintained? The Ordinance restricts the public's rights on such days. I believe it extends ministerial powers because it is the Minister who will decide whether a day is of special significance, thus restricting the rights of assembly of citizens on that day. It is my view, as a former member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, that the extension of ministerial powers, if they are to be extended, ought to be done by an Act of Parliament and not simply by delegated legislation. Honourable senators will recall that delegated legislation ought to be confined to fairly minor areas of behaviour and not relate to major matters, such as are provided for by the new ministerial powers under this Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the notification procedure. To obtain authorisation for an assembly the organiser must, in the first place, give to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police not less than seven days notice of a proposed public assembly or not less than 14 days notice of a proposed limited participation assembly. The notice must specify the name and address of the organiser, the name and address of the organisation or body represented, the date, time, place, purpose, proposed route, and anticipated number of anticipants and, in the case of a limited participation assembly, the particular persons or classes of persons to whom it is proposed that participation in the assembly should be limited. On the same day that the notice of a proposed limited participation assembly is served on the Commissioner, a copy of the notice must also be published in a local daily newspaper. If the Commissioner does not, within three days of receiving the notice, or within seven days of receiving the notice in the case of a limited participation assembly, inform the organiser that he or she opposes the assembly then the assembly will be considered to be authorised. Within these time limits the Commissioner may inform the organiser that he or she does not oppose the assembly, either unconditionally or subject to certain terms and conditions. If the organiser does not accept such terms and conditions the organiser may apply to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory for a review and the court has a wide power to affirm, set aside or vary the Commissioner's decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner may also within the time limits inform the organiser that he or she opposes the assembly. Further, the Commissioner may apply to the court for an order prohibiting the assembly but must first confer with the organiser and consider the organiser's representations. On the Commissioner's application to the court the court may, in its discretion, prohibit the assembly or impose terms and conditions in relation to its conduct. In making such an order the court must have regard to the public interest and, in particular, the likelihood that the proposed assembly would occasion serious public disorder or damage to property, place the safety of any person in jeopardy or cause an unreasonable obstruction. If less than seven days notice is given of a public assembly which is not a limited participation assembly the commissioner may inform the organiser that he or she does not oppose the proposed assembly either unconditionally or subject to terms and conditions or that he or she opposes it and intends to apply to the court for a prohibition order. The review procedure is the same as previously described. If the Commissoner does not so inform the organiser the assembly is considered to be unauthorised although the organiser may apply to the court for an order authorising the assembly. The organiser must have regard for the public interest and may specify terms and conditions. The Commissioner may then apply to the court for an order revoking the court's authorisation. The inducement for organisers to apply to the Commissioner for authorisation of a proposed assembly is under section 20 of the Ordinance which states that a person who participates in the assembly is not by reason only of that participation guilty of an offence against any law of the Territory relating to the movement or free passage of traffic or pedestrians or the obstruction of a person or vehicle in a public place. Failure to seek authorisation or participation in an unauthorised assembly is not itself, a criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spelled out the procedures whereby assemblies under this Ordinance now have to be authorised in the Australian Capital Territory and, from that fairly summary description, honourable senators will see that the procedure is extraordinarily complex and involves appeals to the Supreme Court which are extremely expensive, especially for community groups without resources and that the time involved in getting authorisation for an assembly is, I believe, unreasonably long. It seems to me that procedures like this fly in the face of our common law traditions of the right to assemble. A right to assemble should be a natural and straightforward right in a democracy. Here we have a series of complex, cumbersome and time-consuming requirements that a citizen has to go through to exercise something which ought to be a natural and straightforward right in a democracy. That is one of our objections-not our major objection-to this Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> I will proceed with comments on the Ordinance. There is the provision whereby people are authorised to join limited participation assemblies. In the case of a limited participation assembly where authorisation is sought only in respect of particular persons or classes of persons, other persons may, within four days of the publication of the notice, apply to the Commissioner for approval of their proposed participation in the assembly. The Commissioner shall approve the participation in the assembly of the relevant person or persons unless he is of the opinion that that participation would not be in the public interest. The Commissioner has to have regard to certain things when forming that opinion. The Commissioner must inform both the applicant and the organiser of the proposed assembly of his decision and of the reasons for the decision. An applicant or organiser aggrieved by this decision must apply to the court for review. Again in respect of the Commissioner's powers to grant participation in limited participation assemblies the provision for review to the court is something which will be burdensome to the average citizen and average community group. Again we have cumbersome and expensive procedures for the exercise of what ought to be a basic right in a democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> When we pass to the offences provided for in the Ordinance we find further cause for concern. Conduct causing or provoking a breach of the peace is made an offence by section 24 (1) although breach of the peace is not defined, and that is one of the many inadequacies in this Ordinance. Section 24 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> When a police officer of or above the rank of Sergeant has reasonable grounds for believing that the conduct of a person in or near a public assembly is likely to cause or provoke a breach of the peace by any person, he may direct the first-mentioned person to leave the vicinity of the public assembly. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 24 (3) states that a person who contravenes such a direction is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine of $200. In the case of a limited participation assembly any unauthorised person who participates or attempts to participate in such an assembly may be directed by a police officer of the rank of sergeant or above not to participate, under section 25 (1). Section 24 (3) states:</PARA>
<PARA> A person who contravenes a direction given to him under sub-section (2) is guilty of an offence and punishable, on conviction, by a fine not exceeding $200 . </PARA>
<PARA>I draw honourable senators' attention to the fact that no guidelines are given in the Ordinance as to when a police officer should give a direction, and such an unlimited discretion is likely to cause problems for the police. </PARA>
<PARA> In what circumstances should a direction be given? Should a police officer give a direction only when he or she fears public disorder or whenever an unauthorised person makes an attempt to participate in the assembly? If the latter is the case, the effect of the law is that a person who fails to obey a police officer's direction by peacefully participating in the assembly commits a criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 24 (2) concerning a breach of the peace again is a very difficult provision to implement. I draw the attention of the Senate to clause 24 (2) which states:</PARA>
<PARA> When a police officer of or above the rank of Sergeant has reasonable grounds for believing that the conduct of a person in or near a public assembly is likely to cause or provoke a breach of the peace by any person, he may direct the first-mentioned person to leave the vicinity of the public assembly. </PARA>
<PARA>What does this mean? It could mean, for example, that one person participating in the Anzac Day March is dressed in a manner which is unacceptable to another group-for example, the Returned Services League. If that is the case the police officer may come to the conclusion that a certain person who has been authorised to march is, by his very appearance, provocative to the RSL. In that case, the first person who was properly authorised to join the march may be directed by the police to leave the march on the grounds that his very appearance may provoke a breach of the peace. I do not think those sorts of provisions are the sorts of provisions that the Senate ought to approve. I think they are contradictory because it is already the case that certain groups have permission to march. It is already the case that the RSL has expressed opposition to that. So we have a provision which has in itself an internal contradiction and police officers will be put in a very invidious position in trying to implement it. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the powers given to the Police Commissioner under the Ordinance, it is apparent from a close study of the Ordinance that the Commissioner's powers to authorise, impose powers and conditions or oppose a proposed assembly are extensive, notwithstanding the opportunity for review by the Supreme Court. The Government seems to have overreacted in seeking wider powers to control public assemblies than would appear to be strictly necessary. That the Commissioner can delegate his powers under the Ordinance to a police officer of the rank of sergeant or above is also a matter of concern. I understand that my colleague, Senator Evans, will have more to say on the particular provisions of the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I draw honourable senators' attention to the fact that what we have in general terms is an excessively complicated, sometimes difficult to comprehend Ordinance which, by its very nature, is likely to hinder citizens in the exercise of their freedom of assembly. I remind honourable senators that it is the responsibility of the Senate to examine all delegated legislation. That responsibility is carried out primarily by the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee, which in this instance has decided not to recommend disallowance of the Ordinance. But that decision of the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee does not absolve the Senate of its responsibility to assure itself that any delegated legislation approved by the Senate is, in fact, in keeping with our general position on the rights of individuals in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to honourable senators, notwithstanding the failure of the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee to recommend disallowance, that this Ordinance does trample unduly on civil rights and liberties, that it does make civil rights and liberties unduly dependent on administrative decisions, namely, the decisions of the Commissioner, and that it will provoke breaches of the peace rather than assure peace and orderly conduct of the Anzac Day service and any other public assembly which is held under its provisions. It is an Ordinance which has not met the requirements of any group in the community. It will simply make the exercise of individual freedoms very troublesome indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I exhort honourable senators to support my disallowance motion. I remind them that it is the view of the locally elected Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly that the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) ought to proceed to develop appropriate public assemblies legislation in consultation with all the local groups. He should do that by an Act of Parliament so that we, as senators, will have an opportunity from the beginning to be involved in the debate rather than only, as in the case of delegated legislation, having the power simply to allow or disallow. This is not an ordinance which will solve any problems. It will promote problems. It is not an ordinance which will lead to orderly conduct of the Anzac Day commemorative service. It is not an ordinance which I believe fulfils the criteria the Senate ought to apply to any legislation it approves and it ought to be disallowed. </PARA>

It is clear to me that the Australian Labor Party, as usual, is trying to have two bob each way. Senator Ryan is putting forward to the Senate the proposition that because all of these groups, including the Returned Services League, are alleged to be opposed to the Public Assemblies Ordinance, it ought to be disallowed. But we all know that the objection which the Returned Services League is expressing in relation to this Ordinance is that it is not restrictive enough. It believes that the Ordinance should be totally restrictive, and that it should control the march totally and it should determine who should participate. We all know that Senator Ryan and her colleagues Senator Evans and Senator Coates are putting forward the proposition that participation ought to be totally unlimited and that that is why the Ordinance ought to be disallowed. With typical fervour Senator Ryan and her colleagues come into this chamber and say that the Ordinance ought to be disallowed because the Returned Services League is opposed to it when, in fact, the Returned Services League is opposed to it for directly contrary views to the views they are putting forward.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only way in which we can resolve the disputes beforehand is by having a limited participation march and setting out certain procedures in order to resolve the disputes between the parties. That is what this Ordinance does. It enables the disputes between the parties to be resolved beforehand. I totally reject what Senator Ryan has put forward to the Senate; namely, that this Ordinance is badly drafted. This Ordinance protects the rights of individuals in this community to participate in the march. It is reported in today's Canberra Times that, as Senator Ryan mentioned, all groups, including the Returned Services League, are dissatisfied with the Ordinance. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the statements made. They are very interesting. Mr Clarke is reported as saying that he is opposed to the Ordinance but he also is reported as saying, in reference to the meeting between the participating groups which took place yesterday:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . worked well and we reached a reasonable consensus: it was a worthwhile exercise. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ritchie, representing the Ex-Servicemen for Peace and Disarmament, is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the gap between us and the Returned Services League is not as wide as it might have appeared. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the committee anticipated would happen. In other words, an educative process is taking place whereby the people will come together to try to resolve their disputation and come up with a consensus. There is much talk in this place, especially by Senator Chipp, about consensus. We have the Government bringing forward an innovatory ordinance which enables people to resolve their differences before they march and which we hope will enable us to have a peaceful march, and Senator Chipp says that I do not know what I am talking about and that apparently I am a fool. Well Senator Chipp does not know what he is talking about and he may very well be a fool. I suggest that the critics, including Senator Chipp, have not properly considered the wording of this Ordinance. I suggest to Senator Chipp and to the other honourable senators who are opposing this Ordinance that they apply their minds to the Ordinance and to the procedures which it sets out. They should stop worrying about whether the Minister ought to have introduced it earlier and all the peripheral things, and apply their minds to whether we should have a limited participation march or an unlimited participation march and to how we should go about it. If there is to be an unlimited participation march, which will cause chaos next Sunday in the Australian Capital Territory, then by all means honourable senators must support the disallowance motion. We will then know precisely where we stand. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view that there ought to be a national celebration in Canberra on Anzac Day. I believe that the national celebration should be limited to the memory of fallen comrades. I do not believe that the celebration ought to be conducted by the RSL. I believe that the celebration ought to be conducted by the service chiefs who ought to determine who should participate. That happens to be my personal view as to what should happen. This Ordinance is a fair Ordinance for those who are interested in civil liberties. This Ordinance goes as far as one could possibly expect it to go to enable other groups to participate. I would not want the other groups to participate, but as a civil libertarian and as the chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances I am prepared to support this Ordinance. I strongly urge all honourable senators in this chamber to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will disregard everything that Senator Lewis has said except the last part of his speech. I thought that ought to be commended. I think that is an innovative, positive and sensible proposition. It is one that I think the Senate and the Parliament ought to consider. As I said in my remarks last night, as an ex- serviceman I regard Anzac Day as a special day, a sacred day and a solemn day. It commemorates a group of occasions that I say are quite different from a march to protest against proposed laws, a march to protest against nuclear energy or whatever. I concede that there is a respectable argument to be made out for Anzac Day and what it stands for, not the glory of war that some gung ho generals would like it to be, but for the reason that Senator Lewis has said, that is, simply to allow this nation, and particularly former servicemen, to pay as high a tribute as they can to fallen comrades and the families of fallen comrades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hate to ascribe to myself what might seem to be a flattering adjective, but I will go on to say that I will take a broader minded view of the way in which Anzac Day should be celebrated and the march itself. Because I am an ex- serviceman I would like to see the march limited to that purpose alone. I have marched in Anzac Day marches. I would not have been too upset had people joined in that march, such as women against rape, the gay ex-servicemen of Vietnam, or whoever, provided they were peaceful, provided they did it with dignity and were not sending it up or ridiculing it in any way. I would not have been upset if they had tagged on to the end of the march. In the same way, I would not be at all upset-in fact I would have been pleased in the various anti-uranium or anti- nuclear marches that I have had the honour to lead-if pro-nuclear people joined in in a dignified way carrying their placards, flags or whatever. Surely to God in a democracy we should have reached a stage of civilised behaviour in this country where we can use the streets for purposes of demonstration, whether it be demonstrating against something, such as an anti-nuclear march, or demonstrating for something in the way ex-servicemen demonstrate with respect to their fallen comrades. I have a great sympathy for the people who wish to march for that pure purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I have respect for a great number of members of the RSL, although I cannot say that I agree with or respect some of the statements that members of the hierarchy make. I think that would not be too far from the view that Senator Lewis would have. The thoughts and memories in the minds of those men and women who march on Anzac Day are quite different from and cannot be compared with the thoughts and memories of those who march in protest against nuclear armament or whatever. There are people who care about the future, and who can conjure up in their minds and want to conjure up in the minds of other people the horrific picture of a nuclear holocaust and who, therefore, protest against nuclear armament; but even that does not compare with the memory that is conjured up in the minds of men and women who march in remembrance of their comrades who were shot down or killed beside them in war. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, one must acknowledge that we do not live in a perfect society , that there will be idiots and fruitcakes who will want to join in Anzac Day marches and perhaps spoil them, ridicule them or send them up. I deplore those people. I think a majority of people in the Senate would do so also. All we are saying is: Is bringing in legislation the right way to discourage those people? Can we legislate for that sort of human behaviour? All we are saying is that we cannot. </PARA>

I think Senator Lewis and his Committee have done a damned good job in the circumstances in trying to get some sense out of this matter. I am opposing the Ordinance and my four colleagues, without caucusing the matter as a party, will be opposing it essentially because it is very difficult to legislate for human behaviour. I would have thought that, over a period, the sorts of people who want to denigrate the Anzac Day march by joining in, by disrupting it or by adding capricious or facetious purposes to it would be dealt with by their peers, their neighbours and the community. They will do so much damage to their own cause by acting in that way. They will do far more damage to their cause than any law or any police officer could do.

This morning's Canberra Times carries a report about an idiot in Canberra who has painted an enormous swastika on his garage. We could say: 'Let's send the police around to get him to wipe it off; it is offensive to a great number of people'. We could handle it in that way. But that idiot will be dealt with very quickly by his neighbours, by his peers. We believe that is the best way to tackle the problem. If people interrupt and cash in on the platform provided by Anzac Day for their own purposes and jar the people who respect Anzac Day and what it stands for the community will deal with them. I believe that in the normal processes of a civilised society these people would drop off over a period of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What my colleagues and I object to is that by getting government to interdict in this sort of situation we are bringing in a steam-hammer to hit a tack. We would have to give the Commissioner of Police powers that are frightening. The Commissioner happens to be a most honourable, decent, responsible person, and this is meant as no criticism of him; but the Ordinance allows him to delegate certain powers to the policeman on the beat. I think it is unfair to that policeman or policewoman on the beat and is quite dangerous to delegate to him or her powers whereby he or she can take certain action if he or she forms in his or her mind that a certain action is likely to cause public disorder. If Senator Lewis, as a self-confessed civil libertarian, contemplates that prospect for a moment, he must see that that can lead to the kind of disputation, the kind of public disorder, which he is genuinely trying to prevent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak very briefly at this stage, having contributed to the debate yesterday on the report of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I would like to try to avoid referring at all to the fact that Anzac Day is on the coming Sunday. Of course, this Ordinance is meant to cover assemblies, whether standing or marching, for all time. It is supposedly to cover not just Anzac Day. Of course, at this stage we have a great problem because we should have dealt with the Ordinance much earlier in the year, with the draft of the Ordinance being much more advanced by the time the Parliament resumed at the beginning of this year. It is most unfortunate that we are dealing with it in this current atmosphere. It arises because of the events of Anzac Day last year and, therefore, we cannot avoid dealing with it in this atmosphere. But we ought, I suppose, try to look at the matter in much more general terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to concentrate on the concept of limitation of participation which, as everyone now knows, is available only in respect of assemblies on days of special significance as defined by the Minister, in addition to Canberra Day and Anzac Day. My whole problem with this matter centres on that question of limited participation, if it is to be justified at all, to be available only in respect of those days. I think this is the sort of problem with which Senator Chipp was grappling. When Senator Lewis spoke today, as he did in the debate on this matter yesterday, as far as I am concerned he argued in favour of limited participation being available for all public assemblies. That was the gist of his comments. He was arguing that it was better to be able to define participants in advance and, therefore, avoid the sorts of disputes that could arise on the day. He still has not argued at all on the matter of providing limited participation only on such days. </PARA>
<PARA> I concede that there is an argument for limited participation. I do not agree with it. I would prefer it if all assemblies were open. The reason that limited participation was included was that the problem of disputes could arise. If it is justifiable why should not everybody be able to take advantage of that sort of condition? I would have thought that there would have been more logical argument for it in the case of a more private march, a more one-sided march, rather than a march on a day where everybody is supposed to be commemorating the one event, the one point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned this distinction between days of special significance and other public assemblies is easily sufficient to support disallowance of this Ordinance, quite apart from other details to which I have an objection. So whatever happens with this vote on this Ordinance today I think the whole question of the concept of limited participation should be debated and reviewed. In that way, after Anzac Day, and after this whole current dispute has been resolved one way or another, there can be a thorough and reasonable debate about whether or not limited participation ought to be available at all and, if it is to be, whether it ought to be restricted only to some types of assemblies and, more particularly, whether it ought to be limited to days of national significance, on these days on which there ought to be most reason for broad public participation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did. My point is that the RSL was not consulted by the Minister in the creation of this Ordinance. That is one of the reasons perhaps why it is defective. I do not say it is defective in a radical way, but it is defective. As I said, the Australian Capital Territory Select Committee was the only forum before which community organisations in the Australian Capital Territory had an opportunity to put their points of view. So it had submissions referred to it by the Returned Services League of Australia, the standing committee of the Australian Capital Territory Council for Civil Liberties, various individuals, the Council for Civil Liberties, the religious Society of Friends and so on. So there was consultation by the Select Committee of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. That House, a responsibly elected body, came to the conclusion that the Ordinance ought to be disallowed. I think that fact should weigh with us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I believe it is possible to come in good faith to the conclusion that the Ordinance does not unduly trespass on civil liberties. The Labor Party, after fair-minded discussion within its committees and within Caucus, particularly after considering the sections dealing with breaches of the peace, still felt such disquiet that it felt its concern should find expression in this disallowance motion. I do not want it thought that those who come to a different conclusion in respect of those sections are acting in bad faith or in a purely political or partisan manner. I think Senator Lewis has acted throughout in a proper way and in good faith. But the Labor Party has come to the conclusion that the sections dealing with breaches of the peace do not incorporate sufficiently objective criteria dealing with what might be provocative conduct. I know that Senator Evans can express that particular case far more eloquently than I. But it is a matter of judgment and that is the judgment to which our party has come. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is some merit in the Ordinance, in what I would call the compulsory conference provisions. It is a fact that when one reads the Ordinance those provisions can appear to be somewhat cumbersome. But in fact, various groups have found themselves able to come before the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and work out a modus vivendi. Groups which have been given permission to march under conditions that are agreed to by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Sir Colin Woods, include the Interim Committee for the Council for Civil Liberties in the Australian Capital Territory, the Canberra College of Advanced Education students and the Ex- servicemen for Peace and Disarmament group. As reported in the Canberra Times, Mr David Ritchie from the Ex-servicemen for Peace and Disarmament group and somebody else speaking for the civil liberties group have, in fact, indicated that they found these compulsory conference provisions helpful in reaching a situation where, indeed, their participation in the assembly may take place without undue upset. To that extent there is some merit in the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> But, on balance, the Labor Party has come to the conclusion that the Ordinance is defective. Largely, I think this is because of the speed with which parliamentarians and the local community have had to consider the matter. The fact is that it was not until 25 February of this year, some nine months after Anzac Day of last year, that the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances was presented with even a first draft. So rather than having the summer period in which to deal with this matter-the Committee had intended to come back in early January to deal with it in a more leisurely and less frenzied atmosphere than prevails when Parliament is sitting-we had this first draft of the Ordinance presented to us a week into the autumn session. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had two months of constant parliamentary and political activity, frenzied activity, since then. The Minister, in fact, could not produce the Ordinance until 25 March, three or four weeks ago. So the Parliament and the local community have had this Ordinance in front of them in a final agreed form for only some three weeks. I think this really leads to the conclusion that the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Michael Hodgman, and the Government must bear the responsibility for the disallowance of this Ordinance should the Senate agree with the case being put forward by Senator Ryan and others in that the Minister has not allowed enough time for community consultation and the parliamentary processes so to refine the Ordinance, if there is to be a law governing public assemblies, as to make it acceptable to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, what concerns me is that whilst I believe that we should take special note of what the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly has to say on this Ordinance, which will govern activity within the area for which it is responsible, an ordinance dealing with public assemblies in the Australian Capital Territory will be seen as a model by other governments, whether of the States or Territories, which purports to implement and to carry into effect the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The objects clause of the Ordinance states:</PARA>
<PARA> The objects of this Ordinance are--</PARA>
<PARA>Amongst other things-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to recognize the right of peaceful assembly in accordance with Article 21 of the Covenant, a copy of the English text of which is set out in the Schedule . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Covenant is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That is what needs to concern the Senate. If it were to endorse this Ordinance it would be saying to other State and Territory parliaments of Australia that this is a model which carries into effect the purport of the International Covenant. I believe that the Senate, given the very short time which it has had to consider this Ordinance, would be acting improperly in giving its imprimatur to what will be seen to be model legislation for the rest of Australia. It would be quite unsafe for the Senate to put forward this Ordinance as a national model and, for that reason, I support the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Walters is prepared to wait to the end in the hope that the force and fire of her rhetoric will turn the debate around we shall wait with eager anticipation to see whether that happens. I begin with the proposition that it is, although perhaps inevitable, a matter of real regret that this debate, limited as it is, has essentially turned into a debate about Anzac Day, the law relating to Anzac Day marches and what will happen or not happen on Sunday. I think it is terribly important to appreciate that we are not debating just an Anzac Day ordinance; we are debating a public assemblies ordinance which is intended to have universal and general application for an infinite period into the future. We are talking about a law governing all public assemblies in the Australian Capital Territory. We are talking about a law which intends to govern all public exercises of the right to free speech and assembly in the Territory. As such it is terribly important, if we possibly can, to strip out of our minds the emotion that is inevitably associated with the topic of Anzac Day-emotion which I can well understand even without the banality and pathos that we can undoubtedly expect on this subject from Senator Walters when she speaks. It is important that we strip our minds of these sorts of sentiments , focus rationally and calmly upon the language content and principles inherent in this legislation, make up our minds and vote accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday, I indicated-at rather more length than I had intended, I acknowledge -what I perceive to be the basic deficiencies of this legislation. I do not want today to repeat what I said yesterday. I just want to supplement those remarks in a couple of, I think, significant respects. But let me reiterate the basic objections. The more simple and straightforward one is that the Australian Capital Territory Public Assemblies Ordinance has not been the subject of approval by the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. After such careful consideration as it was able to give it in the time available, the House of Assembly simply was not happy with it. If we share any respect for the principles of local self-government in these matters we ought, as other speakers have said, to take this matter seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> The second concern I have about the Ordinance, which again I mentioned yesterday, is its complexity and extraordinarily confusing character and the difficulty that everyone will experience in trying to apply it. I think the most graphic way of expressing the maze-like complexity of this Ordinance is to look at the diagrams or charts prepared by Mr Robin Handley for the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly and which appear attached to the report of that Assembly dated March 1982. It is a matter for regret that technology has not got so far with Hansard that these tables can be photographically reproduced and incorporated in Hansard because I think they would graphically demonstrate to the Senate that it is just a maze. Something like 25 to 30 different procedural steps have to be walked through whether we are talking about straightforward public assemblies on the one hand or the even more complex category of limited participation assemblies on the other. It will be, and it has proved to be, in the experience of the last two or three weeks, simply a nightmare to make sense of this material. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole concept of the set of procedures that has been devised really does no credit, I think, to anything other than the creative imagination of the draftsman involved. Because the Ordinance is so complex it also means it is very expensive to apply these principles in practice should anyone be minded to express dissatisfaction with the decision made by the Commissioner or the police officer down to the level of sergeant who is entitled, if delegated that authority, to make these decision on behalf of the Commissioner. Anyone who is dissatisfied and wants to take the matter to court has to confront the possibility of an action in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. It is my understanding, as I said yesterday, that even the Returned Services League of Australia found itself unable to contemplate the cost that would be thus involved even though it is unhappy with the Commissioner's decision. I understand further that Mr Alf Clarke was heard to say yesterday that the League's estimate of the cost of a Supreme Court action in this matter was between $3,000 and $12,000. That is just out of the question. </PARA>
<PARA> The third objection related to the concept of the limited participation assembly. A lot has been said about that, and the only thing I wish to say in addition, in general terms, about this is that it seems to me to be the invention of some fertile brained bureaucrat with more ingenuity than commonsense. It is a unique concept; it does not exist in any other legislation anywhere in the Western world of which I am aware. It was a response to the perceived problems that existed in the Australian Capital Territory in the particular context of Anzac Day assembly. It is a concept that has created much of the confusion and complexity that is evident in the language of this Ordinance. There are difficulties about it conceptually in principle, that we spoke of yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> There are obvious practical difficulties about this in the application of the various criteria that have to be applied by the Commissioner in determining who is in and who is out and in the criteria that have to be applied by working policemen on the day of an assembly in determining which individuals are authorised to march and which ones are not. I believe that here, as elsewhere, there is a very strong case, as I said yesterday, for informal negotiation and discussions to proceed prior to any major public assembly in order to endeavour to achieve a reconciliation of the competing interests that are likely to be involved. There is no case whatsoever for building this kind of stuff into the tortured statutory language of an ordinance of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said by Senator Lewis today that the kinds of discussions that have taken place in recent days, and more particularly yesterday, by the various contending groups, mini-groups and potential groups were in fact a triumph for the procedures contained in this Ordinance. They were in fact an indication of just how much sense the compulsory conference notion had about it. But I remind Senator Lewis, who has come into the chamber and is nodding his head sagely at the summary I have just given of what he had to say earlier, that the consultations which took place this week and, more particularly yesterday, were not those provided for by the statutory terms of this Ordinance. They are entirely voluntary outside the framework of this Ordinance because those consultations are required only, of course, at an earlier stage in the proceedings before the Commissioner's decision is basically made as to who gets in and who stays out. One can equally well, of course, have these sorts of consultations that have taken place without any of the lunatic statutory apparatus that is provided for in this Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need is not this peculiar, inventive notion of a limited participation assembly. Nor do we need, as has been put by Senator Lewis, some notion of an unlimited assembly, implying all in with no holds barred. What we need is simply a straightforward, statutory statement of what the law governing public assemblies by anyone should be and what the standards of behaviour should be of those participating, wearing any hat, playing any role, in such an assembly. They could be wearing a hat as a participant, as a spectator or as part of the mainstream contingent who were first in the field; they could be wearing the hats of those who follow along behind. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever their status, capacity or role in the assembly, there should be a single law laying out the ground rules of appropriate behaviour so that everyone knows where he stands. What that single law should deal with is, essentially, the basic problem everyone is concerned about. One is the intention on the part of certain individuals-this arises evidently on occasions like this-to disrupt the assembly in question. For starters therefore, the law has to deal with that category of people who are intending to disrupt and who do, in fact, proceed to disrupt. The law, secondly, has to deal with that category of people who, whether they have a deliberate intention to create havoc, by their behaviour in fact do so. The law has to respond somehow, sensibly and in a principled fashion , to that kind of problem which I described yesterday as the provocation- response problem. What we need is a law which covers those problems and deals with them, not a law which tries to deal with those problems in the extraordinarily diffuse way that this Ordinance does. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the last of the categories of objection I have-objections to the breach of the peace provisions. In these breach of the peace provisions contained in clause 24, we have the nub of what could be a sensible statement of the law of public assembly insofar as it bears upon the kind of behaviour which should be outlawed and, in particular, insofar as it bears upon the situation of provocation on the one hand matched by response on the other. The trouble with clause 24 as it is drafted at the moment is that it is much too crude and blunt an instrument. As it is drafted it has absolutely no regard for the competing requirements of those who do, in fact, want to exercise a right of free speech. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot have a law drafted as this one is which operates simply to allow the police to move in and arrest anyone who, by his or her behaviour-intentionally or not-creates a reaction in some other people. If we do that we give priority to the interests, however irrational, well-founded or well-justified in principle those interests may be, of those who happen to be reacting. If we have a law drafted like this one is we give no priority, no weight in principle to the right of the people-who by their very presence, by their mere behaviour in perhaps holding up a banner or by their mere wearing of some badge are exercising their right-to express their opinion in that way. The only way one can justify the law having anything to say in this area and the law allowing a power of arrest is if the law is much more carefuly drafted than this one is. As I said yesterday-I just want to spend a moment saying a little more carefully what I mean-that law needs more criteria in it than clause 24 has at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 24, at the moment, is in two parts. First, it says that anyone who acts with an intention to provoke a breach of the peace is subject to statutory penalty. That is fair enough. I do not object to that. If someone has a deliberate intention to provoke a breach of the peace and if they do, in fact, cause a breach of the peace no one could object to that person being dealt with accordingly by the law. I have no objection to that part of clause 24. But the second part of clause 24 is the provision which says, in effect, that anyone who , by their behaviour, is likely to cause a breach of the peace can be dealt with in exactly the same way and subjected to exactly the same penalty. There is only one criterion likely to cause or provoke a breach of the peace. </PARA>
<PARA> One just has to go beyond that and add some additional criteria. The criteria that I and the Opposition have suggested are simply the following: firstly, likelihood of the behaviour causing a breach of the peace; secondly, actually causing a breach of the peace-cannot be just a figment of some police officer's creative imagination; and, thirdly, the behaviour being of such an objective character that it would cause a hostile reaction not just from the particular person who was present and reacting but from any reasonable member of the community. In other words, an objective requirement of offensiveness is needed. Only if we have a provision such as that can we justify draconian provisions of this kind. </PARA>

If the police officer, by looking at the reaction of Mr Alf Clarke and his minions in the ranks who are seething and raging at the mere existence of this banner, can see what is likely to happen by the mere carrying of that banner, the police officer, under the law as it is proposed, can direct the banner holder to depart the scene, and if the banner holder refuses to depart the scene--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is just the extra test that has to be involved of someone putting his mind to the question whether the behaviour is somehow objectively offensive. The way the law is regarded now, nobody has to ask himself that question. The only question anybody has to ask himself is whether someone, however irrational, will react to it. I wish to take the Senate through a course of events which have been related to me about what happened yesterday in a meeting between the Returned Services League people, the Australian Federal Police and at least some of those who are trying to get into the field. It demonstrated exactly what I am talking about. The groups were being told by the police that they must comply with the RSL organisers' requests for no banners of any kind to be carried. Those requests could not be enforced directly by the police because they are not the subject of any conditions that have been set so far by the Police Commissioner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What was said at yesterday's meeting is that irrespective of the fact that certain groups and certain individuals have been expressly given the right to participate in tomorrow's assembly, the police will, in the way I have said they are entitled to do under the language of the Ordinance, move in and deal with anyone, even if they have this permission, if they are acting in a way that is likely to provoke a response from the RSL. The context in which this whole position came up was this: Mr Clarke apparently stated that the banner identifying the group 'Ex-servicemen for Peace and Disarmament' was likely to cause a breach of the peace. I am told that Mr Clarke went on to say that even arm bands with 'Ex-servicemen for Peace and Disarmament' on them were likely to inflame people in the march to attack this particular group. Therefore, Mr Clarke stated, the banner should not be allowed to be carried. I am further told that the police were somewhat flummoxed by this particular statement but then said that on Mr Clarke's information they would be obliged, given the way the legislation was cast at the moment, to act to remove anyone-even someone from a group who had been given permission to march-who was in fact likely to cause another to attack them. So the police said, in response to the very specific case of the kind that I am trying to put to honourable senators, that if someone holds up a banner on Sunday saying 'Ex-servicemen for Peace and Disarmament', and if it appears to the policemen on Sunday that Mr Clarke's analysis, or promises or threats, whichever way one likes to describe them, are likely to become a reality and, furthermore, it is the policeman's reasonable judgment that there are people reacting in this way, then the obligation, not only the right but the obligation, of policemen under this legislation will be to force those people out of the assembly situation even though they have been given the right by the Commissioner to be part of it. This is not artificial, it is not abstract, it is not some academic preoccupation with abstract possibilities. This, to the best of my information, is an account of where we are actually at in a real life, on-the-ground situation, here and now. I think it is an absolutely perfect demonstration of what I am trying to say. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality of the matter is that there are some people in the RSL ranks who, for good motivations or evil, I make no comment on that, for whatever motivations, are likely to react very strongly and very adversely to the presence at that march scene of anyone other than the traditional RSL participants. If that is so, the way the Ordinance is drafted at the moment the police are simply going to have to act because their obligation is not to take into account any objective requirement about the reasonableness or otherwise of the behaviour in question, but simply to look at the likelihood of that behaviour by the other demonstrators in provoking a response. That is why we see this as being so dangerous and so intolerable. That is why we argue that it gives no regard, in the way that it should give regard, to the competing interests of those who do want to exercise a right of free speech. </PARA>

Would it be an intolerable state of affairs so far as police officers are concerned should some disruption in fact break out if this Ordinance is disallowed and there is nothing to guide them in this respect on Sunday?

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Existing Law</PARA>
<PARA> I have implied that the law relating to assembly in the ACT does not comply with the provisions of the International Covenant. This is the case. There is certainly no right of assembly as such in the ACT, and to discover the extent of the residual freedom of assembly, one has to examine the wide range of relevant statutory and common law provisions which may take the form of controls or specific offences. A full examination would be very lengthy, and so what follows is a brief look28 at the more important or commonly used statutory provisions, which have largely superseded common law offences such as breach of the peace, public nuisance, or trespass. The common law offences of unlawful assembly, rout and riot no longer have effect in the ACT, and the old Riot Act provisions have been repealed.29</PARA>

<PARA> In respect of assemblies that take the form of demonstrations or processions on a public street (as opposed to the public meeting which could take place on other public or private property30) the S. 23 (1) requirement for a permit means there is no freedom of assembly. This is similar to the position in Queensland where a permit from the District Superintendent of Traffic is required for any meeting or procession on any road31 and Western Australia where the prior permission of the Commissioner of Police is required 'for any procession, meeting or assembly in any street, thoroughfare or public place'.32 In practice, S. 23 is rarely enforced in the ACT.

<PARA> With regard to s. 17 (d), as mentioned earlier the courts apply an objective test in determining what constitutes offensive behaviour. In Ball v. McIntyre, Mr Justice Kerr, as he was then, stated that:</PARA>
<PARA> 'to be offensive, behaviour must be calculated to produce a stronger emotional reaction in the reasonable man than is involved in indicating difference or non- acceptance of his views or values. The behaviour, to be offensive, would normally be calculated to wound the feelings, arouse anger, resentment, disgust, or outrage in the mind of a reasonable man.'34</PARA>

<PARA> (a) on conviction on indictment-imprisonment for 2 years; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) on summary conviction-$2,000 or imprisonment for 12 months, or both. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The court convicting a person of an offence against sub-section (1) may, in addition to the penalty provided by that sub-section, order the offender to pay such compensation as the court thinks fit for any damage or injury caused by the offender to the uniform, clothing or accoutrements of the member concerned or for any medical or other expenses incurred in consequence of personal injury sustained by him by reason of the offence. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to compare the penalties for obstructing a Police Officer in the execution of his duty: under s. 9 of the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971 (Cth) the maximum penalty is a fine of $250 or imprisonment for three months or both; under s. 73 of the Police Offences Ordinance (ACT) the maximum penalty is a fine of $40 or imprisonment for three months; under the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (Cth) the maximum penalties are on summary conviction a fine of $2,000, or 12 months imprisonment or both, and on conviction or indictment imprisonment for two years. </PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned earlier, the fourteen women charged following the 1980 Anzac Day parade were prosecuted under s. 64. On appeal to the ACT Supreme Court, Connor, ACJ in setting aside the convictions held:</PARA>
<PARA> 'It is to be observed that the penalty for the offence of obstructing the police, if tried on indictment, is imprisonment for two years. I am quite unable to attribute an intention to the legislature to expose a person to such a penalty for disobeying a police order to cease a lawful activity in circumstances where the only relevant police duty is to prevent a breach of the peace by other citizens against him.'35</PARA>
<PARA> This is an important decision because, in so holding, Connor declined to follow the decision of the English Divisional Court in Duncan v. Jones (1936).36 Mrs Duncan was convicted of obstructing a police officer in the execution of his duty for refusing to obey a police officer's direction to move a meeting to another street, 175 yards away. The court found that the police officer had reasonable grounds for anticipating that a breach of the peace would occur if she were allowed to address the meeting at her chosen location, outside a trading centre for the unemployed. A disturbance had occurred when she had addressed a similar meeting outside the Centre 14 months earlier.37 Connor ACJ, obiter, preferred the law as stated by the Divisional Court in Wise v. Dunning ( 1962),38</PARA>
<PARA> 'namely that a binding over order may be available against a person who has not committed any offence in circumstances where the consequence of his lawful conduct is likely to produce a breach of the peace by other persons.'39</PARA>
<PARA> An order binding a person over to keep the peace is a preventive measure available to magistrates in the ACT, under statutory and common law powers.40</PARA>
<PARA> This brief look at the more important or more commonly used statutory provisions applicable to assemblies in the ACT, indicates just how difficult it is for a number of the public to appreciate his legal position if he takes part in a demonstration or procession or attends a public meeting. There can be no short answer to the question 'What does freedom of assembly comprise', because of the residual nature of the freedom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not go through the five of six pages of material that is set out here as it will appear in Hansard. I simply want to retail, for the benefit of the Senate, that there is an ample body of existing law that will more than adequately cope with any conceivable situation that will arise. There is the Traffic Ordinance in the Australian Capital Territory, sections 21 and 23 ; there is the Commonwealth Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act sections 6, 8 and 9; and there is the Unlawful Assemblies Ordinance, which apparently still exists in the Australian Capital Territory, sections 3 and 4. There is the Police Offences Ordinance for the Australian Territory, sections 12 , 17 and 73. There is the Australian Federal Police Act, section 64. There is also the potential application, which I think is set out here, of some other common law provisions. Without going into any of the boring detail about what is contained in those provisions I assure the Senate-that this is only the tip of the iceberg of provisions that are potentially applicable. Let me further assure the Senate that there is no shortage whatsoever of police power to deal with any situations that might conceivably get out of hand on Sunday if this Ordinance were to be disallowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On that basis I urge the Senate once again to think of the fact that we are not just dealing with something that has application for one day of the year; we are dealing with something which is fundamental to the right of free speech and public assembly. We are dealing with an Ordinance of intended general application and open-ended application in the future to any conceivable variety of public assembly situations. For that reason we are obliged to look at it very carefully and not just get emotionally swayed which is what I suspect Senator Walters is about to attempt to do on the subject matter of Anzac Day. The issues at stake are much more important than that.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing is new, as our Whip says. Senator Evans has made some quite extraordinary comments. He has assured us that the Public Assemblies Ordinance for limited participation does not apply to just special days as the Ordinance clearly indicates. He says that it will apply to any conceivable public assembly in the future. The honourable senator ought to read the Ordinance and get it a bit clear. It does apply just to any special day that the Minister so decrees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans really makes me mad. He stands up and wears on his sleeve the badge of a champion for the right of freedom of speech and for human and civil rights until we are all thoroughly sick of it. We know if we look at his history that he does not really care about people's civil rights. He stood up in this place a couple of months ago and assassinated the character of Professor Chipman . He called him a sophisticated racist because Professor Chipman dared to write an article with which Senator Evans did not agree. Of course, Senator Evans did all this under parliamentary privilege. He was not game to make those accusations outside. Professor Chipman has, indeed, challenged him to do so. But Senator Evans has not done that. He has not given Professor Chipman the right to sue him over his allegations. He has not even given Professor Chipman the right, as we senators on the Government side have, to stand up and claim to be misrepresented. So much for Senator Evans's thoughts on human responsibilities, human rights, civil rights and freedom of speech. He has freedom of speech in this place to denigrate anyone. He knows darn well that people outside this place cannot take him to task for it. They can ask him to apologise but he knows that they cannot take any further action and they cannot sue him. He does this regularly in this place. I really query Senator Evans's great concern for people 's civil rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get back to the Ordinance. Many accusations have been made against this Ordinance. We keep getting told about hurried decisions. Senator Ryan has said this again today.

But nobody mentioned that very recently a referendum in the Australian Capital Territory gave us responsibility to pass legislation in this place for the Australian Capital Territory. We were not told that we had to abide by the decisions of the House of Assembly. We were told that the people of Canberra wanted us to make decisions and that is what we are doing in this chamber today. Let us put it quite simply: The difference between the Opposition and the Australian Democrats and this Government is very simple. Senator Evans and his ilk over there have decided that they want to support the right of all the radical groups to march on Anzac Day. They say that they ought to be able to march and that they ought to be able to attend Anzac Day marches and to commemorate it as they see fit. The Government's point of view is that this has been a traditional day, held once a year since I think 1916, to commemorate one thing only-not the glories of war but, as Senator Chipp said very clearly this morning, fallen comrades. It is one day of the year on which returned servicemen and women of Australia ask in peace and with no interference to be able to remember their fallen comrades.</PARA></TALK.START>

It has been interpreted by some radical groups as a glorification of war, and that is a lot of tommy rot. Simply stated, the Opposition wants those groups to be given the right to commemorate Anzac Day in the way in which they want to do it-not in the traditional manner. But this Government's point of view is that the day should be given to the Anzacs to commemorate their fallen comrades without interference, in peace, in dignity and as a solemn occasion. Frankly, that is the difference simply put. This Ordinance is designed to prevent breaches of the peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans gave us a 20-minute dissertation on how it is up to a junior police officer to decide what is a breach of the peace. In fact the whole emphasis of this Ordinance is to prevent situations such as those we have seen in other countries where violent demonstrations have occurred. I do not think that is an unreasonable request. I believe that if this Government can prevent breaches of the peace before they take place, that is a responsible thing to do.</PARA>

<PARA> There is one further matter with which I wish to deal. Senator Chipp suggested that the radical groups will be dealt with by their neighbours.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I will be very brief. It seems to me that we have been ignoring the fact that this Australian Capital Territory Public Assemblies Ordinance is before us because of what happened on Anzac Day last year. I appreciate that this Ordinance is not only for Anzac Day but also for all public assemblies, both limited and unlimited participation public assemblies. However, my mind is exercised by the fact that it is to overcome a problem that arose on Anzac Day last year. If we accept Senator Ryan's motion to disallow this Ordinance it means that we will be opening the way for what occurred last year. The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police has operated under this Ordinance by giving approval to certain groups to join the march on this occasion. Those groups, of course, have met-I admit to what Senator Evans has said-but not under the compulsory provisions of this Ordinance. Nevertheless, they met yesterday and they came to a reasonable sort of compromise which it appears will work well on Sunday. Let us hope it does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My fear is that if the motion for the disallowance of this Ordinance were adopted that would throw everything back into the melting pot. The good work that has been done by people of goodwill in these groups as well as by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and others will be undone. We might well see a shemozzle such as occurred last year occurring again on Sunday. Nevertheless, I address myself to the point that was made by Senator Evans in respect of the breach of peace provisions contained in clause 24 of the Ordinance. The way he described it caused me some consternation. But as I see it , if, as he has described it, one of the group were to hold up a placard which gave some sort of offence to the major participants in the march, that, of itself, would not be reasonable grounds for the senior officer of police to ask that placard be removed or that that person remove himself from the assembly or from near the assembly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has to have reasonable grounds. He has a responsibility, as a sergeant of police, to charge a person who is engaged in a breach of the peace. I come back to the brief point. I agree with what has been said by Senator Chipp and Senator Lewis. Whether Anzac Day is to be a day on which there is unlimited or limited participation in public assembly depends surely on the purpose of Anzac Day. It has been said that Anzac Day goes back to the first march which was held the year after the event at Gallipoli. The first remembrance was held in Melbourne when about 380 returned Anzacs marched from near Princes Bridge to a service at St Paul's. I agree with the proposition that Anzac Day ought to be returned to being a commemoration of the fallen dead. Another day ought to be available, for example Australia Day, for other victims of war or for other groups to march. But Anzac Day in my view ought to be set aside especially for the commemoration of the fallen comrades of persons who have fought in wars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am prepared to oppose this proposition only on the basis that the Minster for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) and the Government look at the whole question of Anzac Day to see whether it could be separated because of the limited participation character of the public assembly which ought to be directed at the true purpose of Anzac Day. The Minister and the Government should look at this matter and come back to the Parliament with a proposition along the lines that have been suggested. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (12.51)-I rise to refer to one or two points. I think this issue has been talked out at great length and there is no need to go over old ground. The Government's position is well known. Certainly, through consultation with Senator Lewis, as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, a great deal of work has been done in what even Senator Chipp acknowledged as a good attempt to get some order into the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise mainly to acknowledge the points made by Senator Harradine in relation to what might be called a national event which has been referred to by Senator Lewis and acknowledged by Senator Chipp. It seems as though there is some common ground for further consideration of that area. On behalf of the Government I take the matter on board for later deliberation realising that Sunday is very close and that Parliament will rise today. I will refer the matter to the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) and come back to Senator Harradine for later discussions. Other than that, the Government supports the Ordinance and will oppose the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-There has been fairly extensive debate on the Australian Capital Territory Public Assemblies Ordinance. It is notable that there has been very little defence of the Ordinance by the Government. Senator Lewis has explained why he considers the Ordinance to be a good one. I think Senator Walters spent her time mainly attacking one of my colleagues. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) has merely responded to a point well made by Senator Harradine. There has been very little analytical discussion of the Ordinance by Government senators and very little defence of it. I must note my disappointment that the other elected representative of the Australian Capital Territory in this place, Senator Margaret Reid, has not participated in this debate despite the fact that the issue is of great significance in the community at this stage and will continue to be for the course of the weekend. It is very disappointing that Senator Reid has not come into the chamber either to defend her Government's action or to give some assurances to the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lewis made one major point in defence of the Ordinance. He said that it had the effect of causing conciliatory behaviour by various groups in the community. Senator Harradine also commented favourably on this point. I simply point out-I think Senator Harradine acknowledged this-that such conciliation activity that has taken place has taken place outside the terms of the Ordinance . The Ordinance provides for conciliation discussions before approval is granted . That did not happen. The meeting that took place yesterday occurred at the initiative of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, for which he should be congratulated, and because various groups, in good faith and because the people involved are good citizens, were prepared to participate. Progress has taken place because of the goodwill of the parties involved and not because of the Ordinance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were, but the conciliation procedures under the Ordinance were not carried out. I am pleased that there were some conciliation procedures, but I think the community groups involved and the Commissioner of Police ought to be congratulated. Senator Lewis should not claim that this happened because of the Ordinance. Senator Walters seemed to be under a serious misapprehension as to the extent of the Ordinance. The Ordinance is not simply to provide for limited participation assembly on days of special significance. The Ordinance applies to all public assemblies held in the Australian Capital Territory, although of course it includes special conditions for special days. Section 24 of the Ordinance, the breach of the peace provisions, which is causing such concern to Opposition and Democrat senators and, I think, to some extent Senator Harradine, applies to all public assemblies, that is all assemblies of three people or more in the Australian Capital Territory. It was, I think, rather disappointing that Senator Walters, one of the two defenders of the Ordinance, seemed to be under such a serious misapprehension as to the extent of it. Senator Harradine expressed his concern that the troublesome events of last year would not be repeated. That is why he supported the Ordinance, although he seemed to have very grave reservations about it. I place on record that a lot of the disturbances last year came about because of the Ordinance. It did not in fact solve any of the problems, just as this year's Ordinance, I anticipate, will not solve any of the problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion I remind the Senate that we are engaged in an exercise of our democratic responsibilities. The elected members of the House of Assembly are opposed to this Ordinance. All community groups affected by it have criticised it in very fundamental terms. The elected Federal representatives of the Australian Capital Territory are opposed to the Ordinance, except Senator Reid who has chosen not to make her views on this matter known. All groups, including the police, have expressed the gravest reservations about the Ordinance. It seems even at this stage that the Ordinance will not achieve the objective-the objective being something we all agree about-of an orderly and solemn remembrance service on Anzac Day. That will not be achieved because of this Ordinance. Therefore, I believe it should not be allowed to proceed. I thank honourable senators who made constructive contributions to this debate, particularly the Australian Democrats who typically have maintained a position of support for democratic values and democratic procedures. I urge the Senate to disallow the Ordinance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I rise briefly because these documents are tabled in the Senate and also in the House of Representatives today partly because of a question I asked in the Senate yesterday and partly because of a question asked by my colleague, Mr John Brown, the honourable member for Parramatta, in another place. Mr Brown, in fact, asked for a complete set of documents referring to the matter of the importation of the colour television set on 5 October last and I asked more specifically for information about an investigation made by the Internal Affairs Unit of the Bureau of Customs on this very matter. The documents that have been tabled today, I assert, are not the only documents available and they certainly do not contain the document I asked for. This is not an answer to the question I asked yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we have had put down here today is a series of letters from various officers of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, referring to other files and conversations, and the confidential minute of 4 February last from Mr R. Kennedy, the Director of the Internal Affairs Unit of that Department, which refers to an investigation which in fact started before Mr MacKellar passed through Customs on 5 October. This document is of no relevance, in fact, to the MacKellar affair; but it is of great relevance to the consideration of how this Department operates, specifically when it is viewed in conjunction with the documents which were tabled in this place two days ago, in a booklet form almost , and which are entitled 'Documents Relating to the Importation of a Colour Television Set by the Honourable M. J. R. MacKellar, M.P.'. The minute which is tabled here and which will now be published can have only one purpose, and that is to attempt to discredit two officials of the Customs Officers Association, namely, Mr Bennett and Mr Spanswick. The previous attempt to browbeat and discredit an officer-Mr Mayhew-failed, and it seems to me that, not to be outdone, an attempt is now being made to discredit others. </PARA>
<PARA> The minute which is produced here, I repeat, refers to an investigation conducted by Mr Kennedy which started on 1 October, five days before Mr MacKellar ever came through Customs. I believe that this documentation is useful , though, in that it can serve as a warning to any Public Service union official or employee and it emphasises the need for the independent judicial inquiry which was brought forward in this place by my colleague, Senator Button, yesterday. We have already some documentation that was tabled earlier this week relating to the importation of this colour television set. That documentation revealed, as has been amply demonstrated in this place, in the Press and in the media generally, a bizarre, Kafkaesque situation of how an officer, Mr Mayhew, was ignored or given the runaround and revealed some of the extraordinary thought processes of some of the officers in this Department. Suffice it to say that it has now been demonstrated that Mr Mayhew in fact was honest, conscientious, persistent and the only person in the affair who was consistently correct and in fact had the courage of his convictions. For this he was browbeaten. </PARA>

All this occurred in a matter which, were it not for the fact of ministerial involvement, involved merely a very small amount of money and a small item imported into this country. What goes on in the Department, what goes on in the bureaucracy, when serious matters, involving large sums of money, involving items of high value, involving drugs or crime, are involved, we do not know. But in view of what we know now the mind boggles at what might happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to the minute, dated 4 February, which was produced here today with other documents which I suggest are less relevant. Let us look at some excerpts from this minute. Mr Kennedy refers in the minute to Mr Bennett, an executive officer of the Customs Officers Association. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Bennett raised a number of issues principally in respect to Departmental Administration and while it was pointed out to him that his complaints were being expressed in the wrong forum, we did, nevertheless, take opportunity to ' bleed' him of his thinking and aspersions. </PARA>
<PARA>What that means exactly I do not know, but it is an extraordinary expression to be used in a document like that. Mr Kennedy goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> It can be accepted that Bennett regards the Minister as being dishonest. He is most critical of Senior Departmental Officers and their administrative ability. Together with his confederate, Robert Spanswick, he is currently before the Stewart Royal Commission, and, on his claims, being favourably accepted in his aspersions of poor Departmental performances and inefficiency. He claims that Mr Justice Stewart has requested his Association to prepare and submit their recommendations on their proposal for Special Services to be transferred to the Australian Federal Police and Revenue Control move to Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA> While I do not condone Bennett's conduct, nor do I accept his condemnation of the . . . Department or the Minister, I do regard him as administratively dangerous, in that he is not without intelligence, influence or ability in some respects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a terribly dangerous man he must be! What a terrible man to have in a department when he has some intelligence, influence and ability in some respects! Mr Kennedy continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To me there seems to be requirements for time, tact and tolerance on the part of Senior Officers for the successful handling of Bennett and Spanswick. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am certainly not endeavouring to advise officers in respect to Administration, I am suggesting that to ignore either Bennett or Spanswick by lack of communication--</PARA>
<PARA>One assumes that there was attempted lack of communication, sending to Coventry or something-</PARA>
<PARA>and non acceptance of their Association Role will result in resentment, resistance and the circulation of unsupported and untrue rumours. </PARA>
<PARA>We have this document, which was produced after a request by Mr Brown and a request by me for specific documents on investigations into the MacKellar affair . What we are given here is really a point of view, without any supporting documentation, of a senior officer in the Department, in the Internal Affairs Unit. I presume that that is the unit which would conduct an internal investigation into the behaviour of various people in the Department. In that document that senior officer makes remarks and casts aspersions on two officers of the Customs Officers Association who are doing their duty and have done their duty consistently in trying to protect the rights of their members. Mr Mayhew, whose case is well documented in the extraordinary document which was produced on Tuesday, did so very successfully and by coincidence a couple of Ministers got caught up in it. They are assertions and they are opinions. There is no supporting documentation. I really cannot see what relevance this document has to the MacKellar affair, other than to discredit Bennett and Spanswick. I do not believe that there is any other reason why that document should be produced. </PARA>
<PARA> The other documents introduce into the affair the names of other officers, departmental officers, senior officers, which did not appear in the documents that were tabled two days ago. But it is very difficult to judge just what their relevance is in light of the fact that they are mainly covering letters and no reports. But nowhere in this is the documentation that I asked for; that is, a report by the Internal Affairs Unit on the affair involving Mr MacKellar on 5 October. I assert that that document exists. I suppose one could say it existed, if the shredders have been running well. The documents do not contain the reports which must exist to back up the assertions of Mr Kennedy about Mr Bennett and Mr Spanswick. If that document-that document which by itself is quite scurrilous-was going to be produced, the back-up documents should have been produced. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, this affair has now reached proportions which I think we all should be very concerned about. We have a department which has had its difficulties in the past. We have a department which is absolutely crucial and important to safety in this country in many ways. The Department detects drugs; it detects quarantine breaches, which in many ways are more dangerous than the importation of drugs; it is charged with an important job in maintaining the security of this country. Yet, any reading of the document tabled here on 20 April indicates the extraordinary activities that went on to stop Mr Mayhew from pursuing his duties as he should have and, as it has been shown, he tried to do. That was followed today by a document which, I assert, can only have been produced to discredit two other officers who were active in this affair. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we have a very serious situation in that Department, a situation so serious that the evidence produced today adds to the importance of Senator Button's call and Mr Brown's call in another place for an independent inquiry into this affair, an independent inquiry which obviously should be conducted by a judge or someone at that level. Until that happens we quite clearly will have a persistence of the cover-up which has gone on and I suspect we will have a persistence of the dribbling out of documents of this type, maybe to back both sides of the struggle which is obviously going on in the Department. We will have a situation in which it will be impossible for that Department to work effectively. It will make it impossible, or make it very risky, for any trade union official representing public servants in this country to operate as he or she should be able to operate, without threats of being exposed as excitable, dangerous--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Yesterday, I think, Senator Grimes, in a question he directed to Senator Messner, indicated that he had some knowledge of a second statement, presumably as he understood it made by Mr Kennedy. Senator Grimes asked whether we had knowledge of it, whether it could be found and whether it could be tabled . Senator Messner acted immediately. I, in turn, acted. The Government has given quite explicit instructions that every file that exists, be it here or elsewhere , should be searched thoroughly and every possible piece of information that could relate to this matter should be made available. To this moment no record has been found of the document to which Senator Grimes referred. If Senator Grimes can give any more details than he has already it would aid us in this matter. The Government, in good faith, wants to bring forward every piece of information. That is the first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point is this: Senator Grimes seeks to find motives in the tabling of this minute of Mr Kennedy's. He will know that his colleagues in another place were told last night-as I understand it-why this minute is tabled. In the course of a search to find every piece of information relevant to the television set, at first blush that minute did not appear relevant. But, in the second search, the Minister and his Department were told that part of the discussions that took place and are referred to in the minute, and the complaints referred to in that minute, related in one of the items to the television set. Let me make that perfectly clear. </PARA>
<PARA> Under those circumstances, does any honourable senator say that that piece of information should not have been brought forward? A Minister and his department, having been acquainted with that, would have been committing the very offence that Senator Grimes says should not be committed had they not brought it forward . The fact that the minute makes certain allegations about one person or another , however sad that may be, should not stand in the way of that. The important thing is that Senator Grimes has sought to be selective. He has sought to debate a document but not to debate the merits of other documents. I hoped that we would not debate only one or the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it perfectly clear: Nobody I know in the Government is reflecting upon any of the Customs officers. On the evidence that is before me, the Customs officer Mr Mayhew appears to have acted with complete propriety. There is absolutely no reflection on any officer at all. The sad fact is that there is some suggestion of conflect between the officers at the level of operation of Mr Mayhew's section and the managerial section of the Bureau of Customs. That being so, it is not a question of sitting in judgment at this moment; it is a question of recognising that there has been a long-standing problem. </PARA>
<PARA> At this moment it is not a question of whether we support this particular person, whether we protect this particular person, or whether we criticise that one. What is before us at this moment is getting all the evidence that we can on to the table. Then we will be in a position to go forward to an inquiry. I repeat: This document comes forward because the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Minister were told that, although on the face of it the document does not appear to do so, one of the factors of the events covered in it involves the television set. I put it in all seriousness that, therefore, no one can seek to have that document not put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> If, indeed, the document does-as Senator Grimes says it does, and I acknowledge that-emphasise the conflict that has been going on inside the Bureau of Customs apparently for some time, how even more important it is that it should be there to be used in any investigation that should come forward. I plead that every document that is relevant to the television set inquiry must be brought forward, irrespective of whether in the short term it asserts particular things about particular individuals. To make a selective judgment is to sit in judgment in a prior inquiry and we would be wrong in doing that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter of some considerable concern to me which was precipitated by an incident that occurred this morning. I preface what I have to say by pointing out that, in common with most senators and members, I strive to make full use of the rather inadequate provisions that we have for bringing staff members with us to Canberra to help us with the work we have to do. I am not particularly enamoured of the number of trips that we are allowed, but I do try to make full use of them. It therefore irritates me considerably when an outside factor influences or affects the usefulness of those trips. Something like that happened this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My staff members are in the habit of arriving at Parliament House at about the same time as I do, that is, some time between 8.30 and 8.40 a.m. This morning I was becoming particularly concerned when my research assistant was not here by 9 .45 and I had had no word from him that he was intending to be late; nor was I given any reason by anybody else for his being late. When he appeared I questioned him, obviously. He said that he, along with two other senators' or members' staff members, had had to wait an additional 48 minutes this morning for the taxi which they ordered last night for 8.30 this morning.</PARA>
<PARA> That cab, he said, was ordered from the Aerial Taxi Cab Society Ltd last night when he was on his way home. He ordered it through the cab driver. Another staff member who had been in the cab with him had also ordered a cab for the same time . When they discovered the double booking they rang and cancelled one of the taxis, having clearly explained that between three staff members they did not need two taxis. They assumed that they would be picked up, as usual, at 8.30 a.m . No car had arrived by 9.10. They rang again and called for another. It arrived at 9.23. I might add that it took them some time to get through because, in his words, the number was extremely busy this morning. The upshot of it was that those three senators' and members' staff members appeared here at 9.45 a.m. on a day when the Senate was due to sit at 10 o'clock and I had work that I wanted my research assistant to do in anticipation of that sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that that incident really is a direct result of an instruction that was issued by the Department of Administrative Services Transport and Storage Division, Australian Capital Territory Branch, in a notice to drivers and supervisors regarding proposed shift changes and changed methods of working with regard to the passenger car fleet. I am not exactly sure when this was issued but the changed shift arrangements were to take effect from the commencement of the first shift on Monday, 5 April 1982. So this week, in effect , is the first week that members of the Parliament-the Senate and the House of Representatives-have had the opportunity to see how these changed shift arrangements will affect them. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it quite clear that I am aware that staff members are not entitled to Commonwealth car transport, from their motel, hotel, unit or whatever, in the morning to Parliament House. I am not asking that that be changed. What I am saying is that senators and members who rely on their staff are being inconvenienced-I was certainly extremely irritated this morning-and we are being prevented from pursuing our duties as effectively as we would like because this directive is placing an additional strain on the finite taxi and hire car resources servicing Canberra residents and is therefore causing the sorts of delays that occurred this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from an item in this morning's Australian newspaper that Government concern at the high wages involved in the use of Commonwealth car drivers was behind this change. I, for one, have no particular criticism of any Commonwealth car driver who manages to earn up to or even more than $30,000 if he wants to work the hours involved. I am not criticising that at all. What I am concerned with is that, according to the Australian, the high wages are believed to be confined to ministerial chauffeurs who are often kept waiting late into the night to drive their bosses home. The point I would like to make is: If that is the reason for these high costs, why is it that the people causing the high costs are not being asked to cut back, instead of the damage being done to those lowly people among us who are mere back bench senators and members?</PARA>
<PARA> I also question whether in fact there will be any valuable cost saving from this little exercise. I cannot believe that the change from using Commonwealth cars to using private taxis and hire cars will cut costs. I would like the Minister to provide figures to prove that this somewhat farcical exercise is likely to be sufficiently cost beneficial to justify its nuisance value. I think there is some empirical evidence that can be brought out; for instance, a comparison, of what it cost the Commonwealth during the period of the transport strike and what it costs in a normal period of working. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Senate. I am aware that Estimates Committee A is waiting, with bated breath, I dare say-certainly with some impatience-to come into this chamber to conduct its business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe, as Senator Georges said, that this is an important issue not only for us but also for the residents of Canberra. There is a finite number of taxis and hire cars available in Canberra. We do not, despite the fact that some members from some parties would like us to do so, run Canberra. We are not in the position of being entitled to ride roughshod over the needs of Canberra residents. We are here for approximately 26 weeks of the year and we ought to cause as little disruption to the lives of Canberra residents as we possibly can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was heartened to read in that same article in the Australian that the Minister promised to make arrangements to ensure that members of parliament did not miss their early morning planes. That is terrific. Most of us do not want to miss our early morning planes. Actually most of us do not want to catch them either. We would rather they were a little later in the day. But that is a matter to take up with Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans Australia Airlines . The point is that to catch those early morning planes we are now going to have to take taxis or hire cars. What, I would like to know, are the Canberra residents who have early morning transport requirements, for which they habitually use the taxi companies and the hire car companies, going to do while we are placing this apparent priority drain on the system? I will not take up the time of the Senate any longer, except to point out that this is an important issue, not just for us as senators and members but also for our staff and for general Canberra residents, and that a group of people who have not caused a problem are being asked to solve it in a manner which I do not think is going to prove as economical as was intended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter Senator Haines has just raised is nothing new in this Parliament. I have been raising it for quite a number of years. If Senator Haines would like to have a look back over the Hansard records she would see that two or three times every year, for many years now, I have raised this matter of car transport for members of parliament and complained about the use of taxis and hire cars. What she said is quite true. There is only a limited number of taxis in the Australian Capital Territory and there are many people who are unable to get taxis when they come out from theatres or whatever they are attending when the Parliament is sitting. This week I received from the Minister for the Capital Territory an answer to a question on notice and he says that his Department receives very few complaints. That is quite contrary to the responses that I and some of my colleagues have received when we have raised the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing which concerns me greatly is the moonlighting on these taxis. I got into a taxi here one night about 18 months ago and when I said to the driver 'Are you a permanent taxi driver?' he said: 'No, I work for a Minister'. The Minister concerned at the time was the Minister for Education. On another occasion-it is on record in the Parliament-a friend of mine who was working back late doing pays in a department rang for a taxi, and when she went out and got into the taxi who should be behind the wheel and driving the taxi but her section head. It was a great embarrassment to him, of course. He is not being paid enough, apparently, and he is out moonlighting on taxis. </PARA>
<PARA> The main concern now is that, with the change in the system, as Senator Haines said, no Commonwealth cars will be available to convey members of parliament to the airport on Friday mornings. We know that the Government engaged Mr Marks to do a survey of the Commonwealth fleet here. I have tried on many occasions-I tried again on Monday-to get a copy of the Marks report to see what was recommended. I am told that it is an interdepartmental report and it is not available to members of parliament. One thing we were told in the Estimates committee that dealt with the Department of Administrative Services on Monday was that in that report Mr Marks recommended that a consultant be employed, at a cost of some $50,000, to have a further look at the Commonwealth transport fleet . I would like to know the qualifications of the person who is now in charge of Commonwealth transport and whether he in fact is on a very good government superannuation payment as well as what he is getting as his wage as the supervisor, or whatever category he comes into. I do not know what it is. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the statement which Senator Haines referred to and which was on the front page of today's Australian. Apparently if we can believe the Australian article, it was stated in the Liberal Party room-not in public- yesterday, in answer to a question by Senator Martin to Mr Newman, that in fact some Commonwealth drivers, Ministers' drivers, are in receipt of salaries of $30 ,000 or more. I have had it brought to my attention by some of these drivers that they are very disturbed that they are being put up as the bogy people getting $30,000 a year; yet the man who is making these decisions could be getting much, much more. This is of grave concern to many of us. Not so long ago Mr Morris, my colleague who is the shadow Minister for Transport in the other place, was given an answer to a question on notice seeking some details of the breakdown of the costs of Commonwealth cars. There was a big splurge in the Press, after he was given that answer, on what it was costing to transport members of parliament in the Australian Capital Territory. I followed that up with a question on notice and sought further explanation. To my surprise, I found that it was not the members of parliament who were costing the taxpayers the great amount of money; it was the public servants, in the main-of course there are more public servants than members of parliament-and, secondly, Ministers. In the lowest category, costing the taxpayers the least, were the back bench members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot find out what was the cost of Mr Marks's report. I will be pursuing that in the Committee of the Whole, in the consideration of the Estimates. We now are given the answer that he has recommended that another person be employed at a cost of $50,000. That was given with some reluctance because, it was said, the person might not want the public to know what the Government was paying. Of course, my rejoinder was that the public knows what is the salary of members of parliament. We get kicked to death, every chance the Press gets, in respect of what we are paid. But here a consultant is going to be employed and the officer concerned said that it might be an embarrassment to him if the public knows what he is being paid. What is he going to come up with? He is going to come up with more confusion in the car pool. Some years ago, when I first came here, there was no problem with Commonwealth cars; but, under the penny-pinching methods of this Government, it is phasing out the Commonwealth cars not only in the Australian Capital Territory but in every capital city, while the Ministers are using Commonwealth cars and hire cars and taxis are used to convey members of parliament. It is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other questions that I still have on notice is: How many 'no contacts' are being reported by hire cars and taxis in the morning when people want to go the airport? I have had the experience of their arriving late. I have never yet had the experience of a Commonwealth driver arriving late or coming with the excuse that the taxi drivers offer, namely: 'I had the wrong address; I was around in the other street'. Only a fortnight ago, when I was in Canberra on parliamentary business, I had to catch a plane at 8 p.m.-the last plane out of Canberra at night. The transport did not arrive. I rang up the after hours number at the depot and I was told that a car was on its way; that it should have arrived. I said: 'What sort of a car-a private hire car or taxi?' The girl said: 'Yes'. I said: 'That follows'. She got on the blower, and then she said: ' Hang on; he will be around in a few minutes'. When the car arrived the driver said: 'I was around in the other street. I had the wrong address. What time did you have the car booked for?' I told him. I said: 'We will have to hurry or I will miss the plane'. He handed me the warrant book to sign and, lo and behold, when I opened the book I saw that he had the time there on the document. He knew what time he had to pick me up; yet he asked me what time he was to pick me up. This has happened on many occasions. Many members of parliament have had the same experience. A taxi driver is given a job and he tries to fit another one in before the time at which he is to pick up a member of parliament. He has a little bit of lag, he fits in a private fare, and therefore the member of parliament in lots of cases is running late for his plane. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing we are concerned about is the instances in which the drivers report that no contact has been made. This probably does not happen with members of parliament; it happens with public servants who in the course of their duty have to catch a plane out of Canberra in the morning. They find that the taxi does not arrive. What do they do? They have to get into their own car and drive to the airport. When the taxi arrives late, the driver phones back to depot and says that there is nobody there. Of course the passengers are not there; they have had to use their own transport. Members of parliament cannot do that because very few of them have their own transport in Canberra. So, there needs to be a thorough inquiry into the whole system which is operating now, not by somebody who is employed by the Government, like Mr Marks, who recommends the employment of another consultant for $50,000. It is something that ought to be done by a Senate select committee so that we can get to the crux of the matter and make some recommendations and take it out of the hands of this Government altogether. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This matter needs to be debated. I am indebted to Senator Haines for raising the matter. But the fact that this is the adjournment debate and Senate Estimates committees have to follow limits the ability of senators to participate in the debate. The matter is important. It seems to me that those who were responsible for the decision which has led to the problems that have been spoken of should have first consulted those who were going to be primarily affected, such as the members of parliament and staffs of members of parliament. We could extend it to others. If the discussion had taken place and if those employed by the Transport and Storage Division of the Department of Administrative Services-the car drivers-had been consulted, these problems would have emerged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My view is that, now that the decision has been made, we are in a state of disarray and the Government, in order to explain away the disarray and justify the decision, is beginning to distort the matter. I am particularly concerned that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) should tell members of his own party-I hope they were not satisfied with the explanation, but perhaps they were-that drivers in the pool were earning up to $30,000 a year and it was necessary to cut this back. That was a selective statement and a misleading statement, and it does not help the situation at all. It appears to me that most drivers do not receive that amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA> What has now occurred is this: We have a limited number of drivers and a substantially larger number of cars which are not properly utilised. We have to be careful about the problem being corrected in this way: The Government will sell off some of the cars, extend the number of taxi licences and perhaps also, with its fetish for private enterprise, issue further hire car plates. That is what is bound to follow. The problems which have developed will not be corrected . In other words, the Government will not go back and reconsider its decision; it will merely endeavour to correct it by getting into further error. All I am saying is that this matter needs to be raised. The senators should have been consulted before these changes were made. In fact the changes were made in conflict with the direction by the Minister for Administrative Services that Commonwealth cars would be available for members of parliament and other closed categories whenever they were required. In Canberra the opposite has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I am seriously concerned about the erosion of the conditions that have been available to members of parliament and their staff and to the people who work in this Parliament. There is a continual erosion of these conditions and if this is allowed to occur without complaint the Government will feel free to carry out further, what it calls, economies which are economies on the surface and do not really bear close investigation. I am not going to go any further into experiences such as Senator McLaren has described. I could add a number of instances in which the service now provided to members of parliament falls far short of what is really required if we are to carry out our duties with some reasonable dignity. Maybe I should not use the word 'dignity'--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that it offends Senator Baume. Let me give an example: I call for a car every morning at 6 o'clock. Over the years I have expected and have received a car at 6 o'clock. At 6 o'clock the other people in the house are asleep, and my neighbours are asleep. The Commonwealth car driver knows my requirements. He pulls up quietly, I go out to the car and get into the car, and we pull away quietly. If I get a taxi, what happened to me on one occasion can happen. The taxi driver roars up the street, roars up the driveway, parks underneath the neighbours' window, gets out of the cab, roars up the stairs, knocks on the door and wakes up everyone in the house. It is just unreasonable that we should get that sort of treatment. One says to that person: 'Next time please park in the street and keep the noise down'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One does not have to explain that to a Commonwealth driver. His purpose is to give members of parliament, in the somewhat strained conditions under which we work, a special type of service. It is a confidential service, it is a secure service and it is a safe service. If we get into a taxi now we become victims of the person who is driving the taxi. We are obliged to listen to a whole series of questions about the political situation of the country and how problems ought to be solved. We get that and we have no defence against it. We just have to sit there silently and accept it all. The other night I was in a taxi that had no brakes. I said to the driver: 'Look, you've got no brakes. You put your foot on the brake and you've got a grind of metal upon metal'. There were no shoes to the brakes. I said: 'What's the idea?' He said: 'This is my last job. I'm putting it in and it's going to be worked on tonight'. But I was sitting in the car, at a late hour, trying to get home peacefully, and the car had no brakes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to contribute a little to this debate because, in my activities on another committee, I have already raised matters in relation to security. My concern has always been that we have Commonwealth drivers, or people in a Commonwealth uniform with a Commonwealth visitor's pass-responsible for driving a Commonwealth car admittedly-coming into Parliament House to pick up members of parliament and coming to their homes to pick them up, but we have no physical identification that these people are in fact who they purport to be. My concern in that area is for security. Incidentally, I have raised this matter in another place and there will be continuing discussion on it. The other point I make is that we tend to blame the transport officers for this. Of course, they are not at fault in this instance. What has happened since the Marks report is that a colonel has been placed in charge of Commonwealth transport here in the Australian Capital Territory. I think it is Colonel Fleming. He has been responsible for the institution of new rosters which require that Commonwealth drivers, by virtue of their needing to start at 7.30 in the morning, will not now be working past 10 o'clock at night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I make is that in the Australian Capital Territory the general public is already short of taxi cabs. I do not know whether the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister for Health (Senator Peter Baume), who is at the table, is aware of that, but some time ago-earlier this year-I had figures taken out in relation to the ratio of population to licensed taxis. We may have a larger number of private hire cars in the Australian Capital Territory; I do not know. I did not go into the private hire car situation. But let me just tell honourable senators that, for instance, in Sydney the ratio of taxis to population is one to 1,000. It is the same in Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. In Hobart the ratio is one to 750. In Darwin it is one to 1,000. In Canberra already it is one to 2,000. So the people who want to travel by taxi are already seriously disadvantaged in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are going to have this stupid roster system-I have to call it a stupid roster system because no-one has been able to explain how the heck it is working or how it is expected to work-all it will mean, as far as I am concerned anyway, is that the Commonwealth car drivers, because of the nine-and-a-half hour break that they are required to have between Thursday night and Friday morning, will not be available to get to my home in Torrens in time to pick me up to take me to the airport to catch the flight which I have to catch to get back to Western Australia in time to have any time at all in my electorate office on the Friday. I agree with what Senator Georges and Senator McLaren have had to say, but my concern is not in the same areas. My concern is that we will also make it doubly difficult for the ordinary Canberra resident, the visitor to Canberra, to get a taxi if, in fact, we monopolise the situation just so that we can get to where we want to go. </PARA>
<PARA> We should have the right to a Commonwealth car driver. I have mentioned the situation with regard to security. I have already expressed in this place and at committee meetings my concern that the people who purport to be Commonwealth car drivers may not necessarily be car drivers, but one has no idea of the identification of a taxi driver. If we are going to have massive security inside Parliament House it has to extend to the secure transportation of members of parliament between their home and the House, the House and their home and the airport and wherever they are going. That applies not only here in the Australian Capital Territory; it should apply in all the States as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation that we now have to look at is so serious that little argument can be put other than, as Senator McLaren suggested, that we should either open it up for full debate in this chamber or refer it to a committee so that it could be debated properly, so that we can receive the submissions of the people who are most affected. I point out that the people who are most affected are the transport officers who are resident in Parliament House and the transport drivers themselves, plus the very nice people who work on the after hours number , who are always very courteous but who, unfortunately, are not necessarily in a position to provide us with a Commonwealth car when we particularly want one. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation that has evolved over the last few months is not something that has just happened; it has been happening for years. Gradually since I came here in 1974, we have seen the denigration of members of parliament. We have seen, as I said, the lack of concern about the secure transportation of them between point A and point B. Now we have this added incursion into the right of the people of the Australian Capital Territory to be able to ring a number and be able to obtain transport. If we look at the figures-one taxi to 2,000 population -we see that they are grossly out of proportion when compared with those of any of the other major capital cities throughout Australia. Hobart has one to 750 and the others all balance out at roughly one to 1,000 population. The Canberra resident does not have that advantage now. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that there would be little advantage in the suggestion that more taxi licences should be issued in the Australian Capital Territory to overcome what is, after all, a short lived problem. It is a problem only when the Parliament is sitting for the two sessions each year. At other times there is adequate coverage for the rest of the population of the Australian Capital Territory to have normal access to taxis. It is when the Parliament is sitting, because we are greedy in that sense and we say that we are entitled to have first call on the taxis, that the people will be further disadvantaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Several honourable senators have spoken on the question of car transport. Senator Haines actually raised an issue which was slightly different from that taken up by other honourable senators. I will attempt to summarise her case. She was concerned about the fact that her staff had made a complicated arrangement with two separate bookings and one cancellation to try to rationalise the bookings. In the process the booking was lost. It is undesirable that her staff should have been late.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interpreting what the honourable senator said. She said that, in fact, that is what happened and her staff member was 48 minutes late. For that I am very sorry. If it is the Government's fault, we are sorry. But I want to come immediately to a point made by Senator Coleman. I think, from the figures she has given, that there could be a case for a bigger taxi fleet in the Australian Capital Territory, irrespective of the operations of the Parliament. The honourable senator took some trouble to give us taxi to population ratios. Irrespective of whether the Parliament is here, those figures show that per head there are half as many taxis in the Australian Capital Territory as there are in most other capital cities. I will certainly pass that on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with honourable senators that it is quite inappropriate that there should be any suggestion that this is directed at either Frank Stewart or Steve Heggen. They look after us with great dedication and care, as have all transport officers. We can make bookings in two main ways, either through the booking office in the Department of Administrative Services or through our own transport officers in the Parliament. In the case of the DAS booking service, when a Commonwealth car is not available for a senator or member an attempt is made to book a hire car. Failing that, a taxi is booked. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the shuttle service, bookings are made by the parliamentary transport officers. The Department provides the vehicles for the shuttle on the basis of the numbers requested. They can be Commonwealth cars, hire cars or shuttle cars. I admit that for 18 months now I have been a Minister, but in my period in the Parliament up to that time I found the taxis and hire contractors in this city to be, in the main, reliable, courteous, safe and reasonable. But in peak periods, particularly during parliamentary sittings, taxi availability may be difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept Senator Coleman's concern about security. I will pass that on to Mr Newman because I think there is a reasonable point to be raised there and to be answered. I am not willing to take on board that our dignity requires that we receive a certain kind of transport. What we require is to get from point A to point B. Irrespective of whether we go in a drive-yourself car, as I choose to do whenever there is a strike, or by way of taxi, hire car or Commonwealth car, our dignity is not really affected. Senator Georges mentioned the fact that senators and members have to talk to people and said that he thought the cars were unsafe. That is a matter for the Australian Capital Territory authorities. I do not really believe it is good enough for parliamentarians to say that we are special and different and deserve better treatment than other people receive . If taxi transport is good enough for me-I use it in Sydney and my family uses it-I do not know why it is not good enough for other people. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren asked a question about a particular person and asked whether he in fact was receiving a certain kind of salary. I will have to ascertain that information for the honourable senator. Whether a Senate select committee should look into this issue is entirely a matter for the Senate to determine. The Senate appoints its own committees. I would not presume to have a judgment on that. I merely say that, as a senator, I would take part in any debate on such an issue at an appropriate time. In conclusion, I must say-I separate Senator Haines's concern from this because her concern was for her staff-that I am sometimes disappointed when it seems that the greatest passion is aroused in this place when dealing with a matter of our own comfort and our own convenience . </PARA>

That is so irrespective of the level of the position held in this Parliament. For that matter, it applies equally well to the people in the cars that we spoke about.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) As I have stated in answers to the honourable senator's previous questions (Nos 856 and 1374) on the habitation review process, the aim of these annual habitation reviews is to help maintain up-to-date electoral rolls. The reviews are as much concerned with seeing that eligible electors have their names placed on the electoral rolls as they are with the removal of ineligible electors. Accordingly, in order to give Parliament a total picture of enrolment activity, I asked the Chief Australian Electoral Officer to supplement the information sought by the honourable senator and provide details of additions to the rolls as well as the deletion details which have been requested.</PARA>
<PARA> The Chief Australian Electoral Officer has provided answers to parts (1) (a) and (2) (a) in the two tables set out below. The tables also include details of additions to the relevant Divisional rolls in two parts-the ''New Enrolments'' figures represent new enrolments and interstate transfers of enrolment; the ' Transfers' figures represent intrastate transfers of enrolment.</PARA>
<PARA> In essence the statistics show that in the year to December 1981, the names of 349,759 electors were removed from the electoral rolls following objection action on the grounds of non-residence, whilst on the other side of the ledger 1 ,032,339 names were added to the rolls throughout Australia during the same period. Of course, as the honourable senator will appreciate, these were not all new arrivals in Australia of persons turning 18 years of age. But this figure clearly takes into account people who have moved from one address to another, whose names have been removed from the first address by the required objection process, and whose names have been re-entered on the roll at their new address- many of them as a result of habitation review work in the area to which they have moved.</PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned in answer to Question No. 856 the Australian Electoral Office does not maintain statistics in a form which would enable precise answers to be given to parts (1) (b) and (2) (b). Electors' names are removed from the rolls as a consequence of objection action on the grounds of non-residence within Divisions concerned, pursuant to the provisions of sections 52 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and regulations 26 to 31 of the Electoral and Referendum Regulations. The main sources of objection on the grounds of non- residence are Habitation Reviews and follow-up action in respect of non-voters at elections (both Commonwealth and State) but the statistics maintained by the Electoral Office do not so differentiate.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable senator will appreciate, removals from the roll as a result of objection action during 1981 are much higher than in 1980. This is brought about as the result of non-voter follow-up action following the October 1980 Federal election as well as non-voter follow-up following by-elections in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Electoral Office does not maintain statistics which would enable precise answers to be given to parts (1) (c) and (2) (c)-electoral rolls are maintained on a sub-divisional basis. To assist the honourable senator transfers out of a sub-divisions have been totalled. However, the statistics maintained by the Australian Electoral Office do not differentiate between transfers between sub-divisions within a Division and transfers to sub-divisions in other Divisions. The figures supplied therefore cannot be interpreted as transfers from Division to Division.</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Enrolment transactions in each Federal Division in the 12 months to December 1981 showing:</PARA>

Because of the considerable changes made to sub-division boundaries as a result of the redistribution all polling places within the State were abolished and re- appointed within the new sub-divisional boundaries-the changes set out in the table are in addition to these abolitions/appointments.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. (a) and (b) The Australian Electoral Office has advised that Habitation Reviews are normally conducted on the annual basis (during each financial year). As was mentioned in answers to the honourable senator's earlier questions on this subject, officers who conduct the reviews are employed on piece rates (i.e. they are paid an amount in respect of each habitation reviewed) and are not employed on an hourly basis.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator will recall that to answer question No. 856 an estimate of the numbers of hours review officers worked was made. However, because of the basis of payment which gives no direct indication of the actual time spent on review work and because of the various densities of habitation within areas and the mixture of such areas within and between Divisions the information quite clearly could only be based on very broad estimates. Therefore, to give the honourable senator an accurate picture of review work undertaken, details of the actual number of habitations reviewed in each month in each Division are provided.</PARA>
<PARA> The following table sets out, by Division, the number of staff employed on habitation reviews in 1981 together with details of habitations reviewed in each month in each Division during 1981:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Offset orders placed with Australian manufacturers total $11.8m at March 1982 against an obligation of $35.4m. Major elements include:</PARA>
<PARA> Electrical connectors and other components</PARA>
<PARA> Refrigeration equipment</PARA>
<PARA> Electronic equipment</PARA>
<PARA> Machine tools</PARA>
<PARA> Tank battery lead</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) When the first contracts for Leopard tanks were signed in May 1975 the then Government agreed that the associated industry program would be provided by offsets, manufacture of ammunition and some components and the setting up of support capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Capacity for the manufacture of ammunition is well advanced; spare gun barrels have been manufactured; the Drivers Night Sight is being manufactured by industry in South Australia; track refurbishment is underway; local production of brake discs, pads and running-gear spares is being investigated together with other high usage items. The engine manufacturer has set up an overhaul facility in New South Wales which could later be used to overhaul Leopard engines and the Army has established a comprehensive overhaul capability. Technology transfer to Australia has occurred in the above areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (6) More than 500 enquiries for offset items from Australia have been listed by Krauss Maffei and its sub-contractors. This list includes a small number of independent offers by Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the earlier enquiries were badly directed, or were for goods not qualifying as offset-such as coal. In response to Departmental pressure Krauss- Maffei has, in the past two years, made increased efforts to satisfy its obligation including mounting a purchasing mission which visited major Australian cities during 1980. Several follow-up visits have taken place and the Company has sought a two year extension to the offset period to give it further opportunity to satisfy its obligation.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The cumulative value of contracts with Krauss-Maffei is about DM300m ($120m ).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 March 1982 (Hansard, page 569) Senator Martyr asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Minister for Defence aware of the feeling expressed in Western Australia last weekend that the new ship of war acquired by the Government should be home-ported at HMAS Stirling, Garden Island, Western Australia. Will the Minister convey this sentiment to Cabinet and, I hope, support it himself?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It is assumed the ship referred to in the question is HMS Invincible; if so there are no plans to home-port her in Western Australia. A significant shore based infrastructure is required to support an aircraft carrier on a permanent basis and this is only available on the East Coast. Nevertheless Invincible will be able to operate from HMAS Stirling and should circumstances so dictate she could be base-ported there for limited periods.</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1980, up to two destroyers have been base-ported from time to time at HMAS Stirling for short periods. This practice will continue. It is planned the first destroyer will commence home-porting at HMAS Stirling in early 1984 with a second destroyer home-ported by mid 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> This requirement has given rise to significant infrastructure developments in the area including:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Armament Depot, HMAS Stirling. Completed in October 1981 at a cost of $4m;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 20,000 tonne oil fuel installation, HMAS Stirling. Due for completion in October 1982 at a cost of $2.6m;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) modifications to South Fremantle slipway to accommodate destroyer escorts and submarines. Completed in May 1980 at a cost of $0.4m;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) land is being purchased progressively in the Rockingham area for additional housing associated with HMAS Stirling; 19 additional houses have been built since February 1980 and a further 126 are planned for construction in the current Five Year Defence Program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) My Department does not receive details of dairy and factory's monthly production or stock figures. For the purposes of the dairy industry stabilization marketing arrangements, the Australian Dairy Corporation (ADC) receives, on a confidential basis, details of production of the prescribed products by factories. For planning purposes, manufacturers also make available to the ADC details of their stock holdings of prescribed products on a commercial-in-confidence basis.

<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) The information sought by the honourable senator is unavailable.

<PARA> Two reasons for this difficulty are, first, technological change is only one of many factors affecting employment; second, the employment consequences of technological change comprise both direct and indirect effects, the latter being of a complex nature.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) There has been considerable speculation in Australia and overseas in recent years about the number of jobs affected by technological change. As indicated in response to question 2086 there are difficulties even in estimating the number of jobs which have been affected by technological change previously introduced. These difficulties are greater in the case of forecasting, particularly over a long time horizon. Reliable information pertinent to the honourable senator's question is thus unavailable. As historical evidence suggests, new technologies have employment generation as well as employment displacement effects. It is therefore perhaps more appropriate to consider net employment effects, although the forecasting problems I have described also apply to employment created by technological change.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There are several Government schemes and initiatives which, although they cannot be regarded as 'controls', help ease the process of adjusting to change.</PARA>
<PARA> On the recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia (CITCA), the Government established the Technological Change Committee as a sub-committee of the Australian Science and Technology Council, to monitor and report on the direct and indirect effects of technological change.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also accepted CITCA recommendations for increased effort by employers where technological change is to be introduced in the areas of consultation with, notification of and provision of information to employees. The Commonwealth Employment Service, the Relocation Assistance Scheme and the Government's manpower programs are aimed at improving the mobility, adaptability and skill level of the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that, in the long term, the employment prospects of Australians are dependent on the innovativeness and competitiveness of Australian industry and its ability to keep pace with the latest technological advances.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 February 1982 (Hansard page 78) Senator Townley asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and it refers to public telephones. I preface it by saying that I note from a letter I received a couple of years ago from Telecom Australia that it anticipated income of some $1,000 from each public telephone before a new one was installed. Of course I realise that that figure may now be somewhat higher. Now that Telecom has decided to increase public telephone calls to 20 cents, will this mean that Telecom will re-examine the number of public telephones that are installed and consequently install many more so that those people who are without a private telephone will have a public telephone more easily available to them?</PARA>
<PARA> Will Telecom convert most telephones to take 50 cent pieces as well as 20 cent pieces so that people who make subscriber trunk dialling calls, long distance calls, will not get arm ache from putting the 20 cent pieces in?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, will Telecom convert as many public telephones as possible to the international subscriber dialling system so that people without that service available to them at home will have it available at public telephones?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> As background to the honourable senator's question, Telecom advises that the loss on the public telephone service in 1980-81 was about $43.3m or the equivalent of over $1,350 per public telephone in service at the end of that year.</PARA>
<PARA> The figure of $1,100 quoted by the honourable senator was assessed some years ago and has been the average annual revenue used as a guide in determining whether a public telephone should be installed at a particular location. Clearly, in the light of the above loss figure, $1,100 is insufficient to offset the network costs of handling calls from the unit plus the maintenance and continuing running costs of clearing, cleaning and lighting the unit itself . The figure of $1,100 is therefore being re-assessed in view of cost increases to Telecom since it was first established.</PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the honourable senator's specific queries, the recent increase in the public telephone fee was designed to help offset the high loss being incurred on the public telephone service rather than to provide additional public telephones which will continue to be installed in particular locations on the basis of expected revenue and community needs.</PARA>
<PARA> There are currently some 26,000 of the new type green public telephones in service. Whilst similar in appearance, there are two types-the CT3 and the CT3 (I)-and, because of the technical and cost considerations, the earlier CT3 units (some 20,000) will be converted to 20c operation only. Of the remaining 6 ,000 CT3 (I) units, 2,500 will be converted to 20/50c operation in 1982-83 at a relatively low cost. Also, 2,000 new type public telephones will be installed in 1982-83 and these will have 20/50c operation.</PARA>
<PARA> The 20/50c units will be available in areas with a high incidence of STD and/ or ISD usage. Telecom will convert as many public telephones to ISD as is practicable bearing in mind particular local exchange equipment restrictions and the need for such a service. It will also give consideration to 'out of area' provision of ISD public telephone facilities in areas where the local exchange equipment is not suitable for ISD and where subscriber requirements justify such action, for example, where there is a high level of overseas calls being booked through operators from public telephones.</PARA>
