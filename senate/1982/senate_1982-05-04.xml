<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to the statement by the Minister for Defence of 25 March 1980. The Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of fundamental importance to our military operations and defence preparedness is an improved availability of resources for such things as spare parts, maintenance and equipment repair, flying hours, steaming time, ammunition holdings and other stores, and higher states of training of skilled manpower. In these respects also we aim to broaden the expansion base and reduce the lead time for movement to a higher state of operational readiness . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I now ask: What changes in Australia's strategic environment have occurred that justified the Minister's announcement last week of restraints on training activities and equipment repair, and reductions of fuel and other stock holdings levels, and services and activities, including the Navy's steaming time, the Army's utilisation of its armoured vehicles and service flying hours in respect of the Air Force?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not disagree with the views expressed by the Minister for Defence, nor would he disagree with what Senator Button quoted. The matters in the statement by the Minister for Defence on Thursday of last week to which Senator Button referred indicated that there was some rearrangement of priorities and rescheduling of certain matters in relation to the overall decisions which have been made by the Government in recent months. In relation to manpower, of course, the implementation of the Coldham recommendations added very considerably to the costs of wages and salaries in this year and the purchase of the Invincible requires payments to be made at an earlier date than was anticipated. But, as I said, apart from substantially a rescheduling of payments and a rearrangement to a relatively small extent of some priorities such as those mentioned by Senator Button, the overall commitment of the Government to defence remains undiminished. That is exemplified by the fact that , as the Prime Minister has already said, this financial year there will be in fact a substantial increase in the expenditure on defence. The actual cash spent by the Government on defence this year will be increased by 19 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask a supplementary question. Does the Minister appreciate that this is not really a matter of expense? It is a matter of a statement made by the Minister for Defence in 1980 that flying hours and Royal Australian Navy steaming time would be increased as a matter of Government policy. The question is: What has changed, in terms of Australia's strategic environment, which enables the Minister to say that these things are no longer important in 1982? Let me put it also in these terms: Was the decision which was made in 1980 wrong in regard to Australia's strategic preparedness?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I made it clear in my answer that we are dealing with matters of degree and, to some extent, a rearrangement of priorities; but there is no disagreement with the broad thrust of the statement that was made by the Minister for Defence in March 1980. As far as the specifics of the reductions of flying or steaming time are concerned, one would have to have regard to the details of the position in March 1980, which was referred to, as against the position today. If Senator Button wants that sort of detail I certainly will refer the matter to the Minister for Defence to see whether he has anything to add to what I have said.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator asked how I can do that without notice. The Minister for Energy in New South Wales, Mr Landa, stated in the Press-I take it that all honourable senators can read-that it was expected that the extension of daylight saving, which occurred in New South Wales and in the Australian Capital Territory in recent times, would save one per cent of energy otherwise used in that period. Indeed, it was estimated that in other States the effect of daylight saving would be a reduction of one per cent in usage of electric energy. I am sorry that Senator Georges rejects the statements of his Labor colleague, but that is for him to judge. That is a measurement in terms of electric energy. One does not know what other consumption of energy may offset it-for example, fuel energy if there is a greater use of automotive vehicles during daylight hours. Fundamentally, it was expected that, with the conservation campaign going on, upwards of 6 per cent of energy could be saved in New South Wales, of which I understand one per cent would be from daylight saving. I think daylight saving is carried out for social reasons as well as for energy conservation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> There will be 10 additional patrol boats ordered, to meet increased surveillance and patrol requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>I draw to his attention also legislation passed in the House of Representatives a fortnight ago which entails increased responsibilities to patrol off-shore rigs following an alteration to Customs legislation permitting direct importing of goods at the rigs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the important matter to be emphasised in relation to this question is that the Government has decided that it will not at this stage proceed with the acquisition of an additional five patrol boats. There has not been a decision, as has been reported widely, that the Government will not proceed with the acquisition of those boats. The decision is simply that the Government will not proceed at this stage. That is part of the point that I was trying to make in answer to Senator Button. There has been simply a necessary rescheduling of purchases and programs and a rearrangement of priorities. There has not been a decision to cancel the acquisition of these five additional patrol boats. There was a decision in the first place-as Senator Elstob's question recognised-to buy the additional patrol boats. There has been a decision not to proceed with the purchase at this stage. The decision to purchase has not been cancelled or reversed.</PARA></TALK.START>

As the Minister has said that at this stage it is not necessary to purchase the five additional patrol boats, does he mean that at this stage there is no need to have surveillance to stop drugs coming into the country? Is there no fear that drugs are coming into this country over the water , something which the Navy would normally stop if it had extra patrol boats?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate by referring to the many pronouncements in the media by leaders in business and industry that, largely through excessive wage demands, crippling industrial disputes and shorter working hours, Australians are squandering their future.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have outlined to the Senate the particular difficulties and challenges that Australia faces at this moment because of rising wage demands. The Senate is well aware that in the first half of the 1970s wages rose very rapidly and, indeed, during a brief time in 1974-75 rose by 37 per cent. The effect of that was effectively to cost us out of world markets. In the years that followed the Government tackled inflation in such a way that our trade relations improved to a point where they were better than they had been for some 10 years. But the recession overseas has caused countries overseas to take stock of their cost position. They are now discounting wages. Indeed, trade unions and employees are taking cuts in wages voluntarily in order to keep their countries competitive. The result is that the rate of inflation is falling overseas, whereas in Australia it has not fallen in recent months. The fact is that there is a danger, therefore, that our competitiveness will diminish rapidly unless there is a full understanding of this matter in Australia. I do not believe that the Australian people are incapable of the will or the decision-making ability to tackle this matter, so long as it is clearly understood. Governments themselves, particularly State Labor governments, have been pacesetters in high wage claims. These kinds of things are bad and set a bad example. They will delimit our ability to trade. Senator Walters, therefore, has put her finger very rightly upon one of the major things that are bedevilling Australia at present and will bedevil Australia in the months ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Leader of the Government in the Senate aware that the Australian economy is now generating only half the number of new jobs needed to prevent the level of unemployment rising further? Is he aware also of recent reports of robots playing an increasingly active role in Japanese manufacturing, to the extent that some firms have cut employment levels dramatically and that it is believed that in 10 years half of everything made in Japan will be produced by robots? Does the Minister concur with a report in today's Australian that the new technology of robotics is expected to prove central to the future of Australian industry? For instance, it is estimated that Japanese painting robots can do 1.5 times the work of human painters, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Given these statements and given the already declining level of job creation in Australia, can the Minister inform the Senate of the steps the Government is taking, or proposes to take, such as long term indicative planning , in order to overcome the effects of the silicon chip and technological change on employment levels?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Siddons's question is really an extension of the question asked by Senator Walters and, indeed, of my answer to that question . Representatives of manufacturing industry and commerce have pointed out to the Government that wage rises and cost pressures of recent times are such that their capacity to employ is being diminished and that, therefore, there will be fewer new job opportunities. That is basic to the effect of rising costs and specifically of higher wages. The primary solution to that problem is to try to get in Australia an understanding such as has been reached and is being reached elsewhere in the world; namely, that there should be some moderation of this upward pressure of nominal wages, which in the end destroys real wages and jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand the other part of Senator Siddons's question, which referred to robots and silicon chips, the implication is that such introductions will destroy employment. I have to say that every study that has been made over the years, of any authoritative background in terms of the effect of new technology on job creation, has found that in fact technology does not threaten job creation, that what does happen--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the previous Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Hawke, was on a committee-not five years ago but several years ago-which, if my memory serves me correctly, concluded in part what I have just stated. The fact of the matter is that members of the Labor Party are now saying that Mr Hawke is out of date. I noticed that fact was borne out in the Labor Party ballots the other day-he was very much out of date. The fact is that over the years throughout the world studies have been made of the effect of technology upon job creation. The evidence, which has been very persuasive, has shown that there need not be job displacement in the overall or net sense of job loss but that in fact new technology should create greater opportunities for increasing purchasing power by reducing costs. There should therefore be a wider ability to create more materials and more demands both within the tertiary sector and within ordinary employment. That, I think, still stands in the judgment of those who have expert judgment on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All of those who have engaged in the pursuit of the technology and the long term commercial development of synthetic crudes have been emphatic that the one stimulus that is necessary is for the price of natural petroleum products to be such that syn-crudes would be competitive with them. It has been indicated in Australia repeatedly that import parity pricing would be sufficient stimulus for that purpose. It so happens that for a short time in recent months-and prospectively for some little time-there has been a very temporary surplus of oil in the world. That surplus will disappear. The goals of the energy program still remain the same. Oil will become scarcer and scarcer in the long term and it will become dearer and dearer. There will be a need for synthetic crudes. In terms of the present surpluses, there is a realisation that there will not be as pressing a commercial need for synthetic crudes in the immediate years ahead as had been thought before. No one is suggesting that in the longer term synthetic crude production will not be necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing I would like to say in relation to the Colony announcement this morning is that Esso has advised the Government that this will not affect in any way the arrangement that has been made with the Rundle joint venturers. The joint venture contractual arrangements which became effective in March this year commit Esso to expenditures of at least $30m at Rundle over the first three years of a technical investigation program. That will not be affected. Secondly, I understand that a decision has never been made for an immediate go-ahead of the Colony project. I would take it to be a deferral because of the temporary glut. I do not think that anybody within the energy industry anywhere in the world believes that the glut will remain for any real length of time or that the need for synthetics has been removed or put aside for any really long period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne's question is in a number of parts. The Australian Foundation on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence is financed by the Government, certainly as to some of the costs of its federal secretariat. In addition, I believe that it receives funds for the conduct of its alcoholism in industry program, which is one of the constructive approaches to try to ameliorate the effects of alcoholism in the Australian work force. Yes, it does receive funding from the Commonwealth. It is, in fact, a responsible and leading body in the area of drug dependence and alcohol abuse. It tries to express a reasoned view in what are very difficult areas. The Commonwealth Government has responded to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, the Williams inquiry, and has announced that it does not intend to alter the laws relating to the use of cannabis. So to that extent there is a Government policy and a Government statement. I know of nothing which would suggest that that policy is about to be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recommendations of the Williams inquiry were made in the light of the current knowledge about these different drugs and about their dangers. One of the things that has been needed in this country is a constructive public debate. I think we should welcome anyone who will contribute to that public debate in a way that will help to increase understanding free of hysteria. I think Senator Crichton-Browne has quite properly expressed a concern that there should be no precipitate action in an area of great social sensitivity. But I think the honourable senator would also accept that while AFADD is trying to move the public debate, however carefully, that is to be welcomed. We as individuals do not have to agree with its conclusions or with the different points to which it takes the argument. In past times I have, of course, contributed to this debate through a Senate committee. In answer to the essential part of the honourable senator's question, the Government policy is clear and unchanged and AFADD is funded from the Federal Government for some of its activities at least.</PARA>

I would think that we would need to await its first Budget to see what exactly it will have in mind with regard to expenditure and the raising of revenue because I have also seen some comments about that. I would not assume that any change of direction-if that is what has occurred-in relation to its policy is as a result of watching the expenditure of the Federal Government or the expression of any of our economic attitudes. I also have no comment to make, as far as expenditure patterns are concerned, on the bankruptcy of New South Wales. Perhaps if I were asked to comment on the Western Australian Government I would reiterate some of the statements made by the former Victorian Government; that is, if that Government had had full access to the revenue raised in that State and was not required under existing arrangements to transfer it to other States it may have been in a healthier position.</PARA></TALK.START>

I commend Mr Brack's statement to her and also table it. I understand that Telecom's objective is to improve services to its subscribers. It is for this reason that it has been trying progressively to upgrade the services available to those who use telephone services in Australia.

<PARA> Before the new systems are introduced the impact of the new exchanges is discussed by Telecom with local communities and with its own staff because it is clear that there will be some changes in practice and some people may find some uncertainties with the new arrangements.

The observations that have been made about the value of manual telephonists will be taken into account in the decisions that have to be taken. They will not be ignored; they are considered as an important input. It is important, though, to note that more telephone information is available through automatic exchanges than at present is possible under the manually operated system. An automatic exchange gives people extra capacities and extra opportunities. I will have to seek information on one other part of the honourable senator's question-her question about the 000 service.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the article, but one of the major recommendations in the report of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment, which Professor Bruce Williams brought down several years ago, was directed towards the responsibility to ensure that students do not fail resting not only upon the students and their families but also upon the institutions. A very strong view had been held before that this was up to the student. I remember from my student days the old university song: 'The profs have issued a bold decree that 50 per cent must fail. It might be you and it might be me but it is all to no avail'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Williams Committee did not take that as a useful kind of approach. The Government adopted Professor Williams's recommendation that heavy responsibility to reduce failure rates should be placed upon the academic staff. In my last few weeks of responsibility for the education portfolio I travelled throughout Australia discussing this and other matters with academic staff. If indeed there is this fall-out it is a matter for the particular institution concerned to look at and to be sure that the defects do not lie only on the students' side but also relate to a need for better communication, better counselling and a better relationship in teaching, which might produce less attrition. I feel it is a very sad thing indeed that, very high standards for the higher school certificate and therefore very high admission levels to a tertiary institution having been set, there should be significant fall-outs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The provision of anti-submarine warfare helicopters was dealt with at some length by the Minister for Defence in his statement regarding the Invincible. It is not simply a question of the numbers of such helicopters; it is also a question of their ability to be used in a concentrated way, operating from effective vessels in all circumstances. The decision to acquire the Invincible was influenced very considerably by the fact that the helicopters can be concentrated on a vessel of that size from which they can be used much more effectively than from an FFG. In fact, a larger number of such frigates would be needed to provide even the number of helicopters that can operate from the Invincible, apart altogether from the other operational improvements provided by the Invincible. It is not a question simply of numbers; it is also a question of the way in which they are deployed.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the four years I had the education portfolio I did not have brought before me the question of financing significant deficits of universities or other tertiary institutions. The normal Bills which come forward to this place and another place for the provision of revenue for such institutions provide an amount of money for the year and not for the offset of any deficits that may be carried over.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I think there is some concern by the Government that, in the final run to the end of this year, it is obvious that the Budget deficit will be greater than was anticipated at the time of the Budget last August. I think it was made clear in a recent statement by the Treasurer that the best estimate of the increase in the Budget deficit at the moment is that it will be about $1,000m at the close of the financial year. I give that figure, stressing the fact that receipts vary from day to day and collections of company tax and other revenue are still likely to be varied from our present expectations. But there is concern that the deficit is greater than that anticipated at the time of the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we have discussed this matter in some detail at various stages, pointing to the increases in salaries and the reduction in revenue that have arisen in a number of instances during this financial year. However, it is not long now until the end of the financial year when all of these things will be able to be shown more accurately. I simply say at this time that there is concern with regard to the overexpenditure and the under-receipt of revenue. I think the increase of $1,000m that was given by the Treasurer is, at this stage, the most likely outcome of the Budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yet again I have to bring before the Senate the plight of Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland. I have to do so because of the total failure of both the Queensland Government and the Fraser Government to achieve land rights for Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland. As the Senate is aware, in the absence of Federal Government action, the Senate, with the support of the Australian Democrats, the Australian Labor Party and Government Senators Bonner and Missen, passed legislation which would give Queensland Aboriginal and Islander people land rights to their reserves. However, now that the Bill has been for some time in the House of Representatives, it is clear that the Federal Government has made up its mind that it will not proceed with that legislation. There can be only one reason for its refusal to proceed-that is, the Fraser Government's fear of the Bjelke- Petersen Government in Queensland. The Fraser Government has never at any time shown any willingness to carry out its constitutional responsibility in Aboriginal affairs and stand up to State governments of its own political complexion which are not prepared to ensure the rights of Aboriginal people. In this instance I am very disappointed to have to say again to the Senate that Senator Baume has failed to act in the same way as his predecessors failed to act. He has failed to challenge the Bjelke-Petersen Government's refusal to grant land rights. He has failed to assert the Federal Government's responsibility and he has left Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland with no hope of achieving anything from either the State Government or the present Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There may be many reasons for the Fraser Government's inadequacy and Senator Baume's inadequacy in particular. Of course, the Government has had other things on its mind. Lately it has been so strife torn and demoralised that as it lurches from crisis to crisis it is not surprising that there is little energy left for it to deal with the really serious issues confronting this country, such as the unresolved question of Aboriginal land in Queensland. As the Government fights for its political life the future of Queensland Aboriginal people may seem of little consequence to it. However, the Government, even in terms of its own electoral health, is making a great mistake in trying to ignore this outstanding moral question. I believe that at the next opportunity Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland and in other parts of Australia will use their numbers in many critical, marginal seats to demonstrate to the Federal Government that it no longer has their support. I remind the Government that support for Queensland Aborigines amongst a wide range of community organisations, trade union organisations and church groups is growing all the time. The Government is flying in the face of community opinion by refusing to act in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion that I have moved today provides me with my first opportunity in the Senate to discuss the matter of Aboriginal land rights in Queensland since the Queensland Government brought down its long-awaited Aboriginal land legislation on 25 March of this year. Honourable senators will be aware that that legislation has been universally condemned-by church groups, lawyers, the media, of course by the Aboriginal people themselves and by the Labor Party. I remind honourable senators that this pathetic legislation, which solves none of the problems of Aboriginal land in Queensland, is the legislation that Senator Baume , the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, for so long urged us to wait for. For 18 months Senator Baume kept assuring the Senate and me that he was keeping a close watch on the situation in Queensland, that he was negotiating with the Queensland Premier and that we must take no legislative action in this Parliament because the matter would be resolved by Queensland Government action. For 18 months he asked Queensland Aboriginal and Islander people to do nothing in defence of their situation. </PARA>
<PARA> During those 18 months when he assured us that constructive negotiations were taking place, he laid down four principles which he said the Federal Government would require to be satisfied by the Queensland legislation. The four principles -I am sure honourable senators must nearly know them off by heart by now, we have heard them so often-were that the integrity of the present reserve boundaries be maintained, that there be secure tenure for occupants and preservation of their rights to use the land, that local communities play a significant role in the management of the reserves, and that there be full consultation with Aboriginal and Islander people before any decisions were made. It will be clear to honourable senators and to the public that the Bjelke- Petersen legislation satisfies not one of these criteria. Yet, Senator Baume has taken no action. Senator Baume has even stated that the Queensland legislation represents significant advances. How can he expect to retain any credibility in his portfolio when he lays down the criteria which he says his Government will insist on and then none of them are met? Yet he still expects Aboriginal and Islander people to accept this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is Senator Baume's belief that the Queensland legislation represents a significant advance, or any kind of advance at all, then that belief is shared by nobody else in this country. For example, Queensland Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops were concerned enough about the situation to seek independent legal advice. They engaged a Melbourne barrister, Mr Frank Brennan, to analyse the Queensland legislation. I have a copy of that report. I will draw the attention of the Senate to relevant sections of it. For example, it states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the country reserves (of which there are at least 28, accommodating 20-30 per cent of the State's aboriginal and islander reserve population) are not to be affected in any way by this legislation and they are not to receive the benefit, if any, of any deed of grant in trust. </PARA>
<PARA>Another point states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-in-Council may exclude from the grant ways of access, ' improvements the property of the crown' such as hospitals, police stations and their surrounds. It may also exclude from the grant an area of land . . . which need not be described by locality but which will remain available for public purposes generally. </PARA>
<PARA>A third point states:</PARA>
<PARA> The boundaries of the community reserve lands could be varied at any time by order of the Governor-in-Council freed from any parliamentary scrutiny whatsoever. The Governor-in-Council could also vary the purpose for which any land was granted. </PARA>
<PARA>And so on. There is a disallowance procedure available for any decision of the Governor-in-Council. But, of course, that disallowance procedure is available only to the Queensland Parliament. One can hardly imagine the Queensland Parliament, as it is currently constituted, disallowing any decision which the Government wanted. It is an impossibility. This is not a proper provision of parliamentary scrutiny. That disallowance procedure, if it were to have any effect at all, should be a disallowance procedure by the Federal Parliament. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> A Community Council, if and when appointed trustee of land, could be removed as trustee by the Governor-in-Council if it is of opinion that such a removal would be in the public interests. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> A Council will be able to lease plots of land or houses to individuals, groups or families. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Lands is empowered to require a Council to charge the highest rent which can reasonably be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Lands has the discretion to allow or disallow residents to enter into mortgages. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Council has no power to allow people to roam, hunt and gather for more than a month without the prior written consent of the Minister for Lands. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> No provision has been made to guarantee traditional hunting, foraging and fishing rights. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The security of tenure and integrity of reserve boundaries are no more assured by deeds of grant in trust under the Land Act with proposed amendments than are aboriginal lands at present. There is no legal, workable check on the unfettered discretion of the Governor-in-Council proposed. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Brennan concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> The full enjoyment of the land and the free exercise of Councils' powers will be more dependent on ministerial goodwill than on the provisions of law. </PARA>
<PARA> The rights enjoyed by the occupiers of the land will be significantly less than those enjoyed by most landholders in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that when the Minister replies to my matter of public importance he will take up these legal points which have been made and which, in my view, are unarguable. It is very clear that the legislation is a total failure. That opinion, of course, was backed up by an opinion from Mr Bill Pincus, leader of the Bar Association of Queensland. His conclusions stated:</PARA>
<PARA> My response . . . is that no security is offered and, as to the second, no question arises as to the security offered being guaranteed by Act of Parliament . If there was a genuine intention of giving security of tenure, it is manifest that that intention has by no means been achieved in the Bill placed before me. </PARA>
<PARA>The failure of the Queensland legislation to respond to the wishes of the Aboriginal people of Queensland or, indeed, to Senator Baume's four principles has thus been confirmed. The Queensland bishops condemned the legislation yet Senator Baume was too weak to do more than put out a statement saying that whilst the Commonwealth Government had some 'particular concerns'-we might learn what they are in the course of this debate-the legislation represented ' significant advances'. The National Aboriginal Conference, elected by Aborigines to advise the Federal Government on Aboriginal matters, has also condemned the Queensland legislation and supported and called for Federal Government action to secure land rights. Of course, Senator Baume not only ignores the NAC's advice; he can hardly find the time even to listen to it. No wonder the NAC, the Government's own national advisory body on Aboriginal affairs, has called for the resignation of Senator Baume. But perhaps Senator Baume, who is smiling across the chamber now as though these matters are of no concern to him, feels that he does not have to spend time with Aboriginal organisations any more because he may be reshuffled out of the portfolio by the end of the week. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators and the Government in particular of the wide- ranging support there is for Federal Government action to provide land rights for Queensland Aborigines. In 1978 the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs supported Commonwealth action. The World Council of Churches team which visited Australia in 1981 identified land rights as a prerequisite for any significant advances for Aboriginal people and recommended Commonwealth action. The major Queensland church groups-including Anglican, Catholic and Uniting-have all supported Commonwealth action in the absence of any satisfactory State action. So it goes on. A survey last year of Torres Strait Islanders reflected the findings of every unbiased poll ever taken amongst Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders-overwhelming support for land rights. </PARA>
<PARA> These people have now turned to the Federal Government to satisfy their demands and needs. Their elected body, the NAC, has asked the Government to act. It has already the support of some overseas leaders-for example, Father Lini of Vanuatu -and is seeking more overseas support to increase international pressure on the Commonwealth Government to carry out its responsibilities. Yet, instead of paying heed to the Aboriginals, the Senate, the churches and even the international community, the Federal Government has chosen to take the line of least resistance and acquiesce to the proposals of Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen. I remind the Senate that he is a man who in New Zealand this week described Australian Aboriginals as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . very wealthy people, like the Sheiks of the Middle East . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that the Aborigines 'already own and control vast areas of land'. That is a statement from a man who is unwilling to give the Aborigines the less than 2 per cent of Queensland to which they want title. Yet this is the man that Senator Baume says we must support and whose legislation is acceptable. The Premier has made it abundantly clear over the last 12 months that he is working against Aboriginal rights and especially against Aboriginal land rights in Queensland. His behaviour has been a litany of breaches of faith with the Aboriginal people. First he labelled the World Council of Churches as communist because it brought to light the unacceptable living standards of Aboriginal Australians and supported land rights. More recently he claimed that the land rights movement was a Soviet plot. Premier Bjelke-Petersen claimed in the Queensland Parliament that the land rights movement was aimed at obtaining large sections of the northern part of Australia for use by communist governments to train people of non-saxon races in guerrilla warfare. This is the man whom Senator Baume and the Commonwealth Government back up in the matter of rights for Queensland Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also the episode of the Premier claiming to have information that the Queensland Aborigines were going to Libya to train as terrorists. What happened to that bizarre, insane claim? An investigation by the Department of Foreign Affairs found no evidence to support the Premier's allegations-of course. In other words, it was simply another mischievous attempt by the Premier to discredit those working towards land rights. Why is not the Fraser Government challenging these fanatical and mad claims by the Premier of Queensland? It remains silent in the face of those claims. It allows these absurd myths to be perpetrated through the media with very few or very weak attempts at correction.</PARA>
<PARA> On a more concrete level, the Queensland Government has just refused to transfer a second pastoral lease to the Aboriginal Development Commission. The case relating to the Queensland Government's failure to transfer a pastoral lease at Archer River to the Aboriginal Development Commission is still before the High Court of Australia. The Queensland Government has now confirmed its racist stance by refusing the transfer of a second pastoral lease. So much for the Premier's claim that Aborigines are treated just like other Queenslanders. Where is an example of the Government holding up the transfer of a lease to any white property owner in Queensland? It simply does not happen. Of course the Premier objects to any public money being spent on restoring land to the dispossessed indigenous people of Australia. Senator Bjelke-Petersen has recently told us that the money would be better spent on roads. </PARA>
<PARA> That series of quotations and references to the Premier of Queensland should remind the Senate of the calibre of the State Government which Senator Peter Baume and his Government are now backing. I wonder whether Senator Peter Baume read an article by Stephen Mills in the Age of 2 April this year entitled 'None from four near enough for Baume'. I think this article very accurately described the Minister's response to the Queensland Government's action when it stated that he appeared fiercely determined to be conciliatory in his response to the legislation. The fact that not one of Senator Peter Baume's four principles had been satisfied in the Queensland legislation did not prevent him stating the belief that the Queensland Government acted in good faith and that it would administer its new law in the spirit of secure land tenure. How can the Minister expect honourable senators, who have been subjected to those kinds of performances from Bjelke-Petersen over the last 12 months, to credit him with any good faith in this matter? We do not. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, of course, as the land problem remains unresolved the Commonwealth Games draw closer. In the 18 months Senator Peter Baume has had available to him he has achieved nothing towards the resolution of the Queensland situation. During that time, as everybody knows, the racial tensions in Queensland have escalated and the State Government, in response to this, has typically introduced draconian security laws for the Commonwealth Games which are, of course, laws which will threaten the civil liberties of all Queenslanders. The Federal Government has acted irresponsibly in not settling the issue before the Games. By not acting, the Federal Government is acquiescing in a situation which may lead to violence. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it quite clear at this stage that the attitude of the members of the Australian Labor Party is that we want the Games to proceed peacefully. We do not want to see violence at the Games over the issue of land rights, but we must accept the legitimacy of the claims by Aboriginal activists that their needs are being totally neglected and ignored, first, by the Bjelke-Petersen Government and, second, by the Fraser Government. The way to resolve this crisis is clear and the Federal Government has to do very little to settle the land question before the Commonwealth Games, thus removing the need for any protests, peaceful or otherwise. All the Fraser Government has to do is allow the passage of my private member's Bill through the House of Representatives and thus indicate to the people of Queensland that it is prepared to take legislative measures to secure land rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland are asking for very little; they are asking for freehold title-secure title-to less than 2 per cent of the State of Queensland. They are asking for title to land on which they have been living for some generations now and which is not being used for any other purpose. The granting of title would not involve any disruption to other land holders or to the State Government. It would not cost, in fact, the State Government one penny to allow those reserves to become Aboriginal land. It is disgraceful that the Bjelke-Petersen Government made the pathetic lease offer. It is even more disgraceful, I believe, that the Fraser Government and its Aboriginal Affairs Minister, Senator Peter Baume, refused to use the powers of the Federal Parliament to secure this transfer of title which every decent and fair-minded person in Australia believes ought to happen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We are discussing a matter of public importance put forward by Senator Ryan which refers to the failure of the Federal Government to secure land rights for Queensland Aboriginals and Islanders. I spoke on this issue in the adjournment debate in the Senate on 21 April, the first opportunity after the Queensland Government enacted its promised legislation. I wish to refer again to some items I raised in that debate. Queensland has an Aboriginal and Islander population of about 60,000 people. The Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement, the DAIA, estimates that half that population lives in the State's urban centres. Indeed, about 15,000 Aboriginals have, with the assistance of DAIA, transferred to urban areas within the last 14 or 15 years. Other Aboriginals and Islanders live on reserve land throughout Queensland. Reserve land is of two kinds: The community reserves and the so-called country reserves. I wish to refer to that again in a moment because it is extremely important in terms of the legislation that the Queensland Government brought forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Queensland Aboriginals, as has been the case with their brethren in all other States, have been waiting, not for a couple of years, not for three or four years, but for hundreds of years, for justice in regard to this matter. Let us look at what has happened in Queensland within the last 25 years to see whether Queensland Aboriginals ought to feel secure in what is going on. For example, within the last 25 years the Weipa reserve has been reduced from 350, 000 hectares to 125,000 hectares to accommodate the Comalco Ltd mining interests ; the Mapoon mission has been closed and its residents moved to Bamaga-of course , some were moved south to Weipa; and attempts have been made to move the people of the Lockhart River area to Bamaga. These are only a few of the major intrusions the Aboriginal people have suffered on the security of their homelands. In the past the Aboriginal people in Queensland suffered probably the most organised attempt anywhere in the civilised world to divest people of their homelands by moving them forcibly from where they had their roots to places hundreds of miles away. That type of activity has not ceased within the last few years. To seek for legal security is vitally important-not words but legal security; not promises but legal security. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the issue I raised a moment ago. On 31 March 1980-these are the latest figures I could obtain-DAIA estimated that 9,616 Aboriginal reserve residents were accommodated on 12 reserve sites set up under the Aborigines Act 1971-1979. About 7,000 Torres Strait Islanders lived on their islands and that arrangement was established under the Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971-1979. Reserve communities have their own councils and have been provided with managers , courts and police. The legislation that the Queensland Government brought in relates to those reserves. All other Aboriginal residents live on what are called in Queensland 'country reserves'. These reserves are not subject to the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Acts. They are mostly located on the outskirts of Queensland country towns. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1981 the Queensland Government Printing Office produced a map for the DAIA marking 29 such country reserves. The DAIA annual report of 1980, which is the last report to give population figures, stated that the community population in department and church communities in the Torres Strait area and on country reserves was of the order of 30,000 individuals. As it is generally agreed that the Torres Strait Islander population is no more than about 7,000, this figure suggests that there is probably a country reserve population of approximately 23 ,000 Aboriginals. The National Aboriginal Conference has calculated that some 9, 000 people are associated with these reserves; DAIA has estimated it to be about 8,000 and a Queensland Government Minister recently estimated it to be about 200 -presumably he never leaves Brisbane. The point I am raising-it is an extremely important one-is that those people have not been affected by the Queensland legislation and we must pay attention to their needs. I believe it is essential that the Commonwealth Government enact legislation to take account of those 30, 000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders on country reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us return now to the legislation that was brought in by the Queensland Government. In a Press release of 1 April 1982 the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) indicated that he had some reservations in relation to the procedures outlined in the legislation and questioned the type of protection actually offered the people in Queensland. The Queensland Premier has made a number of promises about that piece of legislation. For example, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Before any draft legislation goes before Parliament it will go before the Advisory Councils for discussion . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The advisory councils were set up by the Queensland Government under section 33 of the Aborigines Act 1971-1979. They were in agreement on the issue. I will read from two of the resolutions they passed. One states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Island Advisory Council constituted under s. 49, Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971-1979 conducted an exhaustive survey of Torres Strait Islanders and recommended to the Premier: 'That Torres Strait Islanders be given inalienable freehold title to all land presently designated Reserve Land under the Queensland Land Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to be a fairly unequivocal proposition from the Torres Strait Islanders themselves. It was recommended that they be given 'inalienable freehold title'. Again, the Aboriginal Advisory Council working party recommended, and the Council in substance adopted, the following proposal:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Current Reserve Lands should become perpetual leaseholds under the act of Parliament with an Aboriginal and Islander Commissioner to hold the leases in trust for the communities. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation which was enacted-on 21 April I detailed the appalling problems involved with that legislation-was brought in by the Premier. Senator Baume and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) described the Premier's announcement as ' a good package' because it gave 'ongoing title'. As I outlined on 21 April, the major problem is concerned with the section about for how long and by what methods titles may be taken back by the Queensland Government. The deeds of grant in trust are governed by Part XI of the Land Act 1962-1981 and are created by that section. I refer to existing Aboriginal and Islander reserves. These reserves may be revoked by the Governor-in-Council for any reason thought desirable. I raised a contentious matter on 21 April. I refer to the Hansard of that date, which records my quoting the Minister as having said:</PARA>
<PARA> That may be normal in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister interjected:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the Acts, Senator. </PARA>
<PARA>I replied, referring to the Acts being amended:</PARA>
<PARA> There are two Acts, the Land Act and the Forestry Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister then said:</PARA>
<PARA> I said it was normal for the Land Act. </PARA>
<PARA>My response was:</PARA>
<PARA> You did not say the Land Act, Senator. </PARA>
<PARA>I will quote from the Minister's Press release in which he referred to the Commonwealth Government having reservations about the Queensland legislation. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This may be the normal procedure in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason I raise that is that the Act which was used to bring in the legislation was the Forestry Act. It may be of interest to this Senate and to the rest of Australia that Queensland flora and fauna now have in place far better security arrangements than has the Aboriginal people's land under those Acts. Under those Acts, State forests and national parks cannot be revoked until Parliament is given the opportunity to scrutinise the proposal. What do we propose to do with Aboriginal lands? They will be removed and when Parliament gets around to it-the Queensland Parliament will not be meeting for another four months-it can do whatever it likes. If one scrutinises the legislation in Queensland one will notice that the Parliament does not even have to refer to the proposal. I am sure that Senator Jones, who was a member of the State House, will be able to point to a number of instances in Queensland legislation in which the Queensland Parliament has totally ignored ever looking at any action which has been taken by the Governor-in-Council although it is specified in legislation that it should do so. It is an extraordinary situation that the legal security of the lands for Aboriginal people should be treated less highly than the flora and fauna of that State. That is the situation we have reached and the situation that Senator Peter Baume believes is a reasonable package. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Press release of 1 April, to which I have referred, Senator Peter Baume admitted that the Commonwealth Government had reservations about the Queensland legislation and he said that he had some particular concerns. One concern related to the section to which I have just referred-the fact that land could be resumed before Parliament had a chance to exercise its judgment, which is as far as we are able to go in giving security of land in Queensland. At least the entire Parliament, not the Governor-in-Council, not the Premier and not the Cabinet, ought to have the final say. Let only parties such as the Minister's party-the Liberal Party-which has a policy in Queensland governing this matter, face up to the issue in Parliament rather than saying that they were steamrolled in the Cabinet by weight of numbers. Let us not let the Liberal Party in Queensland off the hook so easily, if that is what the Minister is attempting to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his Press release, gave an unequivocal guarantee that the Commonwealth would act to remedy any transgressions of principles of security of tenure. I believe that we have to welcome that unequivocal guarantee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the transgressions? The Minister has asked the reserve residents in Queensland to rely, first, on the State Government's good will and, secondly, on the Commonwealth Government's determination to see that principle is maintained. Neither of those parliaments has backed up those assertions by force of law. Why? How can Aboriginal people feel secure if neither Parliament will enact legislation to fulfil those types of promises and assurances? Why unequivocal guarantees and not unequivocal legislation? Surely it is testing the patience of the Aboriginal people in Queensland to breaking point to say to them yet again: 'Rely upon us. If it comes to the crunch we will do something'. Surely such reliance is not easy for them to accept at a time when the good will and determination of neither government has resulted in legislation guaranteeing the security which both governments have promised but which again has not been forthcoming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that the House of Representatives now has a moral obligation to enact the legislation which was introduced into this chamber by Senator Ryan and passed by the Senate. That legislation will at least go part way towards giving the Aboriginal people in Queensland some force in law so that they do not have to rely upon the word of a white man. Whey should an Aboriginal rely upon the word of a white man if white man will not put it in writing? White man has given his words for a long time in this country and all we have got again are more words. The Aboriginal people want legislation; they want their land. The very least that this chamber can do is support the matter of public importance brought forward by Senator Ryan and support my notice of motion that this chamber again request the House of Representatives to deal urgently with a Bill which was sent from this place some weeks ago. Unless it does that I believe the types of propositions that Senator Ryan canvassed in her speech will come about. It will be a tragedy, people will be forced on to the streets to demonstrate for something that they feel so dearly about. The people again will be forced to take that type of action. If they do the people who will stand condemned will be members of this Parliament who have failed to grapple with the Parliament's constitutional rights, its constitutional powers, and pass legislation which will put on the legislative books of this country firm and unequivocal guarantees for the future of those lands, that small percentage of the Queensland land mass, which the Aboriginal people have been calling their home for some 100 years. They are not their total homelands, only that little bit left. That is all they are asking for. They have said time and time again: ' Are we asking for too much just to ask for this little bit which we have left?' Surely they are not and surely at last someone can respond to those types of cries that are being made so often in this country to give Aboriginal people that-and in firm, secure and legislative form. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a matter of public importance which has been submitted to the Senate by Senator Ryan in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Federal Government to secure land rights for Queensland Aboriginals and Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA>I must start by contrasting the measured and thoughtful contribution made by Senator Macklin, in which I thought he addressed some of the issues, with what I thought was a quite hysterical and ideological presentation by the proposer of the matter of public importance. I hope that those who have listened to the debate will have noted the difference in approach and the way in which the matters have been dealt with. It is not even clear what Senator Ryan means by the failure of the Federal Government to provide land rights. Does she mean the granting of title to reserves? Does she mean the machinery for transferring title to other lands?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator, having had her say, now comes out with this hysterical noise. Does she mean compensation for past dispersal? Does she mean the provision of an economic base from which Aboriginal self-management may be pursued? What are land rights anyhow? I have studiously avoided using such terms because they do not really help us. The term 'land tenure' is more helpful especially in talking about the Queensland situation. I can converse with Senator Macklin because he is talking about land tenure. The term 'land rights' has been used to describe a multitude of land holding arrangements in different States. Senator Ryan could have been talking about the Pitjantjatjara model in South Australia, which is one model. She could have been talking about the Northern Territory model, which is the one that she is touting around. She could have been talking about the transfer of land to the Aboriginal community at Cape Barren Island in Tasmania. She could have been talking about the Western Australian model, which has provisions similar to the one for flora and fauna in Queensland under which land reserved for Aboriginals, though it remains Crown land, cannot be touched without prior approval of that State Cabinet. She could be talking about the situation proposed for New South Wales whereby the whole 109 square kilometres held on behalf of Aborigines in New South Wales will eventually be transferred from one Aboriginal land holding body to a series of others. That has actually been called land rights in the State which I represent and which you represent, Mr Deputy President. Each of those models is different from the others. It does not help the debate or communication when an honourable senator talks in those terms. Does she mean a grant of deed in trust, as in Queensland? The term 'land rights' could be used for any of these phrases. Why does she stick to the rigid concept of land rights as per the Northern Territory model, which is the one she uses?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Surely I just have to ask: What are the goals we are trying to satisfy? What are the goals that I have been trying to satisfy? What are the several ways in which we might move to achieve those golas? First, may I suggest that it is inappropriate to try to look to an imposed solution from a central government and hope that that will resolve the problem which faces Aborigines in Queensland . The Government has always said that there is an initial issue to be resolved- whether Commonwealth power should be used as a first step to achieve a Commonwealth solution which is imposed upon the States or whether the State should try to act and the Commonwealth should use its powers only if necessary. It is our belief that imposed solutions have less chance of being successful. An imposed solution would carry with it the risk of losing State services. It would carry with it the chance that the State would withdraw from the services of roads, water supply, power supply, schools, police and hospitals-all matters which are under State control, all matters which a State can deliver or withhold . One would run at least the risk-and I put it to Senator Macklin just as a matter to be looked at-of creating Aboriginal enclaves from which State services had been withdrawn and into which we would then have to move and administer. That does not mean that one would not do that but one would have to take into account the loss side of any action one tried to initiate. Of course, incidentally this would promote a whole series of legal challenges which, although they may have to come, would leave the waters muddied for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin said something else to which I want to refer. All governments since 1967-Labor and Liberal governments-have chosen not to impose land rights for Aboriginals on State governments. The Labor Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in 1973, the Honourable Gordon Bryant, actually spoke on this matter. He said in 1973 that he was an advocate of persuasion first and that only if persuasion failed should counter-attacking legislation, overriding legislation, be introduced. Despite talk of possible Commonwealth intervention, despite talk by the Labor Government of that day that it would do something-talk that went on for two and a half years-the Labor Government shelved any ideas of imposing land rights in Queensland in 1975. Yet this is precisely the course that Senator Ryan wants us to now take. I just do not think she understands that it would not benefit Aboriginal people. That is my concern. I come back to Senator Macklin. By contrast, he has urged all the time that we need to seek the benefit of the communities. That is the only goal we are seeking. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, land rights, land tenure and land solutions are only part of the problem. Whatever form it takes, the obtaining of land rights-however one uses the term-is not an end in itself. Its value lies in the fact that it may be an important step-one which the Government wishes to see achieved in Australia in ways which are appropriate to local situations-towards Aboriginal advancement on a whole lot of fronts. The questions we must ask are about the social and economic conditions of Aboriginal people, about the place they have in Australian society and about the opportunities they should have. The granting of land tenure alone will not solve the problems they face. As I have said, an imposed solution such as is being promoted at this stage may in fact make them worse, at least in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of public importance refers to a failure by the Federal Government to secure land rights. What failure? What failure has there really been? I remind honourable senators that in January 1981 we faced a situation where the Queensland Government was proposing to repeal the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Act and put nothing in its place. It proposed to take away the administrative structure and it was said at the time by politicians in Queensland that the reserves would be abolished and that Queensland Aboriginals should be like other Queenslanders. Six months later we had a suggestion that leases would be given for a period of 50 years and maybe renewable. We have reached the situation now where we are way down the track, where Queensland, in terms of its attitude and its willingness, has come light years from the position it set out in January 1981 and in June of that year. Those are facts. Whatever Senator Ryan thinks failure means, she should know by now that the Queensland decision, when announced early in March, represented the most significant progress we have seen from that State in our lifetime. It represents significant progress in security of land tenure for Aboriginal and Islander people. It was more than many people expected, given the number of announcements by the Premier. Let me say again that the Commonwealth was seeking, and saw as being most productive a Queensland solution in the first place to what is a problem of interest to all Queensland citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are points of legal difficulty involved and I am aware of the work of Mr Frank Brennan. I am aware of the statements of Professor Garth Nettheim. I am aware of the opinion of Mr Pincus. I thank honourable senators for bringing these out during the debate. They are not the first to have noticed them, but those reservations do not mean that the program has been a failure. It is very interesting to note that, while Senator Macklin was willing to concede the fact of the Commonwealth guarantee, Senator Ryan chose almost to ignore it and to put it aside. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to discuss a little the question of the grants of deed in trust. If we look at the Queensland Land Act we find that these deeds of grant are not unusual. They exist in Queensland in a variety of situations. If we look at section 5 of the Act we will see that it shows that the grants of deed in trust can be made, are made and have been made for a wide range of public purposes. It might help honourable senators if I table a list which shows some of the many purposes-maybe 50 purposes-for which these deeds of grant are made. I table the document. This is an established form of land tenure in Queensland. It is not new. It provides, for example, for the holding of land by many charitable and public organisations. Many of them hold property under deeds of grant in trust in Queensland. Of course, for them also there is the threat of losing their land if the strict letter of the law is applied. They include the home for the aged and infirm in Coolangatta, the trustees of the Queensland Police Citizens Youth Welfare Association, the Saint Mary's Home and Female Refuge in Brisbane, the reserve for the racecourse and the showground in Gympie, the Morningside Recreation and School of Arts in Brisbane. I can go on and on. All of these organisations hold the land which they use and which their communities value under identical kinds of deeds of grant. Is anyone saying that they feel insecure? They do not feel insecure. Whatever they have, they do not have the guarantee which the Commonwealth has given and which the Commonwealth has made available precisely to overcome the insecurity which some people feel and to overcome the strict points of law which have been raised by some commentators. That the Commonwealth has given that guarantee puts the lie completely to any assertion that there has been a failure on the part of the Commonwealth to apply itself to or to resolve this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Aboriginal land, the Commonwealth has given an unequivocal guarantee to stand behind the stated intention of the Queensland Government. The Queensland Government stated that intention in its Press release of 1 March. It put out its Press release saying what it intended should be the consequences of its action. Our guarantee is to ensure that that intention to provide security of tenure and integrity of the reserve land-those are the words used by the Queensland Government-is preserved. That is our unequivocal guarantee. The Government has said that, if there were actions which transgressed that guarantee or which indicated an unreasonable use of the discretion in the legislation, the Commonwealth would act accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Where were the Queensland Aboriginal communities 18 months ago? Where are they now? An honourable senator might say that, in an ideal world, he would like the situation to be otherwise. But I put it to him, as I put it to all honourable senators and to all Australians, that the Commonwealth has given a serious undertaking, that there has been enormous progress and that the reserve residents of Queensland can now look forward to things which they could not have envisaged 18 months ago. We are bound by that guarantee. We shall act upon it if the need arises. But we will work now, as we are working and have worked, to promote circumstances in which the guarantee will not be used. We will be working to see that the new Act is applied generously; to see that it is applied constructively, to see that it is applied in line with the principles laid down by the Queensland Government; and to see that it is applied to the benefit of the Aboriginal communities and the Aboriginal people. The grant of deeds in trust will give a sound base to the communities on which they can build their futures. They can pursue their ideas for self-management-I might say that the self-management part of the package is yet to emerge-and they can enjoy a large measure of local discretion; all of the things promised by the Queensland Government in its public statements. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to draw a picture of progress month by month. We have moved from one situation which looked negative and desperate to a situation today where we see some real achievement. I do not believe that the situation ends there. The whole history of Aboriginal land tenure in this country has been one of movement . Aboriginal people held about one per cent of the land area of Australia 10 years ago and they now hold 9.6 per cent. This change has occurred in 10 years and will continue to occur. The situation today is not the situation we might have in two years or three years. We will be watching, trying to see what emerges in the light of experience. But we have a developing situation. I ask the Senate to acknowledge that it is a dynamic situation and not static. </PARA>
<PARA> Other companion Queensland legislation is still to be prepared. We are involved in negotiations on this. We shall watch this further legislation very closely. We shall watch the fine print of the grant of deeds in trust. We will ensure that for the reserve communities the fine print is in accord with what we have promised. The guarantee which I have mentioned applies just as much to the fine print of these grants as it does to the emergence of new legislation and legislation already passed. We would welcome honourable senators opposite- Senator Ryan in particular-joining with us in constructive efforts to advance the interests of Aboriginal and Islander people in Queensland, especially those living on reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us come back to Senator Ryan's Aboriginal Land Rights Legislation Amendment Bill. It seems that all Senator Ryan can talk about is her Bill-her one constructive effort over the last 18 months. It is still an ineffective Bill. It still represents an imposed arrangement. It still has internal inconsistencies because of its drafting. It still remains premature. I come back to the point that I do not believe that it will advantage the Aboriginal communities because of its consequences in terms of matters which Queensland has to administer. We have made an unequivocal guarantee. We stand ready to act upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Ryan had a few words to say about the Commonwealth Games during her speech. I remind her that she is not helping the public debate in this country by issuing a Press release saying to Aboriginal people that they have two courses of action open to them: The first course is to try to persuade the Government to pass her Bill and the second course-I quote from her Press release -is that they can 'put all their energies into organising protests at the Commonwealth Games'. I think Australia deserves better than to have a spokesperson for the Australian Labor Party advising Aboriginals to put all their efforts into organising protests at the Commonwealth Games. These Games are for all Australians. It is not suitable for the Australian Labor Party or its representative in this place to be urging Aboriginals to mount protests with all their effort. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder how many more times I will need to explain to honourable senators that there has been no failure on the part of the Commonwealth to secure appropriate rights for Aboriginal people in Queensland. How many more times will we have to remind honourable senators of what we have done? I remind honourable senators that the Queensland Government has acknowledged that it will issue titles to Aboriginal communities where no titles existed; that these titles will be forever, they will be titles without end; that they cannot be revoked without the Parliament reviewing that revocation; that they will be controlled by community councils; and that the Commonwealth has guaranteed that the Queensland Government's intention to deal honourably with its communities will be met and will not fail. I believe that the matter of public importance before us has no merit. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The one hundred and ninety-eighth report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts is the result of the Committee's investigation into the administration and management of the Government Aircraft Factories at Fishermens Bend and Avalon. I must stress that while the Committee' s investigations relate largely to those Government Aircraft Factories a great deal of the report has relevance to all government factories. Many of the problems we identified, in particular the problems for a commercially oriented organisation operating within a government framework, may be applicable to other areas of government commercial activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the early 1970s the GAF received repeated criticism from the Auditor- General with regard to its accounting, financial control and management procedures. The Auditor-General's unfavourable comments in his reports for 1979- 80 and previous years led the Committee to the conclusion that the problems being experienced at the GAF, whilst serious breaches of Commonwealth accounting practice and procedure, were a symptom of more complex issues, including the management of the factories and their relationships with the mainstream departmental administration in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's investigation of the GAF concentrated on these three main areas : Firstly, issues raised by the Auditor-General; secondly, efficiency of the factories' management, including level of support received from the Department of Industry and Commerce in Canberra; and thirdly, the future of the maintenance of production capability appropriation and the current and future viability of the aircraft industry which was referred to in great detail in the 1976 report of the Industries Assistance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In our examination of the comments of the Auditor-General in relation to specific matters of accounting procedure and practice we found a low standard of government accounting resulting from years of neglect. Consequently, we endorse the comments of the Auditor-General when he says that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . collectively the unsatisfactory accounting disclosed by audit represented a critical state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee cannot excuse the GAF's neglect of many basic accounting procedures and practices. Nor can it excuse the lack of action by management at the GAF to rectify these irregularities, particularly since many have been the subject of repeated comments by the Auditor-General over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is in no doubt that there has been a lack of commitment by senior management at the GAF and the Department of Industry and Commerce to the observations of the Auditor-General and a regrettable tardiness in the control of existing systems and implementation of new systems to take account of the changing requirements of modern business practice. Management at the Government Aircraft Factories has consistently proven over the last decade its inability to react to constructive criticism directed at encouraging remedial action or even to rectify problems of this nature that it has identified. An example of this was 'project phoenix', a management review which cost the taxpayers $1m between 1973 and 1976 in consultants and equipment costs. It appears to have had little effect on managerial efficiencies. The Committee found that management of the Government Aircraft Factories had only a rudimentary knowledge of this review. As 'project phoenix' was originally designed to produce a continuous system of managerial review designed to produce savings of around $1m per annum, the Committee regards the handling of this project as quite unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> We examined in some detail management deficiencies at the factories and found that in the areas of staffing, working conditions, remuneration, industrial relations and the adoption of modern business practices, the Government Aircraft Factories lagged far behind their competitors in private industry. The Committee feels that the multitude of problems facing the Government Aircraft Factories is due to the lack of a co-ordinated and integrated approach to its responsibilities by factory management over the last decade and a lack of prompt action on factory issues by the Department here in Canberra. The Public Accounts Committee believes that the major reason why the Government Aircraft Factories have been unable to develop adequate management and financial control systems is the extraordinarily long decision making process involving the General Manager of the GAF, the Department of Industry and Commerce in Canberra and the various other departments such as Defence, Finance, Administrative Services, the Public Service Board and so on, all of which have an input into many areas of the factory management. This process severely limits the General Manager's ability to respond in a timely and effective fashion to day to day management problems and to develop modern management practices. The Committee strongly endorses the general proposition of 'letting the managers manage'. The inflexibility and inefficiency caused by the present management approach should be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA> A further area of concern to the Committee is the fluctuating work load in the aircraft industry as a result of the time-lag between major defence re-equipment programs. Because of this the industry suffers in morale and retention of technological research and manufacturing capability. The Committee is of the view that if the GAF is to function efficiently in a quasi-competitive environment then many of the problems caused by its formal attachment to the mainstream of government departmental administration must be removed. Possible options canvassed by the Committee included: GAF and other government factories being formed into separate, independent statutory corporations with policy advice and co-ordination being provided through a new department of defence production; a tripartite aerospace corporation including the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Ltd, Hawker De Havilland Australia Pty Ltd and the Government Aircraft Factories with the Commonwealth retaining a proportionate share of the equity; and a separate company to include GAF with a majority shareholding vested in the Commonwealth. The Committee concluded that the most acceptable solution would be the first: Re-form the Government Aircraft Factories into a statutory corporation. This solution could also be applied to all other government defence factories. </PARA>
<PARA> Our conclusions and recommendations are directed towards placing the Government Aircraft Factories on a more efficient commercial footing. However, irrespective of GAF's future, the Committee recommends that financial reporting arrangements for the GAF be rationalised taking account of the many new developments in government accounting practice currently under consideration by the Government and this Committee. In this regard, the Committee will shortly table a report on the form and standard of financial statements of Commonwealth undertakings. This must include one set of accounts prepared and submitted to the production board as statements examined by the Auditor-General which are then presented to the Parliament as a record of the financial achievements of GAF. The major point, however, to emerge from the inquiry was the inappropriate nature of a government departmental framework for the efficient operation of commercial undertakings. It is essential to remove the Government Aircraft Factories from this framework and place such undertakings on a similar footing to private industry, particularly regarding decision making processes. It is also considered important to centralise the policy and co-ordination function for the operation of government factories into one separate department reporting directly to an appropriate Minister. I commend the report to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I am sorry that a member of the Australian Labor Party has not moved that the Senate take note of the paper to give an opportunity for the Senate to debate the report of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts. I was enormously impressed by the report as presented by Senator Watson. I think it is a great shame that so few senators were present to hear and understand his speech. What Senator Watson said was a condemnation of the way in which the Government Aircraft Factories are being run. I think the report says a lot more than that. More disturbing is that there has been a series of reports of the Auditor-General over a period of years which has pointed this up. No doubt this is one of the factors that led the Chairman and members of the Public Accounts Committee to home in on this exercise. They have more than confirmed the worst fears of the Auditor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It passes my comprehension how that sort of criticism expressed over the years can be treated with utter and total contempt by permanent heads and, indeed, by Ministers involved in this matter. The nightmarish situation described by Senator Watson is that five departments-I lost count after five-have an input into factory management before really hard decisions can be made. Although Senator Watson had some harsh things to say about the management of the Government Aircraft Factories I believe that underlying those criticisms there was a note of sympathy in his and the Committee's consideration and a feeling that they were trying to fight a losing battle with one or both hands tied behind their backs by utterly confounded, confused bureaucracy. One wonders where these things finish. I know that members of committees, like those on which Senator Watson so ably serves, sometimes wonder whether-Senator Rae would be another person who has contributed magnificently to the committee system of this Parliament-the Government takes enough note of the hours of valuable work put in by these committees when they come down with decisions, conclusions and recommendations in the way Senator Watson presented them today. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Social Services Act with respect to the payment of family allowance to certain temporary residents of Australia, the waiting periods of unemployment and sickness benefit and the recovery of sickness benefit from compensation payments. It also contains a number of minor technical and machinery amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators are aware, family allowance is payable to parents residing in Australia who have the custody, care and control of children under the age of 16 or who have dependent full-time student children aged between 16 and 25. In the case of parents not born in Australia, and where there is no clear intention to reside here permanently, family allowance is payable after residence in Australia for 12 months. Under these provisions, family allowance is payable to diplomats and consuls and their non-locally-engaged staff, and to overseas armed forces personnel who are not attached to the Australian forces, and to the close families of these persons. Such persons have no real claim on the Australian community for the support of their children. Rather, they are the responsibility of their own governments. It was never envisaged that the family allowance scheme should encompass the support of people in these circumstances and it is considered appropriate that the eligibility which these people have at present should be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, as the law stands at present, family allowance is payable with respect to the children of a person who is a prohibited immigrant and has entered or remained in Australia without approval. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill renders such persons ineligible to receive family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> If, of course, the position of a prohibited immigrant is regularised under the provisions of the Migration Act, thus rendering him eligible to remain in Australia, his exclusion from family allowance would cease. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards diplomatic personnel, I mention that there are situations in which certain countries are represented by honourary consuls who are Australian citizens or permanent residents. The amendment in the Bill will not apply to such persons as the exclusion is expressly limited to persons in the relevant categories who are not Australian citizens or permanent residents. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the provisions in the Bill which will modify the operation of the rules which specify the day from which unemployment and sickness benefit is payable. </PARA>
<PARA> New administrative arrangements were made last year under which claims for unemployment benefit are lodged with the Department of Social Security rather than the Commonwealth Employment Service as was previously the case. Unemployment benefit is payable from 7 days after the date the person became unemployed, or 7 days after the date he makes a claim, whichever is the later. It has become apparent that in some circumstances, an unavoidable delay occurs between the time an unemployed person registers as unemployed with the Commonwealth Employment Service and obtains a claim form for unemployment benefit, and the time that the claim is lodged with the Department of Social Security. Where for instance, people in rural areas receive and submit claims by post, the lodging of this form with the Department of Social Security may be delayed. As a result, entitlement to unemployment benefit is delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that, where a person registers as unemployed with the Commonwealth Employment Service, and his claim for unemployment benefit is made within 14 days of the date of that registration, he will be regarded as having made a claim on the day on which he registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. In special cases, such as where mails or travel are disrupted by floods , bush fires, industrial disputes etc, the Director-General will be able to extend the period of 14 days, thus further minimising any adverse effect of the claim being delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the provisions of the Social Services Act relating to the waiting period for sickness benefit. Generally, under the exisiting provisions a claimant for sickness benefit is required to serve a 7-day waiting period before entitlement to benefit commences provided he has not already served such a waiting period in the previous 13 weeks. There are people who suffer chronic illnesses who require treatment or who otherwise become incapacitated for work in respect of the same sickness at periods longer than 13 weeks. In these cases a claimant is required to serve a second waiting period on recurrence of the incapacity. This can cause hardship where such people have exhausted their sick leave entitlements and have no other means of support during the waiting period. The Bill rectifies this situation by providing that the waiting period may be waived in respect of a recurring incapacity which is connected with the cause of a previous incapacity in respect of which sickness benefit was paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the provisions of Division 3A of Part VII of the Act. These provisions were enacted in 1979 but have not been proclaimed because of a number of administrative and machinery deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The principles embodied in Division 3A extend the principles already contained in section 115 of the Social Services Act and are not new. Section 115 provides that, if compensation is received for the same incapacity as that which qualifies a person for sickness benefit, and it is paid for the same period in respect of which he is qualified to receive sickness benefit, then the rate of the benefit normally payable for that period is reduced by the amount of the relevant part of the compensation. Similarly, sickness benefit may be recovered where the compensation is subsequently paid for the same period for which sickness benefit has been paid. Typically, this occurs where a person receives sickness benefit whilst awaiting settlement of a compensation claim, and some or all of the sickness benefit paid, is recovered on settlement. These provisions ensure that a person does not receive a 'double payment' in respect of an incapacity for work and that responsibility for maintaining the incapacitated worker is properly borne by the third party liable to pay compensation, rather than the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 115 does have a number of shortcomings and these shortcomings have been exploited to circumvent the recovery provisions to which I have made reference. It was in order to address these problems that Division 3A was enacted in 1979 to strengthen and clarify that provision where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Division 3A has itself been found to have a number of deficiencies. It was because of a concern that the Division would not be as effective as intended that there has been delay in bringing its provisions into operation. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, Division 3A as drafted would not encompass compensation payable under no-fault motor accident schemes because its terms are restricted to cases where compensation arises by reason of a judgment of a court or an agreement in settlement of a claim. The amendments will remove this restriction. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing Division 3A also makes for cumbersome administration in some respects. The provisions under which notices relating to recovery of sickness benefit are given to the parties involved require the same notices to be given to both an insurer and a third party. Experience has shown that third parties who are insured do not wish to become involved in these matters, and the amendments provide that it is necessary to give notices only to the insurer. This will reflect the position at present under section 115, and avoid both costs to third parties and in administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments also enable notices to be given more efficiently, so that a more effective service is provided to insurers subject to the legislation. At present , notices under Division 3A would have to be given only by post. The amendments will enable the Director-General to give a notice to an insurer over the counter , in appropriate circumstances. This will also reflect the current position under section 115. </PARA>
<PARA> A further amendment changes the way in which the Director-General directs that compensation is to be taken into account in these situations. The existing Division 3A requires the Director-General to give a direction as to the rate of sickness benefit to be paid. This is cumbersome, because the rate of sickness benefit may alter for other reasons, such as a receipt of income, and a new direction would be necessary. The amendments require the Director-General to give a direction as to the amount by which sickness benefit is to be reduced in taking account of compensation. If the rate of sickness benefit alters for other reasons, it will not be necessary to make a new direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments remove a number of other deficiencies in Division 3A of a machinery nature. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Bill also contains machinery or administrative changes to other parts of the Act, as well as a substantial number of minor or formal amendments of a drafting nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to 1972, the Department of Social Security was known as the Department of Social Services. The Social Services Act has not been amended to reflect this change of name. The Bill therefore proposes to change the title of the Act to the Social Security Act and the title of the Director-General of Social Services to the Director-General of Social Security. References to other specific offices within the Department will also be similarly amended. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's initiative in 1976 in introducing a new system of family allowances is not fully reflected in the terminology of the Act. The Bill replaces a number of out-dated references to 'child endowment' with references to 'family allowance'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also incorporates an amendment to clarify the entitlement of institutions to family allowance in respect of dependent full-time students between the ages of 16 and 25. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment will extend the notification provisions of the Act with respect to handicapped child's allowance, where the child has left the home in which he or she was receiving constant care and attention. This will ensure that the person with continuing entitlement to allowance is identified at an early stage. </PARA>
<PARA> A schedule to the Bill proposes amendments which will remove some technical inconsistencies in the legislation and bring the legislative drafting style into line with current practice. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982 is an omnibus Bill containing some 10 significant amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act. The amendments include alterations to zone allowances and to depreciation rates for machinery used in steel production. The Bill contains provisions which attempt to thwart the bizarre decisions handed down by the High Court of Australia which have emasculated vital provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, in particular the existing section 136. The replacement of section 136, together with major amendments to section 26AAA are- I think the Treasurer (Mr Howard) explicitly agreed with this- the major amendments contained in this Bill. Section 136 is concerned with international tax avoidance through transfer pricing arrangements. Section 26AAA is concerned with domestic tax avoidance through the conversion of what ought to be regarded as income into capital gain and to do so in a way which is tax free.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition will be moving both an amendment to the motion for the second reading and a number of amendments in the Committee stage of this Bill. I have just been informed that copies of those amendments are currently being prepared and will be circulated. The amendments to section 26AAA-that section of the Act which is designed, to limited extent, to prevent the conversion of income tax free capital gain-have been prompted by three spectacular recent cases of tax avoidance through the use or misuse of that section. Two of these cases involved Mr Holmes a Court and the other involved the Bond Corporation. A total revenue loss of in the vicinity of $27m resulted from those three examples alone. Not surprisingly, several of the amendments which will be moved in the Committe stage are directed at recovering for the public revenue the tax so far evaded. The Government has for many years been involved in a circular exercise with respect to taxation. It has attempted to close loopholes in the Act, many of which were inserted by its own silly pork barrelling amendments of the recent past. It has also attempted to deal with the assortment of bizarre interpretations of the Income Tax Assessment Act handed down by the High Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has two types of problems in the area of taxation. The first is its cynical misuse of the Income Tax Assessment Act for pork barrelling purposes . Recent examples, one of which this Bill sets out to correct, concerned the provisions relating to tax deductions for works of art donated to public institutions. A couple of years ago other amendments were required to clean up the pork barrelling rort which the Government had deliberately written into the Act concerning film production. Since cleaning up the last but one film production rort, cynically and deliberately written into the Act, the Government has inserted another film production rort which, in its time, I forecast will also be the subject of legislation before the Senate, aimed at cleaning it up. </PARA>
<PARA> Other examples of rorts deliberately inserted by this Government include the income equalisation deposit provisions under which it is possible for any person with a high off-farm income and substantial farming interests to lend $10,000 for one year, borrow $15,000 for each of two years-that is, borrow three times as much as he lends-and pick up a cash bonus of $4,609, half of which is free from tax. Over generous tax averaging provisions, according to a question asked originally by my colleague, Ralph Willis, and answered in February, cost the revenue $215m in the last taxation year. The Government has consistently inserted rorts of that type into the Act and has then been faced with the problem of attempting to clean them up. This legislation falls partially into that category. To the extent that the Government's problems in that area are of its own making, an appropriate response is 'Serve it right'. </PARA>
<PARA> The second problem which the Government has is caused by the parasitic tax dodging industry which has been aided and abetted by the High Court, particularly during the period when it was under the tutelage of Sir Garfield Barwick. Barwick himself is, of course, a tax evader. He lived in a house owned by Mundroola Pty Ltd, a company of which he was a director, without declaring in his taxation returns any imputed rent as he was obliged to do under the Act. It is not surprising that a Chief Justice who was himself a tax evader should take a sympathetic view of tax evasion by others. When the Mundroola scandal broke early in 1980 there hastily appeared a letter hastily in which the Chief Justice resigned his directorship. It was dated April 1974. The ink was still wet. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very well, Mr Acting Deputy President, I shall comply with your wishes. The Government, as it has shown by the way in which it has opened up loopholes in the Act, has no great moral objection to tax avoidance. At least 40 concessions, including the couple to which I have already referred, have been inserted into the Act during the lifetime of this Government. But it has been compelled to act to some extent regardless of any moral reservations which it may have had, but apparently has not, when the leakage of revenue due to tax avoidance and evasion became so high that it could no longer be ignored. Much of the legislation that we have seen in the last three or four years is aimed at closing the loopholes found in earlier anti-tax avoidance legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In spite of the Government's continuing failure to close off this damaging leakage of public revenue, it refuses to take the one relatively simple action which would solve the problem. It refuses to legislate retrospectively against tax avoidance. Because of its refusal to do so and because of its penchant for deliberately inserting loopholes into the Act at the behest of favoured clients, since 1976 the Income Tax Assessment Act has grown from 700 pages to 976 pages, not including the index or the notes, and as a result of this Bill it will increase by another 39 pages. The very complexity and length of the Act facilitate evasion. It is so cumbersome as to be almost incomprehensible. It will get worse unless the Government grasps the nettle as the Labor Party has for years urged it to do and declares a firm intention to legislate retrospectively against tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> We will give the Government the opportunity to declare an intention to do that when the Committee stage of this Bill is reached. The amendments to clause 4 of the amending Bill, which I notice have just been circulated, will then be moved. That clause amends the existing section 26AAA of the Act. That section was the device used by the Bond Corporation and by Mr Holmes a Court's Bell group to collect some $60m in tax free profit. On behalf of the Opposition I move the amendment to the motion for the second reading which has just been circulated in my name. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that it is deficient in that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) penalties contained in the Bill for participation in transfer pricing type tax avoidance arrangements are insufficient to provide suitable deterrents against tax avoidance and are inconsistent with penalties contained elsewhere in the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) without the accompanying adoption of a code of conduct for transnational corporations, as recommended by the OECD and the United Nations, the effectiveness of Division 13 is likely to be limited by the difficulty confronting the Taxation Commissioner in obtaining adequate information;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Bill fails to take retrospective action against persons flouting the tax system through the blatant avoidance schemes utilising section 26AAA of the Act; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the Bill endorses use by the medical profession of corporate and trust arrangements with significant tax avoidance implications'. </PARA>
<PARA>Although we have given the Government the opportunity to legislate effectively against tax avoidance, we are realists enough to know that the Government will not accept that opportunity. We do, however, hope that the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine show some commitment to smashing tax evasion, a commitment which the Labor Party has firmly had for many years. When these amendments are moved in the Committee stage, the opportunity will be presented to the Democrats and to Senator Harradine to show that they, too, are opposed to tax avoidance and that they will take effective action to stop it. If they decline that opportunity they will join the ranks of those who support tax dodgers. Let us be perfectly clear about this. Failure to vote for the amendments to clause 4 of this Bill will signify support for tax dodgers. Not only will it signify support for tax dodgers; but it will be a practical expression of support for tax dodgers, a licence for them to continue their anti-social activity. Those people have already been responsible, to a substantial degree, for the 80 per cent increase in the level of tax paid by single income families with two children on an income of 85 per cent of average weekly earnings. This is almost the stereotype of the family which this Government purports to be concerned about and which, I expect, Senator Harradine would claim also to be deeply concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an 80 per cent increase in the rate of taxation applying to families in that category since 1975. They are paying the penalty for tax evasion. Unless Senator Harradine and the Democrats have the wit and courage to join with the Labor Party in supporting those amendments, tax dodging will continue and families in that category and in other categories will continue to pay the penalty for it. Those who fail to support these amendments will be endorsing also the 22 per cent aggregate increase on taxation of pay-as-you-earn taxpayers this financial year. That is a 22 per cent increase, according to the Budget Estimates, in taxation paid by wage and salary earners. Again, to a substantial extent, that enormous increase is attributable to the continuing existence of tax evasion and tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax evasion has developed into a cancer. It has contributed to a very serious moral decline in the community. I often wish that those people who are obsessed with prying into bedrooms and other like activities, such as the Reverend Nile, for example, would show a bit more concern about this type of moral decadence which has infected large sections of the community. Indeed, it appears to have infected probably most of the self-employed who have followed the example set by the Government and its favoured clients and have taken all possible steps to evade and avoid the greatest possible amount of taxation to the cost of every other member of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the favoured clients to which I referred is the hierarchy or the elite of the National Farmers Federation. The Federation was reported this morning as urging metal workers not to accept the $14 a week pay increase which they have been granted, effective from, I think, the middle of June. On the grounds of social responsibility, metal workers were urged to forgo that pay increase. This has been urged by the National Farmers Federation, a favoured client of this Government. I find it almost unbelievable and incomprehensible that the National Farmers Federation, which is simultaneously attempting to raid the Treasury to the extent of securing an effective interest rate of 32.5 per cent on deposits in a government trust account, expects to be taken seriously when it urges metal workers on $220 a week to forgo a $14 a week wage rise already granted to them. I might add that the metal workers pay a hell of a lot more tax than they would have paid six years ago for a comparable level of income. Likewise, of course, this Government, which has opened up the loopholes which make that sort of raid on the public purse possible, has no moral authority to deal with the metal workers or with anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> I daresay that we will hear one or both of two lines of defence from the Government members. The first will be that the Government has taken effective action against tax avoidance and tax evasion. Supplementary to that, if precedent is any guide, we will be told that the Labor Party was pretty dreadful because it did not do something about tax avoidance when it was in government. My first response is that even if the Labor Party was guilty as charged, that does not excuse the inertia and the culpable negligence of this Government. I concede that there were areas of tax avoidance that the Labor Government should have acted against and it failed to do so. There were many other areas where it did act against tax avoidance and evasion. Of course, in 1973 or 1975 the problem had not reached the scale that it has reached now. It is impossible to put precise figures on this, but the amount of revenues lost through tax avoidance is probably 10 times as great now as it was when Labor was in government. </PARA>
<PARA> The second defence which may be offered by Government members will probably centre on some spurious argument that all incentive is removed if the taxation system is too efficient. I hope we do not hear that argument, but I fear that we might. In the past we have heard from Senator Bjelke-Petersen, and even from some people who ought to know better, that if the maximum marginal tax rate was not so high there would not be so much tax avoidance and evasion. The maximum marginal tax rate is lower now than it has been at any time since uniform taxation was introduced in 1942. As the maximum marginal rate came down, tax avoidance went up. That is an empirical fact. It does not necessarily prove that one caused the other but it does establish that reducing the maximum marginal rate of tax is not an effective way of stopping tax avoidance. Nor would the very much larger reduction in the marginal rate that would be made possible if all income were uniformly taxed eliminate tax avoidance and evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> People who say that they believe that are asking us to believe that these people who have successfully devised ways of evading their social responsibilities by avoiding taxation will, because the maximum marginal rate has been reduced from 60c to 35c-which is about the magnitude of the change which is feasible-suddenly become socially responsible philanthropists who will no longer indulge in tax evasion and tax avoidance even though they have perfected formulas for doing so. Even before the moral decadence which has been induced by continuing widespread tax evasion set in in this society, I do not believe that there was such a strong sense of moral responsibility that the rich , who have shown such a desire to evade tax, would suddenly have developed a social conscience and a sense of social responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The way to stop tax avoidance is to issue a credible threat of retrospective legislation. The opportunity to make this legislation effectively retrospective will arise in the Committee stage when I will move the first group of Committee amendments which have been circulated in my name. For the record, the second group of amendments seeks to increase the penalties which will be applied for breaches of the proposed new Division 13; that is, the transfer pricing section of the Act. The amendments which I will later move seek to increase the penalties applicable for breaches of that proposed new Division to the level established in section 226 of the Act for similar breaches of other sections of the Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982. I want to speak to that section which is intended to vary the zone allowance system and to increase the zone rebate in some instances. The thrust of the proposals which are to be effective from 1 November 1981 is to increase the zone rebate that is related to dependants and to provide a special basic rebate of $750 in lieu of the ordinary basic zone A and zone B rebates for people residing or spending the required period of time at places in excess of 250 kilometres, by the shortest practical surface route, from the centre of the nearest population centre of 2,500 people or more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The existing eligibility for a zone rebate under which a person must reside or actually be in a zone for more than half the year of income will be liberalised. Firstly, a person who resides or spends time in a zone area for 183 days or more over a period of two consecutive income years but who does not satisfy the existing test in relation to either income year is to receive a rebate in the latter income year. Secondly, a person who resides in a zone area for a continuous period of up to five income years but who does not satisfy the existing test in the first and last of those income years will be entitled to a rebate in the last year provided the period in the first income year combined with that in the last income year exceeds 183 days. The dependant rebate will rise from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the relevant dependant rebate amounts for zone A and from 4 per cent to 20 per cent for zone B. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government for this action so far as it goes. However, I consider the increase to be far too small if it is to fulfil the purpose for which it is intended. Zone tax allowances were introduced in 1945-46 at a rate of $80 for a person in zone A and $40 for a resident in zone B. By 1958 the allowance had increased to $540 in zone A plus one half of the total deductions for dependants . Over the 13 years from 1945 to 1958 when inflation was not a significant factor, mindful of the purpose of the allowance, it was increased to more than 10 times the original allowance. Over the ensuing 22 years from 1958 to 1980 the dollar value of the allowance was not increased for a single person and was increased by only $168 for a married taxpayer with a dependant spouse and two children. In fact due to the allowance being transferred from a deduction to a rebate its value has, for many people materially declined. The increases outlined in this Bill are, by any standards, inadequate and clearly are not made on the basis on which the allowance was first made in 1945. There has been a significant decline in the value of the zone allowance over the past 20 years. It has been calculated that in 1947-48 a medium taxpayer in zone A with a wife and two children obtained a 66 per cent reduction in tax liability through a zonal tax concession scheme. However, by 1977-78 this relative degree of tax reduction had declined to about 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Government's submission to the public inquiry on income tax zone allowances demonstrates, from the Commissioner of Taxation's fifty- eighth report of 1978-79, that the average tax collected from taxpayers residing in zone A and zone B in 1977-78 and having assessable incomes was $2,062 per taxpayer allowing for the zone rebate. Taxpayers outside zone A and zone B paid an average of $1,894 per taxpayer-$167 less. This represents an extra $37,313, 098 in tax paid by taxpayers in zone areas while the value of the rebates in the same year was $28,356,000. The taxpayers in these areas actually contributed an additional $9m in taxation receipts, contrary to what is regarded as the intention of the Government to compensate these persons for the higher costs and disabilities experienced in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate to gauge the measure of assistance provided by the reduction in taxation produced by the zone allowance as a percentage of income or, more realistically, as a percentage of disposable income or income less tax. Considering the period from 1958-59 to 1979-80 for a single person, the percentage of zone allowance to average weekly earnings has fallen from 4.8 per cent to 1.7 per cent in zone A and from 0.9 per cent to 0.3 per cent in zone B. If a family of a taxpayer, a spouse and two children is considered, the percentage of zone allowance to average weekly earnings has fallen from 4.6 per cent to 3.8 per cent in zone A or from 1.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent in zone B over the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> If the average weekly earnings after tax are considered for a family of a taxpayer, a spouse and two children, the reduction has been from 6.3 per cent to 4.7 per cent in zone A and from 1.6 per cent to 0.8 per cent in zone B. It can be seen that in both zone A and zone B over the period from 1958-59 to 1979-80 effectively the zone allowance for the married wage earner with three dependents who was earning the average weekly wage was reduced by between 25 per cent and 50 per cent, and for a single wage earner it was reduced by 50 per cent. Of course to compensate for the high cost of living and other considerations, wage earners in the zone areas have to earn far in excess of the average weekly wage and so the percentage drop to many of these people is much greater than a calculation based on an average wage, and due to the allowance now being a rebate and not a deduction from assessable income, as I mentioned earlier, these people are further penalised. </PARA>
<PARA> It ought to be remembered that not all employers within the zone areas are able to pay high levels of wages required to attract a capable and stable work force. Added to this cost burden, these businessmen are faced with higher costs for freight, communications, maintenance and building costs, air conditioning and stock on hand and, to attract good labour, are often required to provide housing for the employees. Not only is this a responsibility that their metropolitan competitors do not have to carry, but also the cost of housing in isolated parts of Australia, and particularly Western Australia, is very high. Many of the small businesses in the North West of Western Australia are in the service industries which are invariably labour intensive. </PARA>
<PARA> The higher wages required to attract labour to these areas cause a flow-on of high living costs which in themselves drive wages up into a higher tax bracket. Similar difficulties occur in the pastoral industry which competes in the world markets and has absolutely no insulation against these high wage demands. More than any other sector of industry which is located and required to operate in isolated areas, the pastoral industry is most adversely affected by high wage demands and other associated costs, such as freight, communications, spare parts and food costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In its submission to the public inquiry on zone allowances, the Western Australian Government clearly illustrated this point. It noted that in the town of Kununurra over the two-year period 1978-79 and 1979-80 food prices were an average of 36.5 per cent higher than in Perth. While it is accepted that Kununurra may well be an extreme example, it nevertheless remains that country towns in Western Australia fall somewhere in this range. Likewise, considering another necessity-housing-the State Housing Commission of Western Australia estimated that the cost of building a three bedroom house in Port Hedland, suitable for Pilbara conditions, was 78 per cent higher than in Perth. That cost differential does not include an additional $3,000 which the commission also estimated was necessary in order to provide a wide verandah for cooling purposes . Honourable senators will agree, I am sure, that that is a necessity in the northern parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, given the extreme isolation of many parts of Australia, especially in Western Australia, it is not unreasonable for people to need to fly to their capital city at least once a year. For a family of four based at Halls Creek, for example, that could mean expenditure in the range of $2,700. Once again this is not a cost to which those in the less remote, more temperate climates are exposed. Even if these trips are regarded as a luxury by some of my colleagues, I doubt whether anyone can deny that with the requirements of children's education or specialist medical attention some transport costs will necessarily be incurred, while people in the major cities simply never encounter these problems. Even if those in our more remote, northern areas decide to stay at home, there is always the aspect of air conditioning which I am sure all honourable senators will agree is a necessity in those parts. Air conditioning costs could double electricity consumption and involve households in these areas with power costs as much as $540 higher than those in more temperate climates. </PARA>
<PARA> When we consider the size of zone allowances we ought to bear in mind their purpose and ask whether the level of these rebates is likely to fulfil the purpose for which they are provided. It appears reasonable therefore to suggest that the rationale for zonal tax concessions rests on two grounds. The first is the national political and economic objective of seeking decentralisation of population and industry away from the centralised metropolitan areas of the States, an object which can be stated as requiring the development of all the resources of the Commonwealth irrespective of their location. Where that location is bad with respect to markets or other inputs, concessions may be required to ensure that those resources are developed. Decentralisation concessions to industry are accepted by the Commonwealth Government and by some State Governments. The zonal tax concessions are a component of these more general decentralisation concessions which benefit workers rather than employers . </PARA>
<PARA> The second rationale for zonal tax concessions is related to the social philosophy of taxation rather than to mere political and economic principles. This second rationale refers to the principle of horizontal equity in the distribution of the tax burden, the attainment of which requires that persons in equal circumstances should pay the same tax. The problem of course has always been in determining equal circumstances. It has generally been agreed that to compute equal circumstances allowance should be made for such things as expenditure incurred in earning assessable income, expenditure on social services such as health and education, and the number of dependants supported by the taxpayer. To this list zonal tax concessions add a further reason, namely, that the costs referred to above may vary among locations in a way for which the existing tax system does not compensate. Thus the wage or salary earner may be paid an additional income based on location to offset, say, high living costs, but this additional income is fully taxable and therefore the high living costs are not offset. </PARA>
<PARA> This second rationale can be given a more precise definition if 'equal circumstances' is taken to mean the real value of income, not the money value of income. The present taxation system taxes money income. Taxation based on the real value of income would take account of the purchasing value of income at the location of the residence of the taxpayer. With such an approach money incomes in high cost of living locations would be deflated or subject to a defined reduction to offset the high prices paid by residents in those locations. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, the people who work in the remote areas are not provided with the same level of services, to which, in equity, it can be properly argued that they are justly entitled to receive through their taxes, as are their fellow Australians who live in the capital cities and the more populated southern areas of Australia. Many people in isolated and remote areas do not have adequate telephone, television, sewerage, bus, or rail services, the full range of education and health services, and a host of other services on which a very large proportion of the taxation receipts is expended. It can fairly be claimed that the zone allowances must be regarded in part as compensation to people living in remote areas for not having normal access to the range of services and facilities provided to and expected by the great bulk of Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The compelling reason which should be of concern to all Australians is to encourage decentralisation in a practical and tangible way and we should be seeking to ensure that our country's natural resources, which are often found in isolated parts of the country, are fully exploited so as to provide our country with the abundant wealth which is available to it both on and under the ground. By populating these areas we are also of course ensuring their safeguard for future generations of Australians. Let me refer to my own State of Western Australia. I remind the Senate that Western Australia comprises one-third of the continent, being considerably larger than the total area of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and both islands of New Zealand and has a coastline of 12,500 kilometres which is about the same distance as between Perth and London. The Perth metropolitan area is the only urban centre with a population of over 25, 000 people. There are only three centres with populations near to 20,000 people, all of which lie in the southern, more populated area of the State. </PARA>
<PARA> It is generally accepted that a reasonable but still limited range of services can be provided in an urban centre of 25,000 people. Such services as specialist medical and para-medical treatment, tertiary education and some areas of technical education, a full range and sufficient choice of retail outlets and household services are not available until a much larger population is attained. Throughout Western Australia, the average distance of all urban centres and rural bounded localities with populations of 200 or more from the nearest urban centre of 25,000 people is 407 kilometres. This average distance is more than three times the comparable distance in other states and far greater than the distance in Tasmania which is only 69 kilometres. The existing income tax zone A covers 52 per cent of the area and has 6 per cent of the population of the State . Zone B covers 40 per cent of the area and has 5 per cent of the population of the State. Together both zones include 92 per cent of the area and 11 per cent of the population of Western Australia. In fact in all States both zone A and zone B together cover 78 per cent of the area and include 5 per cent of the population. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the present taxation zone concessions apply only to a very small proportion of Australia's income earners who reside in an area of more than three quarters of the continent. The proportion of the nation's population living in the remote areas of the continent when these concessions were first provided in 1945 was 1.6 per cent in zone A and 4.3 per cent in zone B, or in total 5.9 per cent of the nation's population at that time. There has been a drop of 0.9 per cent in the population of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in terms of population residing in zones A and B and that of Australia's near neighbours, and despite the enormous development of the mineral resources in zones A and B over the last decade, there is a far greater urgency to develop the remote areas now than there was in 1945. This 11 per cent of the population in Western Australia living in an area of over 92 per cent of the State produces over 40 per cent of the total primary production of the State of Western Australia, 40 per cent of the exports of the State and 8 per cent of Australia's exports. </PARA>
<PARA> As I move towards the conclusion of my comments I draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that the boundaries which were drawn in 1945 remain unchanged. Referring particularly to Western Australia, in 1945 the pastoral industry was by far the dominant industry north of the 26th parallel, which is normally considered to be the southern boundary of the north-west of Western Australia. The only other industries were the beef killing works at Wyndham and Broome, the pearling industry at Broome, an infant iron ore mining venture at Cockatoo Island and irrigated banana planations on the Gascoyne River. The Murchison and Eastern Goldfields depended entirely on the gold mining and pastoral industries. The northern and eastern wheat belts, the south-east and the Esperance- Ravensthorpe agricultural areas were not developed. The availability of transport and services in those areas in 1945 was very limited and the northern part of the State relied almost exclusively on coastal shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> With the more recent developments of the mining industry in the Pilbara, Kimberley and Goldfields, the Ord River project and the partial decline of the pastoral industry, the development that exists in zones A and B today bears little resemblance to that of 1945. Road transport has become the dominant means of transport for most of the remote areas with the exception of the remote wheat belt areas which are served by rail and road. The higher fuel prices that have occurred since the mid-1970s will continue to have a major influence on the cost of living in remote areas in this very large State of Western Australia. Because of the size of the State and the areas within zones A and B and the development that has taken place in the past 35 years, many serious anomalies are provided to residents in centres in both zone A and zone B. There is far too large a disparity in costs experienced in centres in zone A to provide a meaningful and equitable overall allowance. The same situation exists in zone B. The major influence on the relative costs is transport costs and the relative population of the centres which are reflected in the price structures in centres throughout the zones. For instance, within zone A road transport costs for general freight vary from 2.6 cents a kilogram from Perth to Carnarvon, a distance of 906 kilometres, to 16.5 cents a kilogram from Perth to Kununurra, a distance of 3, 184 kilometres and the shortest route; a variation of 800 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA> The relative retail food price index prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for Carnarvon and Kununurra vary from 108 to 135 respectively, with a base of 100 taken as the average of the six capital cities of Australia. The margin above the capital city prices therefore varies by some 400 per cent for the centres I have just referred. The district allowances assessed by the Western Australian Industrial Commission are $662 for Carnarvon and $2,047 for Kununurra. However, in respect of income tax zone allowances, the current situation is that all taxpayers residing in zone A, which includes both Carnarvon and Kununurra, receive the same allowance but as I said earlier, costs experienced can vary by at least 400 per cent. This situation is most inequitable and I believe demonstrates that the present zone allowances do not provide reasonable compensation for the costs and disabilities in either relative or absolute terms for people living in various locations within the zones. Furthermore, there are anomalies in respect of centres outside the present zone B boundary which experience costs and conditions at least equal to and in certain instances in excess of some centres within both zone A and zone B . The conclusion that must be drawn is that the two-zone approach is entirely inadequate for the conditions applying today. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government for taking the initiative and increasing certain zone allowances for the first time in over 20 years. However, I express my disappointment that there has not been a thorough reform in a practical way of zone allowances. As I have already said this legislation takes no proper cognisance of the varying costs and considerations within the isolated parts of Australia which call for varying zone rebates. No consideration appears to have been given to pensioners and low income earners whose incomes fall below the tax threshold and who receive no benefit at all from a taxation rebate. Finally, no serious attempt seems to have been made to correct the very real cost differences between people living in metropolitan areas and those in isolated parts of Australia. In my view Australia will grow, flourish and develop to the benefit of all Australians only if governments are prepared to acknowledge the need to decentralise our community and to give its citizens an incentive to move into the high-cost, harsh environment of our outback. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some remarks on two aspects of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982 which is now before the Senate. First, I greatly commend the Government in the areas of tax deductible gifts wherein measures are undertaken to allow deductions for gifts to three Polish relief funds by way of extending the range of organisations to which Australians can contribute relief funds and thereby obtain a deduction. The Australian people have always had a very close association with the people of Poland. One recalls that in 1794 the great revolutionary hero Kosciusko returned to his country of Poland in order to attempt to throw off the shackles of Russian oppression that existed even then. His peasant troops were armed with nothing but scythes on the top of wooden shafts. It is no wonder that our most noble peak in Australia is named after that revolutionary hero. I believe it symbolises the bonds that exist between the Australian and Polish peoples and which, as I say, is strengthened yet again by means of our taxation laws in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that in making humanitarian aid available to the Polish people, particularly after the bitterly cold winter that they have just come through, we in Australia will be aiding the political movement to make spring an expression of democratic freedoms for which the Polish people so desperately long. There can be no doubt that in this provision of the taxation legislation we are not, in the normal way, providing humanitarian relief, though that must remain a dominant consideration. Food and medical supplies need to be provided to the people of Poland impoverished, as they have been, by an industrial and agricultural system that has collapsed and by the fact that their great coal export earning industry has collapsed along with everything else. That is the basis for them to earn revenue to purchase necessary foodstuffs and medical supplies abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> Anything we can do to aid the Polish people in their desperate plight must be welcomed, but there is the further dimension that in helping these people to survive we are indeed keeping alive the embers of the democratic movement in Poland. It is a revolution of the people which commands our support. It is evidently democratic in the tens of millions of people who have been attracted to the Solidarity banners, be they of the industrial politariat or the peasants of Poland in the farming wing of Solidarity. They formed Solidarity against the will of the party, against the will of the state. In fact, by acting so courageously they have demonstrated, paradoxically, that Marx was correct when he said that the working people, be they the industrial working class or the peasants, will throw off the shackles of their oppressors and humanise their own lives by courageously taking their future into their own hands. Of course, that is what has happened. As far as the ordinary people of Poland are concerned the state has no legitimacy. The party is left as an organisation which makes arrogant claims to act on behalf of, and to be the vanguard of, the politariat. However it is the people themselves, whether industrial workers or peasants, who will determine the future of Polish society. As I say, I commend the Government for extending those tax deduction provisions relating to gifts to organisations aiding the Polish people in the way in which it has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain attempts are being made by the legislation before us to grapple with the transfer pricing policies, as they are colloquially characterised as, of certain multinational enterprises which operate within Australia. Transfer pricing is perhaps too simple and too small a segment of the range of practices that we are dealing with to really merit its constant use in this sort of discussion but it is one that has come into common use to describe the range of arrangements whereby multinational enterprises, acting as they may across many national borders, so manipulate their arrangements as to minimise the tax payable in country A, where perhaps the tax rates are higher than in country B, where they purport to pay most of their tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very pleased, I must say, and brought up with a bit of surprise to see, in the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), the phrase 'international profit shifting arrangements'. I think if we had the term 'profit shifting arrangements' more constantly before us we would have a clearer grasp of what is going on. Transfer pricing practices are, of course, merely a mechanism to that end. Transfer pricing practices are just one aspect of the use by multinational enterprises of their tremendous capacity to shift profits around the world to tax havens or such locations as will enable them to pay the least amount of their moneys into the treasuries of those countries within which they operate. I wonder where the phrase 'profit shifting practices or arrangements' came from. Did it come from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development? In 1979 that Organisation, through its Committee on Fiscal Affairs, presented a report which expresses the concern of those countries-members of the OECD-in which multinational companies have this practice. The problem is well described in that document. It describes how a multinational enterprise can undertake many transactions between members of the group. As the contents show, it is not restricted to the transfer of goods or products in the physical sense. One can have a flow of technology or trade marks , the provision of certain management services or the provision of loans all in addition to the transfer of products or goods. In all of these cases the transfer of such technology, or the provision of services or the making available of loan moneys can be an occasion for manipulating a transaction so that the least amount of tax possible is paid in the host country of Australia, in our instance. The scope of this international phenomenon with which the OECD countries are concerned can be gained from reading the 1979 report of the OECD Committee, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . approximately 40% of imports to the United States in 1974 were intra-firm transactions . . . Roughly 50% of the United States exports in 1970 were within transnational corporate systems. </PARA>
<PARA>That gives some indication of the amount of international trade from that great trading power which is conducted within these multinational enter- prises. As I say, we are not merely dealing with the sale of goods but with a whole range of other transactions within multinational enterprises. I mention loans in particular because-I am sure if Senator Watson were here he would recall some of the evidence that was given to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources in relation to its inquiry into the aluminium industry in Australia-it is to the advantage of the parent company of a subsidiary operating in Australia to make moneys available to the Australian branch of this multinational enterprise by way of loan rather than equity contribution. The tax paid on dividends remitted to the parent company abroad is considerably higher than is the case if interest on loans is remitted abroad to that parent company. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a nice question to ask whether some equity contributions are disguised as loans. I hope that this legislation enables the Commissioner of Taxation to disentangle the myth from the reality and enables him to see clearly that a financial contribution from a parent company is indeed an equity contribution although it may be disguised as a loan. In other words, I hope that it will enable the Commissioner to say whether interest payments abroad are in fact dividends remitted abroad and ought to bear a tax accordingly. No doubt the Minister, whose interest and expertise in this matter is well known to the chamber, will be able to satisfy me on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am pleased to see is that in the new section 136AA the interest rates will be dealt with in the same way as the pricing arrangements-the contracts for sale of goods. In other words, if a multinational enterprise parent company made moneys by way of loan available to the Australian subsidiary at a rate of interest which was nowhere near that which would be expected to result from an arms-length negotiation by the Australian subsidiary with an overseas banker or other lending institution, the Taxation Commissioner would be able to substitute an arms-length interest rate for that which is set down as the interest rate by way of the legal documentation. This seems to be a very important advance in this legislation. It not only makes quite clear that we are concerned with the transfer of goods abroad that takes place under unrealistic terms of a contract for sale but also defines the word 'property' in such a way as to include any chose in action; any estate interest, right or power, whether at law or in equity, in or over property; any right to receive income; and any services. </PARA>
<PARA> Included in the definition of 'services' is the performance of professional or managerial tasks and an agreement for or in relation to the lending of moneys. Almost the full scope of those sorts of profit shifting arrangements which can occur in multinationals is covered by proposed section 136AA. </PARA>
<PARA> My interest in this area of our fiscal arrangements was triggered by my time spent on the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources looking into the bauxite, alumina and aluminium industries. Whilst it is quite a time that the OECD countries have been concerned in general with this matter, at least since the 1979 financial committee's report, I have no doubt that what triggered the exasperation of the Australian Government and Parliament with the operation of section 136 was the case in which Comalco Ltd successfully defended itself against the Commissioner of Taxation's attempt to impute to it the taxable income which it said it had not earned because of a very artificial method of transferring profits abroad. The particular High Court case was concerned with marketing arrangements in relation to bauxite sold to two Japanese companies through a Hong Kong subsidiary jointly owned by Comalco and the Japanese purchasers. The price of bauxite sold to the Hong Kong company by Comalco was lower than the price at which the same bauxite was then sold to the Japanese purchaser. It was claimed in evidence before us that the principal purpose of the arrangement was to gain access to the Japanese markets. However, it certainly had the additional effect, to put it no higher, of reducing tax payable in Australia, though not by overly significant amounts. It is estimated that the sum involved for 1979-80 was $150,000. Nevertheless, when one looks at the evidence brought into the High Court-I have the relevant exhibits-one finds that exhibit 7 in the case is an internal memorandum of 11 June 1963 of Comalco Industries Pty Ltd from Mr E. T. Biggs, who, I think, was the manager of the international division, in which he says, amongst other things, that he explained to a Japanese involved that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we had chosen Hong Kong as the location as this would give the maximum tax advantage over the dividends which they draw from the sales company. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, in exhibit 8 in the High Court case one finds a letter from Mr Christie, the managing director of Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Pty Ltd, to Mr Shioya, managing director of Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd, stating, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA>Comalco has selected Hong Kong as the location for the sales company as the Hong Kong corporation tax, at 12 1/2 per cent, is very much lower than the corporation tax in either Australia or Japan and taxes of the profits to be shared can thus be minimised to the mutual benefit of both Comalco and the Japanese participating companies. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to see that the very able chairman of that Senate Committee, Senator Andrew Thomas of Western Australia, nods in agreement that the Committee was right in coming to the conclusion that we had exposed on the Senate record this particular form of profit shifting arrangement. I note with pleasure that the legislation no longer requires that entering into the transaction for the purpose of defeating taxation need be proved as a dominant purpose. It is enough that in fact the effect is to shift profits out of Australia and then the terms of the legislation come into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I might also say that I believe that this legislation in part owes its appearance in the Parliament to the work of that Committee. I think it was certainly one of the catalysts which, along with the general exasperation with the High Court in that decision, brought this legislation before us. Insofar as some will say that too much discretion is vested in the Commissioner of Taxation by this legislation, I answer that the High Court has created that situation for the Australian body politic. Mr Justice Murphy in the Westraders case said, I think very aptly:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . strictly literal interpretation of a tax act is an open invitation to artificial and contrived tax avoidance. Progress towards a free society will not be advanced by attributing to Parliament meanings which no one believes it intended so that income tax becomes optional for the rich while remaining compulsory for most income earners. If strict literalism continues to prevail the legislature may have no practical alternative but to vest tax officials with more and more discretion. This may well lead to tax laws capable, if unchecked, of great oppression. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is, of course, that these discretions, such as they are, vested in the Commissioner of Taxation are appealable. There are guidelines set down by the Parliament in these sections which do not mean, by any means, that he has some sort of untrammelled discretion. But insofar as the movement is that way, as I say, it is largely the necessary response of this Parliament to the way in which the High Court has dealt with our legislation over the last few years. I could go on for some time on this subject, but I see that Senator Evans and other honourable senators are anxious to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply wish to express my concern with the penalty provisions within the legislation. Whilst this may be properly dealt with at the Committee stage, I may not be speaking at that time, so I thought I would say now that the penalty clause provision of 10 per cent is really no penalty at all. I see it as doing no more than levying some sort of interest charge of 10 per cent for the amount of tax avoided. All it means, at the very most, is that moneys due to the Federal revenue will not be eroded by inflation, assuming an inflation rate of about 10 per cent. It does no more than that. It is certainly not a penalty from the point of view of the company involved. It merely puts the Federal revenue in the same position in real terms as if the moneys had been paid as they ought to have been. It possibly does not even do that, when one considers that the company had the use of that money and could certainly have invested it on the short term money market at twice that rate of interest. Certainly it will have used it, if not on the short term money market, within the internal affairs of the company to its advantage, which would certainly be greater than 10 per cent per annum. Otherwise, it probably would choose to pay the tax. When one calls this 10 per cent payment a penalty and then looks at other penalties levied in the tax Act, the claim that really there is a penalty involved becomes all the more ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA> I will point to a few examples of much more severe penalties. Section 226 (1) provides a penalty of additional tax equal to the tax assessable-that is, a penalty of 100 per cent, not 10 per cent-for any taxpayer who fails to furnish any return or information required by the Act or by the Commissioner of Taxation . Section 226 (2) provides a penalty of double the tax sought to be avoided for any person omitting assessable income or claiming a rebate or deduction in excess of the expenditure actually incurred. Section 226 (2) (a) provides for a 200 per cent penalty for persons caught evading tax by the new general anti- avoidance section 177 which we enacted last year. When one compares the 10 per cent called for in this case with that range of penalties one sees that it is no more than levying of interest to keep the real value of the money up with an expected inflation rate of about 10 per cent. However, having expressed my disappointment with that particular aspect, and mindful of the second reading amendment and of the amendments that will be moved by the Opposition at the Committee stage, this proposed new section 136 represents a very necessary response by this Government and this Parliament to the practice of profit shifting by multinational enterprises. To that extent I certainly welcome it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal with only one part of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982-that relating to the accelerated depreciation allowances in relation to the iron and steel industry. The amending legislation raises the whole subject of the Government's support for industry in this country-the Government's industry development policy. It raises questions of whether one-off changes in relation to a particular industry are good policy, particularly when at the same time the Government is announcing an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry into certain budgetary assistance to industry, bearing in mind that there are already IAC references on approaches to general reductions in protection levels and also on export incentives. It questions whether certain industries are favoured at the expense of others. As the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) reminded the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce in September of last year:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The farm plant and equipment can generally be written off over five years whereas depreciation life for most manufacturing plant ranges from six to 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA>If that principle can be supported, is the decision as to preference soundly based? Is the form of support, within the fiscal context, that attracting the greatest community benefit for the community cost involved? That is, is a depreciation allowance the best solution or would an investment allowance or some other form of incentive be better? If one looks beyond the taxation context , do the depreciation allowances match up against such non-tax incentives as export grants?</PARA>
<PARA> I will show that the consideration of accelerated depreciation allowances in industry in Australia is a worthwhile exercise. Within that concept-that is, within the general principle-I applaud the new provisions offered to the iron and steel industry. I must say, however, that I am concerned that it is a one- off measure and that the Government has not given reasons why it has decided to assist this industry at this time by this method. It makes evaluation of the assistance, as opposed to other forms of assistance, difficult. I hope that the Minister later in the debate will give reasons as to why the choice was made in this way. I trust that it will indicate a trend in the Government's industrial development policy towards greater and accelerated depreciation allowances. Nevertheless, the Government in so acting has indicated that the measure falls within its industry development policy. The objective of that policy, which I applaud, is sustained, strong, real economic growth. Without that we cannot sustain increases in living standards in this country, either through increased employment opportunities or increased material and non-material wants. </PARA>
<PARA> On an international comparison, I regret to say that we have not fared well on growth in the last decade. Australia's average gross domestic product growth rates in the 1970s were well below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average and much lower than those of our Asian neighbours. Our standard of living has declined in relative terms. This raises the question: Why ? In the 1960s we had a period of relative stability for business. Inflation and interest rates were low and stable. Energy prices were stable. Exchange rates remained fixed for long periods. But the 1970s brought major changes. The first was a major shift in the direction of Australia's trade from the old world to the new world, from west to east, to countries which have more competitive and outward looking economies than Australia. This meant bilateral difficulties and associated questions of protection and industry assistance. Secondly, there was a rapid change of Government policy on private sector development and the difficulty of business in adapting. </PARA>
<PARA> A joint submission of five major mining and manufacturing companies to the Industries Assistance Commission recently pointed to 33 major taxation changes which affected the mining industry within the last decade. Given the lead times and the risks that are involved in that industry the difficulty of the industry in adapting is not surprising. A loss of confidence has resulted. Thirdly, and most important, the 1970s saw the emergence of historically high inflation rates with a whole new range of problems. These include: Erosion of capital through the taxation of illusory profits; increases in the real cost of money-that is, interest rates less inflation; increases in real wages without always having increases in productivity; reduced return on capital invested, loss of profitability; efforts to reduce outgoings; and growing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> With that experience the Government must look to what is necessary today in the 1980s for sustained, strong, economic growth. One important element of a growth- oriented policy would be an emphasis on broad measures that tend to lift productivity across a number of sectors. One step towards that policy could be the lifting of investment levels. I presume that that is at least one part of the rationale of the Government's decision in this part of the Bill. If that is correct and the Government's intention is to increase investment levels I commend it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that budgetary assistance and appreciation is a method whereby governments can encourage greater investment. Additionally, more favourable tax treatments of capital lead to substantial competitive advantages in an open economy. This is because of the need to earn a lower pre-tax return to obtain the minimum return needed to recover the cost of using a capital asset. The Government gains not only a method of attracting new capital but also an opportunity of guiding that capital in a particular direction. The competitive advantages not only throughout Australia but also in an international trading environment in which we must survive and grow can lead to substantial capital movements between nations. I presume that that is another part of the rationale of the Government in relation to this proposed new section 57AK of the Act, to give the Australian steel industry some further international advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981, the Australian Industries Development Association had Arthur Andersen and Co. provide information on capital recovery allowances in 15 countries selected on the basis of their competitiveness with Australia. The results are most important because they indicate what we must compete against and the sort of advantage that we must consider giving if we are to attract sufficient investment to lift productivity and profitability across a number of sectors. Three major features came out of that survey distinguishing Australia from its competitors. The first related to depreciation on buildings and it is relevant to this debate because it shows another way in which the Government could have continued to give assistance to the iron and steel industry. It is a way that obviously is still open. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1972 an OECD survey of capital recovery allowances showed that Australia had the highest tax cost of buildings among the 22 member countries. The AIDA survey indicates that that still applies today. That 1981 survey found that the average period of depreciation write-off provided by the other 14 countries was 29 years . But it referred also to accelerated depreciation schemes for industrial buildings in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The United Kingdom scheme allows a first year write-off of 75 per cent of expenditure incurred on buildings, industrial and mining but not commercial, after 10 March this year. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to remain internationally competitive, and in order to sustain a growing industrial sector, the Government will have to give further consideration to the question of depreciation on industrial buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major distinction that came out of the AIDA survey was the less than average depreciation rates that are allowed in Australia. With Australia's additional loading of 18 per cent on normal depreciation rates, which I might add does not apply to all plant and equipment, the survey indicates that we have an average write-off period of 6.9 years for manufacturing plant and equipment. That can be contrasted with a full first year write-off for plant and equipment in the United Kingdom and Malaysia; two years write-off in Canada for manufacturing, processing and mining equipment; and three years write-off in Singapore for plant and equipment. In summary, AIDA said:</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed if all the depreciation rates after allowing for accelerated depreciation are expressed in present value terms, the Australian rates would be among the lowest-(ie the most harsh) of the 15 countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, on normal rates on specific types of assets AIDA says in that survey:</PARA>
<PARA> The normal rates of depreciation in Australia are generally lower than our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps even more important than the fact that our rates are low compared with our partners is the trend that is apparent from these recent surveys. Between 1980 and 1981 Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore introduced more favourable normal depreciation allowances. From 1981 substantially more favourable capital recovery assistance will be available in the United States. That trend must be something that is borne in mind by the Australian Government if, as I said, we are to remain competitive. To give credit where it is due, the Australian investment allowance is relatively generous with only six of the 15 countries having a more generous tax credit or investment allowance scheme. But the end result of the survey which is incorporated within a table showing the capital cost index in manufacturing, by country, is that our position with regard to incentive benefits of this type is extremely low. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the table that appears in the AIDA report on that subject. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As was said by AIDA:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A high tax cost of capital regime will induce less capital intensive and research and development intensive activities, the very industries which have the greatest potential for our region. Whereas overseas competitors will be induced to spend more on capital, similar industries in Australia will be accorded no such inducement. </PARA>
<PARA>What did the Myers Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia say on Australia's low depreciation rates as compared with its trading partners' rates? The Committee said that this suggests either that the effective working life of the assets is shorter-for technological and other reasons-overseas than in Australia or that the governments of the economies provide more attractive depreciation rates as an incentive to industrial investment. I suspect that both factors are, in fact, involved in the decisions overseas to have a more generous depreciation allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the total package of government assistance-on the one hand protection, tariffs and quotas and on the other hand research and development grants, export incentives, taxation and budgetary assistance-I ask that the Government give serious consideration to accelerated depreciation not only in relation to the iron and steel industry, as it has been prepared to do in proposed new section 57AK of this Bill, but also across the industrial front. Firstly, I have no doubt that, in giving consideration to that request, the Government will bear in mind the reasoning of both the Asprey Taxation Review Committee and the Mathews Committee of Inquiry into Inflation and Taxation which is still valid, that is, that a taxation system which does not recognise the impact of inflation on the replacement of stocks and capital is not compatible with the continuity of sufficient business incentive. Accelerated depreciation offers some compensation in that aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I trust that the Government will bear in mind that more generous depreciation allowances will reduce the current distortion between the repairs and maintenance and new capital equipment mix. This distortion leads to more aged and inefficient plant than would otherwise be the case. That effects competitiveness and retards growth. In that regard it is interesting to note in another of the submissions to the inquiry-that of the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia-that 78 per cent of machine tools used in Australia are more than 10 years old; 61 per cent of such tools in the US, Germany and Japan are less than five years old. I trust that the Government will take into account also the level of private sector investment in research in Australia which is comparatively low. Improved depreciation allowances and greater return on capital invested may well encourage a reversal of that trend. This would be highly satisfactory. I trust also that the Government will take into account that existing rates are not designed to take obsolescence into account. Industry must be able to respond quickly to changing technology if we are to remain competitive. I quote the Bureau of Industry Economics in a recent report on the impact of technological change in Australian industry. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a selective or across the board policy of slowing the rate of technological change has the effect of making domestic costs higher than they would otherwise be, which in turn, serves to impair the long run growth opportunities in industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I presume that the Government will take into account also the very substantial increases in the cost of equipment and its installation due to inflation, that is, depreciation allowances based on historical costs. The real value of the depreciation deduction declines each year while the cost of replacing the asset increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point that I make on this subject of greater taxation and budgetary assistance to industry to enable Australia to increase its competitive status is that if we are to grow in this very competitive world our basic conservatism- which I think in many ways exists more strongly among members on the other side of the chamber-must be cast aside. We must look at the inducements available in countries; for example, tax holidays available to primary industries in Malaysia of six to 10 years, in Singapore of five to eight years, in Taiwan of five years and in South Korea of five years. Is it not therefore surprising that the growth within these economies is so rapidly overtaking our own? We must become more imaginative. We must become more radical. We must look to the ways in which we can compete more efficiently and more effectively so that we can, in fact, be ahead of some of our Asian competitors rather than follow behind them. The last point that I wish to make is that I urge government to look at the whole package . Whilst accepting the value to the steel industry I urge government in the future to steer away from one-offs, to give industry clear, consistent guidelines. Let it be obvious where particular government action falls within the total growth package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982, which, I am happy to say, the Australian Democrats support, will amend the income tax law in a number of very significant ways. As we have given an undertaking to the Government not to delay unnecessarily the workings of the Senate-in fact we have said that we will endeavour to expedite the passage of legislation through this chamber-I propose to confine myself to only two areas of this very comprehensive and important Bill, namely, the areas of transfer pricing and depreciation allowances. Perhaps, instead of transfer pricing, in deference to Senator Tate and to the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), I should say profit shifting arrangements. I think that was the term used. I agree that this is what we are talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will speak only briefly on depreciation because Senator Hill has covered that vitally important subject in an excellent manner. I recommend that the Senate read his comments. They should be studied very carefully. They are very vital as far as industry is concerned. We have spent so much time in this place and in public debate talking about free trade and the level of tariff protection that industry does or does not enjoy in Australia that we have forgotten the other very important incentives that are enjoyed by industries around the world which are Australia's industrial competitors. I will talk, then, on depreciation and underline some of the comments that Senator Hill made so well. The Australian Labor Party has circulated two sets of amendments. The first was moved to the motion that the Bill be read a second time and the second will be moved in the Committee stage. The Democrats wish to move an amendment to the Labor Party's second reading amendment. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out paragraph (c) of the words proposed to be added. </PARA>
<PARA>That amendment addresses itself to the issue of retrospectivity-an area that I wish to cover in some detail later in my remarks. The Democrats are absolutely opposed to retrospectivity in any shape or form, irrespective of whether it relates to our tax laws or to the laws of the land generally. I am anxious to make our position abundantly clear, as it seems to have caused some confusion in the Australian Labor Party. I thought that our leader, Senator Chipp, made the position abundantly clear during our election campaign, but as there is some confusion we will try to clarify the position so that all are clear as to where the Democrats stand on this vital matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A clause of this Bill allows the Commissioner of Taxation to counter transfer pricing arrangements and imposes a penalty of 10 per cent on companies found guilty of breaching the provision. The Democrats, I am happy to advise Senator Grimes, agree with the ALP that this penalty is ridiculously small. We support that part of the Labor Party's amendment which proposes to increase to 100 per cent the penalty on transfer pricing. If such an amendment were acted on by the Government it would have the effect of being a considerable disincentive for organisations to rip off Australians in the shameful way that has been the practice of so many transnational companies. This is an area that has cost the Australian Government millions and millions of dollars in revenue. It is now being addressed in this Bill, but in a very minor way. Transnationals would undoubtedly consider a 100 per cent penalty very carefully before embarking on schemes to avoid taxation in this country. So we urge the Government to strengthen those positions along the lines of the Australian Labor Party's amendment. I point out, as I think has already been made clear by Senator Tate, that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations and the International Labour Organisation-three very important organisations-have already addressed the problem of transfer pricing and have set out in great detail codes of conduct for transnational corporations . On taxation the OECD states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Enterprises should</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> refrain from making use of the particular facilities available to them, such as transfer pricing which does not conform to an arm's length standard, for modifying in ways contrary to national laws the tax base on which members of the group are assessed. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the OECD guidelines. The United Nations has this to say about transfer pricing as it applies to taxation:</PARA>
<PARA> In their intracorporate transactions transnational corporations should not use pricing principles, which, contrary to national legislation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> In their intracorporate transactions transnational corporations should use pricing policies based on international market prices, or in the absence of such prices, the 'arm's length' principle. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . Under conditions and safeguards set forth in this Code, transnational corporations should disclose to the public the principles applied by them in transfer pricing and supply to Governmental authorities all relevant information related to transfer pricing. </PARA>
<PARA>If those two codes of conduct were incorporated in a code of conduct in Australia it would at least make clear to the transnational companies what the Government wants to happen. Until we make clear to transnational corporations what the law of the land is, what the will of the Government is in this respect, we cannot be critical of any taxation arrangements that they may enter into to minimise their taxation in this land. We have to make clear to transnationals what this Government wishes to happen. I wish to dwell briefly on the issue of retrospectivity insofar as the Labor Party's amendment is concerned. The amendment sets out to make the legislation retrospective to 1979. In this we cannot concur. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I understand that. As I said earlier, as a general principle the Australian Democrats are opposed to retrospectivity in any legislation. While we strongly endorse the Government's move to cut down on tax avoidance and tax evasion-we believe that the Australian Taxation Office should be strengthened in personnel so that it can attack this very important problem- we cannot agree that the tax law should be made retrospective under any circumstances. We believe that it is fair that the law should be made to operate from the time the Treasurer (Mr Howard) first announces that he intends to move against a certain tax avoidance scheme that has come to his notice. From the day he makes that announcemant we believe that people will be warned that the Government intends to do something. We believe that it is reasonable that any subsequent legislation which is introduced into this Parliament should date effectively from the date on which the Treasurer makes the first announcement.</PARA></TALK.START>

We will oppose those aspects of the Labor Party's amendments which ask the Government to impose legislation on this matter retrospective to 1979.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter I raise-I will deal with it very briefly because, as I said, it has been so well covered by Senator Hill-is depreciation. The Government foreshadowed in its Budget Papers that it intended to introduce legislation to cover this matter and that it would apply accelerated depreciation allowances for plant used to produce basic iron and steel first ordered under contracts entered into after 18 August 1981. The rate for eligible plant which currently has a write-off period for taxation purposes of five years or more will be 20 per cent of the capital cost of the plant, and plant which currently has a write -off period of less than five years will have an allowance of 33 1/3 per cent. Those special rates will apply to 30 June 1991. As we have heard, the Canadians, for instance, are prepared to allow plant-I understand it is all engineering plant-in Canada to be written off over a period of two years. Many countries allow plant to be written off over one year for taxation purposes. There is no doubt that Australian industry has suffered great stress over a period of some 10 years due to competition from imports and general economic conditions. Because of this long period of pressure it is true that many Australian industries have plant which is outdated. If we are to have a revival of efficient manufacturing in Australia we have to look quickly to the problem of modernising our plant. Added to this, a technological revolution is going on. If we do not address ourselves to the problem of modernising our plant we will be forgotten as an industrial nation for all time. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of change of design and the things that can be done with machinery these days are quite amazing even to a person such as me who has been involved in engineering for over 35 years. We can now put drawings into a computerised machine and wait until the die, the final product, comes out at the other end, machined to the precise details of the drawings. The silicon chip is enabling the world to do this in machine design. If Australia does not keep up with this rapid improvement in machinery its industries will be doomed. We have to give industry the incentive to modernise. I can think of no better way of doing so than to allow for much quicker depreciation allowances than are currently allowed under the tax laws. Senator Hill also mentioned depreciation of buildings, another area in which Australia is very far behind what is now common practice in most Western industrialised countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that we commend the Government for addressing in this Bill a number of very important questions. On the question of tax avoidance we say that it has not gone far enough and we will support the Labor Party on this issue. The Government has not gone far enough on the question of depreciation allowances. We hope that it will give both those areas its very careful attention during the framing of the 1982-83 Budget. I foreshadow that the Australian Democrats will vote against amendments (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) that the Labor Party proposes to move during the Committee stage. Those five amendments relate to retrospectivity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two central features of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982 are those concerned with transfer pricing and tightening the capital gains provision in section 26AAA. I will confine my remarks to those topics. Let me say at the outset that this Bill represents another alarming example of the phenomenon we have seen so much of in recent years of massive additions being made to the statute book, with each new Bill adding multiple new pages to what is already a very massive Act. Clause 19 inserts the new Division 13 relating to transfer pricing. It amounts to 12 pages in place of the existing Division 13 which consists of a single section, the ill -fated section 136. The existing section 136, in its present form of twelve lines, having been rendered ineffective by the High Court of Australia in the Comalco case, has been replaced by provisions which extend over 12 pages. The clause 4 amendment to section 26AAA is, by contrast, less dramatic, containing only six pages. Still, the Bill as a whole rambles its way-understandably enough , given the drafting approach of the Government-across some 40 pages of new legislation. As my colleague in the other place, Mr Willis, counted, there have been about 40 taxing measures since 1976, adding 700 pages to the Income Tax Assessment Act which now consists of over 1,000 pages. There seems to be an urgent need for a comprehensive inquiry into the structure and form of the Act with a view to a complete rewrite, its simplification and consolidation for the obvious reasons that the more complex the Act, the harder it is for any taxpayer to know what his obligations are or for any legal practitioner to give accurate advice. More importantly, the denser the legislative jungle, the greater the scope for subtle avoidance schemes which manipulate the detailed provisions to produce a result other than that which was intended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem, of course, lies not only in the text of the legislation but also in the approach to it of the courts and their tendency, talking about jungles, often to confuse the wood with the trees. We have called often enough for a departure from strict legalism in the application of the judicial task of statutory interpretation and the adoption of more purposive interpretations, taking a broader view of the mischief of the tax avoidance which the various provisions are designed to overcome. That approach, which the Australian Labor Party has long been espousing, is now apparently beginning to bear some fruit. We are certainly heartened by the recent legislative developments, which have either occurred or been foreshadowed by the present Government, involving section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act, directing the judges to follow out a purposive interpretation where the circumstances allow it. We are also moved a little by the recent decisions of the High Court in the Cooper Brookes case and in Whitford's Beach case, both of which indicated a changing attitude on the part of the High Court-an attitude not simply founded on the legislative direction now given the High Court by section 15AA. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may be so. They cannot, of course, work without the tools that are given to them by the legislature, however well motivated, however keen they may be to do real justice and not the kind of justice that we may have seen in some notorious cases in recent years. From that point of view we regard it as incumbent upon the legislature to go further in its approach to dealing with tax avoidance and evasion than has been the case so far. Among the approaches that we have suggested and will be suggesting again, no doubt, are the insertion of specific objects clauses into the various parts of taxation legislation so that judges and, for that matter, taxpayers are left in no doubt as to what the mischief is that the legislation is being directed at, a technique which would undoubtedly enhance the use of a more purposive interpretation by the courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other more far reaching legislative tool that we have constantly urged should be used in appropriate cases is the weapon of retrospective legislation. I will have a little more to say about that in a moment, particularly in the light of Senator Siddons's comments. I will say something, firstly, of a more technical nature about the particular transfer pricing provisions contained in this Bill, provisions which are rather more aptly named-as Senator Tate said-by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle as the profit shifting provisions or the provisions to deal with profit shifting arrangements. The nature of these arrangements has already been described in very considerable detail by not only my colleagues, Senator Walsh and Senator Tate, but also, in greater detail still , by Mr Willis in the other place. It is-I need say no more-a massive area of revenue loss. We certainly welcome the amendments which are here contained. The particular features that we most welcome are, firstly, the wide discretions that are vested in the Commissioner of Taxation, an acknowledgment that we cannot afford to tie the Commissioner's hands when he confronts sophisticated tax avoiders, operating in the twilight zone of commercial arrangements such as are involved in transfer pricing. The Labor Party called for wider discretions to be vested in the Commissioner in dealing with these ambiguous areas of tax avoidance when Part IVA was debated some months ago. We will continue to call for it as an appropriate legislative weapon in these sorts of situations where the transactions in question are not easily labelled on their face as contrived tax avoidance arrangements, but may wear all the garments of a legitimate commercial transaction and have some commercial legitimacy about them. In these circumstances it is a matter for the Commissioner weighing and balancing a variety of factors to determine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, there has indeed been an avoidance situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge that in many other areas of tax legislation it is not appropriate for the Commissioner to have vested in him wide-ranging discretions- on the general principle that taxpayers should know, with as much certainty as is humanly possible, what their liability is likely to be. But when we are talking about very large sums of money being lost to revenue through the operation of what I have described as ambiguous or twilight zone tax avoidance arrangements, of which transfer pricing is a pretty classic example, the vesting of wide discretions of this kind seems to be the only possible legislative technique available. We welcome its application. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it will be a darn sight more effective than the odds and ends provisions which have been around for the Commissioner to use hitherto in relation to transfer pricing. I think it would be likely to be more effective were the penalty provisions to be beefed up rather more substantially and were there to be deterrent effects of that kind. But that apart, I doubt that very much more could have been done. However I think the legislation, in vesting the very wide discretions that are vested in the Commissioner, could have given itself a greater chance of success were there to be more specific legislative guidelines set out as to the criteria to be applied by him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The crucial element that is in this part of the Bill is the notion of arm's- length consideration and the determination of arm's-length consideration by the Commissioner. We believe that it might be easier for everyone involved to have a better idea as to what arm's-length consideration might be held to be if there were some statutory criteria listed in the Bill having regard to things such as, for example-I do not state these with any precision-the corporate structure and the relationship to each other of the various parties concerned in the transaction, the consideration received or perceivable in respect of comparable transactions and the cost of the supply or acquisition of the property or comparable property in comparable cases. There are many other criteria of that kind that one could articulate. But I think if that sort of thing were set out in the Bill it would make these provisions a little more practically able to be enforced, maybe because there would be more compliance at the outset by the parties because they would be able to understand the kind of considerations that the Commissioner is likely to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The other drafting thing that we applaud about section 136, as it now appears before us, is that these provisions are not limited by any requirement that tax avoidance be the dominant purpose of the transaction. That is important because in so many of these twilight zone commercial transactions where there is at least some commercial justification for what is going on it is difficult, obviously, to establish that the tax avoidance purpose is the dominant one. It is enough that it be one, one might say, for the Commissioner to be able to move in this area. That was a view that we took, without success, in the context of the debate on Part IVA. We note that the Government does seem to have accepted the force of this argument in the present context. </PARA>
<PARA> But let me add to those minor bits of applause some statement of concern about the deficiencies in the Bill. Primarily, they go to the penalties. Clause 23 amends section 226 to provide that the additional tax which is payable in the case of a transaction found to be one of transfer pricing is to be calculated at a rate of 10 per cent per annum in respect of the specified period; that is, between the last date for furnishing the relevant return and the date on which the assessment is made. That 10 per cent rate is applied to the amount of tax avoided. But, of course, it is 10 per cent per annum, so if the period were less than one year the penalty would be even less than 10 per cent of the amount of the tax avoided-even less than the rate of inflation. One can, I think, ask quite properly what kind of penalty that is. It does not really amount to anything more than ensuring, as Senator Tate said, that the amount of primary tax due to the Government is not in fact seriously eroded through inflation over time. The rate of penalty is no more than that applicable under section 207 of the Act where tax remains unpaid after the due date. It is hard to credit that the Government regards this as a serious or appropriate deterrent to transfer pricing arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does look to us, as apparently it does to Senator Chipp, like merely tickling with a feather, a proposal from a government which simply is not prepared to deal firmly with large transnational corporations. What sort of a disincentive can a 10 per cent penalty be when the taxpayer can reinvest the tax avoided at, in many cases, around 20 per cent nowadays in the meantime? The Labor Party thinks it is simply another example of a government which is all appearance and no substance when it comes to combating tax avoidance. This is one of the matters that we will be picking up, with it appears the Democrats' support, in the Committee stage. We certainly appreciate that support and the reasons for it that have been articulated by Senator Siddons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One further technical point that needs to be made very briskly about section 136 is that there is a doubt which remains in the minds of many lawyers, to which the Government perhaps ought to have some regard, as to whether Division 13, as the explanatory memorandum says, will apply comprehensively in the international field and to the exclusion of section 31C and the relevant sub- division of Division 2, they being provisions which enable the Commissioner to deem the extent of consideration where there is no bona fide transaction. They are provisions which have been thought to have some relevance to transfer pricing situations in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> All that is said in section 136AB (2) and section 136AE (9) is that in the application of Division 13 the operation of each of the other provisions is to be disregarded. But that does not prevent those provisions from being applied to the transactions in question. There is a danger, I guess, that if those other provisions were still applicable the court or Commissioner may be moved to regard them as the appropriate weapons to deal with a particular transfer pricing situation rather than the slightly more draconian provisions that are being introduced in Division 13 of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 26AAA is the capital gains provision. We acknowledge the fact that section 26AAA is, and always has been since its introduction in 1973-whatever semantic games the present Treasurer (Mr Howard) might care to play with it-a short term capital gains tax provision. We have in clause 4 of this Bill an attempt to cover a loophole which has become apparent in the operation of section 26AAA what we might call the Holmes aCourt-Bond amendment. To appreciate what this amendment is all about I think one needs do no more than quote from the language of the explanatory memorandum which explains succinctly what the problem is and what the new clause is proposing to do about it. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA> As presently framed, section 26AAA taxes profits arising from the sale of property within 12 months of its purchase by the taxpayer. However, the intention of the law may be avoided by arranging for a private company to purchase property and then, within 12 months, selling controlling shares in the company at a price which reflects the increase in value of the underlying property. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that this is, of course, what happened in the notorious Bell and Bond cases-three of them since 1979-when, in each case, after takeover enterprises a very handsome profit was accomplished by the companies in question , not by simply realising that profit in the ordinary way but by selling the whole of the companies in question with shares at an inflated value to represent that profit. The memorandum continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The technique could be varied by using a trust as the vehicle for the purchase and sale of assets, or by holding an interest in property through a chain of companies, or through interposed companies, partnerships or trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> To remedy the defect, the amendment will specify that a taxpayer is to be assessed to tax where he sells shares in a private (unlisted) company or an interest in a private trust estate if, at the time of the sale, the company or trustee owns property that was purchased by it within the preceding 12 months and the value of which is not less than 75 per cent of the net worth of the company or trust estate. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, the taxpayer's assessable income will include so much of the sale price of the shares or the interest in the trust estate as reflects an increase in the value of the underlying property from the time it was purchased to the time when the shares or interest were sold by the taxpayer. An appropriate allowance will be made in respect of any additional expenditure incurred in relation to the property during that period. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fine provision as far as it goes in that explanation of it thoughtfully provided by the Government and, clearly, it will do the job in catching for the future the transactions that have aroused so much, I think, legitimate indignation in the media and elsewhere over the last three years. But what it will not, of course, do as it is cast at the moment is reach backwards so as to cover the particular transactions that have caused all the fuss, the details of which I do not think it is really necessary for me to spell out because that job has been done amply well by other speakers. However, I will say that what we are talking about is the Bell takeover bid for Ansett in 1979 which resulted in the group selling off the shares through a subsidiary company and making a tax-free profit of $11m. In March of 1981 the same Bell group made a takeover raid for Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd and acquired a substantial number of shares in that company. It eventually abandoned the attempt and sold off the shares by selling the subsidiary company and making a profit of $16.5m, again tax free as section 26AAA now stands. The third example is the Bond Corporation with its takeover bid for White Industries Ltd in August 1980 which involved a tax free profit of around $32m. Adding the amounts of the profit and making the appropriate calculations we see that we are talking about a loss to revenue in those three notorious transactions alone of something like $27m. </PARA>
<PARA> Our solution, which has been foreshadowed, is to make this amendment to section 26AAA retrospective in its application. What is the justification for doing that ? Let me spell out again what the Labor Party is and is not saying about retrospective legislation to deal with tax avoidance legislation. I have done this job before, on 12 September 1979 in the Senate and also on 11 June 1981, at fairly nauseous length. I do not want to go over it at such great length again. There is perhaps one further threshold point. We are talking about not just retrospectivity back to the date of an announcement by the Treasurer of an intention to legislate because in a situation where everybody is clearly on notice that is the kind of limited retrospectivity which the Treasurer has been applying now for a number of years and about which nobody is seriously unhappy. What we are talking about is retrospective legislation reaching back rather further than that; back to the first known date of operation of the avoidance scheme in question; back to the first known time that it has operated, even if the scheme in question remains hidden from public view, from the Treasurer's view and from the Taxation Office's view for maybe one year, two years, three years or even longer after that. The justification for-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the limit arises naturally from the nature of the criteria which I will now seek to articulate. But basically I think nowadays we are not talking about anything going back much beyond the last two, three or four years at most because all the really rough schemes that appeared during the 1970s-I think it has been acknowledged that they really only started to appear on any major scale around perhaps 1974-75-have now been legislated against in this piecemeal fashion by the Government's 40-odd remedial measures over the last five or six years. We are talking about only a handful of roughies-if I may so describe them-which have not yet been picked up. I would put the Bell and Bond cases in that category and further examples of schemes that may be created in the future but which are of a nature that they are likely to remain disguised from the Taxation Office until the second year or so of their operation. So I say to Senator Chipp that I do not think it really involves reaching right back into the dim, dark past. Certainly I would not be comfortable about applying even the principles I will now spell out to further back than two, three or four years at the most.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The object of legislating in this way is, of course, that it is notoriously the most effective deterrent of all. We do not have to worry about the multiple pages of legislation to cover every known, conceivable loophole that reveals itself because once we demonstrate a clear-cut legislative intention to legislate retrospectively so that we wipe out back to day one whatever benefit the tax avoider got from his ill-gotten activity we make it very clear to that tax avoider that any future scheme into which he might enter will be subjected to exactly the same kind of treatment and that he will not derive any benefit at all from engaging in the avoidance arrangement. At the moment taxpayers are getting a free go, as one can describe it, for at least a year or so for most of these highly complex, artificial avoidance schemes simply because it takes that long for the Commissioner of Taxation to catch up with what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are basically saying about this legislation is that it should operate only in very limited and carefully defined circumstanes-only in relation to schemes which are unambiguously blatant, contrived and artificial and which would be so understood by everyone who had to look at them. We do not regard this kind of legislation as being appropriate in any way for ambiguous or twilight zone tax avoidance arrangements which may have a redeeming commercial justification as well as a tax avoidance justification. I draw a distinction in that respect between the kind of anti-tax avoidance measure that is involved in section 136 dealing with transfer pricing in which each such transaction may, as I said earlier in this speech, have a legitimate commercial content and some of the more hair-raising Curran-type contrived schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation can be appropriate only in respect of specifically identified schemes which are dealt with in very specifically drawn legislation. I think it is quite inappropriate for retrospective legislation of the kind I am talking about to apply in a discretionary context where the Commissioner can apply his own discretion, perhaps extending backwards for some years, to reconstruct transactions according to what he thinks the actual cash values or merits of the transactions were. It has to be the kind of transaction which nobody could conceivably have entered into with other than open eyes, realising it to be a kind of transaction which had no other justification in anybody's mind except that of tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it would be most inappropriate for such retrospective legislation to contain any penal content. We are not talking in any way about the retrospective application of penal provisions. We are talking only about the retrospective application of a liability to pay the basic marginal rate of tax that would otherwise have been applicable had the transaction been viewed in a different light at the time. I can appreciate the way in which the Democrats have been wrestling with the principles which are relevant to apply in this area. I notice that Senator Chipp in a notice of motion given on 29 April in fact indicated that one of the approaches that ought to be adopted was:</PARA>
<PARA>a systematic attack on tax avoidance schemes including retrospective application of new legislative measures following specific identification and warning of the types of schemes to be affected by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Senator Chipp is referring to a prior warning. No doubt he is doing no more than referring to the existing practice of the Government. I do not read that as going any further than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Housing and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Housing and Construction has utilised private sector resources for some considerable time.</PARA>
<PARA> The major areas for the use of private sector resources are in the provision of design services, and the execution of capital works, and repairs and maintenance work.</PARA>
<PARA> Traditionally, almost all of the physical construction of projects has been carried out by the private sector under the competitive tender system managed by the Department of Housing and Construction.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the Review of Commonwealth Functions the Government directed that 50 per cent of design of major new works be undertaken by private consultants. The Department had previously been utilising private consultants to undertake some 40 per cent of design of major new works in accordance with a Government directive of 1976. The new target should be achieved in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> Also arising from the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Government directed that the Department's in-house repairs, maintenance and minor new works functions be reduced by approximately 50 per cent from the levels approved by the Government in 1976. The Department is aiming to achieve this new target over the next three or four years.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of decisions following the Review of Commonwealth functions private legal services are being used for aspects of the disposal of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, and the Experimental Building Station.</PARA>

<PARA> The above times taken to process those cases referred back to the Repatriation Commission from the Repatriation Review Tribunal are also incorporated in the overall Repatriation Commission statistics shown under (b).</PARA>
<PARA> It should also be stressed that these are median times. Thus many claims are processed much more quickly than the times indicated. As an example, a first claim for a single disability will usually be finalised much more quickly than the average time taken. However, where a claim is a composite one, e.g. for acceptance of several disabilities, in addition to an application for increase in pension for an existing disability, and the veteran also requires medical treatment for a previously accepted condition, there will be competing priorities for the files and associated records. In these instances considerable delays in finalising all the processes can occur no matter what steps are taken to improve administrative procedures and to provide additional resources.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of delays in finalising claims and appeals is under constant review and I have previously outlined some of the initiatives which have been taken to improve the overall situation. (See the answer to Question No. 2936 in the House of Representatives, Hansard page 2940 on 17 November 1981).</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that some statistics have to be interpreted in the light of deliberate efforts to finalise long-outstanding claims or appeals. Where a substantial proportion of claims or appeals finalised in a particular period are in this category or have been deferred to await Court decisions, the 'times taken' for cases finalised in the period obviously will increase.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 February 1982 (Hansard, page 388,) Senator Button asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Construction, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware of the criticism by the then Victorian Minister of Housing concerning the level of Federal housing assistance to Victoria, and if the decline in funding was as dramatic as Mr Kennett said.</PARA>
<PARA> Is he aware of reports of a document alleging inefficiency in the Victorian Ministry of Housing.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Housing and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a decline in welfare housing funds for Victoria paid under the Housing Assistance Act, but the decline is not as dramatic as has been suggested.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth welfare housing funds under the Housing Assistance Act in 1978-79 were $85.8m, of which about 4 per cent were in the form of grants. In 1981-82, the funds are $58.8m. It is important to note however, that non-repayable grants now comprise about 38 per cent of total funds, and the State can clearly direct these funds to the most needy. In this context it should be noted that Victoria has taken steps to get more value for money and to more efficiently assist greater numbers of people in need. In conjunction with building societies, the State is operating an interest subsidy scheme to provide low interest loans to home buyers. It has also stopped large scale land development and it has significantly increased spot purchasing to boost the rental stock.</PARA>
<PARA> When other Commonwealth housing and accommodation payments are taken into account, the estimated expenditure for Victoria in 1981-82 is $149.9m compared with $116.9m in 1980-81, an increase of 21.44 per cent. Areas of significant increase include allocations under the Aged and Disabled Persons' Homes Act, increased from $6.0m to $10.9m; estimated expenditure on supplementary rental assistance to pensioners, increased from $23.0m to $29.0m; and estimated expenditure on home savings grants, increased from $13.2m to $24.0m.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of newspaper reports of such a document. However, I regard the matter as being completely the responsibility of the State Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 March 1982 (Hansard, page 782) Senator Watson asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and it concerns the scrutiny of Australian aid projects. Is the Minister aware that criticisms have been levelled at the Northern Samar Integrated Rural Development Project which claim that rather than benefiting the poor the project is in fact further contributing to the poverty of the area ? What controls are imposed on Australian aid to ensure that the objectives of any project are being met and that money is not being misspent?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following additional information to the reply I gave to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB) makes maximum possible use of specialist resources in the identification and design of projects as well as in the management and implementation of Australian aid projects. These are private sector consulting firms, public sector authorities and individual experts. These organisations or individuals are in most instances selected on a competitive basis to ensure that the best quality and most appropriate services are obtained. Contractual agreements are negotiated with ADAB which, inter alia , specify the scope of their services, the estimated cost and the format of their financial and progress reports.</PARA>
<PARA> Project performance and progressive expenditure are closely monitored by officers in the Bureau. Where the Bureau lacks particular technical expertise to monitor effectively or review performance, it is able to draw on expert professional advice from appropriate technically oriented public or private sector organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> I should add that the objectives, achievements and expenditure patterns of all our larger aid projects are also closely examined as part of a regular review/ evaluation process which is administered by a team of experienced officers in the Bureau's Appraisal and Evaluation Unit. Such reviews are undertaken jointly or in close collaboration with relevant recipient government authorities. The Australian review teams usually include appropriate professional technical experts engaged under contract for this purpose from both public and private sector organisations. These are major assignments which are undertaken on site.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 March 1982 (Hansard, page 859) Senator Giles asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Government noted newspaper reports that, with Professor Leonie Kramer in the chair, the Australian Broadcasting Commission plans to axe the Australian Women's Broadcasting Co-operative, the justification being that the ABC should not cater for sectional interests. Can we anticipate that under this new approach to programming we will soon hear the last of the Country Hour, the Stock Exchange Report and the Kindergarten of the Air?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Kramer has advised me that there has been a good deal of misreporting in the press of her alleged opinions. Professor Kramer does not plan to 'axe' the Australian Women's Broadcasting Co-operative and she believes that it provides a worthwhile service to a section of the community, as do many of the other ABC programs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 March 1982 (Hansard, page 859) Senator MacGibbon asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning recent tests on cattle held at Cocos Island animal quarantine station.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Of the first consignment of cattle to be imported through the Cocos Island animal quarantine station 50 were released at the end of the quarantine period.</PARA>
<PARA> The results of the series of tests performed on the other six animals while in the Cocos Island animal quarantine station clearly indicate that they have been exposed to epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus. This was despite their having passed an extensive series of tests for this disease both on-farm and in pre- embarkation quarantine in Canada.</PARA>
<PARA> While EHD is a disease of white-tailed deer there is circumstantial evidence that it may cause disease in cattle in the United States of America. It also has a close relationship in the laboratory with Ibaraki disease, a severe disease of cattle in Japan.</PARA>
<PARA> No animals have been destroyed at this time. However all owners were given the option of re-export or destruction under the Quarantine Act and all have now indicated that they will not be taking up the re-export option.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 March 1982 (Senate Hansard, page 1084) Senator Button asked me a question without notice concerning the Government's campaign to advertise its new housing initiatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Housing and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The campaign was handled by the Australian Government Advertising Service ( AGAS) which has responsibility for engaging advertising agencies, and purchasing advertising space for Commonwealth departments.</PARA>
<PARA> Scheduling of the advertisements and decisions on the amount and percentage of expenditure between the States and Territories were made by AGAS with the aim of ensuring satisfactory and effective communication with the Australian public .</PARA>
<PARA> The campaign was handled by AGAS in its usual efficient and professional way to achieve Australia-wide public awareness within the given advertising budget.</PARA>
<PARA> AGAS has advised the Department of Housing and Construction that the campaign costs were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>$  television time  178,994  daily Press space  79,200  ethnic Press  10,157 total media expenditure  268,351</PARA>
<PARA> Other items such as production costs and service fees amounted to $31,649.</PARA>
<PARA> Of the total expenditure on television time and Press space 34.6 per cent was spent in New South Wales, 33.2 per cent in Victoria, 9.7 per cent in Queensland , 7.7 per cent in South Australia, 6.3 per cent in Western Australia, 1.2 per cent in Tasmania, 0.4 per cent in the Northern Territory and 1.2 per cent in the Australian Capital Territory. A further 5.7 per cent was expended on national and ethnic Press.</PARA>
<PARA> Initially it was expected that advertising costs on television in Victoria would be higher than in New South Wales as the Victorian stations had offered more prime time (and therefore more expensive) spots. In the event, more was spent on television in New South Wales than in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA> The following figures were provided by AGAS to the Department of Housing and Construction relating to the campaign. The figures show that over one third of expenditure in Victoria took place after the elections in that State.</PARA>

<PARA> Australian Government Advertising Service, 14 April 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Department of Housing and Construction received some 32,600 telephone calls around Australia in the three weeks following the Treasurer's announcement of the Government's new housing policies is proof of the wide interest people had in the matter. Taxation offices no doubt received many other calls from people seeking information.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's advertising campaign used television spot advertisements as pointers to detailed Press notices. It is reasonable to assume that many other people had intended to ask questions by phone, but in fact had their queries answered by the detailed information carried in the Press notices.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the overall campaign is concerned, I am informed that the advertising industry would not regard $300,000 as an unusually large amount to spend in order to achieve a moderate level of public awareness nationwide. I am convinced that the expenditure was fully justified as a means of ensuring the public of Australia were informed about their entitlements under the government's new housing policies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 March 1982 (Hansard, page 1089) Senator Lajovic asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs obtain for the Senate an analysis of contributions by various countries, including Australia, to the Third World countries during the last five years, excluding the cost of arms supplied by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and its satellites.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following reply to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The tables below detail development assistance given to these countries (both bilaterally and through multilateral agencies) by western developed countries, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the Soviet Union and the eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania).</PARA>
<PARA> The source for these tables is the OECD's 'Development Co-operation 1981 Review' prepared by the Secretariat of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC). It should be noted that the figures are in United States dollars. The USSR and eastern European countries do not publish comprehensive information on their aid activities. The attached data on their aid efforts are DAC Secretariat estimates collected from a variety of sources and established in collaboration with experts in DAC member countries. In general this data must be considered to be less reliable than for other donor groups. Within these limits, the DAC Secretariat attempts to ensure that the aid reported is truly developmental and would thus exclude any overtly military assistance whether from the USSR or any other country.</PARA>

<PARA> Has the Government directed Telecom Australia to reduce its staff this financial year by 2,000?</PARA>

<PARA> Is this due to the particularly depressed condition of the Victorian economy, both in absolute terms and comparatively with other States?</PARA>
<PARA> Is it the case that Victoria is the only mainland State in which Telecom plans to reduce its level of investment in new works and services in the 1981-82 financial year?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has been required to reduce its staff by 2,000 this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> Approximately 1,000 of the reduction will be in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA> The higher savings are achievable in Victoria due to a levelling of demand in that State. A similar situation is not evident in other States. Demand is particularly high in Queensland and there is difficulty in recruiting suitably qualified staff. Telecom has therefore invited lines staff in Victoria to move to Queensland to relieve pressure in the higher demand areas.</PARA>
